<h2>            Unlink Microsoft account from skype account</h2>
                    <p>I need to unlink my Microsoft account from my skype account and it's not letting me. How do I fix this? My husbands email address is on there... I need it changed. I cant ever get into my skype since his password is always needed for MY skype account. We
 didnt even link them.&nbsp;I tried to unlink them but there is no unlink button when i go through all the steps... i was trying to contact support but obviously they dont have that option either..&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Currently, unlinking Skype and Microsoft accounts is not possible. Skype understands how frustrating it might be that&nbsp;the option to unlink is not available but you can send a feedback through a quick survey so Skype can help improve user account experience.

<p>Well when will this be fixed? Are you working on the issue. This has been a problem for years and this question has been asked for years, you have been responding the same for years now. All of my contacts gets messed up when skype is merged with hotmail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the only way to unmerge is to delete HOTMAIL account, serious - why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix this urgently.</p>

            This needs to be sorted I have changed my email but not able to swap my skype to my new account. I could ask for a refund of the money on my skype account and close it but then I have the problem of sorting all my contacts with the new skype name. Since
 Microsoft has taken over skype its gone down hill. You closed my smart TV app, you closed my duel phone. do you not want people to use skype any more? Or do you prefer people to move to another to another program?

            I am having the same issue. All I wanted to do was get ride of someone elses name appearing. I was told I needed to create a new account. Now I can remove the old, incorrect account, and add a new. This is extremely frustrating.&nbsp; FYI all - I heard that
 Google and Apple are both have and are creating improvements to their programs that will take the place of Skype.....Thank goodness!

<p>Same **** here!! And it's getting on my *** nerves. This is how **** mad this has made me! I never linked this garbage to my outlook, now it's all ***! I get some random pop ups and **** from Skype all over the place.</p>
<br />
Fix your garbage services! I stopped using Skype 2 years ago because they keep on forcing their *** on me! I feel violated. I never asked for any of this. Maybe soon you have to use Skype in order to use Windows too?<br />
<br />
Worst part is that I didn't even realize this garbage was linked, I changed my "Skype" password and it also changed my Outlook.com pass ... Now I'm stuck with some garbage **** password and I can't change it back because it is saving all of my old passwords
 and wont allow me to revert back to my password!<br />
<br />
So now I have two **** accounts and it's vital to my life! This account is over 15 years old and I got all my life's work on it!<br />
<br />
I'm so **** angry right now over this ***! This is how you *** treat customers who have been around for over 15 years? *** I never recommend Skype or Outlook to anyone ever again!

            <p>"Factory Settings" means the way it came from the manufacturer's factory--essentially just Windows and whatever else the manufacturer put on it. It will *not* have anything else you put on it, so you will lose Word and everything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do you want to do this? </p>
<p>
</p><div><span><span>In my view, it's usually a mistake.&nbsp;</span><span>With a modicum of care, it should never be necessary to reinstall Windows (any version). &nbsp;</span>I've run Windows 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, 3.11, WFWG 3.11,
 Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and now Windows 10<span>, each for the period of time before the next version came out, and each on two or more machines here. I never
 reinstalled any of them (with a single exception--a problem that I worked on for weeks unsuccessfully), and I have never had anything more than an occasional minor problem.</span></span></div>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><div>
<p><span>It's my belief that this mistaken notion stems from the technical support people at many of the larger OEMs. Their solution to almost any problem they don't quickly know the answer to is "reformat and reinstall." That's the perfect
 solution for them. It gets you off the phone quickly, it almost always works, and it doesn't require them to do any real troubleshooting (a skill that most of them obviously don't possess in any great degree).</span><br />
<br />
<span>But it leaves you with all the work and all the problems. You have to restore all your data backups, you have to reinstall all your programs, you have to reinstall all the Windows and application updates, you have to locate and
 install all the needed drivers for your system, you have to recustomize Windows and all your apps to work the way you're comfortable with.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Besides all those things being time-consuming and troublesome, you may have trouble with some of them: do you have or can you find all the drivers you need? can you find all your application CDs? Can you find all the needed installation
 codes? Do you have data backups to restore? Do you even remember all the customizations and tweaks you may have installed to make everything work the way you like? Occasionally there are problems that are so difficult to solve that Windows should be reinstalled
 cleanly. But they are few and far between; reinstallation should not be a substitute for troubleshooting; it should be a last resort, to be done only after all other attempts at troubleshooting by a qualified person have failed.</span><br />
<br />
<span>And perhaps most important: if you reformat and reinstall without finding out what caused your problem, you will very likely repeat the behavior that caused it, and quickly find yourself back in exactly the same situation.</span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><span>If you have problems, post the details of them here; it's likely that someone can help you and a reinstallation won't be required.</span></div>

    <title>Live Mail Quick Views not picking up new unread emails - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Live Mail Quick Views not picking up  new unread emails</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>Live Mail (2011)&nbsp;Quick View&nbsp;has now stopped picking up new, unread emails from all accounts. Problem started about a week ago.&nbsp;I've looked through the forums and tried "<span><strong>Repair all Windows Live programs"
</strong>twice but the problem remains. I've not added any new software, downloaded any updates (knowingly!) or changed any program settings.
</span></p>
<p><span>I know I can look in each account... it's just the lack of convenience&nbsp;and time consuming for the&nbsp;5 accounts email accounts&nbsp;I run....plus it's a feature of the program so why shouldn't I have it working?</span></p>
<p><span>Hope someone has got a solution. Thanks folks.</span></p>
<p><span>Cheers, Mick</span></p>

<p>Live Mail (2011)&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Windows Live Mail 2011 has been obsolete since 2012 on all versions of Windows later than Vista. Which version are you using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because it's so old, I can't remember whether the Quick Views rebuild hack was incorporated or not. The solution for Quick Views not working properly used to be this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Close down Windows Live Mail</li><li>Open the Registry Editor (press Windows key + R, type <strong>regedit</strong> and press
<em>Enter</em>. Give UAC permission when asked.)</li><li>In the left-hand pane, navigate to <br />
<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail</strong><br />
and click on it to see the values under it in the right-hand pane.</li><li>Right-click on the value named <strong>SearchFolderVersion</strong> and select
<em>Delete</em>.</li><li>Close the Registry Editor, then launch Windows Live Mail. It will take longer than normal for the program to open, because it has to rebuild its Quick Views cache.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it's possible to repair Windows Live Mail 2011. The repair utility depends on an online source that no longer exists.</p>

            Probably the Recovery Image was corrupt.
<br />The following steps outline the steps to fix Windows failing to boot and you can boot to the advanced startup options.

            Hi Clubsaretrumps, since the Reset option seems to have failed, if you have a backup of your data, your best and probably only option is to clean install Windows 10, this would also repair your Windows Recovery Image . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

    <title>Run a batch file from Task Scheduler Won&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gg80  say:</h3>
<h2>            Run a batch file from Task Scheduler Won&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp; I have a batch file that copies and renames a file.&nbsp; It works fine when double click it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I set it up to run on the Task Scheduler using the Basic Actions wizard.&nbsp; To test the method, I made a simple batch file that&nbsp;just displays&nbsp;date and time and stored
 it in the same folder as my desired batch file.&nbsp; The scheduler runs the simple bat fine.&nbsp; When I try to run the copy/rename bat file, it does nothing, though I do see the blue flash and&nbsp;see that the scheduler lists the task as successfully&nbsp;completed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Per one suggestion on this site&nbsp;I tried to&nbsp;change setting to "use whether user is logged on or not".&nbsp; When I click the check box, I get some undecipherable message about&nbsp; restrictions and &nbsp;blank pasword.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a single user computer (w7 64 bit) and, as
 far as I know, is free of passwords and restrictions..&nbsp; Any help much appreciated, I have no hair left to tear out.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you receive a 1935 error when you try to install software, the Windows file system transaction log has become corrupted. The transaction log is used by the Windows file system to recover when a file error occurs. You may try following methods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span><br />
To correct this install error, you need to clear the log -<br />
a. Open an Administrator command prompt: Right-click Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Command Prompt and select "Run as Administrator" and click "Allow" for the elevation prompt<br />
b. In the command prompt, type the command below:</span></p>
<p><b><span>fsutil resource setautoreset true C:\</span></b></p>
<p><span>c. This assumes that C: is the drive in which Vista is installed. If it is installed on another drive like D: (please change the drive letter appropriately).</span></p>
<p><span>d. Reboot the system.<br />
e. Install the software and check.</span></p>

<h2>            Skype V12.10.572.0, video calling issue</h2>
                    Skype - I can select the caller but as soon as I hit the video button it shows Call Ended?!! Should I&nbsp; uninstall the latest MS update KB4054517/4058043 from 17 Dec - but as it happened before then, do I go back to 13 Dec KB4054022 and uninstall all of
 them? Last year had to pay for a total PC rebuild after the PC froze from a MS upgrade! So want to avoid that!! Community volunteer so no funds! Thanks

    <title>How to get Windows 7 to remeber logon credentials to netowrk resource - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr cheese  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get Windows 7 to remeber logon credentials to netowrk resource</h2>
                    
<p>I have a number of network resources which require logon credentials to be able to access them.</p>
<p>Previously under Windows XP, I was able to tick a box on the logon dialog that stored these credentials permernantly.</p>
<p>Under Winows 7, the same option is presented when logging into a network resource, but it is NOT remembered.</p>
<p>i.e. After a re-boot, the system will prompt for userame and pasword again.</p>
<p>I have looked in the Windows 7 Credential Manager but do not see a way to set the username and password to be retained on a particualar resource.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, I need to change the option of "Persistance" to be "Enterprise" as opposed to "Logon Session", but I have been unable to find a way to change this option.</p>
<p>Could someone please advise how to be able to make Windows 7 retain logon credentails permernantly.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Kobo Glo HD &#43; Windows 10 connecting problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a Kobo ereader for more than two years and it works perfectly. There is just one problem: since the buy of my new laptop a few months ago, I am unable to connect my ereader to my PC (which runs on Windows 10). Before, I had another laptop also
 running on Windows 10 and that worked perfectly fine. The problem should be with my new laptop, as my ereader connects normally on other computers running both on Windows 10 and earlier versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many things: I tried 4 different USB cables, both of the USB ports, I did a factory reset on my ereader and updated my laptop to the latest version of windows 10 but nothing seems to work! When I plug the ereader in, it will charge but not connect.
 I do not see the screen on the Kobo where I should click ''connect to PC'' either (which does show up when I connect the device to another PC). I do not see any error on my laptop screen either, like many users with a similar problem do. My laptop simply does
 not recognize it at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone has a solution for this as I would really appreciate to be able to use my Kobo on my own laptop again!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Joëlle</p>

<p>We just stumbled upon a solution - we turned off the wifi on our kobo glo, and then suddenly the kobo asks that familiar question - "do you want to connect?" Tap yes, and it's back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We load books from local library via Adobe Digital Editions - and we normally get prompted by the kobo glo to connect when the usb cable is plugged in. We lost that message until we turned off the wifi on the kobo</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I upgrade to Windows 10 from Vista &#40;home premium&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I don't need to buy a new computer, and I have paid for my OS legimately just as Windows 7 and 8 users have, so why am I being punished for having a slightly older (and not particularly good!) version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's clearly not a technical issue (it is possible to upgrade to 8.1 albeit&nbsp;for a cost as a stepping stone) and there aren't that many of us left (14% is the latest figure I have seen, probably less by now) it would&nbsp;be a nice goodwill gesture to include
 us, otherwise you are just generating resentment.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows XP, Windows Vista and LINUX users will have to purchase a full retail license and&nbsp;perform a clean install from a .ISO. As Windows Vista was released many years back,&nbsp;after&nbsp;that many&nbsp;hardware changes&nbsp;has&nbsp;taken place and the&nbsp;possibly some feature of
 Windows 10&nbsp;might not be compatible with the hardware of computer which is&nbsp;Windows Vista compatible.

            I'm still waiting for a proper reply. Kindly tell me what hardware changes would prevent me from installing Windows 10, I am not aware of any, anyway it is my responsibility to decide if I want to install Windows 10. I have been punished enough for having
 Vista in the first place, so please tell me why I should have to pay for it? From experience if I was a corporate user I bet you wouldn't treat those of us on Vista like this.

<p>Mh da es keine Bewertungen bei den kleinanzeigen gibt würd ichs nicht ausprobieren wollen. Ja Paypal hat Käuferschutz aber er wird sagen das du einen Code erhalten hast - aber wegen der Gültigkeit wird er dich dann an MS verweisen etc.</p>

<p>Ist zu günstig für meinen Geschmack. Bei den meisten seriösen Anbietern bekommt man für 25 Euro 2100 Punkte. Ich würde es mal nicht drauf ankommen lassen, selbst mit Käuferschutz durch PayPal.</p>

<p>Bei den Kleinanzeigen gibts doch nur Betrüger :D (auch dank meinem unglaublich sympathischen Smiley ist das ernst gemeint).</p>
<p>Würde lieber paar Euro mehr zahlen und auf der sicheren Seite sein, PayPal hin oder her</p>

<p>Die sind wahrscheinlich vom Laster gefallen.^^</p>
<p>Aber ich würde auch die Finger davon lassen.</p>
<p>4200 Points kosten bei seriösen Anbietern auf Ebay so um die 35 € und das ist auch noch in Ordnung vom Preis her.</p>

<p>Please answer&nbsp;<em>each of the following diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>2. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>3. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>4. Open <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> &amp; make sure the <strong>Show Updates</strong> box at the top is checked (and leave it checked); then select the
<strong>Name</strong> option in the <strong>Sort by</strong> box on the right. Now scroll down &amp; tell me if ALL of the following updates are listed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • KB2660465, KB2661637, KB2647516&nbsp;[<em>or KB2618444</em>]; KB2598479, KB2631813, KB2585542; KB2633171, KB2618451 &amp; KB971029</p>
<p>Most will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows XP</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>If IE8 is installed,&nbsp;one will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 8</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>5. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>6. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; CCleaner)?</p>
<p>7. Have you ever had occasion to do a <a href="http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/XPrepairinstall.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair Install</a> (or a clean install) of WinXP for any reason?</p>

            <p>Hi Dennis,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What kind of Internet Connection are you using?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the current Internet Speed for downloading?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diffrent Apps require diffrent amount of Internet bandwidth to download. However, you may run the network troubleshooter and check if that helps in recognizing the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Swipe</span></span></span> show the Charms bar.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span> </span></span></span>Type <b>Troubleshooting</b> and click<b>Troubleshooting</b> under
<b>Settings</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span> </span></span></span>Now type <b>Network Troubleshooter</b> in the<b>search</b> option.</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span> </span></span></span>Click on <b>Network</b> <b>troubleshooter</b> to run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<p><strong><span>◦Run ActiveX Controls and Plug-ins</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>◦Script ActiveX Controls Marked Safe for Scripting</span></strong></p>
<p><span>g. Click OK to save your settings and exit the Internet ActiveX Controls and Plug-ins dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span>h. Click OK to close the Internet Options dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span>i. Exit <strong>Internet Explorer.</strong></span></p>
<p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for using
<strong>Microsoft Answers </strong>Forums!</span></p>
<p><span>What was the exact cause of this abnormal shut down?
</span></p>
<p><span>Check if your system is in Normal Mode:
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Lets Click Start, type “msconfig.exe” (without quotes) in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the General tab, Lets click Normal Startup. And click OK. (If already in Normal Startup then click Cancel)
</span></p>
<p><span>You can try these steps now and check if it helps:
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Start</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type in Services.msc and hit enter</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
</span><span>Advanced Networking Services and Stop the service.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Also
</span><span>Click on </span>
<span>MSSQL$MSSMLBIZ and Stop the service.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now restart the computer and check.
</span></p>
<p><span>You can also try system restore:
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>System Restore
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>We can try to restore settings to the point before you started getting this problem. Put the computer to an earlier point in
 time when the computer was working fine.</span></p>

            Thank you so much for trying to help me with this problem.<br />
<br />
This is a new computer. It is plugged into multi plug unit /suppressor.<br />
<br />
One day a&nbsp;very large group of papers and books and similar&nbsp;things fell down into the corner where these plugs were set. It really was a LOAD of items.<br />
<br />
As I was attempting to pick the mess up....and the computer was on----I caused the plug to shut off unexpectedly. This happened three times.<br />
<br />
The first time it shut down I was kinda shocked about the whole thing--and wasn't really sure what had happened--&nbsp;so I jiggled the switch and the computer re booted fine. I should of turned it off --while I continued to clean up...but I thought --oh --I'll
 be careful....NOT !!!!!! I guess this particular&nbsp; plug unit needed to be replaced---because somehow I touched it again and it shut off the computer AGAIN !!&nbsp; 2 times...each times with strong electrical sounds&nbsp;It went to a blue screen I think....and then I
 got a few messages.<br />
<br />
One of the messages stated it was trying to restart something but couldn't do so. These was repeated a couple of times. And it stated each time that the procedure could not be done.<br />
<br />
Lastly--it suggested using system restore---which I did. It had to go back&nbsp; aprox. 4 months to find a restart date.<br />
<br />
I believe this effected one of the discs..because I lost so much info .<br />
<br />
Now--when I run the diagnostic report--the hnmsvc---is false start...and stopped...as is the MSSQL$MSSMLBIZ<br />
<br />
Hope this gives you more info to try and help me figure out how damaged it is at least the discs I guess.<br />
<br />
I will attempt to follow your directions<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can give...I am SICK over this
