<h2>            Windows 7 EULA question Windows Anytime Upgrade Software transfer</h2>
                    Could someone help me understand what the part after the <i><b>but</b></i> means in the quote below? &nbsp;Specifically when it says you can transfer the software if the software you upgraded from allows you to do so. &nbsp;Is the "from" the original software on
 the computer or is the "from" the actual upgrade software. &nbsp;My real question is if you Anytime upgrade software from OEM version which does not allow transfer but used a retail upgrade package key using Anytime upgrade software is the upgrade key no longer
 transferable?
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Windows Anytime Upgrade Software.&nbsp;You may transfer the software and install it on another computer,<b> but</b> only if the license terms of the software you upgraded
<b>from</b> allows you to do so. That computer becomes the licensed computer. You may not do so to share this license between computers."</div>

            <p>I have a question about retail upgrade software.</p>
<p>If I have a computer with OEM home windows 7 and I have an upgrade retail package and use the product code to run windows anytime upgrade to windows 7 pro&nbsp;from&nbsp;window 7 home&nbsp;is the retail upgrade package no longer transferable to another computer as an upgrade
 for example from windows xp to windows 7 if I uninstall the windows anytime upgrade?&nbsp; Basically is the retail upgrade package tied to the OEM computer forever because I used Windows upgrade anytime software?</p>

<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. </p>
<p>For Fujitsu, press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upgrading from Windows XP?</p>
<p>Please read these instructions carefully and completely before you begin installing Windows 7: There are important steps that you need to follow to upgrade from your PC from Windows XP to Windows 7 in order to preserve your files and settings.</p>
<p>Before you begin, you'll need to back up all your data to an external storage device, and you'll need all of the installation discs for programs you want to keep. Please make sure you have an external hard drive (see details below).</p>
</font></u></b></strong></font>
<p>More detailed instructions are available at windows.microsoft.com/upgrade-windows-xp. Here are the basic steps.</p>
<p>1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor (windows.microsoft.com/upgradeadvisor) to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you should install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.</p>
<p>2. Save your files and settings on an external hard drive using Windows Easy Transfer (windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer). If you don't have an external hard drive you won't be able to use Windows Easy Transfer. Alternatively, you can copy files
 you want to keep on a USB flash drive, CDs, or DVDs.</p>
<p>3. You'll need to manually reinstall your programs, such as Microsoft Office, after you install Windows 7. Gather the installation discs for your programs and any associated product/license keys. You might be able to download some programs from the Internet.
 For example, Windows Live Messenger can be installed from download.live.com/messenger.</p>
<p>4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC. When asked "Which type of installation do you want? click "Custom (advanced)."</p>
<p>5. After Windows 7 is installed, use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your files and settings.</p>
<p>If you're not comfortable installing Windows 7 yourself, check with a local retail store or PC services company to see if they offer upgrade services.

            <p>Anytime Upgrade software is transferable as long as it is removed from the system on which it is installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far example, if you upgrade Windows 7 Home Premium OEM to Windows 7 Professional then later decide you want to transfer it to another computer, then all you need to do is remove it from the computer either by doing a factory reset. Then you can upgrade
 the other computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Anytime Upgrades I am aware of are retail upgrades. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and would guide you in the right direction to get your issue resolved. As per the description of the issue, you have not received the cashback in your Paytm wallet and that Paytm is supposed to inform if the promotional offer was
 applicable in your case. If, so you might need to contact Paytm as to why the cashback is still pending.</p>
<p>

            <p>Dear Hankarwar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all I want to tell you that &nbsp;the promotional offer is provided by Microsoft not paytm. And as promised by Microsoft I should receive a paytm coupon &nbsp;code of rs.200 for 6 months &nbsp;by Microsoft itself. It is Microsoft &nbsp;who gonna provide &nbsp;coupon &nbsp;code
 which &nbsp;can be used at paytm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please come back to the point and resolve the issue @ Microsoft end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi Rohan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a promotional offer which was offered by Microsoft and Paytm. However, the support for the coupons will be provided by Paytm support team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They will be able to guide on how to get and use the coupons. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please contact Paytm support as mentioned by Harkanwar Singh in his previous reply on this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.</p>

</p><p>This offer should be activated by Microsoft. Refer the link.&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/india/tabletoffer/</p>
<p>It should be resolved from Microsoft end. In order to get the coupon Microsoft should first call us which they are not doing, Same problem for me too.</p>

<h2>            Windows XP PC can&#39;t enter safe mode</h2>
                    <p><span>So, my windows XP (Service pack 2) PC has been infected with a lot of viruses and i decided to do some cleaning, the virus has been bugging me, i guess it has been really bad since i wasn't able to install some antivirus and it is &nbsp;showing
 me errors every time i tried to open registry editor or task manager. Then i tried to start the windows in safe mode, but it just wont start and it keeps restarting over and over again. But i was able to start the windows in normal mode.</span></p>
<p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">I searched a bit for my problem above on the internet, and then i tried to open System Configuration Utility, go to the BOOT.INI tab, and checked the / SAFEBOOT option. And this made my computer unable to start at all,
 in safe mode, safe mode with command prompt, networking, and i tried last known good configuration, &nbsp;it won't start at all. Even in normal mode.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">

</p><p class="contentStandard">Again, i looked it up on the internet and i tried the 'Disable automatic restart on system failure' on the Advanced Boot Option. And it shows me this message :</p>
<p class="contentStandard">"A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer" ...&nbsp;STOP: 0X0000007B (0xF78d2524, 0XC0000034,0X00000000, 0X00000000) -&nbsp;With a blue screen.</p>

<p class="contentStandard">And as the only sensible thing to me is to look it up on the internet, but again, it got me nothing but a whole new problem. I tried this :</p>

<div>
<p class="contentStandard"><a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/265132-30-stop-0x0000007b-0xf78d2524-0xc0000034-0x00000000-0x00000000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/265132-30-stop-0x0000007b-0xf78d2524-0xc0000034-0x00000000-0x00000000</a></p>
<p>
</p></div>

<p class="contentStandard">So, i tried that. But instead of changing my SATA mode from RAID mode to IDE mode, i just it from IDE mode to RAID mode because it is already on IDE mode and i don't know what else to do (and i think that it's okay to try
 and see how it goes) and again, i was wrong. It made my problem a lot worse. It's not showing the first screen i usually get. I don't know what screen it is but it has an option press F1 to continue and DEL to start the setup. Instead it brings me directly
 to the screen which has the safe mode option, normal mode option.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">

</p><p class="contentStandard">Please help me, i don't know what to do, and obviously browsing the internet just don't work for me.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">

</p><p class="contentStandard">P.S. booting from a disk won't work because my cd/dvd drive is just not working properly anymore.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">

</p><p class="contentStandard">Any helps would be really appreciated. 😃</p>

            <p>I don't know how many exactly, but it is surely more than a few. When i scan it, i got a thousand registry viruses more or less (I got the viruses from a flash drive that i used on a PC in an internet cafe). Also, i mentioned that the cd drive is broken.
 Well, the PC is kinda old. So i can't do a reinstallation of windows.<br />

<h2>            Error message &#34;mpnex30.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close.&#34; - Why and how to rectify problem&#63;</h2>
                    Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
Sorry about this being a bit long but I think knowing everything I have done will help narrow down the problem and hopefully provide me with a solution.<br />
<br />
I have a Canon MP550 printer which uses its own excellent software (Canon MP Navigator EX 3.0) which is loaded into my computer (using Windows XP SP3) for printing and viewing photos. It has all worked perfectly well until yesterday when I put someone else's
 memory stick (SanDisk cruzer 8GB) into my computer. I did not know at the time that this memory stick would immediately and automatically download a program called U3 onto my computer which I have since found out is known to have almost virus like qualities.
 The result is that I cannot now view any photos using my Canon MP Navigator EX 3.0 software.<br />
<br />
When I now try to view any photos through this software the normal opening window appears with the message"In progress... Please wait a few moments".<br />
<br />
Then after a few more seconds I get the following error message: "mpnex30.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience." Why?<br />
<br />
Since the problem started yesterday I have carried out all of the following in the hope of rectifying it:
<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I initially uninstalled and re-installed my Canon MP Navigator EX 3.0 software but there was no change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then did all the various scans for malware, adware, viruses, trojans, worms, etc., but there were none.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then used a good registry cleaner to ensure that the registry was not the problem but there was no change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then uninstalled and re-installed my Canon MP Navigator EX 3.0 software a second time but again there was no change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then did a search to see where and how many times "mpnex30.exe" was on my computer and it was only once in the following location so it was the same version as on the DVD from which I had just re-installed it again:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Canon\MP Navigator EX 3.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That version of "mpnex30.exe" is 3.0.1.0 at 6,286KB dated 23/3/2009.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The search also showed there is another file of type "PF File" of 121KB called "MPNEX30.EXE-1862C7BB.pf" located in a directory "C:\WINDOWS\Prefetch".&nbsp; Is this relevant?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now I can still download photos from an SD card to my computer through my Canon MP550 without any problem, I can also scan documents and save them on the computer, and I can print photos using other photo software, so it seems this problem
 is only related to trying to view photos using the Canon MP Navigator EX 3.0 software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I can view my photos with other inferior software, it is the much better Canon software that I want to use again as there is no contest as to which is by far the best.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>All this points to it being a Windows problem rather than one with the Canon MP Navigator EX 3.0 software.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also note that "mpnex30.exe" is not showing up in Appplications tab of the Windows Task Manager.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also note that the copy of "mpnex30.exe" that I do have is actually being used when I try to view a photo via the Canon MP Navigator EX 3.0 software because if I remove it the software immediately stops and freezes saying it cannot
 find that file. So something happens a few seconds after which prompts the error message "mpnex30.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is the problem I have and I need to find out why and be able to put it right.<br />
</p>
<br />

<p>I will greatly appreciate all the help you can give me. Many thanks.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>1. do not use a registry cleaner</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. did you reboot after uninstallation of canon program?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. what malware scans did you run?&nbsp; full or quick</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. a usb stick should be scanned before ever opening, it is easy to infect your computer especially if it was connected to another computer first, and may have carried an infection with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. uninstall program again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. reboot</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. do the following:</p>

    <title>Unable to talk on party or game chat on Xbox Live after suspension - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xkillswitch on  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to talk on party or game chat on Xbox Live after suspension</h2>
                    
<p>This issue has become way out of hand. It's apparent that Xbox does not value me or anyone else with critical issues like this. As a backstory, I received a ban on my account for cussing in a message. A message that was sent to a gamer exploiting a glitch
 in Destiny. Interesting, seeing as how Microsoft,Xbox promote rated M games that contain nudity, violence, theft, drug abuse, etc. The result of this ban has left me unable to chat in party or game chat due to an apparent "bug" in the system which no one seems
 to care to fix. The only response I receive is "we are aware of this issue and are working to resolve it". The only reason I play Xbox is so I can chat with my friends. with that said, why would I pay for this service when I am unable to do the only thing
 I want to do on Xbox? Xbox will not compensate anybody on this issue because they simply don't care. Why would I use a service where the customers are treated so poorly? Does Microsoft/Xbox not care about making money and keeping loyal customers around? I've
 been buying Xbox products for 10 years and I'm coming to the end of the battle. Ive been planing on buying a PlayStation for some time now and the poor customer service and faulty products are Making my decision much easier. I have made forum posts on this
 issue (which have been deleted) called into support, chatted with support, and even messaged Major Nelson on my issue. I get lucky if I even get a sophisticated response back. Employees have told me they would follow up with my issue, but never have. I have
 been told updates would fix the issues. They haven't. I have even been told that turning my Xbox off would fix the issue. Do I look Stupid? I am deeply dissapointed with my experiences with Xbox and would never refer someone to any of the products again. it
 would deeply sadden me to see anybody make the same mistakes I did in being a customer with Xbox.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While I do appreciate the quick response, why would I stay with Xbox? &nbsp;There is no foreseeable fix in the near future, I have been unable to talk to my friends for almost two months now, and I feel as though I am legitimately wasting my time and money at
 this point. Would you not agree? What customer would continue paying for a service like this?

<p>So are you guys only required to make one generic response? As far as I can tell my questions have not been answered. I guess I should expect as much though. This is how I've been treated in the entirety of using Xbox.</p>

Change your iPhone's WiFi name (the SSID) to something without a space in the name or without any special characters.<br />

For example, name it MyWiFi instead of My WiFi.<br />

            <p>Hi Poshan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have occurred due the Windows Store corruption. Let's try the methods below&nbsp;and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> I suggest you to run the </span>

<p>
</p><p><span>In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, this tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and
 the Store.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to refer to the article and follow the steps given. It has steps to reset Windows store cache and check for other possible reasons.</span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2: </strong></span></p>
<strong>You may temporarily disable security software and check.</strong>

 to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

            Since many of the built-in apps aren't working, you may try reinstalling them all using PowerShell.

            <p>It appears some of the packages couldn't be registered. Do some of the apps work now? If not, it's easier to create a new user account and move your data there. Better than fixing the Apps, IMO.</p>

<h2>            Repair Disk Created With Windows 7 Backup&#47;Restore Won&#39;t Work</h2>
                    <p>I have a new HP desktop running Windows 7 Pro 64 bit.&nbsp; It is using UEFI firmware and GPT disks.&nbsp; I created a Repair Disk (CD) using Windows 7 Backup/Restore program.&nbsp; The CD completed fine.&nbsp; However, when I try to boot from the repair disk, I get an error
 message and it won't work.&nbsp; Does anyone have ideas/solutions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, I have an HP laptop and&nbsp;creating a Repair disk and booting from it works fine.&nbsp; It is also running Windows 7&nbsp;Pro but isn't using UEFI firmware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

            <p>I used to have this problem with my Dell and, when looking into various forums for guidance, I saw several comments about HP users suffering from the same problem.</p>
<p><span>Along with several users whose PCs also had <i>Factory Restore</i> partitions, I found that my
<i>System repair disks</i> appeared to have been made successfully but then failed in use, after an interminable wait, with the error code 0x4001100200001012 without ever having reached the
<i>System Recovery Options</i> dialog boxes.<span>&nbsp; </span>The backup utility provided by&nbsp;your PC maker might have the ability to make successful
<i>System repair disks</i>.<span>&nbsp; </span>For my part, after I lost the <i>Factory Restore</i> partition when replacing my hard drive, I became able to make
<i>System repair disks</i> that worked correctly.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>- - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>You can make an installation disk [DVD or 4GB USB] that can do everything that a System repair disk can do.&nbsp; Perhaps that would be a useful solution for you as well.</p>
<p>1.1 To make an installation DVD or USB, first download the <i>correct</i>* ISO from
<a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/official-windows-7-sp1-iso-from-digital-river/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Official Windows 7 SP1 ISO from Digital River</a> then transfer it to a DVD or 4GB USB using the
<a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/html/pbPage.Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 7 USB-DVD download tool</a> <i>The download tool can run on Windows 7, Vista &amp; XP SP2 but XP users have to have additional components that are listed, &amp; linked to, on its download page.</i></p>
<p>1.2 * <i>Correct</i> = You can only run a successful installation of the version of Windows [Home Premium &amp; so on] that is identified on your Certificate of Authenticity [CoA]. The PC manual also needs to be checked as, if the PC is only specified as being
 capable of running 32 bit Windows 7 [“x86” but often referred to as x32], then only a 32 bit [x86] installation will succeed. If the PC is specified as being capable of running 64 bit Windows 7 [“x64”] then a x64 installation would normally be chosen. You
 can also check the version you currently have installed at Control panel, System - see the entry at the top for the version &amp; the entry lower down at System type for 64 bit or 32 bit. Your Windows 7 CoA Product Key is valid for 32 bit &amp; 64 bit versions so
 you can choose which one to install.</p>
<p>1.3 Install the USB-DVD Download Tool using an admin-level account then run it with the ISO file stored anywhere on the system accessible by the Admin account [except the target DVD / USB drive, I discovered, although others say that it can be on the target
 drive]. The result is a Windows 7 SP1 installation DVD / USB. The USB-DVD Download Tool can then be ignored or it can be uninstalled.</p>
<p>2 Insert the new Windows 7 Installation DVD / USB and (re)start the system. </p>
<p>3 As soon as the PC maker’s logo appears, set the system to boot from the DVD / USB drive as appropriate by pressing repeatedly on the
<i>Boot options</i> key or the <i>BIOS</i> key identified onscreen at this point [or identified in the PC manual]. This bootup can take a minute or even longer.</p>
<p>4 Once the system boots from the disk, onscreen instructions will guide you through the installation procedure or, as required, the Windows repair &amp; the system image restoration procedures.</p>
<p>5 At the end of the reinstallation, you may or may not have to activate Windows 7. If you are reinstalling the version preinstalled by the PC maker then they might have provided for a self-activation process that you will not even notice. If you have any
 doubts then you can go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Genuine Microsoft Software Validation</a> afterwards to validate the activation / self-activation if you wish.</p>
<p><strong>6 To test the installation disk,</strong> </p>
<p>6.1 Insert the Windows installation disk, restart the system. As soon as the PC maker’s logo appears, set the system to boot from the DVD / USB drive as appropriate by pressing repeatedly on the
<i>Boot options</i> key or the <i>BIOS</i> key identified onscreen at this point [or identified in the PC manual].
</p>
<p>6.2 After several minutes for a DVD or slow USB [that can include periods with a blank screen &amp; no apparent activity], wait during the opening screen “Starting Windows” then, at the first
<i>Install Windows</i> dialog, select the language the time-currency format &amp; the keyboard. Then click
<i>Next</i>. </p>
<p>6.3 At the next <i>Install Windows</i> dialog, select <i>Repair your computer</i>, wait while it searches for windows installations.
</p>
<p>6.4 At the first <i>System Recovery Options</i> dialog, accept Windows 7 as the OS to repair, click
<i>Next</i>. </p>
<p>6.5 At the <i>System Recovery Options</i> menu, select Shutdown. The test is complete.</p>

 on down.</p>
<p>2&nbsp; About UEFI - Here's a&nbsp;thread that refers to images &amp; System repair disks &amp; installation DVDs -
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/recovery-cd-made-by-uefi-install-will-not-boot/cc9a0583-bdcc-44fb-8069-0da7e25201be">
Recovery CD made by UEFI install will not boot</a></p>
<p>3&nbsp; About UEFI - There might be other useful UEFI threads in the forum but I don't know enough to judge them.</p>
<p>4&nbsp; About Recovery DVDs - the term is often used rather loosely to mean a disk with drivers on it but, assuming that it is a DVD export of the Factory Restore partition created using an HP utility that clearly states that it is a tool for doing precisely
 this, then it might fall foul of the same UEFI issue&nbsp;for all&nbsp;I know.&nbsp; If it were not for the UEFI, I'd say,
<em>Yes, that's right.</em>&nbsp; </p>
<p>5&nbsp; About Recovery DVDs - Just my prejudice here but doesn't the HP utility let you create&nbsp;a single Recovery USB instead?&nbsp; I'd think this would be more dependable as it would be difficult to break it by sitting on it and it would be quicker in use.&nbsp; The same
 applies to the installation DVD/USB [I've even transferred my <em>System repair disk</em> to a USB].</p>

    <title>Power Management tab missing for Bluetooth devices in Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> uxfactor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power Management tab missing for Bluetooth devices in Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to prevent a Bluetooth mouse (Apple Mighty Mouse) from sleeping when connected to Windows 8. The solution in Windows 7 is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to Bluetooth Settings in the Control Panel<br />
2.&nbsp;Click "Hardware" tab<br />
3. Select "Apple Built-in Bluetooth" and click "Properties"<br />
4. Click "Change settings"<br />
5. Go to the "Power Management" tab and untick "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In&nbsp;Windows 8 Enterprise the Power Management tab is missing - another <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/why-bluetooth-mouse-keeps-on-disconnecting-in/4d6587f2-a1e9-4486-8a1d-07299cc78d7c">
thread</a> on this forum indicates that the Power Management tab is visible to other users of Windows 8.</p>

            <div>Yes, finally cracked it only this week and have been testing it since satisfactorily. &nbsp;Not sure how critical Part 2, below, is but I have it set up like this anyway.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>PART 1</b></div>
<div>1.<span> </span>Go to <b>Device Manager</b> in <b>Control Panel</b></div>
<div>2.<span> </span>Open <b>Bluetooth</b></div>
<div>2.<span> </span>Open <b>Generic Bluetooth Adapter</b>.</div>
<div>5.<span> </span>Go to the<b> Power Management</b> tab and switch off "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" (as the Apple Magic Mouse driver doesn't have this tab).</div>
<div>6.<span> </span><b>OK </b>everything.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>PART 2</b></div>
<div>7.<span> </span>Search for <b>services.msc</b> via Charms/Search.</div>
<div>8.<span> </span>In the <b>Programs </b>list, click <b>Services</b>.&nbsp;</div>
<div>9.<span> </span>Double-click the <b>Bluetooth Support</b> service.&nbsp;</div>
<div>10.<span> </span>If the <b>Bluetooth Support </b>service is stopped, click <b>
Start</b>.&nbsp;</div>
<div>11.<span> </span>On the <b>Startup </b>type list, click <b>Automatic</b>.&nbsp;</div>
<div>12.<span> </span>Click <b>OK</b>.&nbsp;</div>
<div>13.<span> </span>If you prompted to restart the computer, click <b>Yes</b>.</div>

            Do you have the Generic Bluetooth Adapter and is it too missing the Power Management tab toot then?
<div><br />
<div>I'm running the enterprise version of Windows 8 so I'm not sure if or how that makes a difference - I'd expect not for something as basic as Bluetooth connectivity in a Control Panel.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sounds like you may need to contact Microsoft support directly to troubleshoot this further.<br />

            I've found the power settings for the WiFi adapter set to power save, which gave me an unstable connection. After finding and changing that, I went looking for my Bluetooth mouse power setting because it, too, is unstable.
<div><br />
<div>Thank you uxfactor, for posting this! I'm testing it now. I got really tired of having to hit a keyboard key at random times to turn my mouse back on...hopefully this solves it, since the troubleshooting steps above had as much effect for me as they did
 for you.</div>

            Yes. I'm having this problem too and I've not been able to find a solution. None of my Bluetooth panels have the Power Management Tab and the recommended fix of running the power trouble shooter and uninstalling/reinstalling doesn't work.
<div><br />
<div>Would very much like to find a fix for this; it's driving me crazy!</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I've checked carefully that I'm using the correct and latest drivers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Problem devices are: Targus Comfort Bluetooth mouse and Logitech Bluetooth keyboard.</div>

<h2>            I have no sound on my computer. It says no audio device is installed.</h2>
                    I have no sound on my computer - something has been changed over the last month - is says device not found/no device installed but there was always sound on my laptop before.&nbsp; When I was at home my plug in speakers would not work, nor would my head set
 - but usually I can hear without plugging something in - I just plug in for better sound sometimes - now, the sound doesn't work at all.

            Most often when a device doesnt workl it is because of a driver.&nbsp; Try re-installing yours.<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This error message is normally related to a problem with your user data. Maybe your saved data has become corrupt or unaccessible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may uninstall the game from control panel and delete the user data folder mentioned here.
</p>
<p><br />
I would suggest you to delete&nbsp;all your saved data from the game directory to force the game to create a new clean save on start up.
<br />
<br />
Below is the location of Plants vs Zombies save file: <br />
<br />
<strong>C:\ProgramData\PopCap Games\Plants vs. Zombies\userdata <br />
</strong><br />
Please delete the entire "userdata" folder within the directory. <br />
<br />
In order to access your PopCap Games user profiles/game progress, you may need to set your Folder Options to allow you to view the directories that are hidden by default. To do so, please follow the steps below:
<br />
</p>
<p>Follow the steps given here to unhide the folder.</p>
<p>a. Press <strong>Windows</strong> Key + <strong>W </strong>Key, type: <strong>
Hidden</strong><br />
b. Click <strong>Settings</strong> below the search box.<br />
c. Click <strong>Show Hidden Files and Folders </strong>on the left side of your screen.<br />
d. Then click <strong>Show hidden files, folders</strong>, and <strong>drives </strong>
under <strong>View tab</strong>.<br />
e. Click <strong>OK </strong>and<strong> Apply.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Once you have deleted the entire directory, you may reinstall the game and check.
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. </p>

<h2>            Onenote on windows 10 - Sorry something went wrong</h2>
                    <p>Every time I try to start Onenote (Modern) in windows 10 it says the above followed by saying we are unable to sign you in, please try again later. &nbsp;It never actually works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now normally I would just uninstall and reinstall the app but it seems as if this particular app has been locked into the build. &nbsp;You cannot remove it. &nbsp;That's fine if it works, but if it does not then how the heck do you get it working again? &nbsp;Mail and
 Calendar work fine so it is not an authentication fault overall, just something in onenote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or hint would be useful.</p>

<p>
</p><div>1. Open powershell in Windows 10</div>
<p>2. type following command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The command is to <strong>uninstall </strong>OneNote from your Windows 10.</p>
<p>3. Open Windows App Store</p>
<p>4. Install OneNote again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, I think its cache folder was corrupted.&nbsp; It tried to sync data and failed and became unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if the above steps still doesn't work, try delete "Microsoft.Office.OneNote.*" in your %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Packages (which needs administrator access), and redo steps above again.</p>
<p>

<h2>            &#91;TOPIC UNIQUE&#93; Birds of Steel</h2>
                    
<p>Et oui en voilà une bonne nouvelle pour les fans (dont je suis...) de la série des IL2 ! Ils remettent ça !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Le petit nouveau sera nommé "Birds of steel"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Développeur : Gaijin Entertainment</p>
<p>Editeur : Konami</p>
<p>Date de sortie : 2012</p>
<p>Site officiel : http://www.gaijinent.com/en</p>
<p>Site de Gaijin (forum dédié au jeu) : http://forum.gaijinent.com/index.php?/topic/3719-gaijins-new-mmo-wwii-game-birds-of-steel/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Le jeu se déroulera toujours durant la seconde guerre mondiale mais intégrera&nbsp; la zone Pacifique qui a connu des épisodes de combats acharnés.</p>
<p><br />
- 20 missions basées sur des faits réels ou fictifs<br />
- 8 campagnes historiques<br />
- 100 modèles d’avions des forces Alliées ou de l’Axe (UK, USA, Allemagne, Japon...)<br />
- conditions météorologiques propres à chaque zone<br />
- gestion des dégâts reçus<br />
- différents angles de caméra et vue à 1re ou à la 3ème personne<br />
- pilotage assisté de type arcade ou simulation (gestion entièrement manuelle)<br />
- mode multijoueurs en ligne (coopération, Team Death Matchs, Raids Aériens, etc.)
</p>
<div>
<br />
A priori, les habitués des IL2 seront dans leur élément avec l'intégration d'un mode simulation assez poussé, en plus d'un mode arcade.</div>
<div>
Un trailer est récemment sorti.<br />

<p>Salut et bon topic ! J'ai pas fais le premier <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>Il-2</strong></span> dispo sur <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">360</span></strong> mais je pense que je vais essayer de me le faire tout de même, j'aime finalement assez bien les jeux d'avions, même si la plupart qu'on ai pu avoir été
 clairement orienté <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Arcade</strong></span> comme
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Heroes Over Europe</span></strong> par exemple ... mais ça me dérange pas moi le côté
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">arcade</span></strong> dans ce type de jeux puisque de toute manière j'ai aucune espèce de sorte d'idées de comment ça fait d'être dans un avion de guerre d'une certaine époque et parceque ça reste des jeux !
 Mais l'approche plus sérieuse dans le ressentie des<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong> Il-2</strong></span> à de quoi séduire aussi !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bref titre à surveiller donc ! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Oui, l interet des Il2, c'est precisemment qu'ils sont finalement fait pour tous : les "arcadiens" et les fans de simu. Aussi je n'ai aucun doute sur le fait que birds of prey pourrait te plaire puisque tu apprecies les jeux d'avions.</p>

<p>Yep c'est vrai que IL-2 est polyvalent contrairement aux autres clairement arcades et son contexte semble bien foutu, faut vraiment que je choppe le premier d'ailleurs.</p>
<p>Sinon pour les liens il faut que poste avec le format RTF, ensuite tu fais comme l'ancien forum en sourlignant les mots auquel tu veux ajouter le lien pour le fondre dans les mots, pour entrer le lien, y'a une petite icone en forme de chaîne ( un maillon
 ) etc etc mais je crois qu'il y a une FAQ de dispo non ? Bref ! T'en fais pas, au pire pour les liens je peux toujours les prendres en copier et les coller sur la barre du navigateur ( en ouvrant une page vierge ! ).</p>

<h2>            Who are you&#63; Glitch and general issues</h2>
                    
<p><br />
I've been trying to play GTA online, despite it's already long loading times and inability to get me with friends 90% of the time I finally got in with my friend.<br />
<br />
However then my Xbox decided to ask Who Are You? and take me to the sign in screen, which logged me out of xbox live and the session. It's done this a dozen times over the past hour and it's done it frequently before. Now how do I permanently fix this without
 reboots or worse redownloading my profile? Last time I did that I had to redownload 50% of my games despite them being on an external harddrive, which took me well over my 200gb limit for a month.</p>
<p>I have had numerous other problems such as the host leaving the game (when they haven't), the game not letting me join friends (comes up incompatible), loading times timing out, even when I get job invites at times I accept them and it does nothing. After
 waiting ages for some sort of price drop I got GTA on xbox store at full price just so I can appease friends for joining them. With my current&nbsp;luck I've played very few online sessions, and I can bet any money that GTA 5 will have a discount now that I've
 forked out $100.<br />
<br />
So what are the permanent solutions without me rebooting the console, internet, TV, reinstalling, etc. etc. by rights I shouldn't need to do any of that anyway but I'm tired of trying for literally hours to play a single match.</p>

<p>A hard reset usually helps most problems. I have seen others have this issue here and there. A hard reset is turning your console off by holding in the X button on the console not the controller until it turns off. If that doesnt help then contact Rockstar
 support. </p>

    <title>Logitech G11 Gaming Keyboard key repeat delay issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Logitech G11 Gaming Keyboard key repeat delay issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hello there.</p>
<p>I have been a user of the Logitech G11 for about three months or so now, and I love it. Frankly, it's an awesome keyboard.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have an issue with it. The '/@ key doesn't work properly - that is, it doesn't type anything until after the repeat delay has passed, at which point it repeats as normal. Basically, the first instance of the symbol I am typing never appears.</p>
<p>I initially thought this was an issue with the keyboard itself&nbsp;- a hardware issue - but recently I used the keyboard on another user, and it worked as normal, leading me to conclude that it is a software issue - but whether it is caused by the OS or its
 drivers I don't know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Operating system: Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit</p>

<p>Hello AHadley,</p>
<p>You can try uninstalling the keyboard completely and reinstalling to determine if it&nbsp;resolves&nbsp;the issue. Although, if this does not resolve the issue, it could be due to corruption in your User Profile, since this is not&nbsp;occurring&nbsp;within another user account.

<h3> jdji  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 x64 BSOD Driver_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL USB-HCI.sys ERROR</h2>
                    <p>Wondering why this BSOD pops up sometimes. I looked around and it was suggested that I update D-Link drivers or something, so I first installed drivers from Aetheros (or something like that), and when I kept getting the BSOD, I disabled it completely (I
 use a LAN cable anyways, so disabling wifi wasn't a big deal). However, I still get the BSOD even after that. The BSOD always pops up when I'm playing games, like Counter Strike: Global Offensive or Overwatch. I've went through every device in Device Manager,

            Are you telling me CAM is the program that is causing my BSODs? It's supposed to be a PC monitoring software (tells me CPU and GPU load and temperatures, RAM load, etc). Is it possible that CAM would also be causing PC freezes? I seem to get a lot of freezes
 while playing CSGO as well, but I couldn't tell whether it was my sloppy overclock or something else. I tested my PC using Prime95, 5 instances of memtest and 3DMark demo from Steam store, and my PC would do just fine. Even running Overwatch doesn't freeze
 my PC (just one occurrence over the span of a week). However, CSGO seems to **** out on me quite often.

            <p>Well since the drivers for this monitoring program are 8 yrs old, I wouldnt be surprised if it's causing a crash. Old drivers can cause crashes</p>
<p>
</p><p>And overclocking wont help either</p>

<h2>            All USB connections and monitor switch off after bios screen &#40;booting Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Following an upgrade to Windows 10, I run into an issue where I can get past the BIOS and the blue Windows Logo shows up. Following this, all my USB media shuts off and my monitor turns&nbsp; black (as in standby mode). If I cold boot the computer (as in manually
 switching the power off for a about 10 seconds), it boots normally. However, once I shut down the computer, the same process repeats itself. This has been ongoing for a few weeks. Windows 10 runs very well, once it gets running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other specs and software&nbsp;involved...</p>
<p>AMD 6300 Hexacore (MSI MOBO)</p>
<p>Nvidia GTX 750</p>
<p>Norton Internet Security</p>
<p>Norton Utilities 16</p>
<p>Wireless adapter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note, I have no cursor in the middle of a black screen after start up. There is no monitor or USB readings whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

    <title>Printer Management Won&#39;t Open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kmorrisonkm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer Management Won&#39;t Open</h2>
                    <p>I need to uninstall all the printer drivers on my laptop and start fresh. I found Printer Management in Windows 8 but it just won't open. When I click on it the window starts to open and immediately closes. I have tried pinning it to the task bar, opening
 it directly from system 32 and restarting the printer spooler.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a work lap top that someone was using a year ago. I work in an office of weird artsy people who are clueless about technology. The guy who used to use the lap top has no ideas. I think the best fix is to uninstall all printers and drivers and start
 again with the right driver. I'm pretty sure the only way to do this is throught printer management. HELP!</p>
