</p><p>Your achievements and any add-on content that you have will all be saved on your Xbox Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your saved game progress and data is stored on the Console's HDD; so if you wanted to save that you would need to first move it to the Cloud on Xbox or an External device (HDD or Flash Drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also may need to verify that you are still able to play the Xbox 360 games on Xbox One as some games are not backward compatible yet</p>

            As mentioned the codes are for new accounts with no history of Xbox Live. They can expire as well. Also keep in mind that while the console may be new to you. The store could have had it around for awhile which is another reason it could be expired.&nbsp;

<p>hi all, I once checked an option in settings of the Xbox app to make the game bar appear when i'm streaming to pop up whenever the Xbox button is pressed. &nbsp;Now I find this a pain, but the option is gone from the app!</p>

<p>Anyone know how I can stop this please?</p>

    <title>Can digital licenses migrate from one pc to another&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can digital licenses migrate from one pc to another&#63;</h2>
                    I have a free digital license that I got when I upgraded from windows 7 to windows 10 and as far as I'm aware it is connected to my microsoft account. I also know that this digital license can be activated only on
<strong>1 computer at a time</strong>. The question rises from a situation like this, when I have 2 computers, my old one where I upgraded to windows 10 and activated this license and another one which has windows 10 installed on it, but it doesn't have a product
 key activated on it (computer was commissioned to be built by different people and this is the case where they chose not to activate the key during installation of windows 10 and they made an offline account). Can I just remove the old pc from my device list
 and then add this new pc to it?<br />
And last thing, as far as I can remember (maybe there is info about this in my device history where I can remind myself) I had
<strong>Home</strong> version of Windows 10 on my old pc and this new one has the
<strong>Pro</strong> version, does this conflict with one another and do I need to reinstall windows 10 to make it Home?

            Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends)
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this(one if you have already run activation troubleshooter)
<br />
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below or use the chat support link(weekdays only)
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/405170...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.

            Hi LantemC
<br />
<br />Since that was a Retail Licence, it will have transfer rights to another PC
<br />
<br />However, the Windows Edition (Home, Pro . . . etc.) on the other PC must match the previous Edition, so you would need to install Home on the new PC
<br />
<br />On the old PC, click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 10 Product Key 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />Then on the new PC. go to Settings - Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />Try entering that product key there to activate Windows 
<br />
<br />Otherwise, have that product key at hand and contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Choose a local Phone Number:

<h2>            Windows Media Player graphic equalizer does not work properly.</h2>
                    
<p>It happens in all versions of the incredible&nbsp;Windows 7 that doesn't have any problems as Microsoft so accurately states. Instead of ridding problems, it created new&nbsp;ones, wow. -_- Major down-grade from XP.</p>
<p>The problem is really simple: when you move the bars to create nicer sounding frequencies for your music, the sound becomes unstable and volume is thrown in all directions. This was never a problem with XP. I think it may be because Microsoft took out Realtek
 for some unknown reason that wouldn't be logical at all.</p>
<p>For people without answers and just suggestions, I have bought a sound card, though I shouldn't've had to and that does not work either.</p>
<p>Please don't reply unless you have a possible solution or an actual solution. This is really pathetic and I shouldnt have to post this, but Microsoft doesnt have any competency so it's my last resort.</p>

<p>Please, no "Support" people. They're completely useless. I need someone who actually knows the software, not someone who is going to give me useless suggestions.</p>
<p>The WMP graphic equalizer does not work. I don't understand how a company can put a product out without even testing it. When you move the bars to make different frequencies, mandatory if you care about your music, the sound becomes extremely unstable and
 volume is thrown in all directions.</p>
<p>I have a sound card.</p>
<p>It happens in&nbsp;ALL versions of 7.</p>
<p>Imagine that. New software by Microsoft, more problems. -_-</p>
<p>This is about the tenth time I have posted this, just to show how pathetic the support team and Microsoft is. And I'm clearly not the only one who is hating 7 because of this.</p>

            Dear Friend HERE IS YOUR ANSWER<br />
<br />
<br />
You have problem with media player 12 because Windows 7 uses microsoft codecs... Microsoft don't give you the option to enable or disable some&nbsp; functions... You have to use the products how microsoft likes it. You're right, Microsoft makes new problems instead
 to resolve the old ones.<br />
<br />
HERE IS YOUR ANSWER<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="http://websyrup.net/2012/05/09/preferred-filter-tweaker-for-windows-7-win7dsfiltertweaker-5-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Win7DSFilter Tweeker 5.3</a>&nbsp; from this link or any other site<br />
</li><li>When you execute this program you will see three options</li><li>First select&nbsp; TWEAKS than Disable MP3 Decoder DMO than Apply &amp; Close</li><li>Now Select Preffered decoders go down until you see MP3 and select ffdshow (You have to install ffdshow before you can do it. You can install for example klite codec pack)</li><li>Apply &amp; Close</li></ul>

That was it ;)<br />

            &nbsp;I have a similar problem. I'm a music freak and I play guitar and write my own stuff. I like to add some EQ settings to the mic using "Smart Audio". Then, I record whatever I'm working on, and then I turn on the EQ settings in media player. Then I turn
 up the speakers, turn off the eq settings on the mic, and play the file while recording it with the eq settings from media player. When I listen to it, it sounds horrible! Even though I have the mic and speakers set to "Studio quality." I did that by right
 clicking on the volume icon on the taskbar, and click playback devices. I double clicked the speaker and clicked on the advanced tab. I changed it to 16 bit, 96,000 Hz (studio quality.) I did the same thing with the mic only I set it to 2 channel, 24 bit,
 44100 Hz studio quality. Does anyone know what's going on?? Any help would be appreciated!!!<br />

            When you upgrade, if you did, from whatever (XP in your case ? )to W7 you need to go to your PC/Laptop maker's website and get the audio drivers for your specific model/machine from there, NOT from MS, NOR from Realtek. And lets hope they have some.<br />
<br />
If you made or assembled your machine yourself, then do the same but this time from your motherboard maker's website.<br />
<br />
I would suggest the first thing you need to do is update your audio drivers, but NOT via MS update. Get the latest ones buy going direct, as I mentioned above.<br />
<br />
Also, something you need to understand - MS is NOT responsible for the drivers, that is Realtek. I'm not a fanboi of MS, don't get me wrong, but blame where blame is due........<br />
<br />
Don't believe the replies above, if you want more help, reply to this and I'll mark it so I get advised. Yu don't need IT Tech help, not do you need to install an EQ !!!<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Jerry<br />

            Hey Thanks. I was thinking it might have had something to do with me having way too many documents and files on my pc. I love taking pictures, music, and writing lyrics.. so I have at least a few hundred pictures, about 400 songs, and 30 some documents
 saved. Could that have anything to do with it?? I appreciate the help Jerry. :)<br />

            Yes the problem is still present. I think the file system printui.dll is corrupted. It is not only about this new printer, but every printer I try to install, even my old one. The comand 'add a printer' on my pc doesn't work anymore. I would like a method
 to install again on my system the file printui.dll, without having to install all Windows again if possible. Do you know how?<br />

<p>I apologize for the late revert. When you install software that uses the printui.dll dependency, the software should automatically register the file for you. In some cases, your DLL file may not register properly, and as a result, will provide a printui.dll
 not registered error. Fortunately, you can use a built-in utility called <em><strong>Microsoft Register Server</strong></em> (<em><strong>regsvr32.exe</strong></em>) to re-register your printui.dll file. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the <strong><em>Search</em></strong> box, type <strong><em>cmd</em></strong>, right-click on the result and select
<em><strong>Run as administrator</strong></em>.</li><li>Click <strong><em>Yes</em></strong> when a permission dialog box prompted.</li><li>Type the following commands: <em><strong>regsvr32 /u printui.dll</strong></em></li><li>Press <strong><em>Enter</em></strong>. This will <em><strong>un-register</strong></em> your files.</li><li>Type the following command: <em><strong>regsvr32 /i printui.dll</strong></em>
</li><li>Press <strong><em>Enter</em></strong>. This will <em><strong>re-register</strong></em> your file.</li><li>Once done, close the <em><strong>Command Prompt window</strong></em>, restart your device to apply the changes and check if the issue persists.
<br />
</li></ol>

<p><br />
Does the behavior persist if you uninstall&nbsp;<strong>Windows Internet&nbsp;Explorer 10</strong>, reboot
<em>twice</em> and then do NOT install it again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Uninstalling IE10 will automatically restore the previous IE version (i.e., IE9 or IE8) on your Win7 computer.</p>
<p><br />
Note: To stop Automatic Updates from installing IE10 again, you will need to hide it. See...</p>

<h2>            Webcam cannot be started by certain applications &#40;Camtasia, Flashback Pro&#41;</h2>
                    <p>This issue occurs with both the built-in webcam of my MSI GE70 and a Logitech C525 cam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both cams work with the camera app of Windows 10 (1703). I can see the Logitech cam and record with it when using the Logitech software as well. But neither Camtasia nor Flashback Pro manage to start up either webcam for recording.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the following :</p>
<p>- restart my computer afresh</p>
<p>- uninstall the software, clean up, reinstall the software</p>
<p>- update the drivers (Windows reports the best available drivers are installed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used these cams with Flashback Pro in the past without any problem. I initially thought the problem was due to an update of Flashback Pro, but also Camtasia has the problem, even when Flashback Pro is not on my computer any longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what might cause this?</p>

<h3> tonydean-dsb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t wirelessly connect to Samsung TV with Surface Pro 4 or Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 Surface tablets -&nbsp; 2 Surface Pro 4 and 1 Surface Pro 3 all with Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>I have 3 Samsung Smart TVs - 65 inch, 55 inch and a 40 inch all purchased just a year or so ago.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel I am very tech savvy and have conducted hundreds of meetings with the wireless desktop presentation to the Smart TV at work on my Surface Pro 4 and the 55 inch Samsung Smart TV.&nbsp; I keep all my devices up to date with all the latest updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally one of my surface pro 4 tablets could not connect wirelessly through miracast to my 65 inch TV, so I had to purchase&nbsp;a ScreenBeam Mini2.&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp; I noticed after much use that the surface pro 4 updated as some point and the miracast worked
 directly with the TV and I didn't have to use the ScreenBeam Mini 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then set up my Surface pro 3 to miracast either with the native Windows 10 driver or ScreenBeam Mini 2 to the TV.&nbsp; This worked fine also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then about two months ago I found my Surface Pro 4 would not miracast to the TV with either the miracast or ScreenBeam.&nbsp; I didn't worry about it at the time as I had my surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week my surface pro 3 also started not miracasting the desktop to the smart TV with either the native windows 10 miracast driver or the Screenbeam Mini 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled drivers, reset the Samsung TVs multiple times, and spoken with both Microsoft and Samsung support for at least 6-8 hours this past weekend.&nbsp; Samsung verified the TV had the up to date Software.&nbsp; Microsoft sent me links to do additional
 updates.&nbsp; Nothing has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also purchased the Microsoft Wireless display adapter which also did not work.&nbsp; I even had the techs at BestBuy open a Microsoft Wireless display adapter and straight out of the box it would not work.&nbsp; It displays the adapter app, acts like it is connecting
 and then something is always wrong and won't connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I brought both my Surface tablets home, and along with my Surface tablet at home, I tried all 3 on both my Samsung Smart TVs the 65 and 40 inch.&nbsp; They would not finish the connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time the devices try to connect, they start the connection and it appears they will connect, and then they time out.&nbsp; The connection hand shake never finishes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Samsung Galaxy tablet can cast to the TVs.&nbsp;&nbsp; My iPhone can cast.&nbsp; I even bought a Chromecast and it can cast the Chrome browser tabs from my surface tablets.&nbsp; But my Surface will not miracast the desktop to the TVs anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am back to having a hdmi cable strung across my conference room to the TV to display the desktop.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Samsung blames Microsoft and my ISP.&nbsp; Microsoft blames Samsung.&nbsp; I have received a couple of follow up "hows it coming" emails&nbsp;from Microsoft with no answers yet.</p>
<p>

            Tony -
<br />
<br />No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends AVG since it bloated up 10 years ago and started causing issues.  We solve many problems by having it uninstalled.  
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners.

            It has been happening with new update that new drive is getting uncovered and you start getting low space notifications. You can do following to hide it and there will be no harm anywhere.
<br />
<br />Type diskpart in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) &gt; Right click on Diskpart and Run as Administrator
<br />Give following command and Enter: 
<br />select volume k
<br />Give following command and Enter: 
<br />remove letter=k

            Hi RonP , this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />select volume K
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />remove letter=K
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt

            This is an error when upgrading from Win 7 to 10.
<br />
<br />Replace the wimgapi.dll in following location
<br />C:\Windows10Upgrade\wimgapi.dll
<br />With wimgapi.dll found in following location
<br />C:\Windows\System32\wimgapi.dll
<br />
<br />Point to be noted is that Clean or Custom Installs are always better rather than upgrading.

            This is not uncommon.
<br />During the upgrade one of the .dll did not register properly.
<br />You have 2 options.
<br />
<br />Option 1
<br />Register the dll yourself.

<br />
<br />Option 2

    <title>Trouble with an HDMI cable and audio output - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richbarton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble with an HDMI cable and audio output</h2>
                    I have just bought an HDMI lead in order to run my PC through my Sony Bravia TV so I can get better quality than with the standard PC monitor cable. &nbsp;I am getting perfect picture but I can't seem to get any audio output through the TV. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running an ATI Radeon HD 4800 series (I know that it's not this as I ran it with an HDMI lead to my ex's TV and worked fine including sound!) with Windows Vista 32bit. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried restarting the PC with the TV on (as is suggested on some forums), no luck! &nbsp;I have also tried connecting the two together with a standard audio connection lead but that doesn't seem to work either. &nbsp;I have been into the Sound Manager, but
 the option for the HDMI output is greyed out, as is the option to "Set as default device" when I right click on it. &nbsp;The output port on the PC is working, as I have tested it with another set of speakers, but I can't keep them linked to the PC unfortunately.
 &nbsp;All my drivers are up to date, I have already tried those. &nbsp;Windows is up to date as well.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Before I started using the HDMI lead the computer was connected to said Sony Bravia with a standard monitor cable and an audio jack lead, all worked fine. &nbsp;Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

<br />
<div>If you have plugged this into another TV and achieved both video <i>and</i>&nbsp;audio, then the problem is not with your computer. I might look for specific monitor drivers to use a Sony Bravia, but it is more likely that some setting on the Sony is stopping
 the HDMI signal from supplying audio feed. FWIW, my 42in Panasonic Viera has audio options for HDMI1 and HDMI2 inputs (<i>Auto, Analog</i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i>Digital)</i> and I had to install and setup a special HDMI digital audio driver in my Dell Studio 17 to get the
 correct configuration.</div>

 in mind that on our old laptop, the problem was with only his account, but not mine. Any ideas on how to fix it? please, this is urgent and i tried many solutions.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d6545c0-225c-44df-aae3-cb79ff499d81?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d6545c0-225c-44df-aae3-cb79ff499d81?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Thanks for following up and apologies for the delayed response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is isolated to only a single user account, then it could be that the user profile is has become corrupted. In some cases, corrupted user profile can only be fixed by manually finding the issue from the
<strong>Registry</strong>, but that would be a tedious task. The best that I can suggest is to try performing
<strong>SFC </strong>and <strong>DISM </strong>scan and see if it helps fix those corrupted system settings or files. Check out
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">this article</a></strong> from
<strong>ZigZag3143</strong> for more information and steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists after the scans, then what I can suggest next is to just create a new user profile for your dad, and transfer the files from the corrupted user profile to the new one. Once done, just delete the old profile and start using the new one.
 Creating the new user profile would be much easier than looking through those countless registry keys one by one to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best.</p>

            <p>Thank you for replying! By "Cleaning up" I meant that I Reset the PC. And it set everything back to the default (Factory?) settings.</p>
<p>And I was installing a game called League of Legends which I had before I reset the PC. As the installation failed due to c++ not getting installed, I tried downloading it via the Microsoft website and installing it directly&nbsp;which resulted in the same error
 again. Thanks for the help again!</p>
