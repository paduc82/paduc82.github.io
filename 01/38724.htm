<h2>            My account has been under investigation for almost a month</h2>
                    
<p>Here's the situation my account was compromised on 08/11/1211. There was 60 dollars in fraudulent charges to my account witch means the debit card I had on file was compromised and I had it canceled. This investigation has taken much longer than it should
 in my opinion, It's now 09/07/11 and I am still blocked from my account witch is paid up till november of 2013 with pre paid cards. I have been a paying member of live for 8 years and really don't&nbsp; think you are taking this problem very seriously. well I do
 I own 4 xbox 360 consoles 2 original xbox consoles and well over 30 games. I have supported you since the launch of xbox and have personally been an advocate for xbox and microsoft for 20 years. My jobs as a retail manager at toys r us and gamestop have given
 me the chance to tout the benefits of xbox and the saftey of your network and have been personaly responsible for many Xbox sales. but now that I am having problems and not being taken seriously it feels like a slap in the face. I have spent thousands of dollars
 on your products have a game room in my house that is wall to wall xbox with almost all the halo memorabilia available an xbox markee sign and promo posters from the launch of the 360. I want my money refunded and my account unlocked or I will leave the Xbox
 in the dust. Xbox customer service has been almost rude to me for the fact that I call and check the status of your investigation telling me to wait for an email to tell me how to recover my account. How about you scan my console and see that non of the fraudulent
 games or points have ever been downloaded to my console unlock my account and give me my money back. Im sick of the run around but do what you want and know your about to lose an 8 year member and any further advocacy from me</p>

<p>Hey there! Just a heads up, most investigation of this kind can take up to 30 days, more in some complex cases. I would give it a few more days and then call back with your SR# to ask what the status is. Thank you for your patience here.</p>

<p>Hi DEF1, Mister Gwyther is correct =) To give you my story though, I had a really complex case and my account was locked/under investigation for about 2 months. They did compensate me for the time I had lost and I had nothing changed on my account. Just
 make sure to call back regularly to keep up on the status. Best of luck in getting it back soon =)</p>

<p>kalozois: He doesn't have to call back, I'm simply saying if he wants updates or ETAs, phone support is the only one that can provide that information. Once the investigation is concluded, someone from the investigation team will contact him. So, again,
 he doesn't have to do anything AND we will contact him when the investigation is closed.

<p>Hey just wanted to chime in to tell everyone that Microsoft came through for me 110% they unlocked my account</p>
<p>and gave me a few kicka$$ perks.I wasnt mad at Microsoft I had just gotten 2 very rude tech support guys in a row and was frustrated by it. Today my account was unlocked and I called support to get all the refund stuff set up. the guy I talked to was cool
 as heII. "wish I could remember his name" we got everything squared away and talked about games for like 10 minutes. I've never had a problem with XBOX Support before and today really proved to me why I have supported XBOX and Microsoft since the beginning
 and will do so in the future</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for the help,</p>

<p>@ Craigun My account wasn't taken to another country they just used my debit card on file to purchase points bought some games and some how transferred it all to a different account. I had actually called in to have the investigation started and they locked
 my account to protect it from anymore problems until they could figure it all out. My advice is to keep in touch with support on a weekly basis, most of the support people are very helpful and truly understand the distress this can cause you. good luck with
 everything and keep me updated on your situation</p>

<p>Hi Divya R</p>
<p>I was happy to see I got an answer on my question, but that didn't last long.</p>
<p>when I type cmd in the start search box it brings me to the Dos Screen&nbsp; ?</p>
<p>there is no option or choice to do any of the next steps you described.</p>
<p>Insted it says C:\Users\Vor.........&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Vor......... is the computer name- user name)</p>
<p>what ever I type next it says it is not recognized as an internal or external command.</p>
<p>in the tope left corner of the screen that comes up after I give the command cmd,</p>
<p>it reads C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe</p>
<p>I tried to change Dir, to C:\ and C:\Windows but it doesn't work, I just don't get the steps as you mentioned.?</p>
<p>do i do something wrong here or is my problem bigger then I thought.?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks for your awnser in the first place, hopefully you got one to this too.</p>
<p>Regards Leo</p>

<h2>            CPU and Memory usage</h2>
                    Hello. I've been using Windows 10 for quite some while and it was fanrtastic, but my PC started to get slower and slower every day. I decided to check Task Manager and I saw that the CPU usage was at 100% and the Memory usage was at 80%. I did a quick
 clean to my components using a can of compressed air and booted it up again, but nothing has changed. Please help

            Hi Chris,
<br />
<br />You need to find the processes that are using your CPU and RAM
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager and if necessary choose the Processes Tab
<br />
<br />Leave that open to monitor your system
<br />
<br />When your CPU goes to a high percentage, click on that column header, so the arrow faces down
<br />
<br />What are the top 5 processes listed?
<br />
<br />Then do the same for the RAM column when the RAM percentage is high . . .

<h2>            how to add the letters &#224; &#233; &#237; &#243; &#241; when hotmail language is English</h2>
                    I want my hotmail to stay in English but I want to be able to type emails in Spanish and have a way of inserting the diacritical marks over a,e,i,o, and n. The keyboard shortcuts I set up to do this in word don't work on hotmail. Is there a way to add
 those symbols when I type emails? Remember, I want my hotmail language to stay English (till I learn more Spanish.)

<br />
<div>Here is a simple method:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Open the Control Panel / Region and Language.</li><li>Install a Spanish keyboard.</li><li>Ensure that the US keyboard remains your default keyboard.</li><li>Ensure that there is a hotkey-combination to switch keyboards, e.g. Left-Alt+Shift.</li><li>Create a new shortcut on your desktop, pointing at osk.exe (=On-Screen Keyboard)</li></ol>
<div>When you type something in Spanish, do this:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Double-click the osk-shortcut. The on-screen keyboard will appear.</li><li>Type your English text.</li><li>When you need a Spanish letter, e.g. ñ, do this:<br />
- Press left-shift + left-Alt.<br />
- Briefly click an empty spot on the on-screen keyboard.<br />
- Move the cursor back to the mail item. The on-screen keyboard will now show the Spanish layout.<br />
- Click ñ, for example.</li></ol>
<div>The process looks long-winded at first but you get used to it quickly. If you want something faster then I recommend you use the Windows Keyboard Creator. It takes more time to set it up but it lets you create key assignments like these:</div>
<div>Alt+a = à</div>
<div>Alt+e = é</div>
<div>Alt+i = í</div>
<div>Alt+o = ó</div>
<div>Alt+n = ñ</div>
<div>Post again if you need instructions.</div>

            Are you sure you mean 'download' as download means downloading something from the internet. Whereas if you created and saved docs they should be stored in your Libraries&gt;Documents and 9 months worth is likely to occupy very little space

<h2>            Cannot purchase Xbox live gold</h2>
                    
<p>Several times today i have tried to renew my xbox live gold subscription using me debit card and everytime i try to confirm the purchase i get the error</p>

<p>opps something went wrong</p>
<p>with the following error code</p>

<p>Purchase-Billing-40185</p>

<p>2014/03/04 - 19:54:46 UTC</p>

<p>According to the xbox live service status, the service involved in purchases and billing is up and running.</p>

<p>i have used this same method time and time again and never has it failed until now.</p>

<p>I know what when you get the message telling you oops it usually means that something is wrong with your profile. What I would recommend to make sure that your security proof info is updated, you can go to account.live.com and go to security info to do this.
 After you do that and if you are still experiencing issues I would recommend on calling xbox support for help, it might mean that there is something wrong with your billing info on your account.</p>

<p>I would recommend on calling xbox live support at 1-800-4MY-XBOX then. It might be something that needs to be escalated if your info is up to date and you are able to make other purchases then everything should be working. I know that sometimes when you
 have an active subscription and the auto re-new is turned off it wont allow you to purchase a subscription until your current active subscription is completely done. So call in and see if they can cancel your subscription then attempt to make the purchase.
 Usually they give you a token to make up for the lost time so you get an extra month of service, and if not just wait till your subscription is completely over. I know it sounds weird but it doesn't happen to often so there are not a lot of people that have
 this issue so call in or wait for it to finish. Wish I could have been of more help though.

<h2>            ALT plus TAB and Windows key plus TAB functions Both stopped working</h2>
                    
<p>I have windows vista ultimate and my daughter was playing on the computer. Now the Alt tab function and the windows tab function where you press and hold the windows button and hit tab to scroll through your programs doesn't work anymore. I've searched through
 the control panel trying to find where to turn that setting back on but can't seem to locate it. Anyone know how to turn those functions back on?</p>

Click start and type services.msc, then hit &lt;enter&gt;. Click continue at the UAC prompt. Scroll down and click on the Themes service, then click the start/restart option in the left column.

<p>If your account is banned then you forfeit any downloaded games,remaining live time etc. as per the ToU you agreed to.</p>
<p>You can start a new account but if you break the rules with that account &amp; are banned then the same applies.</p>
<p>Maybe read the ToU/CoC &amp; stick to them then you have nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>I've had the same problem on a Windows 7 x64 Ultimate. Solved it installing KB3177467.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Check that there are no missing/damaged files using sfc/scannow.</p>
<p>2. Run the system update readiness tool (SURT).</p>
<p>3. If the problem persists try installing KB3177467, reboot and then retry KB4025341.

<h2>            Windows Toolbar lagging and freezing</h2>
                    <p>When I click on the main windows toolbar to access my programs/apps/mail there is either no response - or waits for a long time then appears but is frozen. I started getting this a week ago - so I decided to do a fresh install - was working fine - then after
 all the latest updates were downloaded and installed it starts happening again. Done two fresh installs now and getting a bit fed up!!!</p>

            <p>You get a YouTube downloader (Google, there are many out there on the web, and free) then convert it from flv to wmv or whatever format you want. Google also for free flv to wmv converter and you'll find many.</p>
<p>See this for a plyer if you don't want to convert the YouTube flv files :</p>

<p>There was only Toy Soldiers: Cold War from the current Games for Gold on the hard drive.</p>
<p>I followed your instructions exactly (why clear cache 3x?) and it showed up under Active Downloads for like one minute at 0% and then it stopped and disappeared from the list.</p>

            <p>Doing it three times is just something that Support sometimes suggests, so I usually ask people to do it too.</p>
<p>Anyway, could you attempt to re-download your profile (there shouldn't be any need to delete first)?</p>

<p>Repeat the earlier steps again first. (Get rid of partial download, clear cache.)</p>
<p>After downloading the profile, restart and attempt to download again.</p>

            <div><strong>Hello and welcome!</strong></div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Your problem with the <strong>ATI Mobility X2300 </strong>is already known in other forums,
<br />
many users failed to update due directly to the incompatibility of this graphics card from Windows 7/8 / 8.1.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>You should try to download the tool from Microsoft, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a><br />
select the version that corresponds to "Windows 10" and run the setup.exe from there!</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SOLUTION with generic Windows driver detect screen resolution ATI Mobility X2300</strong></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>A number of Web sites that offer a driver for "Windows 10" or such <a href="http://www.3dpchip.com/3dpchip/index_eng.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.3dpchip.com/3dpchip/index_eng.html</a> or<br />

<div>
<p>
</p><p>Personally "<strong>NOT RECOMMEND</strong>" any application or web-based third party that supposedly detect the "hardware" for your "pc"<br />
take you to another "unknown" server and download the appropriate driver for your computer.</p>
<div><br />
<strong>Personally and as you can see from the Microsoft support page in Spanish that I link you here</strong>:<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/es-es/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/pantalla-ati-mobility-radeon-x2300-no-compatible/83e306a6-979c-4c79-b064-468a8f840fdb">http://answers.microsoft.com/es-es/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/pantalla-ati-mobility-radeon-x2300-no-compatible/83e306a6-979c-4c79-b064-468a8f840fdb</a></div>

<div><br />
However, you are free to try and use 3dpchip.com third party websites at <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>your own risk </strong></span>!! <br />
or use the drivers from the manufacturer's website and check if your new Windows 10 is able to detect graphics and work with the optimal resolution !!</div>
<div><br />
I hope I could help!</div>

<p>On Net Framework 3.5 (https://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/hh506443(v=vs.110).aspx#ControlPanel).</p>
<p>Remove all the driver "Display Driver Uninstaller" (http://radeon.ru/downloads/utils/ddu/).<br />
I took the latest video driver from the official site (in my case Asus F3KE). Unpack the archive. Put it in the properties of compatibility with "Vista" and included "Running a means of eliminating compatibility issues" in the same window. After that it offers
 a means to try to run the program. Everything is working.<br />

<h2>            Where do I go to customize my own thumbstick sensitivity curves&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In the video below from the Xbox YT channel, at 2:00, he talks about customizing your own curves. It shows a screen where you can set various points exactly where you want them. I cannot find this in the Xbox Accessories app for Windows 10. Can someone please steer me to it? The whole point of buying this controller was for that exact functionality. I want to remove all dead zones, and set my own sensitivity curves...just like it shows. All I can find is a list of presets (aggressive, delay, smooth), and limited ability to adjust them.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 black screen with blinking underscore in top left corner</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I was updating my computer, when my power went out unexpectedly. With that in mind, I decided to just leave my computer alone for the night. The next day, I started my pc and was greeted to the ever so lovely black screen with a blinking cursor. All I see
 is the motherboard screen and then the black screen. I have put in my windows 7 disc and attempted to repair the device + use command console and do bootrec /fixmbr + /fixboot + /rebuildbcd. This changed nothing, which made me decide to wipe the hard drive
 through the windows 7 disc. This resulted in me having a completely empty disk 0 with nothing on it in the windows 7 install screen; however, when trying to select the hard drive to install windows, the screen says "Setup was unable to use the existing system
 partition because it does not contain the required free space." What do I do to fix my computer?</p>

            Hi, BardinFabian
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />So I recommend borrowing a computer to create a USB to repair Windows.
<br />Downloading the ISO already comes with the Windows 1809 updates
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-windows-10-usb-bootable-media-uefi-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Then you will start with USB and you will follow the steps of this link to repair Windows without losing your files.

            I think the age and Apple's general lack of support for a Microsoft product is working against you. Even users with the latest 2016/2017 running High Sierra seem to be having a hard to running Windows 10 on their configuration.

<p>Thanks, but if win10 can install driver whose id is not matched hardware id, it can resolve this problem, Is there a way?</p>

            Could you try with an older build of Windows 10 just to isolate the problem?
<br />
<br />You probably will need to boot into macOS, delete the Boot Camp partition and start over.
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)

<h2>            What triggers the read-receipt</h2>
                    <p>When chatting with a contact, after sending a message, sometimes the read-receipt icon drops under it immediately, but sometimes it takes a while until I see them typing. Can someone tell me exactly what triggers the read-receipt to come down under the message,
 showing the person you sent it to has read it? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there one single act, by the person that received it, trigger they are received the message or possibly there are multiple triggers?? Thanks,</p>

            You mean, someone receiving a message, and just looking at it on the screen triggers the icon below it on the sender's screen? Wow, computers have come a long way, knowing there are screens you can touch, but to just look at one to trigger a response...
 boy am I behind...<br />

<p>So you are saying that the recipient just having the sender's screen active and open, that the message itself displaying on the recipient's screen is all that is needed for the read-receipt to drop down on the sender's message screen?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recipient doesn't have to physically do something like start typing or do something with the mouse or keyboard to trigger it?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was just curious, because as I mentioned, sometimes the icon moves down immediately while other times it doesn't move for 30 seconds or so, coinciding with the "typing message" indicator to show. If you are right, I guess when it is delayed, possibly it
 was due to the wifi stream delaying it instead of something physical by the recipient?</p>

<p><span><span>If the user (recipient) is actively using Skype when the message is received and the message is visible on the Skype screen, then the read-receipt icon should appear practically

            Ok thanks, that seems like a reasonable process. I was just trying to relate it to how Skype determines a certain window being active, can trigger the icon, rather than a physical action. But I am sure the program code can do this somehow.
