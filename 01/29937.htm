<h2>            Change Network from Public to Private in Windows 10 &#40;solved&#41;</h2>
                    <p>In search icon (lower left corner of screen next to Windows icon -- the circle), type in wifi.</p>
<p><strong>Change Wifi Settings</strong> should be first in list</p>
<p>click <strong>Manage known networks</strong></p>
<p>find your network &amp; click on it &gt;&gt; click Properties.</p>
<p>Turn ON <strong>Make this PC discoverable</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I was always leery to check this, but this seems to be what turns it from Public to Private.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found the solution at <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/6815-set-network-location-private-public-windows-10-a.html#option1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Change to Private Network">

<p>Hey there Sreekanth!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to get in some Rainbow Six games. I would say that if you haven't you might want to power cycle your console as outlined in
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to restart or power cycle your Xbox One console</a>. You'd be surprised how many times that helps. It would more than likely help to try and reset your router while the console is unplugged for about 2 minutes. After those couple of minutes, reconnect the
 router and then try turning it on and seeing if you can get in a game. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get a chance, give those steps a shot and let us&nbsp; know how that helped.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            It may need an update, there was one recently. It was 40 gigs, the entire game was resized. It could also be your region. Some regions are not as active as others. 40 min in queue is odd though. I would try clearing the MAC address, Check for updates etc
 and see if that helps .

<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're still dealing with this difficulty trying to game on Rainbow Six.

<p>I would say that if the previously posted troubleshooting did not help, that it might behoove you to try and contact
<a href="https://support.ubi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Ubisoft support
</a>directly and see if they have a little more insight on why this particular game is giving you grief.

    <title>How can I put a photo slideshow on shuffle&#63; Where are all the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronaldmaya  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I put a photo slideshow on shuffle&#63; Where are all the slideshow options&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just recently bought a new Dell laptop and it has Windows 10. How can I view my photos in a slideshow in shuffle mode? On my old laptop, I was easily able to put the photo slideshow on shuffle by simply right clicking
 during the slideshow and turning shuffle on.&nbsp; The old photo slideshow seemed to have way more options. By simply right clicking, I was able to turn on/off shuffle, adjust the slideshow speed (slow, medium, and fast), pause the slideshow, turn on/off slideshow
 loop, etc. Why would they remove these basic features? Is there anyway to do any of those things now? I've tried using the "Photos" app as well, and don't see any of those options there either, even in settings. Please help. Also, in the old photo slideshow,
 the pics would stretch out and fit the entire full screen. Now they do not. I miss the old slideshow options so much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an example of what I mean by slideshow options:</p>

<br />Scroll down, click Screen saver settings
<br />Click in the list box, choose Photos

<br />Thats about it. A lot of older desktop functionality in Windows 10 is being phased out.

<h2>            Child&#39;s acocunt set up - outside of the USA</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I do not live in the USA. I am trying to finalise the set up of my child's microsoft account.</p>
<p>Each time he logs in to Microsoft, he has a prompt window asking to pay for the Child Security fee.</p>
<p>However, this is requested only for parents who are&nbsp;US-based.</p>
<p>I even tried to pay for the fees but the credit card page is set to the US.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm blocked: my son cannot use his "safe" account and I cannot pay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm considering setting him up as a normal account and manage the security outside the Microsoft range of products</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent 2 weeks on this, called support twice, discussed on the chat boxes many times and no one seems to understand the issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea before I remove all these set-ups?</p>
<p>Sorry, there is no proper category to post this message</p>

<p>"I do not live in the USA. I am trying to finalise the set up of my child's microsoft account.</p>

<p>I even tried to pay for the fees but the credit card page is set to the US.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm blocked: my son cannot use his "safe" account and I cannot pay."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Above you indicate that "the credit card page is set to the US", which implies that the credit card information for your own Microsoft account and so that account itself may have been created in the US.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following is the description of the purpose behind this charge as it relates to US customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10502/microsoft-account-why-charge-to-create-child-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Why does Microsoft charge me when I create an account for my child?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>"Microsoft and Family Safety comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) regarding online account creation for children under the age of 13. To verify that an adult is giving a child permission to create a new Microsoft account, COPPA
 requires a small amount be charged to the adult's credit card. We charge 50&nbsp;cents for this verification. This charge isn't refundable."</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, searching a bit more I discovered the following articles at Microsoft and a 3rd-party lawyer's site discussing the &nbsp;<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/index_en.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">General
 Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),</span></a> which is a European privacy law affecting those in the EU.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.coppalawattorney.com/the-eu-to-adopt-coppa-framework-in-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The EU To Adopt COPPA Framework in 2016</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Privacy/gdpr/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Trust Center&nbsp; General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Though the articles themselves touch on different elements of the GDPR and indicate different dates (2016 and 2018) when it takes effect, The Article 8 section discussed at the first URL above covers the GDPR equivalent to the US COPPA regulations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'd assume that Microsoft has simply started performing the same age verification in the EU as in the US in order to be in compliance with the GDPR once it truly takes effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your specific problem, I'd first try to confirm that your own Microsoft account is truly set up properly in the country in which you reside.&nbsp; Then I'd make certain all of your Windows&nbsp;operating system&nbsp;language, regional and time zone&nbsp;settings are
 appropriate for that location as well, since&nbsp;both Windows and the Microsoft Account system are highly sensitive to these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all of this is correct, I'd confirm that the child's account is correctly set up in that same location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all of this seems correct, but the credit card payments page still switches to the US, try manually changing this to the correct&nbsp;language-country combination&nbsp;(for example:&nbsp;en-gb for UK) and see if it holds, since this is typically&nbsp;selected based on the
 Windows settings I mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason it's difficult to find a proper forum to discuss this is that the Microsoft account information is spread across the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/products/microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MS account help</a> page,&nbsp;as well as the individual product support for Windows and each of the individual applications and products like Email, OneDrive, Skype, Windows Store and others that require their use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember, it's your original adult account that the prompt is trying to verify, while the action of creating the child's account is simply what's generating the request.</p>

<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I literally spent 5 hours with the Microsoft services yesterday trying to fix this. Staff in India (I assume) were good trying to understand the issue, but then the chat stopped, I had to start again, got some calls etc... I ended
 up talking to a lady based in the US from the Outlook team apparently. She was extremely impolite, just following her guide and not listening to my answers. She even ignored me many times for 2 to 3 minutes and I ended up leaving the call after an hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However during this process, I've been told I have to create a new account for my son. So I ended up creating a new email address in outlook (previous was a Gmail address).</p>
<p>We checked many times before with the different people that all my settings were right (ie correct location). For information, I have not entered credit card information in my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>So I had to create a new email address for my son, and re-invited him in the family.</p>
<p>All is good now. It means settings on the computer and parent account were ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still don't understand why this time I have no problem using this Outlook account, as I did exactly the same when inviting his Gmail account. At no time you have to mention the child's location when you invite a new member of the family. The only difference
 here is the email account used for the Microsoft account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have to wait some time (how long?)&nbsp; for the Microsoft account using Gmail to be inactive and deleted from your system so I can try using it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other people have the same issue as per this thread:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/verify-childs-account-not-in-the-us-cannot-use-us/b2198a4b-fc6e-44ec-b20f-5d7871c646b5?auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/</a><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>There must be a way to access a child's account without having to pay for these fees, so we can change the settings. I could have then changed the location and keep using the same Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can imagine this has been a very frustrating day, one of which you wish you'd listened to your friends and go for Apple products...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck fixing this,</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Caroline</p>

<p>Caroline,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not my system and I don't work for Microsoft, I just provide volunteer answers to questions here, while I am a US based consumer PC owner&nbsp;just just like you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that you've mentioned the Google account, that's a potential issue that I would personally avoid like the plague.&nbsp; As with your mention of Apple, mixing the products from different manufacturers simply leads to potential technical issues and confusion,
 so I've personally never used a GMail account of any sort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't really say where your problem might have originated, but as someone who has managed business networks for various organizations in the past, my motto is to keep things simple and not to mix the software, accounts and other products from&nbsp;such different
 developers unless absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Thank you Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I thought you were a Microsoft rep.</p>
<p>This all makes sense not mixing the systems. But the reality is that people will use Ms products with whatever account they have created years ago.</p>
<p>So if that is the reason for the problem, MS will have to make the users aware of the potential issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm happy it's fixed now and I hope I won't have to use the helpline anytime soon!</p>

            <p>You are probably referring to TaskSchedulerHelper.dll and to an error message that pops up (when you start your computer? some other time?).&nbsp; Correct spelling and complete error messages will increase your chances of getting accurate help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a Windows file.&nbsp; It apparently part of Auslogics BoostSpeed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You likely have uninstalled Auslogics BoostSpeed (which was a good decision), but there is a registry entry left over that is attempting to run the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download Autoruns from&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a> (or
 run it live from the same site)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the Autoruns scan is complete, press CTRL+F and search for Auslogics.&nbsp; Do another search for TaskSchedulerHelper.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>For each line found with either of those entries, UNcheck the box at the left end of the line Unchecking the box is safer than deleting the entry.&nbsp; If you have a problem, you can re-run Autoruns and re-check the box; if after a day or so you decide that
 there have been no problems created by unchecking the box(es), re-run Autoruns and delete the lines that contain Auslogics or TaskSchedulerHelper.dll</p>

<h2>            Can MS Paint be loaded without the 3D part&#63;</h2>

<br />"Percentage" allows you to resize your image as a percentage of the original size. "Pixels" allows you to select an exact size.

<p>
</p><p>I can go on my antiquated 2006ish classified desktop running Win 7, open Paint and play with a 5+ MB PNG or TIFF file, close it and reopen it.&nbsp; Just did it 5 minutes ago.</p>

</p><p>What I can't do on my antiquated classified machine is sit on my couch &amp; watch reruns while I do mind-numbing electronic coloring.&nbsp; I also can't take anything off the machine and put it in an unclass document.</p>

<h2>            User profile deleted&#47;overwritten but files still on the computer - how can I access them or restore the profile&#63;</h2>
                    A virus deleted my profile - but I think it may have actually overwritten/fully deleted it because I cannot see my old profile in the SID list. Also I have gone into c:/documents and settings but I cannot see my old profile when I tell windows explorer
 to show hidden files etc.<br />
<br />
However, when I do a scan with malwarebytes, I can see that my old files are still on the computer, because the programme is scanning them. I just can't get into the profile.<br />
<br />
What can I do to restore the deleted profile or access my old documents?<br />

<h2>            Sticky Keys turn on every time I lock or start my computer &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm sure that this has been asked a thousand times, but thus far no solution has worked. As the question states, my Windows 10 computer activates sticky keys every time the computer has been locked or started, and it is a nuisance. I have tried the following
 methods to no avail:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>1. Type "<strong>Control Panel</strong>" without the quotes&nbsp;in search box next to&nbsp;<strong>Start Menu</strong>&nbsp;and click on it.</p>
<p>2. Click on&nbsp;<strong>Ease of&nbsp;Access</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Click on&nbsp;<strong>Ease of Access Center</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Click on<strong>&nbsp;Make the Keyboard easier to use</strong>.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Uncheck on&nbsp;<strong>Turn on Stickey Keys&nbsp;</strong>and also uncheck on&nbsp;<strong>Turn on Filter Keys</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Open a new window for 'Ease of Access' and look for a shortcut named 'log on settings'. You will find it to the upper left corner of the window, right under the folder destination and the file/edit/view/tools
 menu(s). Deselect options marked 'After Startup'</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Both of these options disable sticky keys until the computer is locked or turned off, at which point sticky keys reactivates</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If some settings on your computer are not retained or applied into effect, it's possible that there is an issue regarding system files. It will be helpful if you run the System File Checker tool to check for missing or corrupted system files. Follow the
 instructions here to run the suggested tool.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for replying back.</span></p>
<p><span>Have you followed the clean boot procedure?</span></p>
<p><span>Were you able to fix the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to uninstall Nero before performing clean boot. The file type you have mentioned is related to Nero product.</span></p>
<p><span>1.Open Programs and Features by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Programs, and then clicking Programs and Features.
</span></p>
<p><span>2.Select a program, and then click Uninstall. Some programs include the option to change or repair the program in addition to uninstalling it. but many simply offer the option to uninstall. To change a program,
 click Change or Repair.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><em>Uninstall or change a program</em></strong><br />

<p>Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library</p>
<p>Runtime Error!</p>
<p>Program: C:\WINDOWS\System32\spoolsv.exe</p>
<p>This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.<br />
Please contact the application's support team for more information</p>
<p>I'm running Vista Home Premium, 64bit, SP2 on a Toshiba Satellite P305 Laptop with 4GB RAM</p>
<p>I don't know if this might cause "Windows not responding" errors.&nbsp; I've already tried to correct this error with advice from this forum.&nbsp; I have determined that this error is caused by my
<strong>Conexant </strong>driver.&nbsp; I cannot update this driver because the company that made it is no longer supporting it.&nbsp; My laptop is only 2 years old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW I MIGHT BE ABLE TO UPDATE THIS CONEXANT DRIVER?</strong></p>

<p><span><span>I would suggest you to follow these steps and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong><span><br />
<span>Try booting the computer in safe mode and check if you get the same error message, here is the link:<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong><span><br />
<span>Try performing clean boot and check if it helps, here is the link:<br />
</span></span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span><span><br />
</span><span><span>Make sure that you put back the computer to normal startup mode once it is done.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 3:</strong></span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span>You could also try this below</span></p>
<p><span>a. Start, run type services.msc, OK.<br />
b. Go down the list and click on print spooler and on the left, click stop service.<br />
c. Close everything and restart computer.<br />
d. On restart, it should detect printer and when it ask to install from a specific location, say no.<br />
e. Let windows automatically install drivers for the printer.</span></p>

                    I am experiencing a lengthy auto update (4/26/2016) at a hotel. This is taking a long time and is copying files. It says "Your PC will restart several times". I am worried about a hacker is this legit?

<p>
</p><p>J'ai un soucis lorsque j'essaye de rejoindre un club dans lequel on m'a invité. La problématique c'est que d'après l'application Xbox Live sur PC, elle me dit que je suis déjà dans un trop grand nombre de clubs. Or je ne suis dans aucun.. C'est donc compliqué
 pour moi d'en quitter un ! </p>
<p>
</p><p>J'ai essayé de voir les paramètres de confidentialité etc mais je ne trouve rien qui pourrait causer un problème.

<p>Hi JoFZM,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. If there are still issues given by the account, it may be good to test a dummy account out to make sure it isn't the device/network causing the issue. The easiest way to do so would be by creating an account on the
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Account
</a>website, and then signing into it on the Xbox application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how this goes, thanks again.</p>

<h2>            Can not create a new folder in windows explorer</h2>
                    <p>I found several discussions regarding this subject but do not understand some of the possible solutions and suggestions..</p>
<p>To my knowledge I have added no software to my stand alone Desktop machine. I have 2 users on this machine user X and user Y. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I can create a directory/folder through the command processor. </p>
<p>When I click the create folder button nothing happens. No error or comments. When I do a right click on the create folder button nothing happens.</p>
<p>I have 2 questions: what did I do to kill the create folder feature and how do I correct the problem?</p>
<p>I am very freightened about messing with the Registry because I am ignorant about what it does...</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your assistance.</p>

    <title>Major Hulu Plus issues on 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> foreverfornow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Major Hulu Plus issues on 360</h2>
                    
<p>So after a week of having major issues with playback, buffering, screen tearing, and a/v sync, I deleted my hulu plus app in hopes that reinstalling it would help. Instead, I got to watch my 360 fail to download it a dozen times, and now I can't even find
 the app on the app store on XBL from my 360. Does anybody know what's going on here? Because I've been trying to chat or contact MS via the XBL site, and all the enter name fields are grayed out, and even after ensuring all my billing and profile info is accurate,
 it still won't let me enter that, or chat, or any of the contact options via computer, and I'm starting to get really irritated.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I had similar problems, followed the troubleshooter and now the app is missing. I called support and they said it is a Hulu issue and gave me the number to Hulu support. I called them and they said they thought it is a Xbox issue, but they are looking into
 it. I hope they get this fixed soon or I will have to reconsider continuing to pay for a gold membership.</p>

<p>The app has reappeared, but there is still an issue with the video being choppy and lagging. Clearing the cache does not help. I have great upload and download speeds with my isp and MS tv and movies work perfectly. It's just the Hulu app. Hulu customer
 service has only responded with a generic email with a copy of the online tutorial on how to set up the app.

            <p>Hey RulyDesert71478,</p>
<p>I'm glad to hear that the app is reappearing for you! Regarding the issue with the Hulu app lagging, have you already restarted your router? If not, all you would need to do is unplug the power cable to the router for 15-20 seconds and plug it back in. </p>
<p>Let us know if this has helped any. :) </p>

            <p>Mine came up with an error saying it cannot communicate with the Hard Drive. &nbsp;The Hard Drive is on and working. &nbsp;I disconnected every drive and usb (except mouse/keyboard) and it still says it cannot communicate. &nbsp;This is likely my Hard Drive saying "bye
 bye" but I need to boot so I can move files off my second drive and install Windows on it. &nbsp;However. &nbsp;I upgraded online and did not get an installation disc or have the brains to create a repair usb drive. &nbsp;Any help / suggestions would be appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p><span>Hi Johnny,</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></li><li><span>Which version of Windows is installed on the computer?
</span></li><li><span>When exactly do you get this error message?</span></li><li><span>Were there any recent changes made on the computer prior to the issue?&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check if the hard drive is detected in the BIOS or not.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer
 from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it is detected, make sure it is set as first boot device in the boot priority.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please get back to us with the above information to assist you further.</span></p>

            <p>1. Custom Build</p>
<p>2. Windows 8.1</p>
<p>3. Started Monday (yesterday) afternoon after a restart for Windows Updates</p>
<p>4. It was off for a week while I was on vacation, it started up perfect Sunday afternoon. &nbsp;Then I had it install updates and restart Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Hard Drive is shown in the BIOS and boot sequence is correct</p>
<p>
</p><p>It shows 'Loading Operating System' then goes to blank screen for a while before showing an error that it cannot communicate with the Hard Drive.</p>
