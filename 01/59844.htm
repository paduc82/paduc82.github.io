<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you get <b>any error message</b> as well? If yes, then
<b>when</b> do you get the <b>error message</b>?</span></p>
<p><span>2) Have you made <b>any changes</b> on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>I would like more information regarding the issue.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1-</span></b></p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Step1-</b></span></p>
<p><span><br />
Try logging into <b>Safe Mode</b>. Check if the issue persists over there.<br />
To do so, you may refer the article-</span></p>
<p><b><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/boot_failsafe.mspx?mfr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><br />

</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Make sure you log back into <b>Normal Mode</b> after following all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue does not persist in <b>Safe</b> <b>Mode</b>, then proceed to
<b>Step 2</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2-</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>I would recommend you to perform <b>Clean Boot</b>.<br />
Putting your system in <b>Clean Boot state</b> helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article to perform a
<b>Clean Boot</b>-</span></p>

<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: You need to configure the computer back to <b>
Normal Startup</b> after performing all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2-</span></b></p>
<p><span><br />
You need to perform a <b>System Restore</b> to undo the changes made on your computer.<br />

            I have some scant notes having only read about this issue in another forum (never actually seen it).<br />
<br />
Do you have any Norton/Symantec product installed and if so, which one(s)?<br />
<br />
Tell us a little more about your system:<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum implementation does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and
 agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />

            <p>I don't have any Norton or Symantec software installed. I have a Dell Lattitude D610 with XP Professional Version 2002, Service Pack 3.</p>
<p>For Security I simply use MS Security Essentials. Since it is my daughters laptop the security essentials may not have been current. I'm not really sure what happened before it crashed. All I get is "I don't know what happened".</p>
<p>She spends alot of time on the internet playing so it's almost impossible to say what might have caused it.</p>
<p>Computer Corps removed a virus for me and charged me $75 only to get it back and have the exact same problem. They thought they would probably replace the hard-drive now (no charge). Dell Tech support wanted me to reinstall my OS but I don't have time. Gotta
 give Computer Corps a chance to make good on their failed service since there is no extra charge. ;)</p>

            That sounds good (and nice of them) - make sure they transfer any personal files (documents, pictures, music, etc.) to you new HDD.&nbsp; I don't think there is anything wrong with your HDD, so they should be able to backup/restore your personal stuff to your

    <title>PC HDMI TO Edison 3D TV - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathane200  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC HDMI TO Edison 3D TV</h2>
                    <p>ok, I didn't have an issue with this before. I connect my pc (Acer Windows 10) to a 3D Edison TV so I can watch 2D and 3D content on my TV from my PC. Just recently my TV is saying "No Signal". Generally it will pick up Edison 3D the same as you connected
 your PC to a 3D TV. I have Intel HD Graphics. It's really odd because the HDMI has always received a signal to the TV (Even through Edison. Please, help me find a way for the TV to pick up the PC signal through HDMI again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank-You</p>

            Hello, I see that you are having some trouble connecting the PC to your TV. Can you try and make sure that the input mode for your TV is correct? For example, if the PC is connected via HDMI into port 1, make sure to change the input mode to port 1. If this is correct, you may have to change the settings on your PC. Login to Windows, then hold the Windows key and the "P" key together and cycle through and select Duplicate. If this still does not work, your display driver may need an update. Go to the Intel website, and download the latest driver for your hardware.
<br />Hope this helps, and let me know if you have further issues! :-)

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>It is stuck in PC screen only. My dtive is up to date. If I hook HDMI to tv directly it will work. It’s not working through Edison 3D (it did before)</p>

            Hello! If plugging it in directly to the TV works, there is a communication problem between either the PC and the hardware itself, or the connection between the hardware and the TV. If there is a software or an installation disk for your Edison 3D hardware, try installing that. The Edison 3D hardware may have to be updated. Try checking if the hardware has a new update. Contacting the Edison 3D manufacturer may help you troubleshoot with the device itself. 
<br />Hope this helps, and let me know anytime if you are in need of assistance!

<p>Hey Buddy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all thanks for your answers. So, I decided to do something really crazy. I reset my system to factory settings. This worked! I said to myself Edison 3D worked yesterday with the TV, and not today??? Anyways must have been something different with
 update that prvented a HDMI connection to your 3DEdison TV. I send you a pic 🙃</p>

<h3> mikepemberton41  say:</h3>
<h2>            Certificate error and &#39;problem retrieving messages&#39; using pop.att.yahoo.com</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Windows 10 Windows Live email for several weeks on my new Dell desktop computer. &nbsp;Starting two days ago, every time I open Windows Live, I get an internet security warning window pop-up that says: "the server you are connected to is using
 a security certificate that could not be verified" "Do you want to continue using the server?" &nbsp;If I click "Yes", I start receiving messages, but quite often I get another error message showing a server error code 0x800CCC90 - "problem retrieving message"
 and "unable to send or receive messages for the Att (cmpember) acct". &nbsp;I have changed nothing since the initial email setup, and everything had been working fine to this point. &nbsp;I can eventually get all my emails by closing and re-opening Windows Live, but
 sometimes it takes two to three tries to get all emails downloaded. &nbsp;My email servers are the standard pop.att.yahoo.com and smtp.att.yahoo.com. &nbsp;I have called At&amp;t, and they say the security certificate issue can be fixed either by MS or Yahoo. &nbsp;I have no
 problem getting my email from the yahoo website.</p>

            I no longer get the query re the server security certificate, but I can no longer get all my emails in one download. &nbsp;I have to hit send/receive several times to complete the download. &nbsp;Each time I get the error message that I can't send or receive messages
 from my mail account, and that a message can't be retrieved. &nbsp;This is very annoying, to say the least. &nbsp;Would really appreciate help here.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's always a good idea to quote the error message verbatim, because it usually contains clues to what's wrong. I'm going to guess that the error message you're seeing contains a line reading
<em>Server Response: -ERR [SYS/TEMP] problem retrieving message</em>. If this is the case, then you can appreciate that this is a
<em><strong>temp</strong></em>orary <em><strong>sys</strong></em>tem error at the server, so there's nothing you can do about it in Windows Live Mail. This is not unusual with AT&amp;T Yahoo accounts, which are notoriously sensitive to minor corruptions in messages
 in the mailbox. To clear the fault, then,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Log in to the account in webmail and start by emptying the spam and trash folders.
<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Move all of the messages in the inbox to a user-created folder. <br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Once the inbox is empty, do send/receive for the account in Windows Live Mail. You should see a
<em>No new email messages</em> status message at the right-hand end of the status bar.
<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Move the oldest half of the messages in the temporary folder that haven't yet been downloaded back into the webmail inbox and again send/receive in Windows Live Mail.
<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Rinse and repeat, halving the number of messages moved each time until you can identify any message that is interfering with the POP3 download. Deal with it there.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS&nbsp; Because this is a problem at the <em>server </em>end, removing the account then adding it back again will only have the effect of permanently deleting all the account folders and all the messages in them, meaning that the entire contents of the account
 inbox will have to be re-downloaded.</p>

    <title>Windows DVD Maker and MP3 files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grandpa jim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows DVD Maker and MP3 files</h2>
                    <p>I've a frustrating situation with DVD Maker. The dropdown list of audio file types that can be used includes: *.wav;*.mp2;*.mp3;*.wma<br />
Nonetheless, if I include an .mp3 file I get "Cannot create preview." If I start the burn, after a few minutes it stops with "An error occurred," with no indication of the nature of the error.<br />
If I remove the .mp3, the preview and the burn proceed and produce a beautiful slideshow.<br />
Is this a "bug" in the Windows 7 DVD Maker? Could I just have some flawed .mp3s? [They were downloaded from Amazon.com and play in WMP with no problem.]<br />
I might add that .wma and .wav files do work with DVD Maker.</p>

            .MP3 files can be problematic and the best bet is <br />
to convert them to the .WMA format before importing <br />
into DVD Maker.<br />
<br />
There are many converters available on the net...<br />
the following freeware is just an example.<br />
<br />
***Proceed At Your Own Risk***<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Format Factory (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Format_Factory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Format_Factory</a><br />
(the 'direct link' is fastest)<br />
(the file you want to download is : &gt;FFSetup260.zip&lt;)<br />
(FWIW...when installing...you may want to uncheck<br />
'all' the boxes on the final screen)<br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7)<br />
<br />
First you will need to unzip the file or just open the<br />
folder and drag FFSetup260.exe out of the folder<br />
and drop it on your desktop. Left click it to install.<br />

<h2>            DLC Release time&#40;In general&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Just a quick question and theory I wanted to test. As we know DLC comes out daily or weekly in the Xbox Live Marketplace. My question is this, is there a set time that the DLC is released as with games. For example, does DLC have a midnight release as retail
 games. My reason behind this is to test a theory I had for the Gears of War 3 Horde Command Pack I plan on playing tonight after midnight if its released at that particular time. Including if the time is midnight, by what timezone does Microsoft work by. Any
 input is appreciative. Also refrain from posting responses that is irrelevant to the topic.</p>

    <title>Elite controller disconnects when wired, spins when wireless, now - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lazlow 619  say:</h3>
<h2>            Elite controller disconnects when wired, spins when wireless, now won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t turn on at all.</h2>
                    
<p>Bought a brand new xBox One Elite six days ago. &nbsp;The first four days everything was perfect, then the controller began to stop responding. &nbsp;The power light on the controller stayed on but it would get stuck with the last input; the character running in circles
 playing Black Ops III zombies. &nbsp;When this happened I would take the batteries out, then the game paused saying to connect the controller. &nbsp;Replace the batteries and it worked for about another five to ten minutes and then happen again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried using the micro USB cord and that worked for a day. &nbsp;Then it began disconnecting completely, as if it was unplugged, but it wasn't. &nbsp;Unplugging it and plugging it back in sometimes helps, sometimes doesn't. &nbsp;I tried a different micro USB cord, no
 change. &nbsp;Now when it happens the controller won't even turn on at all for several minutes,&nbsp;either wired or with batteries. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There's absolutely nothing different from now and the first four days when it worked. &nbsp;I tried every suggestion I found in the forums here (deleting blue ray Persistent Storage (even though never played a blue ray), plugging in directly to the wall vs surge
 protector, nothing else wifi nearby (though that shouldn't affect wired controller)). &nbsp;I don't have another controller to test with this xBox nor another xBox to test with this controller.</p>
<p>From the looks of this forum many people are experiencing the same problem since November with no solution from Microsoft. &nbsp;Please tell me I'm wrong. &nbsp;I really would rather everything work than have to return over $500 worth of gear.</p>

<p><span>Hey Lazlow! &nbsp;I've heard a lot of people with this problem as well, but I think we've found the solution. &nbsp;Give this a try, and let me know if it works for you, okay? &nbsp;If it does, we can make sure
 everyone knows to give it a try when they have the issue. &nbsp;:)</span><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span>1. Remove batteries from the controller</span></p>
<p><span>2. Plug the controller into the console with a USB cord</span></p>
<p><span>3. Hard reset the console (turn off, remove power source, turn back on)</span></p>
<p><span>4. While console is powering on, hit the bind button on the left side 3x</span></p>
<p><span>5. After the console is at the Dashboard, hit the bind button on the controller 3x.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Profit, because the controller should stay connected now. &nbsp;:) &nbsp;Put the batteries back in and go wireless.</span></p>

                    <p>In the last month I have noticed each time I go to type in a website address or type within a webpage text box (eg form) the browser will refresh itself and I have to re click on the box and type again.&nbsp; This is especially annoying when filling in a form,
 logging into to an account or copy and paste a webpage address.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this issue with both Edge and Chrome numerous times during the day.&nbsp; I have also found a couple times a day my browser will continually refresh and you can do anything but wait for it to stop.&nbsp; You are able to select anything and the open tabs flicker.&nbsp;
 If I close the browser down and reopen the same thing is happening, I have to wait a good 20 minutes for it to return to normal.&nbsp; During this time explore also refreshes and is unable to be used.</p>

            I am still having this issue and it seems to be affecting all programs now and happening more often. &nbsp;Does anyone know if there are any windows 10 updates that could have caused this issue? &nbsp;Or if it is possible to go back to windows 8?

<h2>            Desktop PC warning &#34;Low Battery - Plug Computer In&#34;</h2>
                    My desktop PC today decided to warn me several times that the battery is low and to plug the computer in.&nbsp; It is plugged in or it wouldn't be running.&nbsp; The battery icon in the system tray shows 100%.&nbsp; My PC is plugged into a UPS but the UPS power display
 is the same as it normally is.&nbsp; I've jiggled all the cable connections.&nbsp; Is this a bug or is something really wrong?&nbsp;

<p>Hi Jaime, </p>
<p>
</p><p>We would appreciate if you could provide more details about the issue. Kindly answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you perform any changes prior to the issue? </li><li>Have you tried updating the computer to the latest update? <br />
</li></ul>
<p>In the meantime, we recommend that you directly connect your desktop to the power source/outlet without using the UPS. This will help us identify the root cause of the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists after removing the UPS, we suggest running the hardware troubleshooter to further diagnose the issue. Kindly follow the steps below to perform it:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open<strong> Cortana</strong>, type <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li><li>Look for<strong> Find and fix other problems category.</strong></li><li>Under it, choose<strong> Hardware and Devices.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Run the troubleshooter </strong>button and follow the on-screen steps to run it.</li></ol>
<p>
Update us with the outcome so we provide further assistance.<br />

<h2>            SSD</h2>
                    <div>I use a laptop. I have a 240GB HD and a 2T SSD on it. The HD is the main drive, and I wanted to put the SSD as my main. I copied everything I had in HD and put in the SSD. I fixed the BIOS for the SSD start as the first boot option, but after I started
 it, I saw that in the files the HD still appears as the main drive (with the windows symbol on top of it ..). What do I do?</div>

<br />Open Disk Management (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of that Disk Management window
<br />
<br />2.
<br />When you say you moved everything from the HDD to the SSD - what method exactly did you use to do that?

            Hi Enzo_2000
<br />
<br />Thank you for the screenshot, everything looks good there . . .
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer, and Navigate to 'This PC'
<br />
<br />In the right hand pane, on the drive labels, is that where you are seeing that the HDD is still the Windows Drive?
<br />
<br />If so, that is just a labeling issue, you should be able to right click the HDD and rename it and then right click the SSD and rename it
<br />
<br />Either way, this is just a drive labeling issue, because your system is correctly configured . .

<br />
<br />Can you please check if you are actually booting form the SSD
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, then just type msconfig and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, choose the Boot tab
<br />
<br />What is the reported location of Windows 10?

<h2>            Unable to transfer files from phone via bluetooth</h2>
                    <p>I have a Samsung Ativ S phone (Windows Mobile 8) and want to transfer files from my phone to my laptop (Windows 8.1) via bluetooth. I'm able to pair my computer and phone, but then whenever I try to send files from my phone to my laptop, nothing happens.</p>
<p>When I click the devicename of my laptop on my phone, it connects for a brief moment (visible on both my phone and laptop), but then it disconnects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried sending files with two different phones to my laptop, in both cases it won't work.</p>
<p>Any clue on what could be the problem here?</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for your reply. Although the icon is there, there is no 'receive a file' option (I remember there being one in Win 7). Any more ideas?</p>

            <p>Thanks for another reply, but unfortunately this didn't bring back the option. I read in another forum post (http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/1c7fb03f-09e8-482e-a1ea-906006e061d9/bluetooth-send-receive-options-unavailable) about running "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Fsquirt",
 which indeed gave me the receive-file dialog.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Slightly different but basically the <em>same underlying </em>problem here: my HTC smartphone will connect easily with my bluetooth headphones AND a stereo system I have but there is simply no way at all&nbsp;I can get my laptop running Windows 8.1 ( completely
 up-to-date ) to connect via bluetooth with the same audio/headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded all the latest recommended&nbsp;drivers from Broadcomm and HP ( my laptop maker ) but no! Windows 8 refuses to connect so I can transmit files and data. True enough the laptop PAIRS quickly after locating the other bluetooth devices but it will
 NOT Connect whatever I do or try or adjust in settings and device manager and services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope ( but will not be really expecting ) that <em>Windows 10 </em>will address this puzzling and irritating issue. It is not a simple troubleshooting matter&nbsp;as such - it is more to do with basic software compatibility.&nbsp;Or even the antennae hardware inside
 a laptop - contrasted with the antennae inside my Android phone. But I'm only guessing of course and do not know. A mystery!</p>

            <p>Indeed a mystery.&nbsp; I have a basic flip-phone, which actually takes amazing photos, and I paired it to my sisters HTC smartphone.&nbsp; From there I simply attached her phone to my laptop using a USB cord and once my Dell recognized it the pictures could be transferred.&nbsp;
 For all of y'all reading this for the first time, I respect the efforts given by other members to direct you to a correct pathway, but their advice is simply rudimentary, at best.&nbsp; If you have Windows 8, or lower, don't waste your time trying to get Bluetooth
 to act correctly. </p>

<h3> davidlohmeier  say:</h3>
<h2>            How clean is a windows 10 clean install&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just went through two days of reading up on doing a Windows 10 "clean " reinstall from installation Media from THIS site (the reason was that after a system re-set my entire laptop was an explosion of every virus I've ever heard of.&nbsp; The reason for that:?
 AVAST, what else? After two days of preparing the disk and changing the settings on my laptop and backing everything up, and getting the g.d. Bitlocker key that i never wanted in the first place and product keys I did the reinstall - it went quickly and smoothly
 (that should have been warning sign number because nothing with this company goes smoothly anymore) I get aol new USB drives to use, double and triple check all of my settings and ..............not only do I have all the same sh*tware i had before, but it
 came in with a driver update virus that requires abouit 18 steps to get rid of.&nbsp; iI followed the instructions on the Microsoft site TO THE LETTER.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOW DID THIS HAPPEN MICROSOFT? As a mea culpa to the people who's lives you've made worse by forcing Windows 10 on them you should come up with qan operating system that fulfills the promise of your earlier days and give it to us for free. It's shameful.
 By the time I have to come to this site for whatever it is I feel like I've woken up in the middle of f a Kafka nightmare.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi DavidLohmeier, 
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear you are having these difficulties. 
<br />
<br />I would suggest running a Malwarebytes scan to clear out any malware - <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a>
<br />
<br />If this does not pick up anything, you can try AdwCleaner - <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/</a>
<br />
<br />If this doesn't pick anything up, but you are still seeing symptoms of malware, you can run ComboFix - <a href="https://combofix.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://combofix.org/</a>
<br />

<p>Depends where you downloaded the ISO file for the install or the download of the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And there is not a bunch of malware in a Windows installation or upgrade. I suggest to get rid of Avast and any other 3rd party virus program as Defender will protect you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this site does not provide the Windows installation media. This is a forum. Someone gave you a link to download the upgrade.

            The usually way to do a clean install would be to create installation media onto a DVD or USB device, boot from said drive &amp; install Windows choosing the delete everything &amp; cleaning the PC of all partitions &amp; allowing the install to create new partitions.
<br />As you had/have malware I suggest creating the media on a non infected PC.
<br />If this isn’t possible Try running these programs:
<br />MBAM free: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />Eset online scanner:  <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/</a>
<br />Adwcleaner:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/</a>
<br />
<br />If these do not fully remove the virus/malware then it will be wise to register with a malware removal site to receive dedicated malware removal instructions, an expert will remain with you throughout the process until confirmation that your PC is 100% clean.

<p>Thank you for replying (as well as getting all the way through my rant.)&nbsp; As you your suggestions: -&nbsp;<em>did

</p><p>My issue was more abouit the way I got this stuff to begin with. I'm always very, very careful with 3rd party downloads because I've been through this before. Somehow I got a copy of Avast and could not get rid of it. Avast seems impervious to any efforts
 to be rid of it. Soirt of like cockroaches.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for replying and gettin through my rant..</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I said I'd gotten the installation media on&nbsp; on THIS site I meant Microsoft's site, or the site that every article about doing a clean install links to - in fact I've had problems with this media in the past so looked for a day to find an alternative
 and finally gave up and decided to use the Installation Media offered by the site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This lap was loaded with a clean copy of Windows ten three months ago and I did a system shot and established a restore point which wasn't there when I wanted to go back to it. (This was done by a tech at Dell (it's an XPS) and cost a small fortune. at the
 time. they haven't responded to my ticket yet. (hmm) When I did a system reset t from inside Windows 10, I got a version with all the crapware and viruses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the media installation tool on a PC that has ONLY ever had a clean copy of&nbsp; Windows 10 and got another Windows 10 filled with crapware. It must have done something because all of the settings I'd applied between the first reset and the total
 reinstall were gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where I'm not understanding what's going on. Dell is partly to blame as well because just about every DIY I find online to try to fix this problem ahs special provisions for Dell who seem to randomly change hardware even within their own product
 lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm probably going to end up going through and deleting all these apps manually, those that I can because I can't afford to have this device out of operation much longer. I keep nothing at I store everything on external storage for both desktop and and laptop,
 both of which have 1T drives which are for the most part empty. I download only that 3rd party software I HAVE to and am very careful to avoid bundling and don't download anything off otherwise "sketchy" sites. THAT;'s where I'm having the problem. (Because
 I had fewer problems when I WAS guilty of committing the aforementioned PC Sins.) 😆 I don't get it. (Also, I';ve always used Windows Defender since it's the only one e that doesn't have a pop up sales pitch&nbsp; every five minutes. )&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sitting here starting at a blank screen wondering what to try next and coming up and blank as the screen I'm staring at.</p>

<p>Time Lady, thanks for responding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you describe is exactly the way I performed the reinstall. I did the installation media FROM a machine that had a brand new hard drive and a clean copy of Windows 10 from the very start UEFI Secure Boot Off - partitions deleted and UEFI reformatted
 - it never had any crapware on it. There was also a restore point established at that point - approx four months ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was installed that ONTO a Dell XPS -13 laptop that had had a clean Windows 10 installation and a system restore point point established by Dell tech who did both (and I double checked the restore point myself) about three months ago. (When I tried to
 do a system restore,&nbsp; several days before this, that wasn't even an option I was presented with. The device only presented two potions - refresh (which I didn't think would be sufficient to get rid of Avast which is what started all this) ) or re-set (with
 or without keeping files - I chose without, though I was concerned that I "factory" settings meant DELL's original "bloated" factory settings, which it did. Meaning essentially I spent a lot of money to avoid getting right to the spot I seem to have gotten
 to anyway - the minute I saw Kandy Mind Crush (or whatever it is) I knew the reset had failed. ) Then bing exploded with the "Web Discover" virus which prevented any kind of movement on the internet. That's when I decided to do the reinstall, which went about
 the same way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the (not so clean) install I had to repartition the&nbsp; SDD (a dell thing, I think, switching t6o UEFI from Legacy) which I I hesitated about but everything I read said it was a good thing to do. (Of course once done, everything I read pointed in the
 other direction.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ditto with the reinstall. Money is an issue here but I never cut corners on stuff like this and would rather wait for software that I can pay for rather than risk the free stuff, because I've been through this before and know that you can either spend a
 little upfront or pay THROUGH the back end IN the back end (as it were😎 ) because of stuff like this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for going on like this but this is typical of the problems I seem to be getting led into with the OS, these are things I NEVER went through with XP, or 7 or 8.1.. I just&nbsp; want to get back to me bloatware free system without having to go back
 to a Dell tech (or any tech) and pay $300 to do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(And I've always used Windows Defender.)&nbsp;</p>

            Did you create the media on the pc same PC which you clean installed?
<br />I’m wondering if the suspected virus has transferred to the USB.
<br />There’s also if you had sync active then the PC settings will have been synced back to the fresh install so that may explain why some things returned like candy crush.
<br />Also major Windows updates will remove all previous system restore points.
<br />A clean install &amp; deleting all the partitions should’ve removed the Dell recovery partition.
<br />Here’s some more in-depth instructions for clean installing Windows:

<p>Hi, thank you (again) for responding (again.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hard drive on the machine the media installation was created on only ever had a copy of Windows that was installed from a copy of&nbsp; Windows 10 purchased retail (on USB) retail. The USB was misplaced or lost (of course) but I still have the product key)
 . I did not know updates overwrote&nbsp; system restore points. Which makes me wonder why set them in the first place.Or maybe I'm misunderstanding something. I'll try the last clean install instructions. I'll check ouit the site you recommend . Thanks again'</p>

            I just checked the instruction link and that's the one I followed when I did this. I'm wondering if reformatting the drive from within the program could have made a difference. I researched it before I did it and it didn't appear that it would be. I'm
 still stumped and not sure what to do abouit this at this point.&nbsp;

            Hi Sguerra,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I’m sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. I understand that your files, favorites and desktop icons are missing after rebooting your Windows 10 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you restart the computer once or twice again and check if the missing files are restored.
</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> You need to go to your user account to check and see if the “<strong>Favorites</strong>” are present in the default folder.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do so, follow these steps.<br />
1.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows Key + E</strong> to open File explorer.<br />
2.&nbsp;Select the “C drive” and then select “<strong>Users</strong>”.<br />
3.&nbsp;Now select your User Profile and click on “<strong>Favorites</strong>”.<br />
4.&nbsp;Check if all your websites are present in the “Favorites” folder.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong> Refer to the suggestion by Jayant Gupta&nbsp;from the following link.</div>
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie11-windows_7/lost-favorites-in-ie-11/c302f6ba-e129-4816-be49-fa060e53bcc5"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie11-windows_7/lost-favorites-in-ie-11/c302f6ba-e129-4816-be49-fa060e53bcc5</span></a></div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persist, I would suggest that you perform a <strong>SFC scan</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> System File checker (SFC) scan is done to check if there are any corrupted system files that could be causing this issue.
</p>
<p><span>1.</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>Press </span><strong><span>Windows key + X.
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>2.</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>Select </span><strong><span>Command Prompt(Admin).</span></strong></p>
<p><span>3.</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>Type </span><strong><span>SFC / scannow
</span></strong><span>and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><br />
Hope this helps you. Keep us posted with the status of issue. We’ll be glad to assist if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Anand,<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you made any recent changes on your computer?<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the make and model of your computer?<br />
3. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What is the exact and complete error message you get when you try to open Bluestacks?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to follow these methods and check.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> <strong>Try to install the app in Windows 7 compatibility mode.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>There is no information regarding the compatibility of bluestack with Windows 8. You can go through the link for your reference.
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=BlueStacks&amp;vendor=BlueStacks&amp;Locale=1033&amp;ModelOrVersion=0&amp;BreadCrumbPath=Bluestacks&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=win8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to install in Compatibility mode:</span></p>
<span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click the app set up file and select Properties then tap or click the Compatibility tab.<br />
</span><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check the Run this program in compatibility mode for box. </span>
<span><br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap or click the drop down box and select a previous operating system, then tap or click OK.</span>
<br />
<br />
<p><strong><span>Reference:</span></strong><span> <strong>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</a></span><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<strong>Method 2:</strong> <strong>Update Graphics card drivers</strong><br />
Follow these steps to update graphics drivers.<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press <strong>Windows key+X</strong> and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Search for <strong>Display Adapters</strong> and expand it.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on the <strong>graphic card driver </strong>and select <strong>
Update driver software.</strong></span><br />
</p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. For further queries feel free to come back.</span></p>

            Hi, First uninstall it and looking at C / ProgramData Bluestack's folders and delete them manually because surely if you uninstall it, you will remain those folders.&nbsp;Before installing, make a cleaning of your PC with a program that you use like Ccleaner
 or something similar. &nbsp;Now, go to install again, and before using it, you go to the icon with the right mouse button you hit and in the window that opens up you go to the tab compatability and spades in the box to always run as administrator for all users.&nbsp;With
 all this you should work without problem. It is simply to do a clean install and run as Administrator.

 name and click save then I get the message that the test page failed to print.&nbsp; This happens on both PDF and XPS printers.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 How to set up a Child&#39;s user account</h2>
                    I have just upgraded to Windows 10. I go to control panel, click on user accounts, under family and other users I click add family member. I choose add child, then next. It says, in red, to enter an email address. I click on 'the person I want to add doesn't
 have an email address'. Then it prompts me to create one. I am NOT getting my 8 year old an email address. Is there any way around this?

            I agree.&nbsp; I do not want to get an email address for a young child.&nbsp; It is just another thing full of junk I would have to review.&nbsp; There needs to be another solution.

            Family settings is a joke! I created emails and paid the $.50, and as soon as my kids log into their account, the option is right there for them to create a local log in. Now they're in and I'm locked out. WHAT A JOKE Microsoft!!!

<h2>            Error code8004808a</h2>
                    <p>So starting from last night I started getting this every single time I tried to save a pdf file regardless if I was editing it in Edge or Reader and this hasn't been a problem before and was wondering just whats going on as it's annoying being I use these
 pdf's as digital backup copies of character sheets in D&amp;D for my group. (In case of loss, damage forgetting it etc.)</p>

<p>Hi Jonka,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me to properly assist you with this error that you received when saving a pdf file, I would like to ask the following information to help sort out the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Before this error appeared, were there any changes or updates performed on your PC?</li><li>Aside from Edge and Reader, have you tried editing a pdf file using a different browser? Did you get the same error message?</li><li>What PDF reader are you using.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, was there any description included on the error code? If yes, please take a screenshot and share it with us so we can look into it.</p>

<p>Hey Jonka,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a similar problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might be able to solve your problem by selecting 'print' and then selecting 'print to pdf' instead.&nbsp;</p>

            I'm trying to apply to a job. Same thing happened to me. Spend an hour filling out an application, carefully adding all the damn dates, blah blah. Finally I finished, tried to save as- same error code. Couldn't do crap with it. Couldn't save as a PDF,
 couldn't print, WTF? I spend 2 grand on a new Dell with Windows 10 and I can't even print a damn PDF. I'm so freaking frustrated I could SCREAM!!! I am computer literate. I've tried everything. Even communities and still can't even save a GD application to
 PDF. I could lose this job because I look like a complete idiot!!! "This chick is applying for a corporate job - she has a degree and she can't even save a PDF".&nbsp; Lost THAT $80,000 job. Thanks a LOT Microsoft!&nbsp; Losers.&nbsp; Why do you have to change up your crap
 every year - to make more money? Why don't you just leave things the way they were? You are not making our lives any easier!!!!!!

<h2>            Why does my network manager show 2 networks&#63;</h2>
                    One says its connected through lan, which I think is the correct one, but the other one says virtualbox host only network. see photo: http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f252/flynt169/network.jpg<br />
I only have the one network that I am aware of. What is this second one?

            When you install VirtualBox, it automatically creates the VirtualBox Host-Only Network connection.&nbsp; To give virtual machines access to your LAN,

create a network bridge</a> between that connection and the LAN connection.&nbsp;
