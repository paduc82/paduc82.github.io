            <p>I have used a "Retail" DVD and installed then activated with an OEM key without problems on several occasions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(Windows 7 Professional 32/64-Bit)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Download the Windows 7 Professional 32 or 64-Bit .ISO and follow the instructions below to create your own installation DVD. You will still use the product key you obtained but the DVD will be created from the .ISO file you download.</p>
<p>32-Bit Digital River: <a href="http://msft-dnl.digitalrivercontent.net/msvista/pub/X15-65804/X15-65804.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/index.htm</a></p>
<p>For Windows .ISO file just place check marks in the SHA1 and&nbsp; CRC32 boxes. In the main HashCalc Window the 'Data format' box located in the upper left should be set to "File"</p>
<p>In the 'Data' field click on the&nbsp; ... box located in the upper right and then click 'Cancel' if you get an 'Insert Disk' window pop up. After you click cancle you should see a 'Find' window. Use this to navigate to the folder where your .ISO file is stored
 and click on the file.You should now see the .ISO file you clicked on listed in the 'File name' box located near the bottom of the 'Find' window. Now click the 'Open' button. The Data field should now show the directory/folder path and the name of the .ISO
 file you selected.</p>
<p>With only the SHA1 and CRC32 boxes checked (Do not place check marks in any other boxes as this can slow down the time it take to calculate the values) click the 'Calculate' button located at the bottom of the main HashCalc window.</p>
<p>It will take anywhere from 30 to 60 seconds for the calculation to complete and the SHA1 and CRC32 data values to be displayed.</p>
<p><strong>These values are not case sensitive</strong>, so a lower case 'a' is the same as an upper case 'A' as far as the results are concerned. However they should match those I've posted below.</p>

            <p>If the laptop came preinstalled with Windows 7 Professional, that means its a OEM license. OEM licenses are not transferrable and they are tied to the first computer they are installed.</p>
<p>If its a retail store bought license, it is transferrable to another computer. Retail licenses include documentation, certificate of authentication and reinstallation media, which you should have if you want to transfer it to another computer. You don't
 seem to have these things, which would make it impossible to transfer the license to another computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If its a Windows 7 Professional upgrade license, the computer you are transferring it must already have a preinstalled Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7 license.
</p>
<p>The requirements for upgrade media though is that you have a previously qualifying operating system such as Windows XP or Vista installed to use it. From the Windows 7 End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One possible work around:</p>
<p>Download the ISO Image of Windows 7<br />
Windows 7 Professional x64 (64-bit)</p>

<h2>            I still can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t let it go of my past gaming... Xbox 360.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. I was a Fair Gamer like many of you Xbox Members.. But sadly I made the stupid mistake in my past which I still can't let it go... I cheated by using a file from the Internet Explorer but the bad news for me is that I only wanted the Save File...
 NOT AN ACHIEVEMENT IN Assassin's Creed 3.. Now My Gamer status is ruined.. I am sure there are players who doesn't care (I think I got one friend who did use a save file to unlock all the achievements in Call of Duty World at War.) that they cheat... But I
 am sure as hell did not wanted to cheat.. But somehow I was brought into it... Before The Worse Assassin's Creed 3 Cheat , I also had someone increase my COD Rank to max rank and Max Prestige in Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare, Call of Duty World at War, Call
 of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty Black Ops 1... And yes I know that is also cheating.. But my guess luckily is that In these 4 Games I don't think There were any stats I would say.... That was until Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 and it continue improving
 to present games... Anyway, COD Modern Warfare 3 I stopped Cheating with Multiplayer rank and I can't remember what was the reason that I stopped. I also cheated by Force unlock all Armor in Halo 4 Xbox 360, sadly which Halo is like my Second Favorite... If
 you going to say I am going to get banned from my past cheating... I already attempted and told Microsoft face to face in the Xbox Support and Something else which again I can't remember... One of the Microsoft Support Members said that: I am going to have
 a Enforcement Team check into... something (Again can't remember, it has been at least 1 or 2 Years ago)... Probably scan and/or look into my Xbox Live Account and such.... I waited for a while for Microsoft to send me a Email that they found something.....
 But however, It has been a long time now and Nothing happened yet.... So, A while back after I grow tired of waiting.. I was not going to stay ruined like this forever.. At least try to recover your game status.. After all, Xbox 360 is slowly dying and I can
 began a new in my Xbox One.. But like I said, I can't stop thinking about it and I can't leave it behind of what I did.. The Only achievement that I stupidly got by the cheat file is The Completionist: Complete ALL progress tracker grid entries in Assassin's
 Creed 3.... Anyway, Now my objective is to restore my Gaming Status.. I just want to be a fair gamer once more like many of you Xbox Players. Anyway, The kind of Work I am doing is finish The game correctly without no Cheat Files, Getting Achievements with
 No Cheat Files and Such, I can't let my mistake happen again. If I got time, I might share my work progress and which games I am doing, whenever I got time.. I can take photos using my Smartphone.. Also one more thing, I also Sold ALL my games of Xbox 360
 and Deleted all my save files of all my games in Xbox 360. I was thinking of starting a new in Xbox One, But.. Like I said again, I can't let it go..Also If I am correct, some of you players may recognize me from a long time ago Topic.. Which now I can't remember
 what the Topic was about.. And other than Working on my games to slowly recover my status. I also want to say to all Xbox Players who is getting Achievements normally, Lost Save files and they played normally either way, And such.. I am very sorry for this
 type of Cheating.. Sometimes I wish for many of you give me some forgiveness but even if I receive forgiveness, I probably still won't be able to let it go.. For those players who may understand my problem with my mind and what I am doing.. Thank you for reading,
 And whatever happens, Keep yourself Clean as a Fair Gamer..</p>

<p>I also wanted to talk about, What is exactly Boosting for Achievements? All I know is that, A Group of Players that works together in order to gather achievements which happens majority in Multiplayers and from a website I know which is called:
<a href="http://www.Trueachievements.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.Trueachievements.com</a>. And the question is, Is Boosting Cheating?</p>
<p><br />
Another thing I want to talk about.. Is that Glitches and such in Multiplayer such as COD Ghosts or Maybe Advanced Warfare.. Is that Cheating?&nbsp; Because one day I did found somebody was inside the walls or Underground in Ghosts and there was no way to kill him...</p>

<p>Sad day when a fellow assassin decided he needed to cheat, whether it was JUST for the game save or achievements is inconsequential to me, if you lost your save file, suck it up and play again or move on.</p>
<p>Boosting is really in the eye of the beholder, by Terms of Service and Code of Conduct standards, boosting is not cheating because you're using what the game developer has provided you and no 3rd party software or websites to tamper with the original content
 of the game. Now some will say it's cheating by a moral stand point, but really boosters aren't harming anyone imo.</p>
<p>Now glitching again can be another grey area as some might argue that it's within the original content of the game, but developers most certainly didn't intend for it to happen, so you're exploiting it to your own gain which is cheating imo. Again, opinions
 will vary, but even if I glitch in a single player game I feel it's cheating.</p>
<p>Though don't get confused with people using glitches in CoD to the actual modders because I've seen the glitches where you can hide in a wall etc. and I've never known them to make you invincible, a grenade or something can usually get you (though I haven't
 played CoD online for about 5 years) so you might be right with Ghosts, I don't know personally.</p>

<p>DigitalAssassin? Well I know it is a sad day to hear about this.. Again to be honest, I only wanted the save file back then... But now in the present, I learn my lesson and Not going to use those Internet Explorer Game Save Files anymore and ever. And I
 already (Stupidly) deleted my save files a long time ago.. Mostly that was the reason why I used those save files back then.. Again, This time around, I am mostly playing through them this time but me move on.. I don't think I will be able to move on without
 fixing the problem in Assassin's Creed 3. And DigitalAssassin I am sorry to disappoint you with this information.. But I promise you and everyone else, I won't cheat ever again with those Save Files things.. After all DigitalAssassin? Nothing is True, Everything
 is permitted..</p>
<p>Oh.. Okay Now I understand more about Boosting.. I guess when I got time on Xbox One, I might get into a crew in Trueachievements.com and start working on certain achievements when I can..</p>
<p>So, Glitch is Cheating... Okay.. On Xbox One, If I see someone doing glitches in Mutliplayer I should report them right? Such games like Ghosts, Advanced Warfare, Halo Master Chief Collection and such?</p>

<p>Why are you putting DigitalAssassin with a question mark? Haha, yes that's me! You can call me Digi though if it's easier.</p>
<p>Also, you are forgiven by this assassin for your past indiscretions, Nothing is True, Everything is Permitted is only a guideline to live by, it doesn't actually mean nothing is true and you can do what you like, especially on the Xbox Live service, you
 will learn this young one (have I taken this too far? Haha).</p>
<p>Though in all seriousness, yes, if I saw someone glitching through walls, invincible, invisible, floating etc. on an online game of CoD, I'd be reporting them, even if they're aren't using mods I think it's better to be safe than sorry. Especially if you're
 playing an older CoD title, they are ripe with people with 3rd party mods.</p>
<p>That's not to say you won't find it in Halo or something, but CoD is the biggest offender of cheaters in my opinion, I've never came across more then when playing that game online.</p>

<p>Sorry! Digi. lol.. And I thank you for your forgiveness.. And I am playing Assassin's Creed 1 Once more and so, Yeah I re-learn that Those words does not mean I can anything I want lol... And okay, I should help out to keep Xbox One safer then.. As for Xbox
 360.. I am sure, It will nearly impossible to report on those players because There is so many in older COD Titles.. Most Especially COD World at War and COD Modern Warfare 2. And plus, Since probably those games are old, I don't think Microsoft or it's creators
 going to do anything against those Modders... But I am very sure they will do in Xbox One, Since it is brand new, High Security and New Gen.</p>
<p>By the way Digi, Do you play Assassin's Creed Unity and Have an Xbox One? Or you only have Xbox 360?</p>

<p>I was just using the older CoD's as an example, but I wouldn't be surprised if you came across them on Ghosts on the Xbox One. I actually suggest never going back to the old titles as you can get banned for just being in a modded lobby without even knowing
 who is actually modding.</p>
<p>I've been gaming on the Xbox since 2006 and have played and completed all the achievements for Assassin's Creed 1, 2, brotherhood, revelations, 3, liberation and nearly 4, but to be honest the series isn't what it was during the Altair and Ezio saga so I
 haven't played Unity or Rouge.</p>
<p>I've also been playing the Xbox One since day one and haven't experienced any cheating personally, it's been a good experience.</p>

<p>Jesus... Now I will most likely stay away from Old COD Titles Multiplayer.... And as for Ghosts. I saw someone do the glitch where they can be underground but in Xbox 360 Version.. And thank you for the heads up about the COD Lobbys... Man.. Things are not
 the way they used to be... </p>
<p>Oh that is cool Digi! I started gaming on Xbox 360 when it was first released.. I played games such as Saints Row 1, Dead Rising 1 and Rainbow Six Vegas 1 back then... But all of this was before I started cheating.. I had a diffrent account which is called
 Dark Assassin9O but my profile got corrupted and I wasn't able to get it back.. So I had to start a new on Xbox 360... And sometime later.. I managed to Complete Assassin's Creed 1, 2, Brotherhood, and Revelations without cheating.. But later in Time.. I deleted
 the save files and then I wanted them back... So slowly that is how it happened with the cheating Save Files.. And yes Digi.. The series is not the same as Altair or Ezio Saga.. But I also like 3 and 4 Black Flag Combat Mechanics unlike Assassin's Creed Unity...
 But As far I seen Rogue, It looks similar to Assassin's Creed &nbsp;4 Black Flag except new features, Abilities and a new character..</p>
<p>I also had Xbox One since Day One.. And as far I can see.. There is still no Cheating I encounter yet. Xbox One sure does feel like a new gen and a very good experience! =)</p>

<p>If it were up to me, you should receive a ban from Xbox Live. &nbsp;You broke the ToS when using outside means to gain access to a save. &nbsp;You openly admitted to cheating in Halo &amp; Call of Duty. &nbsp;Obviously this isn't up to me, but if the PET looks into it and
 finds something, no doubt you'll see some action taken.</p>

<p>Have to agree with Eggnogga,cheating is cheating &amp; deserves a perma ban from xbox live.</p>
<p>The fact that you regret it now makes no difference &amp; you didn't just do it once,not that cheating only once makes it acceptable.</p>
<p>By posing on the official forums you have made it more likely that your account will get banned.</p>

<p>Eggnogga? I understand you feel I should recieve a Ban from Xbox Live. And I know I broke the rules.. And as for the Enforcement Team.. I already attempted to tell them the truth a long time ago.. And yet.. I don't think they found anything... If they did..
 Why did they haven't ban me yet.. I am willing to start over again if I have to.. And Eggnogga? I am sorry.</p>

    <title>Cannot update Office 2016 Professional Pro. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john.bloom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot update Office 2016 Professional Pro.</h2>
                    <p>I've installed Office 2016 Professional Pro (Enterprise) on a Win 7 64-bit workstation, have the software activated via the business' kms, but I can't get Office software updates either through the "Office Updates" button [it doesn't appear] in the account
 screen on any application, nor on the Windows Update setting [the "Microsoft Updates" check box does not appear] -- my preferred method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found KB 2753538 which discusses this situation, but&nbsp;my PC's registry does not have any "OfficeUpdate" keys in the location specified there, or anywhere else&nbsp;(I used "Find" to try to locate&nbsp;any through regedit).&nbsp; Moreover, my IT department says that they
 set no group policies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling and reinstalling Office (using the business' distribution DVD image), but this didn't help.&nbsp; I created a new user account, and went into that, because "first use" gives you an "install updates" prompt.&nbsp; Even though I selected this, it
 didn't take.&nbsp; Oh, I've installed it on three different PCs, and on one of them the "Microsoft update" did engage, but on two it did not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... I must be facing a situation which kb 2753538 doesn't cover... there must be some other means by which "Microsoft Updates" is turned off or not activated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice or help?</p>

<h2>            In FSX &#40;A320 Airbus&#41; I am trying to allocate a joystick or keyboard command to operate the EFIS Mode and Range selector.</h2>

<p>In FSX (A320 Airbus) I am trying to allocate a joystick or keyboard command to operate the EFIS Mode and Range selector.</p>
<p>I have tried a mouse mapping programme to trap the commands but nothing registers when I use the mouse on either of these 2 rotary switches.</p>
<p>The mapping programme does trap all the conventional buttons etc but shows nothing on these specific rotary switches.</p>
<p>Please can anyone help?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your interest and suggestions.</p>
<p>I have tried other keyboards and joysticks including Microsofts own sidewinder and Saiteks X52.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the only way to access these 2 switches is to click on them with the mouse. In FSX there is no keyboard command listed to do the same thing and the trapping software I have tried reveals nothing.</p>
<p>I guess I will have to keep clicking with the mouse.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your input.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

            Hi KeungR, 
<br />
<br />I've found the following article which presents the following answer (<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/general-support/82235-creators-update-blank-login-screen-after-sleep-mode.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/general-support/82235...</a>):
<br /><pre><code>Hi, I´ve had a similar problem after getting Creators update and I got solution on the internet: In "run" type msconfig and it will open System configuration, then in General section select Selective startup and unselect Load startup items. </code></pre>
<br />
<br />If this solution works, you will need to confirm what startup item is causing the problem (which would be common across all of these laptops). Startup items are found in Task Manager, under the Startup tab (Note: some startup items might be necessary to run, so I would recommend testing this on one laptop initially).
<br />
<br />Please let me know how this goes.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan

<h2>            Very annoying GTA5 On Demand Issue</h2>
                    
<p>**NOTE: The game does work after a couple of tries, but this shouldn't happen..**</p>
<p><br />
So I purchased GTAV on demand the day it was released as such. I have 2 Xbox 360 Slim consoles as well. The main one is the one I purchased the game on so my girlfriend could play it on her account. I also have it downloaded on my second console. Now, since
 the license is tied to the main console, it causes some launch issues with GTAV. I'll load it and get dirty disc errors which makes no sense since, well, it's digital.
</p>
<p>Does anyone know if this is being fixed? I mean, every game I purchase goes onto my main console. I have no problems using my content on my second console since I'm using my account which is the one that purchased it.&nbsp; GTAV is the ONLY title that throws
 out dirty disc errors the first two attempts at launching it. Even never games like Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare doesn't have this issue. Thankfully it loads and such but it's still annoying.</p>

<p>Hey Tye,</p>
<p>I haven't heard of this particular issue with GTA V.</p>
<p>To clarify, you have the game downloaded onto 2 consoles. On your console that you downloaded it on, you get the "dirty disc" error but on the other console you do not, correct?</p>
<p>Does that happen only with a profile that didn't purchase the game tries to play it?</p>
<p>Please let us know and we can work from there.</p>

<p>Yes. It is on 2 consoles. The original console I purchased it on has no issues at all. It's my second console that I run into this error. I'm always using this profile (xTye) to play and I bought it on this profile. So I'm not sure what the issue is. I've
 cleared my cache out and it'll still happen. I'm thinking it's something to do with the fact that it's a 2 disc game on Xbox 360.

<p>Hi Tye,</p>
<p>So it sounds like this is just happening on the second console (the one you didn't purchase on). I never like to rule stuff out but I don't think it's the 2 disc nature of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a couple things that I would suggest trying on this second console if you haven't already:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/games/manage-games-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Delete the game</a> (and any update) from your HDD
</li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/system/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear your cache</a>&nbsp;- 3 times
</li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/downloadable-content/redownload-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Redownload</a> the game
</li></ul>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Redownload your profile</a> on your second console<br />
<br />
<br />
Please let us know how those work for you.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
It is possible that the files were not transferred correctly. To narrow this down, we'd like to ask a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you receive any error or pop-up messages while transferring your files?</li><li>What is the make and model of your phone?</li><li>What is the file extension of the missing photos?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, if you have not copied anything after that, you can try pasting to a folder and see if your clipboard is still holding those files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p><br />
First of all, to use all services ralated to Skype for Business, the license for Skype for Business should be assigned to the user. If you don't have any button or option available for Skype for Business. Check the license and assign it to an user. You can
 refer to the article below:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Assign-or-unassign-licenses-for-Office-365-for-business-997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.office.com/.../Assign-or-unassign-licenses-for-Office-365-for-business-997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc</a></p>
<p>If your concern is to use Skype for Business online function without its client, Skype for Business Web App can be used to schedule and join meetings. For detailed information about Skype for Business Web App, refer to:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Skype-for-Business-Web-Scheduler-3b24a211-6470-4a2d-81b7-22d9399d0fec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.office.com/.../Skype-for-Business-Web-Scheduler-3b24a211-6470-4a2d-81b7-22d9399d0fec</a>
<br />
However, functions of Skype for Business Web App are limited. For example, starting a video call to a contact is not feasible in it.<br />
As a tip, it may take several hours to provision Skype for Business Online service. So, I suggest trying the information above several hours later after assigning the Skype for Business Online license.</p>
<p><br />
Moreover, we recommend to use Skype for Business client for better user experience. To download Skype for Business client, choose Settings in the top right corner in the Adimin Center-&gt; choose Office 365-&gt; Settings-&gt; Software-&gt; install Skype for Business.</p>
<p>If you have any questions when referring to the information above, welcome to post back for help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Louis</p>

<h2>            Verbindungsabbr&#38;&#35;252&#59;che Controller</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>wollte mal nachfragen ob jemand mehr zu diesem Problem sagen kann.</p>
<p>Habe mir zwei Titanfall Controller gekauft. Den ersten habe wegen sporadischen Verbindungsabbrüchen umgetauscht. Nun fängt auch der zweite damit an.</p>
<p>Ich glaube mich erinnern zu können das dies an den Controllern lag. Jetzt bin ich aber über einen Post gestolpert in dem wird das Problem der Xbox zugeschrieben.</p>
<p>Weiß jemand genaueres dazu?</p>

            <p>Verbindungsabbrüche können an unterschiedlichen Dingen liegen.</p>
<p>Zum einen natürlich an der Konsole (Empfänger / Sender) aber auch an dem Controller (ebenfalls Empfänger und Sender) aber auch an der Umgebung.</p>
<p>Die Xbox und der Controller kommunizieren über den 2,4GHZ-Bereich....in dem sehr sehr viel kommuniziert.</p>
<p>In meiner letzten Wohnung hatte ich das Problem, das aufgrund der dünnen Wände, die Signale von den Nachbarn meinen Controller auf der 360 gestört hatten und sobald ich weniger als 90% Akkuleistung hatte, der Controller sich nicht mehr connected hat.</p>
<p>In der jetzigen Wohnung habe ich das Problem nicht mehr.</p>
<p>Um dir mal näher zu bringen was alles im 2,4Ghz-Bereich ist hier mal eine Auflistung:</p>
<p>So gut wie alles &nbsp;mit Funk: Funktastaturen, Babyphone, Funktelefone, Wlan, Smartphones/Handy</p>
<p>Aber auch Mikrowellen sind in dem Bereich.</p>
<p>Wenn also dein Fernseher Wlan hat, du evtl. noch ne 2. Konsole (PS4) hast (die im Standby im Wlan ist), sehr viele Wlans der Nachbarn hast usw.</p>
<p>Dann versuch deine eignen Signale mal zu minimieren: Wlan ausstellen usw oder die Konsole an einen anderen Platz stellen.</p>
<p>Davon abgesehen solltest du aber auch, den Controller mal updaten - dies hat auch schon zum Erfolg geführt:</p>

<p>Danke für Deinen Beitrag.</p>
<p>Alle meine Controller sind bereits upgedated. Daran kann es nicht liegen.</p>
<p>Was sonst alles so die Frequenz stört ist schwierig auszumachen. Hier hat es eine Menge WLAN in der Nachbarschaft.</p>
<p>Mich irritiert dabei das diese Verbindungsabbrüche nicht gleich von Anfang an da waren. Beim ersten Controller hat es auch mehrere Monate gebraucht bis das Problem aufgetreten ist. Beim zweiten war Anfangs auch nichts.</p>
<p>Wenn es an der Konsole liegen würde, sollte das Problem doch eigentlich direkt von Anfang an auftreten. Verwirrend...</p>

            <p>Also wenn es an der Konsole liegt, dann sollte es von Anfang an da sein - da stimme ich dir zu....bzw. sollte nicht kommen und gehen.</p>
<p>Wenn es am Controller liegt....dann kann es schon möglich sein das es erst mit der Zeit kommt.</p>
<p>Wenn du aber auch Zeiten hast wo es geht, dann wieder nicht und dann wieder.....dann würde ich wieder auf die Umgebung tippen, da evtl. ein Nachbar ein Gerät (was viel im 2,4GHZ-Bereich sendet) dann anschaltet.</p>
<p>Ich bin damals dann auf Kabel umgestiegen, was bei der Xbox One ja nun noch einfacher geworden ist, dank Micro-USB-Kabel</p>

<p>Der Support schlug vor unter "Einstellungen --&gt; Energie &amp; Start --&gt; Neustart" auszuwählen da ein solcher Neustart alle Programme/Apps korrekt beenden und den Cache leeren würde.</p>
<p>Hat mir leider nicht geholfen. Hatte gestern Abend wieder einen Verbindungsabbruch.</p>
<p>Ich Frage mich jetzt ob es evtl. an den Batterien liegen könnte. Es gibt wohl auch Meinung dazu das solche Verbindungsabbrüche eher mit den "günstigen" Batterien zu beobachten sind.</p>
<p>Es bleibt also spannend. Werde heute Abend meinen CoD Controller anschließen und das mal die nächsten Wochen/Monate beobachten.</p>

<p>Ob das an den Batterien liegen kann vermag ich nicht einzuschätzen. Aber ich kann sagen dass ich seit jeher eneloop Akkus verwende und es mit denen auch zu Verbindungsabbrüchen kam. Wie gesagt haben die letzten Softwareupdates dieses Problem bei mir weitestgehend
 eliminiert.</p>

<p>Um mal zu klären, ob es wirklich an zu schwachen Batterien liegt, könntest Du folgendes versuchen: Ich habe ein normales USB Handynetzteil neben meinem Sofa eingesteckt, und ein normales Micro-USB Kabel zum Controller. So verhinderst Du, dass die Daten über
 das Kabel zur Xbox One gehen (falls Du das Play&amp;Charge Kit hast und mit dem langen Kabel den Controller an die Konsole anschließt), und dass dem Controller der Saft ausgeht.</p>
<p>Akkubatterien haben halt die unangenehme Eigenschaft, dass die Ladung wie eine "Schiefe Ebene" abnimmt. Bei Einweg-Batterien bleibt die Ladung längere Zeit konstant, um dann am Ende rapide leer zu werden. Wenn also der Akku noch "halb-voll" ist, kann es
 auch sein, dass die abgegebene Spannung nur noch etwa die Hälfte ist, und somit der Controller nicht mehr genug Saft bekommt.
</p>
<p>Merkt man auch oft daran, dass der Controller die Vibrationsfunktion bei schwachen Batterien abschaltet.
</p>
<p>Also: USB Netzteil dran, und dann nochmal auf Abbrüche testen. </p>

<p>Danke für den Tipp Arminator. Werde ich auch mal testen. Zur Zeit teste ich aber den CoD Controller.</p>
<p>Momentan kann ich noch keine Abbrüche feststellen. Aber da deren Auftreten ohnehin nicht voraussagbar ist, habe ich keine Ahnung wie lange das gut geht oder eben nicht.</p>
<p>Ich halte euch aber gerne auf dem Laufenden wie die Geschichte weiter bzw. aus geht.</p>
<p>EDIT: natürlich habe ich allen Controller die neue Software verpasst sobald diese verfügbar war. Leider blieben die Verbindungsabbrüche dadurch nicht aus.</p>

<p>Heute Mittag war es dann wieder soweit. Mit meinem neuen Controller hatte ich einen kurzen Verbindungsabbruch. Das Spiel pausierte mit der Meldung das der Controller nicht mehr angeschlossen ist und man ihn wieder verbinden soll. Kurzer Blick nach unten
 auf meinen Controller. Der Xbox Button blinkte bereits und schon war die Verbindung wie von Geisterhand wieder hergestellt.</p>
<p>Ich habe abermals den Support kontaktiert. Diesmal hat man mir eine weitere Lösung vorgeschlagen:</p>
<p>unter "Einstellungen --&gt; System --&gt; Lokal gespeicherte Spiele löschen" (hier werden KEINE Spiele von der Festplatte gelöscht. Hat mir die Dame vom Support versichert. Und das stimmt. Es war danach immer noch alles auf der Festplatte. Ein Übersetzungsfehler
 oder dergleichen?) danach mein Konto löschen, die Konsole neu starten und das Konto nochmals runterladen.</p>
<p>Parallel dazu hat man mir auch ein Rücksendeetikett ausgestellt. Jetzt habe ich 30 Tage Zeit um das Problem zu beobachten. Tritt erneut ein Verbindungsabbruch auf, werde ich die Konsole wohl einschicken.</p>
<p>An den Batterien kann es nicht liegen, diese sind noch fast ganz voll. Und das es am Controller liegt mag ich auch nicht mehr glauben. Ich hatte diese Verbindungsabbrüche bisher mit jedem Controller den ich an meiner Xbox One benutzt habe.</p>
<p>Ich halte euch auf dem Laufenden.</p>

                    I get an "unexpected store exception" on every cold start. It does not occur on restarts.&nbsp; I ran chkdsk on the hard drive and have done a clean install of the Win 10 OS and the problem continues. Any ideas?

<h2>            New Surface Pro cannot find any external drives</h2>
                    <p>Please help.&nbsp; I am not THAT computer savvy, but enough to know that something is wrong.&nbsp; I have a two month old MS Surface Pro.&nbsp; I have tried plugging in a couple of older external hard drives, couldn't get them to work but wasn't worried about it.&nbsp; Now,
 I have just tried to plug in a brand new Zoom H4 which is an expensive digital audio recorder.&nbsp; I have several files on this H4 that I would like to export onto the Surface.&nbsp; Again, I plugged it in - saw a brief message flash on the screen that the Pro was
 "Setting up" the H4.&nbsp; But now I cannot find it anywhere on the Pro.&nbsp; When I go into Settings/Bluetooth and other Devices, it tells me that the H4 is connected.&nbsp; But it does not show up in File Explorer.&nbsp; If anyone could provide some guidance on this, I would
 greatly appreciate it.&nbsp; This Pro is running Windows 10.&nbsp; (Which is probably obvious, but I thought I should mention it anyway.)&nbsp; Thank you so much in advance.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Right Click Taskbar - Task Manager - Processes tab - right click on it and End Process.<br />
<br />
If nothing else close other open programs and restart the computer. That will not cause any issues as there will be no open files being changed.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

            Hi NikhilG,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Windows server related question is more likely to be answered at Technet. I would suggest that you should post simultaneously (i.e. cross-post) to Technet forum also as this will increase chances of getting the fast answer to this query. So, your question will be on two forums - This and Technet. Experts on both forums will assist you giving you wider reach.
<br />
<br />Technet Windows Server forum- 
<br /> <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?category=windowsserver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/off...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Stuck at automatic repair screen in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys, My name is Rafael. I finally decide to write something on the community because I'm losing my mind in trying to fix my problem. I know what people might say "Check other forums" but no, I wanted to give out my side of the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>9 months back, I've started having (Automatic Repair) and (Diagnosing your PC). I was confused as heck but I thought it was just the laptop fixing itself. It would essentially lead to a point where I have to wait until my wallpaper shows and this was frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem has returned even worse this time with blue screen along with Automatic Repair title and such. After struggling with it, I decided to just reset and screw the files that I had which weren't Important at all. That manages to fix my laptop back
 to normal until 3 months later, the problem had finally gotten to a bad point where I'm constantly stuck with Automatic Repair loop. I'm quite confused of this but I've read, searched, yet when I sometimes try to reset to see if it's a problem the screen goes
 blue for hours then it restarts the laptop not allowing the process to continue. Also, when I click troubleshoot, it freezes for hours too just to get to other options. Also, sometimes it restarts itself while I'm trying to run other options which freaking
 freezes for hours or even the next day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no clue what to do anymore, I want to punch the **** out of this dell laptop and be done with it. Can anyone give out solutions or answers to this dolt problem I'm having. I'd really love to hear from anyone at this rate because I'm tired of this
 and also thinking of maybe trying to send it to be repaired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell Inspiron laptop i3&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below&nbsp;methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong><span><span>First, I would suggest you to disconnect any external devices that are connected to the computer except essential devices like keyboard and mouse. Restart the computer now and check if it boots.
 This way we can find out if any external device is incompatible.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: &nbsp;Automatic repair</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you are unable to boot the computer, then I would suggest you to perform an Automatic repair. The Automatic repair can detect and fix the issues that prevent the computer from starting normally. You will need the Windows 8 disc to perform
 an Automatic repair. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you have a Windows 8 installation disc inserted, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>When your computer starts, wait for the manufacturer logo to check the option for boot menu, it will usually be F12.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Restart the computer, keep pressing the Boot menu option key to enter the boot menu and change the boot option to CD\DVD ROM</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD". Press any key.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </span>
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click Repair your computer in the lower left corner</span></p>
</li><li>

            <p>Hey! Thank you for replying to my question. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, I don't have a Windows 8 installation key due to the fact that I downloaded Windows 8 for free. If that's the case, I can't follow any of the directions you have put out here (Unless, I can do something still using the CD/DVD with Windows 8 but not
 using disk. I also thought the Dell Disc for my laptop would of worked). Is there more that I can do to resolve this problem? Because I really need this Laptop to at least work due to college coming soon. This loop takes its time for hours or maybe the next
 day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate it!</p>

            <p>Hello Niranjan,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how to answer, but when Windows 8 first came out I decided to check it out. Two days later, I saw the pop up saying to install Windows 8. I proceeded to do this and everything went well from on. I didn't do anything illegal to get this nor did
 I went on torrent to get it. I also got the windows 8.1 update too so I installed it as well. I can't tell you that this is genuine or not because I didn't bother researching on it rather than just using it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I'm trying to do is just fixing the dang Automatic Repair loop that I've been having for months now. I did research that the new updates do cause this but rarely, mostly applications cause the problem. I don't know how though because I've been using
 my applications numerous amount of times for over 3 or 4 years and now this happens. I'll wait for a response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Rafael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you bought Windows 8 installed in the PC from OEM, the product key is embedded in BIOS and each time you do installation, it picks the product key from BIOS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download Windows 8.1 from Microsoft site and try running Automatic repair as suggested.

<p>
</p><p>I didn't buy Windows 8 at all, as I said previously, I got it for free which my laptop gave me the option to download it so I went for it. But this isn't the case, I'm still stuck in the Automatic Repair loop and about to give up on trying anymore. I still
 see no process whatsoever and sadly, it takes time here to get a reply back. I might as well stop trying. (If you guys are busy, it's understandable but there should be more "users" from Microsoft on)</p>

<h3> trybird  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to let wmic command&#40;s&#41; that within environment variable can run properly in Powershell window&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 V1703, now right-click on Start button, there shows "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" which replaced old "Command Prompt (Admin)".</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ee1b3a8-b8e2-4d26-912e-cff479501476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ee1b3a8-b8e2-4d26-912e-cff479501476" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In a PowerShell window, can run well the below command:<br />
net user $env:UserName</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/198aa63a-2bb4-46b3-af0f-4a60f17afd4f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/198aa63a-2bb4-46b3-af0f-4a60f17afd4f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now in Cortana's search box type "cmd", then right-click "Command Prompt", click "Run as administrator", open a "Command Prompt (Admin)" window,</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c7f4e5c-cb3f-42a5-8b7f-3bf6715847d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c7f4e5c-cb3f-42a5-8b7f-3bf6715847d5" /></a></p>
<p>can run well the below command in it:<br />
net user %UserName%</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/93b383d9-8418-4342-b9a6-07eba4890e68" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/93b383d9-8418-4342-b9a6-07eba4890e68" /></a></p>
<p><br />
This indicates that the environment variable $env:UserName in PS is equal to %UserName% in CMD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And, in a "Command Prompt (Admin)" window, can run well the below two commands in it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get the current account's username:<br />
wmic useraccount where name="%UserName%" get Name</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15e5ef84-34e3-41c0-8d80-7dd087f5fede" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15e5ef84-34e3-41c0-8d80-7dd087f5fede" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>View a specific user account info list:<br />
wmic useraccount where name="[username]" list<br />
for example, list my user account:<br />
wmic useraccount where name="Trybird" list</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0459533a-30c1-4d89-9c10-3aa705c7d501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0459533a-30c1-4d89-9c10-3aa705c7d501" /></a></p>
<p><br />
Now in a PowerShell window, I try to run the following commands, but all have failed:<br />
wmic useraccount where name="$env:UserName" get Name<br />
wmic useraccount where name=$env:UserName get Name<br />
wmic useraccount where name="Trybird" list<br />
wmic useraccount where name=Trybird list</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please tell me, <br />
<strong>which PowerShell scripts are equal to the CMD commands --</strong><br />
<strong>wmic useraccount where name="[username]" list</strong><br />
<strong>and</strong><br />
<strong>wmic useraccount where name="%UserName%" get Name?</strong></p>

<em>Windows 10 Performance</em>). You would get excellent replies to the points you raise in the scripting forum I gave you before.

<h3> earl_d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel Display Audio Driver 6.16.0.3155 update on Windows 8.1-- is this a driver for external displays&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My device driver update scanner just flagged this update under sound, video and game controllers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel Display Audio Driver: </p>
<p>Currently installed: 6.16.0.3129 dated 10/16/2013, states it is "unplugged".</p>
<p>Prospective update: 6.16.0.3155 dated 9/9/2014</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device manager reports only a Conexant High Definition audio driver right now. Makes sense if 6.16.0.3129 is unplugged from external display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:</p>
<p>Is this driver for external displays? Is it for VGA connections or HDMI?</p>
<p>Do I need this update? Will it over-write (replace) my Conexant Hi-Definition audio driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 8.1 on an Intel I5 processor with 12Gig RAM, and all is functional right now. I love my Harmon/Kardon speakers.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 ready to install</h2>
                    When you inform me that Windows 10 is downloaded and ready to install am I still running &nbsp;Wndows 8.1 or am I in a intermediate condition. &nbsp;Are the drivers to my peripheals updated at this point or will they be updated on the install? &nbsp; If I have programs
 like Real PLayer or a disk writer program will they be updated or do I buy a new program? &nbsp; Will I have tp buy a new internetprotection program or will the old program, in this case Viper, be able to handle Windows 10? &nbsp;In short how compatable is Windose 10
 with Windos 8.1. &nbsp;I have one program that runs on XP. &nbsp;Will my Windos Officebe updated or simply add? &nbsp;Righ nnow I have both Office 2010 and 2013 available to me. &nbsp;I have been told that 8.1 can run this program. &nbsp;Will Windows 10 be able to run programs that
 old. &nbsp;I am specifically loooking at the Sony Clie' software. &nbsp;

            <p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>

</p><p>You can also download the Download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

Recent versions of Windows include File History, which was introduced in Windows 8.0 in 2012 but based on my personal experience, it is not as thorough as Windows Easy Transfer which is no longer available or supported.

</p><p><strong>Will my Antivirus be compatible with Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most likely not. Windows 10 will require that you have a version of your Antivirus that is designed for Windows 10. It is recommended that you uninstall your current Antivirus before intiating the upgrade. If you have a subscription that has not expired,
 contact the developer to find out about Windows 10 support. Most Antivirus utilities should be upgraded by the time Windows 10 launches. If your subscription is still active, then you should be entitled to a compatible update for Windows 10.</p>

            <p>When you get that message apart from the file itself absolutely nothing is changed, there is no "intermediate state".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only when Windows 10 setup starts would any changes be made in order for the install to succeed, nothing happens until then. 3rd party software compatibility would have to be the responsibility of the developer not Microsoft so you would have to ask ThreatTrack
 (Vipre) or Sony (Clie) if there are issues with Windows 10 and if so are they going to update their software&nbsp; to match.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are not significant changes to the kernel to make software that runs on 8.1 fail on 10 but there is bound to be the odd one, from my own test Office 2010 works but I am not a power user to say that there are no issues whatsoever. In many cases Windows
 8 broke software that was not rated to work on Windows 7 and the developers were not going to fix it, who would pay for the time needed?</p>

<h2>            Palm Rejection</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I experienced a strange bug on my Surface Book 2. For my study I often take notes in OneNote by pen. It works fine expect for one place so far; my university. At the university suddenly the palm rejection does not work. This happens every time I am at the
 university. Everywhere else the device works fine. Does any one have an explanation and solution for this bug.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi ThaibinhL,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue will require us to check different settings and perform a series of steps. Are there any apps that you use with OneNote exclusively when you are at your university? Were you able to use the Surface at the university before without experiencing
 this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's see if an update was recently installed on your Surface. Go to <strong>Settings
</strong>(<strong>Windows key </strong>+ <strong>I</strong>) &gt; <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> &gt;
<strong>View update history</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the problem occurs while you're at the university, verify that the settings needed are applied for the palm rejection feature to work. In
<strong>Settings</strong>, go to <strong>Devices </strong>&gt; <strong>Pen &amp; Windows Ink</strong> &gt; make sure
<strong>Ignore touch input when I'm using my pen</strong> is <strong>On</strong>. If it's already enabled, try changing the hand option under
<strong>Choose which hand you write with</strong>, then check if palm rejection will work. Apart from that, try using a different app where you can write or draw with the Surface Pen, and see if palm rejection will also not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the feature still does not work, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download and run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong>.
 Afterwards, perform a forced shutdown. While the device is on, press the power button for about 10 seconds or until the screen goes off. Once the device is up, revisit the Pen &amp; Windows Ink settings to make sure the settings are correct, then test if the palm
 rejection will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case the steps are not successful in resolving the issue, we would have to perform further troubleshooting. Kindly update the post with your findings. I will be notified when you reply and I'll get back to you the soonest I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
