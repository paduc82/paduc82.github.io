<h2>            data transfer cable not working</h2>
                    
<p>I have upgraded my xbox due to a RROD. I brought a data transfer cable to retrieve the game data from my old hard disk , however the data transfer cable doesn't work. On the advice of xbox customer support I exchanged.the cable with the shop, however the
 second cable doesn't work either. A second call to customer support provided no yelp other than to return the console. The new hard disk has enough capacity, the old hard disk is whirring when plugged in and I've tried a usb mem stick so I know the usb works
 . I am convinced the driver is missing from the xbox. I also don't know anyone with the older xbox so I can't plug it in to theirs and use a usb mem stick. I only need the skyrim save file, its an awesome game but I don't want to redo the 40hrs plus playing
 time I have put in. Please can anyone help?</p>

<p>It depends on the reason that the RROD occured. &nbsp;If it was because of the hard drive then you cannot transfer it because of the information would be corrupted. &nbsp;Also, if it is used you may just be having some bad luck with cords as well. &nbsp;What I would recommend
 is to just play the games over and for future reference to use the cloud for the most part for a copy of your saves in case this happens. &nbsp;I understand thta it can be frustrating because a friend of mine had the same but the information was perm lost.</p>

    <title>Win 10 Desktop App Notifications - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taylord131  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 Desktop App Notifications</h2>
                    <p>I have had a running issue with notifications on Windows 10 and the Desktop App for Skype for over a month now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notifications are not coming through for ANY contact.&nbsp; I have to close skype and restart in order to get any notifications.&nbsp; After the restart, I get&nbsp;hit with all of my notifications that have been building up (at times over 2+ hours worth).&nbsp; After closing/restarting
 I seem to get notifications for about 10 minutes or so (it varies) then it will stop...requiring me to close/restart the app in order to get any notifications.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sending notifications will lock up at times as well.&nbsp; Forcing me to close the app/restart in order
 for the desktop app to show my message as "sent".&nbsp; outgoing messages get stuck in "sending" quite frequently.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have had friends tell me that my status is not shown as active when this happens...so overall the desktop app is a hot mess right now for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I did a complete wipe of skype on my computer as described by the Skype User Docs...I did everything down to removing any regedit files.&nbsp; After the reinstall, I am STILL&nbsp; having the issue of not receiving notifications.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is only an issue with the desktop app for me.&nbsp; The phone app works fine; however, being logged&nbsp;into two devices at once has created a whole new issue with the desktop app not ringing when I receive a call.&nbsp; &nbsp;I honestly don't care about the call ringing
 issue as long as I can get notifications working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried downgrading to the old version of the stand-alone Skype but whenever I send a message skype locks up and requires me to force close the app via task manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can try or do I just have to sit and wait this one out until an update somewhere down the road fixes this issue?&nbsp;</p>

<br />Make sure the following is configured:

<br />Make sure Skype is toggled on
<br />
<br />In the mean time, switch to using the classic version to see if that works:

<h2>            DVD- Disc Drive shows my DVD-R contains data but all files now missing and I get &#39;Drag Files To Folder To add To Disc&#39; message when opening DVD</h2>
                    Yesterday I used my&nbsp;Toshiba Satellite Laptop to update data on an excel spreadsheet on my dvd-r disc which is half full of files such as spreadsheets, pictures, and assorted backup files.&nbsp; Today, when I insert the disc into the pc it still shows 2.43 GB
 free of 4.37 which has been the norm and means it contains those files.&nbsp; But when I open the disc there is nothing but a message 'Drag Files To This Folder To add To Disc'.&nbsp; I'm not sure what happened.&nbsp; I only had copied various basic files I mentioned on
 this disc months ago with no problems.&nbsp; I have updated excel spreadsheets monthly with no issue.&nbsp; I checked other discs I have and they are fine.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;

<p>Thank you for the information that you have provided. As a workaround of making the registry entries or keys of Mozy placed at the top of the list, you may try to manually create a duplicate of all registry keys that are entered prior to Mozy, in this case,
 from GoogleDriveBlacklisted to Groove Explorer Icon Overlay 4. After you've created a duplicate, delete their original registry keys.<br />
<br />
Duplicate entries will be placed at the bottom of the list, thus will make Mozy at the top after the deletion of other keys. To duplicate, you need to create a new key, and then copy the information from a source, for example, the entry of GoogleDriveBlacklisted.
 You need to rename it first if it will give you an error.<br />
<br />
Before doing so, we recommend that you back up your registry by following the steps provided in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>. You may also refer to the steps on the links below on how to add a registry key and how
 to add a value to a registry key entry:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731733(v=ws.11).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add a Registry Key</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772023(v=ws.11).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add a Value to a Registry Key Entry</a></strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The steps on these links are also applicable to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For
 added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article.</p>

<h3> cyber warfare  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spyware on Windows 7&#47;8 pushed for Windows 10 Eula</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much talk about lawsuits over Eula's we accepted when we install Windows 10, but nowhere in the Windows 7/8 Eula's did I agree to surrender "all of my private data", to include copyrighted materials, or future patent ideas, or anything else I have of value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Windows 10 Eula, as well as other popular sites, like Google, the trend seems to be "no data is safe" anywhere, whether it is on someone's cloud or on your own devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked for this company back in the early 1990's and it was always Microsoft's policy to "protect a users data and privacy" and Microsoft would not be caught dead with another company or individual's private data in hand, for what ever reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, it appears that Microsoft has granted itself (as IT guru's are fond of saying) "God Rights" to all data, regardless of source,&nbsp; regardless of owner and regardless of the data location. Let me catch Microsoft in possession of my copyrighted materials,
 Eula or not, and we will see what rights I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure if this shoe were on the other foot, and we granted ourselves the same God Rights to Microsoft's servers and proprietary data, you would not be able to stop your ears from ringing, as they would be screaming bloody murder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, in its arrogance, decided to use its "update service" which was re-designed for Windows 10 to "push" updates whether you want them or not, decided to go back and do the same with Windows 7/8, by installing "what the web calls spyware updates"
 on Windows 7/8 user machines, to give it similar data grabbing capabilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to one article which explains the suspect updates you may wish to remove.</p>
<p>http://www.infoworld.com/article/2981947/microsoft-windows/the-truth-about-windows-7-and-81-spy-patches-kb-3068708-3022345-3075249-and-3080149.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is clearly outside of any common man's or woman's expectation to privacy, and a judge is going to consider what the "common" man would expect in the way of privacy, far reaching as the MS Eula's seem to be. Microsoft's Windows XP, now in use by many
 military and government departments would be pleased as punch to find similar updates on their secure servers. Most government departments are very particular about the updates they allow on government computers, and some they won't accept because of security
 concerns. Now we have two different types of users here with two very different criteria on what privacy means. Let's go ask the NSA if they would allow Windows 10, or Windows 7/8 with these updates in place, on their servers or clients, or if they would object
 to having our nations secrets on the cloud, accidentally or by Microsoft's design, under the
<em>guise of </em><span><em>necessity for marketing and advertising purposes.</em></span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a cyber warfare consultant, we cannot have two systems of privacy, where the average user (knowing or not) clicking Eula's which allow MS to access everything, while government services protecting our nations secrets have closed door policies and security,
 taking great pains to protect the same data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has gone too far. We need our privacy back, without being tricked, without having the wool pulled over our eyes and without the
<em>guise of </em><span><em>necessity for marketing and advertising purposes</em>, buried in small legal print, or to make our computing simple. I guess it's time we all start looking at MS with an evil eye and check a bit deeper into those "trusted" updates
 we used to take for granted. Having found these updates on all my boxes makes me mad, furious in fact, on how a company I trusted and worked for, now thinks they own the world's data, and they want it all.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Like Freddy Mercury (Queen) says, "I want it all, I want it all, I want it all"....</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Certainly, there must be an attorney in this country who wants to fight for personal privacy rights?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to remove these things, here are the instructions I came up with.</p>
<p>If you want to remove these updates, plus the Windows 10 GWX update, as well as some additional "No Windows 10 updates Period" updates from Windows 7/8, copy the following to a batch file and run it with admin permissions.

</p><p>The first part of the script will identify updates on your machine. The second part will uninstall them. Once they are uninstalled, go to Windows Update, check for updates, and "hide update" for the ones in this list. The first part of the script has nothing
 to do with the latter half, but will only serve to let you know which ones are present on your system. The rest of the script will search independently of the first half, and if it finds one, it will uninstall it. Use it at your own risk. I take no liability
 for it. If you can read script, you know what it does, and will not do. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Another solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are fortunate enough to understand group policies, either local (no server) or server managed policies, as in a home server like Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, then there is a group policy you can set under
<em>Group Policy Management</em> through the "<em>Default Domain Policy</em>" to "<em>Prevent Windows Update from upgrading to the latest version of Windows through Windows Update</em>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can set a group or local policy at: "<em>Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update</em>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's see if Microsoft will trespass and cross it's own domain group policy on a Microsoft Windows Server running and governing Microsoft Windows 7/8 clients, to either snoop or to attempt to upgrade server clients to Windows 10.
</p>

    <title>Windows update caused issues with my computer, how do I restore - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows update caused issues with my computer, how do I restore without my recovery file</h2>
                    <p><strong>Can someone PLEASE assist as I am at my wits end.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>It's been 12 hrs since I woke to read that my Windows 10 computer was updated by automated process.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Since then I have been striving to restore it.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>As I started my computer, a welcome message appeared on a blank black background stating an update had occurred to Windows 10, &nbsp;</p>
<p>When my desktop reappeared, My mouse was acting sluggish and non-responsive. At times it would move on its own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My gadgets were a strange color and most of them missing or not working. &nbsp;Over 80 Icons skewed across and out of place across 4 32" monitors. &nbsp;As I continued, I discovered I no longer have drivers associated with most of my hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I proceeded to restore my system to an earlier time and discovered there are no previous restore points &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(I create a restore point at least 3 times a week)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I started the recovery process by installing the recovery system image disk only to learn that my &nbsp;<strong>DVD drive is no longer available.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I went into the device manager and it is just not there anymore. &nbsp;????? &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>After hours of reading on boot alternatives,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded Windows 10 tool and created a bootable USB and obtained my product key.</p>
<p>I can now boot in with a USB containing Windows 10&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After rebooting, I attempt to restore and it confirms i have no restore points.
</p>
<p>I attempt to manually restore from my backup files but the procedure is asking for a location with the drivers associated with my computer.
</p>
<p><strong>How can I find the files that identify the drivers of my computer in order for restore procedure to start ?</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My intention is to find a way to <strong>restore my computer, all of it ! &nbsp;...</strong><strong>NOT reinstall windows 10.</strong>
</p>
<p>I have many many applications that require fine tuning and tweaking to get them working just right.</p>
<p>...hence the reason I back up so often. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><em>I have been going at this for 12 straight hours and would very much welcome comments and suggestions as the configuration and data files are my lifeline used my daily work.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Lesson Learned : <strong>Turn off automatic update feature. Perform updates manually once a week.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p />

<p>I believe i have followed them correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if you are able to see these files you requested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had to struggle with the mouse as it would often freeze and had to wait 30-40 secs between reactivation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>It may be premature to ask but is it going to be possible to revert the system to an earlier point in time based on the fact I no longer have the restore point files available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping I could perform a restore from the backup files which were last created on Oct 17th. ?</p>
<p>They are on an external drive but i cannot initiate the restore due to missing HW drivers ?</p>

            <p>Thank you Gerry, </p>
<p>This is a relatively decent custom build and i have provided a snapshot of all the computer components in the attached Belarc Report files.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I am adamant about keeping my drivers and files up to date on a weekly basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was confident that the drivers which are mentioned to be updated, were at the latest available version releases. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For what little I know, I care for my PC on a regular basis and try to ensure it is always running optimally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This last windows update has caused a number of unknown issues which resulted in a change to the performance of the PC and now I am spending hours upon hours putting band-aids in place to make certain apps work.
</p>
<p>This may end up being worse so I would like to take another approach. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, i have backups of my system but when i try to restore, &nbsp;windows does not recognize them.</p>
<p>I start with a fresh boot to the install Windows 10 .. From the menu I choose the repair option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I choose the RESTORE from HDD, it does not see the backup directory, &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to browse to it or point to it manually, Windows asks me to install any missing drivers, to which I have no idea what's missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>May i ask you if you know anything about restoring from a backup HDD. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 HDD's with backups of my system. One drive has backup from Oct 17th which i want to restore however, the
<strong>windowsimagebackup</strong> folder is missing. </p>
<p>I have no idea why it has been deleted or disappeared. </p>
<p>All the other folders remain such as Catalog and the 5100 Win-10 back files...., just no image folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I performed another small partial backup of the existing system Oct 20th to another HDD and it created the
<strong>windowsimagebackup</strong>&nbsp;folder. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way i can utilize the new folder created Oct 20th to point to the drive which contains the 5100 backup files created Oct 17 ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i could Restore my entire PC back to what it was on Oct 17th, in perfect working order.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Just in-case this is not your forte, i will also post the question to the community</p>
<p />

            <p><em>[Merged]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>May I ask if anyone knows a way to restore entire PC from an HDD that has lost the WindowImageBackup folder</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have 2 HDD's with backups of my system. One drive has backup from Oct 17th which i want to restore however, the&nbsp;<strong>windowsimagebackup</strong>&nbsp;folder is missing.</p>
<p>I have no idea why it has been deleted or disappeared but after Windows 10 update, all my system restore points are missing.</p>
<p>The backup files are still there but somehow the update chose to delete the Image Backup folder.
</p>
<p>All the other folders remain such as Catalog and Backup Set containing 5100 Win-10 back files...., just no image folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I performed another small partial backup of the existing system "Oct 20th" to another HDD and it created the&nbsp;<strong>windowsimagebackup</strong>&nbsp;folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can utilize the new folder created on Oct 20th to point to the drive which contains the 5100 backup files created Oct 17 ?</p>
<p>Then I might stand a chance to recover my system back to working order. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Would it work if i copied the 5100 backup files from Oct 17 into the Backup Set directory of Oct 20th and overwrote the existing files ?
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Does the restore need the original image or can the new one replace it and I still get my computer back from Oct 17th</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I won't go into the details caused by this last Windows 10 update but it has made my PC barley functional.
</p>
<p>I want to restore it to the condition it was in 3 days ago. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Everything was running optimally, all my drivers were up to date and the PC was humming along just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your input and feedback would be greatly appreciated as this is my work PC and I am losing income daily. Next time i will know to backup my backup files and turn off automatic update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I also want to mention the following.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used a fresh install of Windows 10 and chose the repair method, that's how I chose the restore process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to chose anything other than Oct 20th backup, it asks me to browse to where the drivers are and select missing drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How am i supposed to know which drivers are missing or which driver name to chose.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two options in restoring Windows 10. First, you can use the backup recovery of the one that came with your system (this will be from your
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14148/computer-manufacturers-contact-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OEM</a>). Second, is the Microsoft reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make things easier for you, we highly recommend the first option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>John,</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply, would you mind elaborating on your response please</p>
<p>You provided 2 options...</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Use the backup recovery of the one that came with your system"</p>
<p>Could you explain what you mean by recovery that came with my system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to run Windows 7 Ultimate then upgraded to Windows 10 via download.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you tell me where i might find the OEM recovery file ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to restore 8 times now and windows does not see or find any recovery files.</p>
<p>I know where the 5100 files are located with the data, but i have no way of starting the recovery.
</p>
<p>Windows wants me to provide drivers for my devices before we can get started without specifying which device drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>By performing a backup each week, recovery files were created in a folder, that folder is gone at no fault of my own.&nbsp;<br />
When the backup runs, it stores the recovery files into a folder of my F drive named&nbsp;<strong>windowsimagebackup</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span><br />
Therefore, i don't believe there is a recovery file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Second, is the Microsoft reset."</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">What is reset ? do you mean reset the computer to vanilla factory install.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Is there a way to recover from that point ?</span></p>

<p>Windows performed an automated update and removed my <strong>windowsimagebackup

<p>
</p><p>I see the backup files on one of the assigned HDD's used for Backup but there is no image to point to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I somehow reinstall windows 10 then restore those backup files including the system image and configuration files that has all my drivers and configuration history.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            windows 10 - anyway to get acrobat9 as default file view for explorer and to open file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Have tired several ways, even had the tech people at the ms store play with it, no solution so coming hear.&nbsp; using windows 10, I have acrobat reader dc by default.&nbsp; I also have acrobat pro version 9.&nbsp; what I'm looking for is the ability to view files in
 explorer or outlook but also the ability to open a pdf when clicking on it in acrobat pro, NOT reader.&nbsp; Can't seem to do it. I've uninstalled reader, explorer and outlook doesn't accept acrobat pro 9 as a viewer.&nbsp; I've changed the settings in default programs,
 still doesn't work.&nbsp; The tech at the store staid its probably acrobat pro being too old.&nbsp; He didn't say it with too much confidence so was hoping someone over here might have some more insights.</p>
<p>

            I had gone through that previously,&nbsp;it didn't work in the past, so reset that.&nbsp;&nbsp;It now works.&nbsp; I have to say, I know for a fact it didn't work before and it wasn't just me.&nbsp; Two tech guys at the MS store couldn't get it to work either so perhaps there
 was an update.&nbsp; Thanks for getting&nbsp;me to check again.&nbsp;

            ooppsss ...spoke to soon.&nbsp; when I double click the file, it opens in acrobat reader, not acrobat pro.&nbsp; I went back into the settings, default by type, still shows adobe acrobat 9.&nbsp; When I select Set defaults by app, Adobe Acrobat 9 isn't listed, but reader
 is.&nbsp; When I select at the bottom "Choose defaults for this program" at the bottom, the "Set associations for a program" pops up.&nbsp; there is a bunch of file types listed with checkboxes but .pdf is listed and NOT checked.

            no error code, it just open the pdf in acrobat reader dc.&nbsp; tried to uninstall it, and then acrobat 9 would work and open a pdf when clicked on it.&nbsp; however I lost the preview in explorer and outlook so had to reinstall.

            <p>I have Acrobat Pro 9.5 and would love to be able to set it as the default to open pdf files. I've tried to change&nbsp;the default&nbsp;through settings, through the control panel, and through "Open With / Choose Another App / Always Use This App" – nothing will change
 the default to Acrobat Pro. I don't receive an error code, either; it just doesn't change the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a test, I changed the default to open pdf files with Illustrator (I have an older version, CS5), and it worked!</p>
<p>But I can't set Acrobat Pro as the default. A solution to this would be terrific!</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 not respond to ping even enabled firewall ICMPv4 IN and uncheck Internet Protocol V6 at NIC</h2>
                    <p>Searched internet and read a lot posts, but still can't get it fixed:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I've enable the File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-in) (domain/public/private, all of them, just want to test)</p>
<p>2. I've also read some posts say binding of Internet Protocol V6 with the network card could prevent the ping, so I've unchecked the box, disabled the card and re-enabled the card</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing is I still can not get it work. I use Microsoft network monitor 3.4 to monitor the traffic, I see the incoming packets source 192.168.1.101 to this windows 7 box 192.168.1.105&nbsp;&nbsp; (ICMP: Echo Request Message ),&nbsp; but I don't see the reply from this
 box, what's going on ? it's like black hole. </p>
<p>Could anybody shed some light here? Thanks in advance !</p>

<h2>            Duplicate libraries</h2>
                    Several copies of libraries have appeared, I tried deleting but this deleted all libraries and contents. I reloaded files (from USB copy) but the copies also reappeared. How can get rid of extra, unwanted libraries?

            When I looked this up online I found the same thing but when I go to the page for one it does not tell me where to download and unzip to. Also It does not explain how to install, therefore I have not been able to use this hotfix. If you can help with that
 that would be great

<h2>            Signing in to my skype account</h2>
                    <p>Hey!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems i have created two skype accounts on the same email, -&nbsp;&nbsp; 
l.************@******.com</p>
<p>I had the skype name l************4 and now when i sign in using my email and password i get sent to another skype</p>
<p>account with name l.kav.&nbsp; I know that the other account still exists because i can add it to my contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to sign in using my skype name l***********4 and my password but it says that there is a problem.
</p>
<p>Although there shouldn't be a problem because i made a new password. So everything should work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like help to get my account l***************4 back please.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to advise that you try and sign in to this link using just the Skype Name instead of using the email address connected to your old Skype account. Signing in using your email address if it is not yet linked to your old Skype account would only
 create a new one which is the case that happened on your account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to get back the old Skype account, you can try on resetting the password for that one using this link, just remember to use your Skype Name instead of using your email address:
</p>
<p><a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And use this link to sign in with your Skype Profile using the Skype Name you have provided on your thread:<br />
<a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/myaccount</a></p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hello Charles,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve this issue you may follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First, you may try to re-install the Mouse Pad driver/s from the manufacturer’s website by restarting your computer in
<strong>Windows Safe Mode with Networking</strong> option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To restart your computer in Windows Safe Mode with Networking follow the steps from the following Microsoft Article:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not resolve then this issue might occur due to driver incompatibility since upgrading to Windows 10.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve the issue you may try to install the currently available driver for the touchpad from the manufacturer’s website, however make sure to run the driver in compatibility
 mode for your earlier Operating System. For example if you upgraded from Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, you may run the driver in compatibility mode for Windows 8 or Windows 8.1.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do so you may follow the steps as per the following Microsoft Article:
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</span></a><br />
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the above steps help.
</span></p>

<p><span>Thank you.

            Hi Shashi
<br />
<br />The minidump file indicates your Broadcom WiFi device driver (bcmwl664.sys) as the cause of your system crashes
<br />
<br />You should go to the support page for your device on the Dell website, then download and install the Broadcom WiFi driver they recommend - please note on that page, Dell call that Broadcom device a Dell Wireless 1530 . . .

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to install the driver you suggested and got the error as follows :</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have uploaded the Installation log file named 'Network_Driver_71T5D_WN32_7.35.340.0_A03.txt' to the onedrive :</p>
<p>https://onedrive.live.com/?id=9185342AEAA1F191%21134&amp;cid=9185342AEAA1F191</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Shashi</p>

<p>Sorry Dave,</p>

<p>1) To evaluate the BSOD please post logs for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
