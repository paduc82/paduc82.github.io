<h2>            Microsoft HotFix 417038_intl_x64_zip.exe Did NOT Fix My &#34;Screen Freeze&#34; Problem</h2>
                    
<p>I installed the Microsoft HotFix for my "Screen Freeze" problem (KB2265716) on September 23, 2010.&nbsp; Today (9/24/10)&nbsp;my new HP dv7 3160us notebook PC with Windows 7 64 bit had a "Screen Freeze" and I had to hold the power button down for &gt; 5 seconds to shutdown.&nbsp;
 Please fix this persistant random problem!!!</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; This is NOT a hardware problem.</p>
<p>Right now I have IE8 up with 2 tabs (USA Today), Microsoft Outlook, Google Side Bar, Windows Task Manager, Lexar Secure II Dashboard, RoboForm, Microsoft Essentials is scanning and this page.&nbsp; I CAN change displays using the task Bar but CANNOT Close, Minimize,
 Select or Drag any thing on the page. The Task Manager is displaying live data and the CPU usage is low.&nbsp; Google Side Bar is updating.&nbsp; Just now I can access all of the above.&nbsp; I lost control of the display for approximatly 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Well, your problem certainly has nothing whatsoever to do with Windows Update functionality. That being said...</p>
<p>Please answer <strong>all of the following diagnostic questions</strong> by number in your next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. Did you upgrade to Win7 or is it a new computer?</p>
<p>2a. Does this "Screen Freeze" behavior ONLY happen when you're running Internet Explorer (IE8)?</p>
<p>2b. Does it happen in IE8 32-bit AS WELL AS IE8 64-bit?</p>
<p>3. When (approx. date) did you install Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) and was the computer fully-patched at Windows Update at the time?</p>
<p>4. What anti-virus application was installed <em>before you installed MSE</em>, was your subscription still current, and did you uninstall it before you installed MSE?</p>
<p>5. Has a Norton or McAfee application ever been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>6. Did a Norton or McAfee free-trial come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>

<p>!. This is a new (May 2010) HP dv7 3160us Notebook PC with Window 7 64 bit.</p>
<p>2a. I believe that IE8 is usually running when the screen freeze occures.&nbsp; I have many other applications running.&nbsp; I am not normally actively using IE8 when screen freeze occures.</p>
<p>2b. I am running 64 bit IE8.&nbsp; I do not believe I have used IE8 32 bit.</p>
<p>3. I uninstalled Norton 360 trial and installed Microsoft Security Essentials within a week of receipt of the PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same period I installed all available Microsoft updates.&nbsp; The sequence was install Microsoft Security Essentials, install Windows Updates
 then uninstall Norton trial.</p>
<p>4. Norton was not installed but I had to say NO many times before&nbsp;I uninstalled it.</p>
<p>5. Neither Norton or McAfee were ever installed on this HP dv7 3160us Notebook PC.</p>
<p>6 Norton free trial was included on my HP notebook PC.</p>
<p>I use my Dell XPS 420 desktop with Vista 32 bit.&nbsp; I am so disapointed and disgusted with my new HP dv7 3160us Notebook PC that I only run it while&nbsp;I am using my Dell desktop.&nbsp; I run IE8, Windows Task Manager, Google Side Bar and a couple of other applications
 to see now long it will run without screen freeze.&nbsp; I ran 2 weeks with the battery removed on a UPS untill it had 2 screen freezes&nbsp;within an hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;My HP dv7 3160us is a boat anchor and can not be used for any serious work.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have contacted HP but there is
 little they can do because&nbsp;my HP dv7 screen freeze problem is random.&nbsp; I have been searching the web for solutions but found only many other people that had the same problem.</p>

<p>Norton (and McAfee) applications are notorious for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. I suspect the Norton "leftovers" may have been causing all of your problems.</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Ideally, you would have uninstalled the Norton 360 free-trial AND run the Norton Removal Tool (see below) BEFORE you installed Microsoft Security Essentials AND BEFORE you installed any Windows Updates.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Win7 64-bit includes two versions of IE8: IE8 64-bit (the default) and IE8 32-bit. The executable for IE8 64-bit is located here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe</strong></p>
<p>The executable for IE8 32-bit is located here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe</strong></p>
<p>See this previous discussion for more details &amp; info about IE8 64-bit vs. IE8 32-bit on a Win7 64-bit computer:&nbsp;<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/InternetExplorer/thread/babaa5f8-ff06-4ea2-aef6-a9416d65f981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/InternetExplorer/thread/babaa5f8-ff06-4ea2-aef6-a9416d65f981</a></p>
<p><strong>ACTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>1. Download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop: 
ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/removal_tools/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe</p>
<p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>3. Right-click on the file you saved in #1 above and select Run as Administrator to run the utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>4. Reset IE8 32-bit (and then&nbsp;IE8 64-bit, if necessary) per <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Open&nbsp;IE8 32-bit&nbsp;(only) to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a>&nbsp;[ignore APPLIES TO section]&nbsp;&amp; run the Fix It in DEFAULT and then AGGRESSIVE modes. [1]</p>
<p>6. Reboot once more &amp; test.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
[1] Full Disclosure: Running the Fix It in AGGRESSIVE mode will delete your Update History but not the list of Installed Updates.</p>

<p>Today, Sunday October 3 at about 11 AM, I had a "Screen Freeze".&nbsp; The last time I ran my HP dv7 Notebook PC was Friday night.&nbsp; I am running on a UPS with the HP dv7 battery removed.&nbsp; I started the HP dv7 and then stepped away to do something.&nbsp; When I came
 back a few minutes later and the screen was frozen.&nbsp; There were no applications running.&nbsp; Only my Google Side Bar and Windows Task Manager were running.&nbsp; I tried all keys, the touchpad and my Bluetooth mouse but the HP dv7 did not respond and screen freeze
 did not go away.&nbsp; I took pictures of the screen with my camera and held the power button down for &gt; 5 seconds to shutdown.&nbsp; I&nbsp;believe most of my screen freezes occur shortly after computer startup and after a day or more on nonuse.</p>
<p>Are there any Windows Error Logs that might help find an answer to this problem?&nbsp;&nbsp; What if I wait to see if the HP dv7 comes out of Screen Freeze by itself.&nbsp; Would there be any&nbsp;helpful&nbsp;Windows Error Logs?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;I was connected to the internet and installed Microsoft Security Essentials immediatetly on receipt of my HP dv7.&nbsp; I had my LAN setup within a couple of days of receipt of my HP dv7&nbsp;but not without problems. I had less than full LAN capability.&nbsp; Norton
 was a free trial program.&nbsp; It wanted to install each time&nbsp;I booted up but I said NO.&nbsp; After a couple of weeks saying NO, I decided the free trial Norton was a pain so I uninstalled it.&nbsp; Norton was never activated.</p>
<p>2&nbsp; YES&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) has always been auto updating.&nbsp; My update history confirms MSE daily updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3&nbsp;YES&nbsp; I can and do a Windows update manually (check for available updates).&nbsp; In many cases I find updates that have not been auto installed yet.&nbsp; Whenever I run a manual scan on MSE it checks for updates before it runs.&nbsp; I have checked for updates on MSE
 but normally it is up-to-date.</p>
<p>4&nbsp; YES&nbsp; I have auto update and auto install set and Windows including MSE are up-to-date.&nbsp; If I run Belarc Advisor, it says windows is up-to-date but does not check MSE.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
A week ago, you told us that you'd&nbsp;"uninstalled Norton 360 trial and installed Microsoft Security Essentials within a week of receipt of the PC."</p>
<p>I have nothing further to suggest here&nbsp;except&nbsp;to recommend that you only obtain&nbsp;any driver updates from the device or computer manufacturers' download page only, NOT Windows Update.</p>
<p>Assuming you've installed one or more driver updates (e.g., for your graphics card) offered by Windows Update, try rolling back the driver(s):</p>

<h2>            My Samsung MR HMD keeps going black while in use.</h2>
                    <p>I just got the Samsung mixed reality headset and Where it is suppose to be plug and play I have one problem after another. I ended up buying a new motherboard and all and now I am at my wits end. As I use the display it will randomly go black and I still
 hear sounds and things as if I am moving. At this rate I am thinking of returning it if I cannot find a solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I will go over what I have tried. I have switched HDMI ports, restarted the computer, turned off the ability to let the computer disable the device to save power. Switched USB ports. Unplugged it and plugged it back in. Updated drivers of all kinds (graphics,
 USB, etc) Switched screen resolutions. Tried to set up multiple display but the MR headset does not count.&nbsp; So yeah I have been going through the motions trying to get this thing to work right any help would be greatly appreciated before I have to return it.</p>

<h2>            so UPS took my cinsole to Germany... how do I track the repair&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>As the title suggests, my console has gone to be repaired. The courier took it and I was able to track it right up until it arrived at the repair centre. How do I track the repair?</p>

<p>Just had another alert from Microsoft that my console is on it's way back to the UK from the German repair centre. Looks like I will have it back next week, not bad Microsoft considering it was only picked up last Monday. Hopefully my drive will be working
 now. Getting excited here all over again LOL</p>

<p>Me too, in terms of faffing with the license transfer business, I would rather have the same one back. The also gave me a copy of Zoo Tycoon after I had a moan. Which was the least the could do in my opinion.

 too!!</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail no longer seems to be working.</h2>
                    <p>I am aware that Live Mail is from Windows Essentials and I have used for a few years.</p>
<p>But it has been playing up in the last few months.</p>
<p>Live Mail opens but it stalls at 'checking' but no emails are collected and soon it has to be stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have heard Live Mail and some other Windows Essentials software (such MovieMaker) is being phased out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the current status of Live Mail and will an announcement be made of a date when Live Mail will officially stop working?</p>

<p>Bruce, I think Live Mail seems to be working again.</p>
<p>I am still with POP3 and changed the outgoing port to 465 (I had it at 25).</p>

</p><p>I sent a message as a test and it worked - though oddly slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll next try IMAP.</p>
<p>But meanwhile thanks, Bruce.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BT's WebMailer is unsophisticated. For example, in composing an email, you can't drag a string of text elsewhere. You have to cut it, then paste in the new location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again. (I must remember to restart the computer)</p>

<p>Hello Bruce:</p>
<p>I've just checked that my email provider (BT from UK) does not support IMAP.</p>
<p>So I will carry on with POP3</p>
<p>Thought I'd let you know.</p>

<p>I wonder where you got that from. It's several years since they started allowing IMAP access, probably because iPhones don't do POP3. See here:

<p>Well, none other than BT's&nbsp; CHAT assistant told me that IMAP is <em>not</em> supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went to my account and into Properties - Servers. I tried to type 'IMAP' over POP3. The latter wouldn't budge!</p>
<p>So the CHAT girl must be right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, Noel, you must have got it wrong. (By the way, I use a Desktop, not a mobile.)</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the zip containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply. Prefered sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel-Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel-Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel-Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel-Dump is the best
 choice. Do note that Kernel-Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong></em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload photos and files to Onedrive.</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete .DMP files upon use.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />

<br />

I SOLVED the problem...<br />
In my tray I have "Wireless Network Connection 3" and "RTL8187B is connected to something".<br />
If I open the Advanced setting and it only shows General and Advanced tab, my connection will be slow (tested around 128 kb/sec).<br />
<br />
Things I do is open service.msc and start the Wireless Zero Configuration and check that option. download restored to 600 kb/sec.

<h2>            Skype for Business presence shows &#39;Away&#39; when in a meeting.</h2>
                    I am using Skype for Business 2016 client with SfB Server 2015 on the back end. This infrastructure is all on premise. I have set the client to "Update my presence based on my calendar information". This works and shows that I am in a meeting when the
 meeting starts. Problem is that the majority of my meetings are in a conference room. That means I lock my computer and go to the meeting. When the computer locks, my presence changes from 'In a meeting' to 'Away'. How can I make that continue to say 'In a
 meeting'? Do I need to fix something in the client or in a policy on the server?

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, I understand your skype for business client presence show “Away” when you lock computer although actually you are in meeting.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I assume that your skype for business client is for windows. Generally, for skype for business online client, there is no settings about changing the presence as your described. And from your description, I know the infrastructure is all on premises,
 there might be some settings about it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not the admin on premises, please contact your admin for help. If you are, you can seek help via below link:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=sfbfr&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=sfbfr&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc</a>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>And I searched that Instant messaging (IM) and presence always run on Enterprise Edition Front End pools and Standard Edition servers. I hope it may help you.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
Follow the below steps to disable the interactive service dialog detection windows and check whether the issue is resolved or not.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Start and type in services.msc in the search box hit enter. <br />
b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate the Interactive Services Detection service. <br />
c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on the service and stop it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;Note: Interactive Services Detection enables user notification of user input for interactive services, which enables access to dialogs created by interactive services when they appear. If this service is stopped, notifications of new interactive service dialogs
 will no longer function and there might not be access to interactive service dialogs. If this service is disabled, both notifications of and access to new interactive service dialogs will no longer function.</span></p>

<h2>            Cannot permanently unpin Windows 10 Taskbar icons</h2>
                    <p>We are running Windows 10 enterprise and a few users are having issues deleting icons such as Internet Explorer from the taskbar. There seem to be a few fixes around on the internet, we've tried all of them to no avail. What we have tried so far is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- deleting</p>
<p>
</p><p>"%AppData%\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar\*"</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Taskband /F<br />
<br />
- checking all GPOs</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can delete/unpin the icons, but they return. At this moment in time it only seems to be Internet Explorer, I'm not sure about other icons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? TIA</p>

<h2>            Windows starts to boot but then stops</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron 1545 that will start to boot windows, but then will stop. &nbsp;Here is what I have done:
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tried Salvation HDD Repair-no success</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tried Hiren Boot CD-no success</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ran Memtest: No errors</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tried Safe mode: no suceess</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Booted Helix to save files-no success</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Booted knoppix to save files-no success</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Used Fedora 17 to save files-success</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I tried safe mode a blue screen of death flashed and the computer turned off. If I start up windows and then let it boot, it will flash me back to the screen that pops up when I first start up that tells me windows had a problem starting and that
 I can try to start windows or launch recovery if I lock recovery the computer locks up.&nbsp;</div>

            I wasn't able to read what the blue screen of said because it didn't stay up, it flahsed the blue screen and a split second later shut off the computer. I guess I'll have to contact Dell. Thanks for the help.

            Hi,  Margaritabarre
<br />
<br />my name is Milagros, Independent Advisor
<br />
<br />Si la impresora está encendida y conectada a la red, Windows debería encontrarla fácilmente. Las impresoras disponibles pueden incluir todas las impresoras de una red, como las impresoras Bluetooth e inalámbricas, o las impresoras que estén conectadas a otro equipo y se compartan en la red. Es posible que necesites permiso para instalar algunas impresoras.
<br />
<br />Conecta el cable USB de la impresora a tu dispositivo y asegúrate de que esté activada.
<br />
<br />Selecciona el botón Inicio  y luego Configuración  &gt; Dispositivos &gt; Impresoras y escáneres.
<br />
<br />Selecciona Agregar una impresora o un escáner. 
<br />
<br />Espera a que aparezcan las impresoras próximas, luego elige la que quieras usar y selecciona Agregar dispositivo.
<br />
<br />Si la impresora no aparece en la lista, selecciona La impresora que me interesa no aparece y, a continuación, sigue las instrucciones para agregarla manualmente usando una de las opciones.
<br />

            Will do. Thanks for your input. However, I did just try this: I unpinned the Chase tile on my desktop computer and tried to repin. Got a tile marked P-Microsoft. Tile would not open unless I right clicked and then it took me to the browser page.

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I've been running Windows 7 Professional (64-bit) for several years. Last week, though, a Windows Activation Technologies message popped up saying "This computer is not running genuine Windows." When
 I follow the "Resolve online now" link, it has me download a file: &nbsp;</span>legitcheck.hta</p>
<p>I run this and get the result:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Windows could not be validated as genuine &nbsp;<br />
The validation service couldn't determine whether the copy of Windows that is running on your computer is genuine. Please try to validate Windows again. If you keep getting validation errors, try to again later or contact support."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not done any recent hardware changes or software installations. Please let me know if you have any suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the recommendation in another post, I ran the MGADiag.exe and pasted the diagnostic report here:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">i have tried everything on ur site to connect to xboxlive and it still fails every time on the first one i think the reason is my nat type is too strict and im preatty sure that reflects the connection speed
 sooooo that means thats just another thing u need to pay extra for it seems that everything to do anything on xbox u have to just buy is that all. also i can play on ps3 for free and guess what i can actually play online becuse the people at sony r apparently
 smarter to wher u can play with like the lowest high speed connection so y cant i on xbox is it all u care about is money.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p>There is a chance it is the ISP you have. The NAT type can be changed in your router that's not an internet problem it can be fixed going through your router configurations and setting I believer there are sticky forums explaining how to do this:) .. if
 you think it's the speed of your internet check www.speakeasy.net for a speed tool to see what your internet speed is anything under 1 Mbps and you might be being throttled . I hope things can get fixed for you

<p>Hi NAT issues can usually be resolved by the user </p>
<p>Please read:- <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/t/9.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../9.aspx</a></p>
<p>And post back your details in full (the bits that are in bold on that post) so that people may help</p>
<p>If you are wireless can you also state whether you are using the white or black external adapter or the Xbox 360S Internal adapter</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I'm sorry but i actually don't think that was very good response but i have a good suggestion 1: you could get a wireless internet and a wireless device that may get u a better connection but there is a problem if u get a 3g or a 4g i would get higher if
 I were you because it may not work as good or peform lag I hope this helps you :) hope you have fun on the xbox web sight</p>

The "<strong>Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library error </strong>" may be caused due to some program or service running at the startup.&nbsp; Perform the clean boot process to check which program/service is causing this error at startup.<br />
