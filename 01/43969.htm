<p><strong>Hi-</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Anyone know how to change the background color? I have a pic for my background, but I don't like the color that is on the sides of it. (I have it on "center").&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Right click on desktop and come to personalise. click on Windows color on the bottom and click "Advance appearence settings" and in Item drop down menu by default you will see "Desktop" if not then select it and in the color1 on the right side select the
 color you want on the sides of your background and click apply and ok. Hope it helps!</p>
<p>Good Luck.</p>

<h2>            child account and restricted mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since upgrading to Windows 10, I've had problems with YouTube and the restricted mode always turning back on. I know this isn't a new question but regardless, I think I found the problem. Everything related to Google (i.e YouTube) is linked to my gmail
 account. Again, nothing new there, but there's an account on my laptop which is in the name of my gmail account. I don't what it's doing there but that's not the problem. No, the problem is that it's a child account. From what I've heard, this seems to be
 the cause to my problem and all I have to do is turn it off. However, I don't where to do that. I went onto Microsoft Family and there was nothing, I've looked through the settings and nothing and I've followed YouTube videos explaining how I do it but it's
 solution is always Microsoft Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dat</p>

<h2>            I can make a recovery drive, but it is not valid when I try to use it to restore or refresh my PC.</h2>
                    Upgraded to Windows 8 Pro 64 bit from Windows 7 Pro 64 bit. After experiencing some trouble with the AMD graphics drivers (missing tabs) I wanted to refresh the PC, or, if that didn't work, restore back to the defaults.

<div>Using the included utility, I can make a recovery drive on a USB drive. The files total about 223 MB. No errors.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I try to restore/refresh the PC, however, it first reports that "some files are missing", even though the recovery disk is connected. After pulling out the USB drive and reconnecting, the error is "The media inserted is not valid."</div>
<div><br />

<div>Why can't I make a valid recovery drive?</div>

Maybe you need to restore the boot files first?&nbsp; There are advanced options for doing that...</p>

<p>Apparently that message is expected for your scenario.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knew?</p>

<p>(BING search for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "some files are missing" recovery windows<br />
)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, my tack (curiosity) would be to try to get more information about the missing files, perhaps by looking for changed files and readable log files.</p>

            <p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with Windows 10. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the web browser you're using? <br />
- How long have you had this issue? <br />
<br />
The 502 Bad Gateway error is an HTTP status code which means means that one server received an invalid response from another server that it was accessing while attempting to load the web page or fill another request by the browser.<br />
<br />
The 502 Bad Gateway error is usually a network error between servers, meaning the problem is not with your computer or internet connection.<br />
<br />
The error may be temporary. Try refreshing the webpage or re-enter the address in the address bar and check. Trying to reload the page often fixes the issue.<br />
<br />
Since the 502 Bad Gateway error message is an issue with the web site's network, there could be a technical glitch from the server. You may want to wait for a while before loading the website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please post in case you have any further issues, I will be glad to help you further.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Web Camera not working for Sony Vaio &#40;No image device found&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have had this laptop for years, and I've had this problem come up every now and again where the web cam isn't reading when I'm on skype, therefore no video calling (which isn't a huge deal, it's just annoying.) A few times, it fixed itself when I turned
 it off, removed the charger, then plugged it in before turning it back on. It's been about 2-3 years since my last issue with the web cam. Can someone for the love of god explain to me how to fix this? I literally used the web cam just fine last night and
 all of a sudden today it doesn't want to work.<br />
<br />
I've tried going to the device manager and the "imaging devices" tab isn't there either.

<p>
</p><p>But at the bottom where the selection is for the ports, there's 2 "Unknown USB Device (Device descriptor request failed)" options with the yellow triangles and when I click the information for both of them, a code 43 error is shown. Please help!!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65ccd4c2-f340-4946-b62f-25033faaf8a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65ccd4c2-f340-4946-b62f-25033faaf8a0" /></a></p>

            <p>It's a built in camera so I can't really just unplug it. It simply wasn't reading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I did get it to work by something called a "static reset". It's sounded odd to me at first, but with my luck, nothing else I had tried working. I had already disabled, re-enabled, uninstalled, and reinstalled everything and it didn't budge. But
 once I did the static reset, &nbsp;the Imaging Devices option appeared and the web cam was being read again. -eyeroll- Thank you very much for your time anyways though!</p>

<p><br />
insert your SD card into your pc then go to control panel, in classic view choose add new hardware and follow it. see if that helps!</p>
<p>otherwise make sure that your sd card is working properly. try reinstalling driver software.</p>

<h2>            Where is my product key located in windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    Can I find it in my registry or anything? I want to download an iso version of windows 8 but I can't find my product key. I heard this http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only&nbsp;&nbsp; gives an iso version of clean windows 8 directly
 from microsoft but I need my product key. I heard about it from this other website http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only.

            <p>Did Windows 8 come preinstalled on your computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, the best option is to upgrade to through the Store on the Start Screen:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/how-to-upgrade-from-windows-8-to-windows-8-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/how-to-upgrade-from-windows-8-to-windows-8-1/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If purchased Windows 8 online and installed it, then you should be able to retrieve your product key:</p>
<p>Go to the order summary page, there you will find your product key:</p>

<p>Tommytucka,</p>
<p>I think your issue is that of the iPhone headsets as you describe aren't compatible (OMTP)</p>
<p>You can find some options on Amazon and Ebay but I wont link them just in case the one I link doesn't actually work. &nbsp;I do know that these converters exist but after trying two, I ended up just buying a xbox one brand headset</p>

<h2>            my computer crashes after 20 minutes</h2>
                    no matter what i'm doing - if i'm on the internet, not using the computer or on word, for example, the computer crashes every time after twenty minutes of running. i have to turn it off manually and i can't work out what the problem is - i have done virus
 scans and since i'm useless with computers i have no idea what the problem could be. if anyone could be of any assistance that would be wonderful.

<p><span><br />
<br />
Let‚Äôs follow these steps &amp; check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>You may boot into ‚ÄòSafe mode‚Äô and check if the issue reoccurs. It will start Windows 7 with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed, follow the steps
 to boot the computer in safe mode with networking:</span></p>
<p><span>i. Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>ii. Start tapping F8 key.</span></p>
<p><span>iii. You will get advanced boot option window.</span></p>
<p><span>iv. Select the option ‚ÄúSafe mode with Networking‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Refer: </span></b><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></a></span><b><span><br />
<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Step 2</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the issue doesn‚Äôt persist in safe mode, you may configure the computer in clean boot state and check if the issue reappears. It will start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs and helps to eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the step 7 from the article: How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows7:

<h2>            KB40388788 and Video TDR Failure atikmpag.sys</h2>
                    <p>Since Microsoft installed the update KB40388788, I am getting Video TDR Failures when my PCs wake from sleep. This is occurring on two different desktop PCs with ATI Radeon video cards running two monitors One is a 4600 and the other a 4200. If I uninstall
 the update the stop errors no longer occur. Of course, you reinstall the update over night and the errors return. The BSOD does get past the trouble, but it restarts the PCs and I lose any work I had in progress on them. I have searched the Microsoft web support
 but do not find any <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">current</span></strong> articles.&nbsp; Here is a screen shot of the Blue Screen:</p>

            Hello Mickey -

Is there a newer Display driver on the PC model or Display Device's Support Downloads webpage?    You can run the AMD Autodetect to confirm:  http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx

Roll back the Update via WIndows Update settings for Installed Updates or System Restore, then ensure you are collecting BSOD information to submit following http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d.

Then if it happens again, roll it back one last time and run the tool to hide problem Updates as they are offered:  https://www.guidingtech.com/48828/delay-disable-mandatory-updates-windows-10/

Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I ran the ATI driver tool and got no newer driver.&nbsp; I have also reported it to them and have a case number there.&nbsp; Their suggestion is also uninstalling the update.&nbsp; As I mentioned, it gets reinstalled the next night.&nbsp; While the update is uninstalled,
 Windows Defender warns me that I am missing security updates, so I don't think hiding the update is a very good answer.&nbsp; I hope Microsoft will fix this in the next release.

<p>I installed a different video card in one desktop, an ATI Fire GL 3600 with dual DVI ports.&nbsp; With the update installed it still gets the stop error on waking from sleep.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the update from the other desktop and it wakes from sleep with no issues, but Defender says I need to restart the PC and going to settings and updates reveals the machine is trying to reinstall the update right back.&nbsp; See screen the shots below.</p>

            Did you attempt to hide the Update per the link in my first post?  This may be your only option for now.  

Then post this up big and bold in the Feedback Hub in your Start Menu to alert Windows Update if they are not tracking it on telemetry - an issue I've brought up with them that the tool should trigger.

If you'll link back to your Feedback posting I'll elevate it from MVP channel, too, as I have been working on this issue to see that the Hide Updates tool trigger telemetry.

            I bought a NVidia Quatro FX 3450 off eBay to see if it is affected by the error.&nbsp; Turns out there are no Windows 10 drivers for it.&nbsp; I did get a call from tier 2 support Saturday.&nbsp; They are aware of the error, but there will probably not be a fix until
 the next release.

<p><span>System Restore</span><span>
 is a very useful feature of Windows </span><span>Vista</span><span> but it has one main
 drawback. After running for a few weeks, it can use a lot of your hard </span><span>disk space</span><span>.
 With the default settings turned on, System Restore might use up to 15 percent of the space on each disk. For example, if you have a 250GB
</span><span>hard disk drive</span><span>, System Restore might end up using 37,5GB of
 it. </span></p>

</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />

<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;quick scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the
<strong><span>Scan</span></strong> button to start scanning your computer
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malware<strong><span>
</span></strong>removal process.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the
<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span></p>

<h2>            Fable Anniversary, lagging all the time and random freezes ...</h2>
                    
<p>So i saw quite a few threads relating to this issue, and still on this day it is not fixed for anyone on the xbox 360 ... i wrote this on an old thread :<br />
<br />
"""&nbsp;<span>Still a problem, noticed this was an issue a year ago, and i got it as a gift from a friend 1 week ago, and the lag and frame issues and random freezes still exist, if you release a game that is this broken atleast fix it and stop having your heads
 up the *** lionhead, because this is just unforgivable ... more then a year without a single fix ... bah! &nbsp;""""<br />
<br />
</span>Yes, it is quite a rage since i find the lack of effort from lionhead into fixing this game very disturbing, how can you release a graphical remake of the best fable ever made and leave it broken like this and absolutely ignoring the fanbase ... i don't
 get it&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And then i got this reply from Miss Diggz, but sadly it's not resolved at all, and i'm not only speaking for myself here, i'm pretty sure of that :<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>[quote]Hey there Blasti27,</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear about the issue. Since this thread is pretty old and the original poster most likely has been resolved, I would suggest creating a new thread detailing what you're experiencing. This way our awesome community offer support to you more specifically.
 Thanks![/quote]<br />
<br />
So hopefully someone has some tips that are not on these forums, i tried all the stuff that is on the forums/comments on threads relating to " solving " this issue, and nothing works, since i'm confident it's the game itself that is broken, i have noticed a
 mate of mine has it working fine on the PC after the tons of traveling and funking around in files, so there must be an option to solve it on the xbox 360 aswell&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Anyways thanks for the time to read this, hope this will be fixed soon</p>

<p>Prison race is &nbsp;'slow motion' glitch when running &nbsp;or just stopping. it is impossible to win the race.</p>
<p>I was using a wireless but went out and brought a wired controller. I thought it would work better. But did &nbsp;no. I did the update but that did not help anything I needed.</p>
<p>Should go out and buy new disk ?? Its less money now. I just brought a new controller. Or just walk away. But I am near the finish. &nbsp;Any Ideas</p>

<p>I had 2 hero they could not get out of Prison. ( I made a second one because I could not get out.)But I did get out &nbsp;by rolling, if you can believe that. When you roll you get away from the others. Is that a &nbsp;glitch or what to have to rolled. I do not think
 thats what lionhead was trying to do?? Now both of my heroes are out. </p>
<p>But this was not fun. And I will not buy anything more from lionhead again. They do not care so I will not buy. &nbsp;Too many people were having some kind of problems, and they did nothing.</p>

<p>@VisualCanoe i agree with not buying from them anymore, the least they could do is say they work on it, but they completely ignore it, for all i care they can shove the games up their buttholes
</p>
<p>Anyways i made this post to see if there is a solution for this game to be fixed, but the people o this site are not the ones to blame, it's not Xbox fault here, ah well, was worth hoping for, i guess i just have to face the facts i will never finish Fable

<p>It might be a longshot, but I'm curious if anyone knows where I can get a MS Gift Card for my US Xbox One in Korea. &nbsp;I've searched online, but I'd prefer to purchase a physical card from a physical location. &nbsp; Online purchases with a Korean bank card are
 a big headache. &nbsp;Thanks for the help!</p>

 I tried disconnecting and connecting my Spotify account but that hasn't worked.

<h2>            PROBLEMA GTA ONLINE &#40;SOY NUEVO&#41;.</h2>
                    
<p>Hola que tal hace unos dias cree una sesion en xbox one y comenze a jugar un juego llamado GTA V o Grand Theft Auto V. Pero el caso es que jugaba en modo historia y cuando queria tambien iniciaba sesion en gta online pero hoy 02/01/2015 decidi jugar y me
 dice que mi sesion no tiene permisos para jugar gta online y que vuelva a gta V. Quisiera saber que pasa o si tiene que ver con algo de xbox live que no casi nada de ese tema asi que podrian explicarme que pasa y que es eso de xbox live , gold, silver y eso.
 Gracias.</p>
<p>PD:Siempre jugue gta5 sin xbox live solo wifi y no pasaba nada.</p>
