<h2>            Windows 10 will not detect Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver</h2>
                    <p>I was reorganizing my USB connections and unplugged the Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver, when I went to plug it back in the green light no longer lit up.&nbsp; I tried
<span>repositioning it into it's original USB location and it still doesn't light up.&nbsp; I've tried every USB outlet I have on my PC now and it still does not light up.&nbsp; I checked my device manager and it showed it greyed out, so I uninstalled it and tried to

 reinstall and it no longer shows up in my device manager list at all.&nbsp; Nor are there any Unknown Devices in the list that could possibly be it.&nbsp; In fact I have a second Wireless Receiver I attempted to use on my PC and it also does not work in any USB position
 on my PC.&nbsp; So alternatively I tried using the reveivers on both of my laptops (so a total of 3 PCs I've tried all running the latest update of Windows 10) and it does not detect either of them.&nbsp; My Surface Pro 3 never had the drivers installed to being with
 so it should have automatically detected and installed them but it does not detect it at all.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now interestingly enough, I recently purchased a Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse, when used it was extremely laggy across my screen and no settings seemed to change that.&nbsp; I turned my old worn out mouse back on at the same time, a Microsoft Wireless
 Mobile Mouse 4000, and there was no lag issues with that mouse</span>.&nbsp; I would have them both on and the new mouse lagged and the old one did not.&nbsp; So in an effort to try and fix it, I uninstalled the drivers for the new Sculpt mouse and I can no longer reinstall
 that mouse.&nbsp; I had to purchase a new one to replace my brand new mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems as if Windows 10 does not take kindly to uninstalling drivers, since once you do, you can no longer reinstall them and get
<span>peripheral devices to work once you do.&nbsp; Not to mention in some cases Windows 10 does not seem to recogize devices when plugged in and automatically download the appropriate drivers required.</span></p>
<span>peripheral devices to work once you do.&nbsp; Not to mention in some cases Windows 10 does not seem to recogize devices when plugged in and automatically download the appropriate drivers required.</span></p>
<p><span>I have never experienced this problem before the new big update I received on all my Windows 10 computers.</span><span>&nbsp; I tried doing a system restore to yesterday when I was having no problems the recovery failed and removed all of my restore points,
 I am no longer able to restore to previous working copies.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone have any thoughts on why Windows 10 won't discovery new devices, or why I can't seem to reinstall old ones?&nbsp; Or why removing them stops them from working?</span></p>

<p>I cannot print from my Windows 7 pc desktop to my printer.</p>
<p>Printer works fine from plug in wall to printer - will make copies just fine that way.</p>
<p>Computer added my printer as default - that part is fine.</p>
<p>When I try to print from the computer to the printer I receive a message showing the printer is in queue 1 document waiting for printing, but it will not print.</p>
<p>I've tried unplugging the USB cord and plugging it into another USB port, but that does not work either.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to wifi after updating to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    After updating my laptop from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1, I have found that I am no longer able to connect to my wifi. I read the help section which told me that if I have Windows 8.1 I will not be able to connect to a domain, and that in fact I can only
 do so with either Windows 8.1 Pro or Enterprise. This leaves me with a huge problem, as due to not being able to connect to my wifi I am unable to resolve this issue! Please help! I am a student and unfortunately I cannot go without the Internet, it is pretty
 essential and I have been supplied with no information whatsoever as to how to resolve this issue. Thanks.

<h2>            How to Export WMP Playlist &#43; Songs Together&#63;</h2>
                    I know I can copy the playlist file easily, but what about all the songs?&nbsp; I made a playlist on my PC but decided it will work better if on my laptop for better mobility around the house etc....&nbsp; so is there a way to copy the playlist AND the songs in
 that playlist automatically?&nbsp; I have like 100 songs in there so going through one by one manually will be painful, on top of the fact that the file structure may get screwed up?&nbsp; Not sure how that works with the "Library."<br />
<br />
Oh and what if the laptop is NOT Win 7?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            This is why people get frustrated with windows and move elsewhere. WMP has not had a significant update in years and this is starting to become very visible... This should not be difficult thing to do.

<div>What you should have told the user was to sync his playlist to an external drive then copy that music to the desired location from the external drive.</div>

<h2>            &#34;They&#39;re already part of your family&#34; - Bug on Microsoft Account &#40;Family Safety&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having trouble adding my son's account to my account. When I try to add him I see the message that the account is already part of the family, however the main family safety page shows only myself
 and my wife. My son's account does not appear at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have contacted Microsoft account Chat Support and telephone support. They have verified using remote control what I describe. we have tried 2 PCs and 3 browsers. They are sure it is a problem with
 my Microsoft Account on your servers, not a PC problem and they have told me to escalate it to you. It seems there is no way for them to escalate it electronically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For background, when I first tried to add my son he did appear as "pending". He received an email inviting him to join. However, when he "accepted" nothing happened - he remained "pending" and we
 never got an email saying he had joined (spam folder checked!). So, in desperation, we removed him from the family and tried to re-add and when we did that we ended up with the current problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can check on what is causing the issue and have it rectified. Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attached are 2 screen shots showing the issue. Obviously I have hidden the email addresses, but the main "family" page shows just 2 adults - myself and my wife. The 2nd shows me trying to add my son.
 The email address is not one of those shown on the first page, yet it tells me his is "part of the family".</p>

            <p>Sorry, but you have been misdirected. &nbsp;This is primarily a peer-to-peer Community Forum, with no direct link to Microsoft's Development Teams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to report direct to the Windows 10 Development Team is to use the Feedback App built in to Windows 10. &nbsp;Just type 'Feedback' into the Search Box on the Task Bar, select the app and follow the guide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you get a solution soon.</p>

            <p>I have already been through using "Feedback" and several passes through "Answer Desk "- chat and telephone. Initially I did refuse to post here because I am fully aware of forums and how they normally work. However, I was ASSURED there are Microsoft staff
 here who intervene on account issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really am going crazy trying to find anyone to own this issue and fix it. Everyone in Microsoft - Windows team (telephone and chat), Accounts and Billing, Password Reset - they all agree there is a server-side issue here and no one has the tools to fix.
 I am assured that someone here (maybe lurking?!) can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are there, thanks for helping!</p>

            <p>Never mind, with no help from about (literally!) a dozen Microsoft Support people, who either just passed me to a different team or directed me to community support I found my own answer. it seems if the family member is signed on to any device when you
 remove them then the disappear from the family safety page, but they stay associated with your account. Even when I deleted my wife and myself from the family (so family safety screen looks like it is a first time setup) and tried to re-invite my son STILL
 it said he was already in the family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To&nbsp;re-add them I had to make sure that they were not logged on with ANY device. Then I could send a new invite. I'm not sure if resetting family safety by removing all family members was necessary too. If just logging the person off from all devices does
 not fix it that would be worth trying too.</p>

            <p>sadly this solution did not work for me.</p>
<p>It is clear from all the clueless techs I have spoken to that nobody at Microsoft has any idea how family safety works or is able to support it, nor could they care less that it is completely broken.</p>
<p>Every aspect of family safety is unreliable. The screen time settings will randomly stop working and your kids will either start using previous settings, give them unlimited time or just block them entirely. Blocked apps and sites will randomly be allowed,
 allowing your kids to view inappropriate websites, and allowed apps will randomly be blocked continuously requesting you to allow them again.</p>
<p>I would not recommend anyone relies on family safety to protect their kids. One support tech actually admitted to me that they know it is broken and I will simply have to wait until they fix it. Which means they are intentionally ignoring everyone on these
 forums and letting everyone think their kids are safe when they are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The last person I Spoke to was&nbsp;Medha on 28/10/2015, who after pointlessly clicking around the family safety website for a while and trying to ADD CHILD about 10 times and getting the same error,
 he obviously realised he had no idea how to solve the problem and then called me and stated that Microsoft do not provide any support for family safety other than on the forums, even though I have an ASSURE plan. T</span></span><span>his
 is&nbsp;<span>clearly</span>&nbsp;a complete fob off, as he could have said that right from start as could any of the other answerdesk techs I spoke to ove rthe last few weeks, instead of me spending numerous hours with them in live chat and
 a remote support session.&nbsp;</span><span><span>He also promised that if I posted here that he would make sure someone replied to me and solved my issue, yea right.</span></span><br />

            Yeah, it seems cl;ear that family safety is essentially unsupported! There is no support route other than "community", i.e. user-to-user, support. Hopeless!

            <p>I was able to fix this in a different way:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Add the child using a different email (account2), doesn't matter which one as long as you can access it</li><li>Sign the child in with the email you want them to use (account1) at: account.microsoft.com</li><li>Open the email invitation from Microsoft sent to (account2)</li><li>You should get a prompt saying you're already logged in as (account1), would you like to accept the invitation as this user?</li><li>Say yes, and the child will join the family with account1.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully that works for anyone reading this!</p>

            <p>I upgraded my kids to Windows 10, I really had nothing to lose now since family safety was not working at all for anyone.</p>
<p>So far things seems to be working. I had one child whole computer would not show under her user, I fixed this by switching her to an administrator and back again, and then she showed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it would appear that Microsoft have Family Safety only work on Windows 10, and have completely screwed anyone using windows 7 or 8, quite intentionally as well it would seem from my discussion with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly family safety is not recommended if you want to actually keep your kids safe.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 GUI</h2>
                    <p>I despise the appearance of Windows 8/10, it's lazy, less productive, and absolutely hideous.&nbsp; The&nbsp;<strong>ONLY</strong> reason I still use Windows 7 is for the aesthetic.&nbsp; There are a lot of people, though still a minority, that feel similarly about flat
 design; I've even had people tell me I'm "lucky" to still have a choice in what Windows OS I use, because a lot of people are stuck with an OS that may do what they need it to do, but hate looking at it everyday.&nbsp; Skeuomorphism is aesthetically more pleasing
 to look at and easier to navigate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what do I have to do to get a pseudo-3D GUI in Windows 10, like Windows 7/XP/2K, and everything else before the advent of flat design?</p>

<h3> maz t3rz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stuck in tablet mode in a non-touch screen Lenovo Y700.</h2>
                    <p>I have no clue how did this happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I left my laptop open when I went downstairs and when I came back, my screen looked weird, with the taskbar being disappeared and the app icons on the right having huge spaces. I right clicked the taskbar and I can't even go to properties anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure did I click something that did it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also switching applications does this weird jumping animation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a feeling my laptop is on tablet mode even though my laptop doesn't support it and I have checked 3 times it is not on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I tried the "hide taskbar + icons on tablet mode" setting and they worked, meaning I AM in tablet mode. My laptop doesn't even support it so how am I using it???</p>
<p>
</p><p>My screen looks like this:</p>
<p>(notice the arrow next to the start menu icon as well as the enormous spaces with the right side icons.)</p>

            <p>You would need to contact Samsung since they are to provide your support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if you did have a disc, you might notice that your new computer doesn't have a COA sticker on it with an activation key. Therefore, reformatting you hard drive and reinstalling Windows 8 would make it impossible for you to activate it.</p>

<p>How to reinstall Windows 8</p>
</span><span>
<p>You have a couple options:</p>
<p>If you would like to reinstall Windows 8, which means removing apps and personal files and settings, you can use reset and refresh. This is equivalent to a clean install.</p>
<p>To do it, do the following:</p>
<p>· Press <b>Windows key + i</b> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar (If you are using a touchscreen: Touch the right edge of your screen and swipe your finger to the left)</p>
<p>· Click <b>Settings</b></p>
<p>· Click <b>Change PC settings</b></p>
<p>· Click <b>General</b> in the left column</p>
<p>· Under <b>Remove everything and reinstall Windows</b>, click <b>Get started</b></p>
<p>Then follow the instructions that will be provided on the screen to reinstall Windows on your PC.</p>

<p>Some things have changed since the time of this post. There is now the Windows 8.1 media Creation Tool. In order to use the media from this tool, you need to know your Windows Edition; right click the Start Button and select System and check your edition
 of Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may then download an up to date .iso of Windows 8.1 with Update 1 of your Edition:</p>
<p><a href="http://dellwindowsreinstallationguide.com/download-microsoft-windows-and-office/download-microsoft-windows/download-windows-8-1-retail-and-oem-iso/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://dellwindowsreinstallationguide.com/download-microsoft-windows-and-office/download-microsoft-windows/download-windows-8-1-retail-and-oem-iso/</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may use this to clean install. The product key for Windows 8.1 is hidden within the system BIOS and when you begin an installation with the correct .iso it will be automatically input. It will also be automatically activated when the system is online.
 See here for some more details:</p>

            Windows 8 has an activation key in the bios. When the computer reformats, it looks for a key in the bios. If there is no key found you'll have to get a new activation key.

            Hi  whitepawn_23.
<br />
<br />If this option is available for signing option that probably it is it on position.
<br />
<br />Please check the system drive.
<br />
<br />Run System file checker.
<br />-	Press Windows key + X, select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />-	Type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />-	Restart the computer.
<br />If no corrupted system files were found in the previous state, then I suggest you to try the following steps: 
<br />-	Press Windows key + X, select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />-	Type the following commands and press Enter after each command:
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />       DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />-	Close the command prompt and restart the PC and check if it works.
<br />
<br />Guide: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this would not be any issues.
<br />
<br />For the signing option try to set up it one more time / restart device / turn it off / restart device.
<br />
<br />Let me know how this works.

            Hi, Whitepawn_23, 
<br />
<br />What is the computer make/model?
<br />Which version of Windows are you using?
<br />Start &gt; Type Run &gt; Press Enter
<br />Type Winver &gt; Press Ok
<br />The window that appears reveals the OS version &amp; build.
<br />
<br />1. Run gpedit.msc.  Note; Does not work on Home Versions.
<br />Select Local Computer Policy / Computing Configuration / Administrative Templates / Windows Components / Windows Hello for Business
<br />Set the policy to Disabled,
<br />Click Apply, Ok
<br />Reboot
<br />
<br />2. Start &gt; Type Regedit &gt; Press Enter
<br />Navigate to the following key
<br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\PassportForWork]
<br />Right click an Empty space in the Right Pane
<br />Select New &gt; Dword (32-bit) Value
<br />Name it "Enabled
<br />Right Click on Enabled &gt; Select Modify
<br />Give it a 00000000 value &gt; Click OK
<br />Right click Empty Space in Right Pane Select New Dword (32-bit) Value
<br />Name it DisablePostLogonProvisioning
<br />Right Click on DisablePostLogonProvisioning &gt; Select Modify
<br />Give it a 00000001 Value &gt; Click Ok
<br />Close Windows Registry
<br />Reboot and retry login
<br />
<br />Note: Create a Backup of Windows Registry prior to Editing. This way if something goes wrong it makes it easier to Restore the Registry.

<p>Please click <strong>Edit</strong> remove the product key from your post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, where did you purchase the product key? If it did not come with material such as packaging, documentation and certificate of authenticity, then its likely a license from an MSDN or TechNet (which is for evaluation purposes) resold into the
 wrong market channel. Especially if you bought the key off an auction site such as Ebay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you say it did not work, did you use it to install Windows 7? If so, please run the Microsoft Genuine Diagnostics Tool then copy and paste the results in a reply here for further analysis:<br />

<p>You really should remove the product key. As the unfortunate post already happened, I'm afraid this is a MSDN key for Ultimate N (without media features, not for resale). (There are tools to check that.) It's probably blocked, therefore. If you want proof,
 follow Andre's advice.</p>

<h3> juliel12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Android Won&#39;t Take Photo After Last Update</h2>
                    <p>Skype on my Android phone updated last week (April 2018) to 8.15.0.166 and ever since it will not take a photo when I push the PHOTO icon to share a photo&nbsp;in a message.&nbsp; The only way it works is if I take a photo with the phone camera outside of Skype and
 add it to the message as a file.&nbsp; When I select the PHOTO icon it launches the camera (in selfie mode now which I don't want so I have to reverse it), and then I see a white circle at the bottom of the screen and I have tried to push it and swipe it but it
 does nothing, it does not take a photo and add it to my message,&nbsp;so I select the X in the top left to close it.&nbsp; This is also happening with Skype Lite.&nbsp; How do I get it to take a photo again, and how do I get it to not start in selfie mode?&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Laptop not shutting down properly on Windows 10.</h2>
                    Hey there! I have this odd persisting problem of my laptop not shutting down. Almost 9/10 times I shut down my laptop or attempting to put it in stand by mode something odd like some sort of hanging happens. It won`t shut down properly. The power led from
 the power button, the wireless indicator and the "on" indicator led remain turned on, however the laptop itself it is turned off. I have to keep the power button pressed for a few seconds in order to shut it down all together. This situation occurred a few
 days after cleanly installing windows 10 (i had it before and worked like a charm!). I`ve tried reinstalling ATKP driver, disabling fast startup function, using the repairing commands sfc/ scannow and dism, changing the power modes and it still does this.
 What I did noticed is that if I use the laptop for a long period of time (lets say more that 2 hours) this problem occurs almost every single time. If I use it just for a short time it will shut down properly 100% of the times. I ha

            <p>Hi, did you ever solve this problem? Same thing happens to me as well, and now it's messing with my bluetooth. I have to rollback the bluetooth driver and update it every time I turn my laptop on because this thing won't shutdown right/save the settings.
 The bluetooth thing happened after a Windows 10 update. Please let me know if your issue has been resolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the Microsoft team you are doing a terrible job at helping your users. Jenith_James didn't even get back to this woman. What's that? Terrible.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now, yes I solved the problem. A driver was responsible for the issue so I deactivated it. Intel Management Engine Interface - this pesky little driver. See if you have it too. It might be the same.<br />

                    How do I upgrade from Windows Vista Home Premium to Windows 7 for free? &nbsp;Is there a free upgrade to a later version of Windows?

            <p>You can't, it is not free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because Windows 7 is in limited stock because Microsoft ended sales in October 2013, this has created demand because of its scarcity. This means retail boxed copies demand a premium, while OEM System Builder copies remain affordable.<br />
<br />
Full version (Retail):<br />
<br />
- Includes transfer rights to another computer.<br />
- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.<br />
- Expensive<br />
<br />
Upgrade version (Retail):<br />
<br />
- Includes transfer rights to another computer.<br />
- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.<br />
- Expensive, but cheaper than full version<br />
<br />
OEM System Builder version:<br />
<br />
OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:<br />
- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel<br />
- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on<br />
- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard<br />
- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with using it too, especially since all future releases of Windows will be full versions anyway.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find OEM System Builder software from dozens of online merchants. The current price for OEM Windows 7 Professional at Newegg, for example, is $140. When I checked a few minutes ago, Amazon was offering OEM Windows 7 Professional packages from multiple
 sellers at prices ranging from $101 to $150. When I checked just now, a package specifically intended for refurbished PCs cost only $50 for a 64-bit copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no technical limitations to prevent you from using OEM software on your own PC, although this software will work only for a clean installation and not for an upgrade. In the past, Microsoft has been remarkably inconsistent in its advice to customers
 about whether this practice is allowed. (See "Is it OK to use OEM Windows on your own PC? Don't ask Microsoft.")</p>

            <p>Note that an upgrade from Vista to Windows 10 is *not* possible. You would have to do a clean installation of Windows 10. Or you could do a two-step upgrade, from Vista to 7, then from 7 to 10, but I strongly recommend against that, since it doubles the
 risk of problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note that you are *not* forced to do anything. You can continue to use Vista. And with an 8-year old computer, you will very likely find it dying soon, so it's not a great idea to put money into it.&nbsp; So you might want to wait until it dies, and then
 buy a new computer.</p>

                    I have downloaded a file that requires a program to open a .rfk file. Windows suggests searching the web. All I find are purchase programs that suggest registry problems. I am sure that is not the answer.

    <title>Coming backwards compatibility on Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Coming backwards compatibility on Xbox One</h2>
                    On Sonic &amp; SEGA All-Stars Racing, I played in years both on PS3, Xbox 360 on 2012 and Wii on 2018 cause It was unfortunately how these versions are differences: Xbox 360 version has Xbox Avatar and Banjo and Kazooie character, while Wii version include
 Mii, but no add bonus characters on PS3 version. So I like to put on add Sonic &amp; SEGA All-Stars Racing on Xbox 360 version better than Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed cause Sonic racing transformed kept screen freeze during matchmaking mode and gameplay,
 this game is fun to play, but still. So I need Xbox Team and Major Nelson to add 2010 game Sonic &amp; SEGA All-Stars Racing on Xbox One Backwards Compatible cause It has Sonic and 19 SEGA All-Stars while Avatar and Banjo and Kazooie are on Xbox 360 version Exclusively
 and lots of fun to play on me and your experience to play 2010 Sonic Racing game. So thanks for post.

<h2>            My ASUS K52F is running slow.</h2>
                    <p>Hi...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My ASUS K52F PC is running very slow. It is currently running Windows 10 Home. What is the best operating system suitable for this laptop? I want to speed up the performance of the laptop, while still being able to run all my favorite programs like Blender,
 Windows Essentials 2012 (a program suite), and some others. Also, I want it to work with my device drivers (I don't want there to be any errors in anything, especially in WiFi). Can you please tell me what the best operating system would be (matching with
 this criteria) and give me the ISO file or a media creation tool?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            1. You can first try to reset your Windows

<br />
<br />2. You can try a clean install of your existing Windows 10 home. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose.

            If you want to stay with Windows, Win10 Home is the MS operating system you want to use.  Otherwise, the general suggestion is to switch to one of the varieties of Linux. It is relatively a "lighter" OS and tends to feel like ti runs faster than Windows on the same hardware.
<br />
<br />I agree with both of Vijay's suggestions, reset or re-install Windows.
<br />
<br />I looked up the specs for your machine. It is several years old now, originally it came with Win7, and has relatively low power CPUs. 
<br />
<br />How much RAM do you have? I'm guessing 2-4GB.
<br />
<br />There are a couple of hardware options:
<br />- add RAM, go to 8 or 16 GB - approx $100
<br />- switch to SSD  - at least 120GB, approx $100
<br />
<br />But since this is a relatively old laptop, you would be better off spending the same amount of money, or slightly more, on a new computer. You can get low end computers for $200-500 that are much more high powered than that.  The number one thing to look for in a new computer is a SSD rather than normal HD. Then, at least 8GB of RAM, 12-16 is better.
