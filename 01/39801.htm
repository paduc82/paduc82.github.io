<h2>            Setting up primary e-mail address on Surface RT</h2>
                    <p>I have Surface RT, or rather I'm preparing one for my husband for Fathers Day. I want to set it up to primarily use his gmail.com address, How do I do that? I was instructed to go to Settings, but it's not as obvious as they apparently think it is.</p>

<h2>            Audio Inattivo</h2>
                    Salve a tutti<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; stavo cercando di disfarmi di un fastidiossisimo virus (credo sia uno spyware, ma ne chiederò in altra discussione) quando ho dovuto avviare una procedura di ripristino. A ripristino avvenuto noto che la barra delle notifiche è molto scarna, ripristino
 qualche elemento ma non riesco a ripristinare l'audio, poiché a differenza di altre icone attivabili o meno dal menu a tendina l'icona degli altoparlanti è bloccata su "inattivo"<br />
&nbsp;grazie anticipatamente,&nbsp;

<p>Please explain what you are trying to do in more detail. What are the specific symptoms that you are encountering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Start menu search for Control Panel. </p>
<p>Click on Programs and Features</p>
<p>scroll through the list of installed programs to find Microsoft Office 365</p>
<p>right click on the program name, select uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will remove Office 365 from the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are asking about uninstalling your daughter's Office that suggests another problem. It suggests that your daughter is using your computer with your Windows login, which is you confusion when trying to use Office.&nbsp; MS prefers that each user on the
 computer creates a separate "Windows User Account". That way their "MyDocuments" folder, desktop and miscellaneous other "stuff" is personal. The files saved in MyDocuments is only available to that Windows User ID.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These Windows user IDs can be "local" or they can be based on a microsoft Email address. Using the email address will automagically sign you in to Office also.

<h2>            my computer wont allow my wifi to turn on.</h2>
                    <p><em><strong>Original title: </strong></em>Free windows 10 upgrade?&nbsp; I think not</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 weeks after the windows 10 upgrade became available I downloaded it on my hp elitebook 8730w. &nbsp;After running ok for a few months, my computer wont allow my wifi to turn on. &nbsp;I have researched this problem on the internet and it seems like this is a very
 common problem. &nbsp;After speaking to HP first, I was told it was a common windows 10 problem and to contact microsoft. &nbsp;After going through a tier 1 troubleshooting session, I was told I needed to buy the one month or one year office 365 in order to have the
 problem mitigated and hopefully corrected. &nbsp;I purchased the year for $50 more than the 1 month. &nbsp;I asked what percentage of people who sign up and pay more for the service actually have this particular problem resolved. &nbsp;Fuma said 100%. &nbsp;An appointment was
 made for today at noon to have a tech call me. &nbsp;The tech did not call. &nbsp;I called to complain and was told a tech would call me back within the hour, again. &nbsp;It's coming up on the hour and no call. &nbsp;Free update? &nbsp;I think not.</p>

            <div>Hello Sangeeta Sarkar,</div>
My wifi switch on my hp elitebook 8730 w will not turn my wifi capabilities on.&nbsp; I spoke with a HP tech and he told me this happens quite often to those who have upgraded to windows 10.&nbsp; I upgraded soon after windows 10 became available.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no problems
 until 2 days ago.&nbsp; I spoke with a hp tech who told me to contact microsoft to mitigate the problem.&nbsp; On 1/6/16 I spoke with a tier 1 tech who took the problem as far as she could and then told me if I wanted the problem corrected I would need to buy either
 a 1 month subscription or a 1 year subscription.&nbsp; I bought the 1 year hoping this problem would be corrected.&nbsp; I asked the tech if my problem happens often and she said yes.&nbsp; I asked the tech what percentage of people who subscribe to the service actually
 have this problem corrected and she said all of them.&nbsp; So I paid the one year and had an appointment set for a support professional to call me 1/7/16 at 12 pm.&nbsp; The support professional did not call.&nbsp; At 1:08 pm I called microsoft and told my problem to 2
 people, Fuma, who transferred me to a Nowell?,who said a support professional would call me within the hour.&nbsp; The support professional did not call.&nbsp; After waiting an hour and fifteen minutes, I call 866-425-8809 and spoke to a Mohed who told me that I should
 call 800-642-7676 and to ask for a tier 1 specialist and then aske the tier one specialist to transfer me to a tier 2 specialist who would help me..&nbsp; I spoke with Robin at tier 1 who transferred me to tier 2 specialist enrico.&nbsp; Enrico worked on my problem
 for a few hours.&nbsp; He finally restored my software to before an update my computer did on the day my wifi would not turn on.&nbsp; Enrico said that would fix the problem.&nbsp; I asked if he would stay on the connection until the reboot was finished. &nbsp; He said it would
 take too long but he would send an email to follow up to ensure it was fixed.&nbsp; Well,&nbsp; IT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM, AND I HAVE NOT RECEIVED A FOLLOW UP EMAIL. Unfortunately I am using this venue again because You did not provide me with an email address I could
 respond as you asked. &nbsp; It does not appear that anyone is happy to assist me.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Lucas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very easy.&nbsp; Restore Down your File Explorer window.&nbsp; Using your mouse, lay the cursor on any corner of the window.&nbsp; When you see the double arrow, click and hold.&nbsp; While holding, simply drag the corner of the window out until you have the desired
 size. Close File Explorer and reopen.&nbsp; It will maintain these new dimensions. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, in Windows 10, the window will open anywhere it wants on the screen.&nbsp; You can't change the location where you want to open it to.</p>

<h2>            Unknown software exception 0x00000fd</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I open a new tab or page, I get an iexplorer.exe&nbsp;message saying:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The exception unknown software exception (0x00000fd) occurred in the application at location 0x0105d240. Click on OK to terminate the programme.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to have started since my son (God love him!) tried downloading software to restore his iPhone 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm a bit of a technophobe, so be gentle with your reply please!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to boot in “Safe mode with Networking” and check if issue persists.</p>

<h2>            Windows XP - .net framework 3.5 installation errors.</h2>
                    
<p>I have been trying to install the following updates on my Windows Vista Home Premium 32bit system. When I attempt to install these updates I receive error codes. (I will put the error codes in [brackets] next to the name of the update.</p>
<p>Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Family Update (KB959209) x86 1.4 MB [8007064C]</p>
<p>Security Update for Microsoft .net Framework 3.5 SP1 on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 x86 (KB2416473) 1.4 MB [8024002D]</p>
<p>Office Genuine Advantage Notifications (KB949810) 712 KB</p>
<p>When I attempt to install these updates it takes but a brife second for the error codes to set up. Literally 1 second or less.</p>
<p>The last "Windows Update" that I have on my system is dated 10/27/10 (KB2388210), 10/21/10 (KB959175), There 10 'Security' updates for 10/14/10 and one 'Update' for 10/14/10.</p>
<p>Are the updates with the x86 designation even for my .32 bit system? As I have no other updates with that type of designation.</p>
<p>Are the updates that I listed from my system up to date? or do I have some sort of bug?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

    <title>HDMI cable not working&#33; please help - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iisupasaiyanii  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI cable not working&#33; please help</h2>
                    
<p>My Xbox 360 won't work with an HDMI cable on my TV but it works in the living room TV. Both TV's are 1080P.</p>
<p>I don't think it's my TV because my WiiU and Blu-ray player work just fine when I connect them through the HDMI. My friend brought over his 360 and it also worked just fine on my TV but my xbox doesn't.</p>
<p>When I turn it on with the HDMI cable I can hear the start up sound for 5 seconds and it cuts out and there is no picture at all. Sometimes if i'm lucky I can get it to a gray screen. Any help would be appreciated!</p>
<p>My Xbox model is the holiday 2008 Arcade</p>

<p>I have no other cables in my xbox besides the power adaptor and ethernet cable. &nbsp;My settings are perfectly fine on my TV. It's only my xbox causing this trouble. HD component works but it's a big pain having to plug in 6 different cords all the time and
 the quality isn't as good as HDMI. :/</p>

<p>Are you using the same HDMI cable for both TVs? Will other devices work with the same cable and the same HDMI input that you are using for the xbox? It sounds like there is either an issue with the TV or with the cable. You know that both the TV and the
 xbox work, so I would try different combinations of components to see if I could find out where the failure is.</p>

<p>Did you try resetting the display settings on your console? Make sure there is no disc in your console disc drive, power the console on using the guide button on your controller, as the console starts up press and hold Y and the right trigger on the controller
 until the console restarts again.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If that does nothing you could try navigating blindly through the menu to change the display output settings.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Please use the dpad to perform the up/down/left/right movements and take it slowly when pressing the A button on your controller</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>power the console on using your controller ( wait two minutes to be sure the console reaches the dashboard )</p>
<p>up once</p>
<p>right six times</p>
<p>down once</p>
<p>press A 4 times</p>
<p>up twice ( if you get no display try up three times or even four&nbsp;)</p>
<p>press A Twice</p>
<p>down once</p>

<p>Hi guys. I'm having the exact same problem.</p>
<p>The box is working but not on my TV. Cant read signal</p>
<p>All was working fine. I updated xbox and now it does not work on the TV.</p>
<p>I know the cable works cause it works on my pc monitor with xbox and my ps3 on tv fine no problem, I've tried every little thing I have found on the net but still nothing. &nbsp;I'm using a Samsung tv. It used to work fine but no more.</p>
<p>Ive tried new HDMI,s</p>
<p>resetting the TV</p>
<p>resetting the xbox</p>
<p>The blind set res thingy. The y and right trigger and everything else people have suggested from laying it flat to taking out the HD and putting it back in. Everything. I have searched all forums and have seen no one has been able to fix this.</p>
<p>Any help would really be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks </p>

<h2>            Microsoft needs to fix this&#58; Windows 10 persistently changes the keyboard setting to &#34;UK keyboard&#34; &#40;incorrect&#41;, and the fix only lasts till the next reboot</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader1">Microsoft needs to fix this: Windows 10 persistently changes the keyboard setting to "UK keyboard" (incorrect), and the fix only lasts till the next reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">PROBLEM: KEYBOARD LAYOUT PERSISTENTLY REVERTS TO WRONG SETTING (UK)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Installation of Windows 10 (from 8.1) created a problem that recurs every time the computer is rebooted:&nbsp; my
<strong>keyboard layout setting </strong><strong>is altered from the correct US (Dell) keyboard mapping to&nbsp;the incorrect&nbsp;UK keyboard.</strong></span></p>
<p>SYMPTOMS</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">These are the symptoms:&nbsp; typing the AT key gives “ ; typing the DOUBLE QUOTE KEY gives @ ; and typing the HATCH/HASH KEY gives £.&nbsp; These settings are for a UK keyboard.</span></p>
<p>SYSTEM DETAILS:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe7eaf01-d291-4c4b-aea3-f37cf94839ae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe7eaf01-d291-4c4b-aea3-f37cf94839ae" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">THE FIX THAT ONLY WORKS UNTIL I REBOOT.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press and hold the WINDOWS KEY and while doing so press the SPACE KEYS.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This brings up a green and black menu of three items</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0da1725a-15de-4460-bf41-730593e926d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0da1725a-15de-4460-bf41-730593e926d5" /></a></p>
<p>The green item is the one that is selected, but note that <strong>pressing the WINDOWS and SPACE KEYS TOGETHER actually CHANGES the setting to the next one down the list, so you need to do this three times to toggle back to the setting you were on before
 you hit Windows+Space.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">None of these settings is&nbsp;correct for my situation
<em>[English (Australian); US keyboard], </em>but I can live with the top one (US English/US Keyboard).&nbsp; I’ve just now reselected the top item (having done that yesterday, and the day before, and every day before that&nbsp;... ) and again it has fixed the above
 keyboard mapping, so typing AT gives @, Hatch # and “ “.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong>After rebooting the computer, the keyboard mapping problem&nbsp;always reappears:</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><strong>AT gives "</strong></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong><span>HATCH/HASH gives £</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong><span>DOUBLE QUOTE gives @</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please let me know how I can PERMANENTLY set the keyboard mapping to US,</strong> as there is no option apparent under "Settings". To get to Settings, hit the Windows icon at the bottom left of the screen (it is white in Edge and&nbsp;green in Google
 Chrome).&nbsp; &nbsp;Settings is the third item from the bottom.&nbsp; Under "Time and language" is "Region and language".</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/847e3779-e704-4e88-9d33-0771f9251d33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/847e3779-e704-4e88-9d33-0771f9251d33" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, Australian English is the default, but making the default US English actually does not fix the problem.&nbsp; By the way, the "Set as Default" and&nbsp;"Options" are hidden underneath "English (Australia)" and visible only when you select it, as in
 the above image. Pressing Options reveals</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/50694671-0ab6-4c38-a21e-5030043bf647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/50694671-0ab6-4c38-a21e-5030043bf647" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, no UK keyboard is even listed, so why does Windows 10 keep changing my setting back to UK keyboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first tried to find a fix to this problem back in early Dec 2015: I <strong>
reported the problem to Microsoft by phone</strong>, and the call lasting about an hour (including the technician having access online to my computer) did not provide a solution; his last&nbsp;attempt was the only one that even worked, and it&nbsp;worked only until the
 next reboot - so, although I have no idea what he did, it was probably exactly what I described above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Three previous postings here have been (so far) a waste of time, as the supposed solutions provided by a variety&nbsp;of Microsoft Support Engineers were completely ineffective*, and none has bothered to follow up on my reports demonstrating that the "fixes"
 did not work.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Surely, somewhere, someone has come up with a proper solution to this problem.&nbsp; Many other users have reported it on the net, but I have not seen a workable solution described.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>While I can hardly claim that this is a serious problem, it is irritating enough to be annoying, and for Microsoft not to be able to fix it in the long period since the OS was released, undermines Microsoft's credibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we really
 rely on this operating system?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Ricky</p>
<p>
</p><p>*These replies&nbsp;appear to ALL be generalised "cut and paste" responses, inappropriate to the problem and&nbsp;always ineffective in solving it - sometimes because the procedure cannot even be done in Windows 10.&nbsp; As I said, follow-up is also inadequate.&nbsp; One wonders
 what knowledge, experience and qualifications these people actually have ... and whether some of them are even using Windows 10!</p>

    <title>Cx_freeze fatal error, can&#39;t find zipimporter instance message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shirliecoles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cx_freeze fatal error, can&#39;t find zipimporter instance message</h2>
                    <p>When I try to open a document via the "openwith" command in context menu in win7, I get error message,
<strong>"cx_freeze fatal error, Cannot &nbsp;get zipimporter instance:"</strong> How do I fix this? It's frustrating. I already added the following to the registry:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 <br />
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers\Open With]<br />
@="{09799AFB-AD67-11d1-ABCD-00C04FC30936}"<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it didn't change anything. My "openwith" option is still in the context menu as before, it just won't work, still only gives me message above. HELP!</p>

            <p><span>Hey Shirlie,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>It would help if you could answer these questions in order to troubleshoot the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What document are you trying to open (File format of the document)?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Which software are you using to access the document?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Are you using any programming language like Python?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you tried using Open With to open a music file in Windows Media player to check if the open with option in context menu gives any error?</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you remember making any changes to the computer prior to the issue?
<br />
</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Also check the event viewer logs for any errors tracked when you receive the error message when using the Open with option in Context menu.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/open-event-viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/open-event-viewer</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>Note: See if there are any errors in application (program) events of the event viewer during the time you encountered an error with the context menu.</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>I’m trying to open anything that isn’t an executable. E.g. a Word document, jpg, pdf, etc.. If I double click on it, it automatically opens the program associated with it.
 They will also open when I right click and click on <font><b>open.
</b>No problem there. &nbsp;It’s when I try to use the <b>open with</b></font> command nothing happens except I get the error message.</span></font></p>

</span></span></span><span>To my knowledge, I am not using Python. I’ve been doing research about this problem for a week and see this error msg is common with Python and that it’s a program language
 (which I don’t really understand) so, to see if I had it installed, I went to both the control panel and regedit and searched for
<b><font>python</font></b> and no results in either.</span></font></p>
<p>
<font color="#000000"><span><span><font>4.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I just tried to open an .mp3 with the

<p>
<font color="#000000"><span><span><font>5.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>As far as changes go, I’m constantly running either

Windows Feedback</strong>, but it doesn't work at all, even the "search bar" and hit Enter many times doesn't show anything up. I have no idea what's the problem, maybe "country/region" matter, or "metered connection" prevent this app from running, cause I've
 tried to make it "no metered connection" still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Second, I'd like to suggest <strong>Microsoft developers</strong> to build an App that has permission to change my desktop background

            I have updated the drivers via Windows Update, but I have not updated them from Intel because they don't have compatible drivers (with Windows 10) and I haven't updated them from HP because they say that they will provide updates through Windows Update.
 Should I install the Intel Driver even if I have a 2nd gen processor?

 in order for it to work but I can't remember exactly what it said or what the software was called.

</p><p>Do you see the DVD drive icon when you open File explorer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, then insert the CD/DVD and then open File Explorer and right click on the DVD drive and select the option open. It will open another windows with the contents on the CD/DVD. You can try to run the files from there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If still its not working then when you upgrade Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 you will receive an update for DVD app with your Windows updates. Try to open the app by typing Windows DVD app in the search bar and try to play the DVD through the app and check.</p>

<p>It was due to the fact that I was directly downloading the file instead of saving it on my computer and, then runing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution, do me, was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>To chose "said this file to to computer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to the file location and rename it with the .exe extantion (it saved as _exe instead, somehow)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And problem solved</p>

    <title>Is there a way to disable gamepads from interacting with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bitcoinweasel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to disable gamepads from interacting with Windows 10 UI&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 didn't originally have this feature, but one of the updates made it so that pressing A on a gamepad (Logitech's old school one, XBox 360, or XBox 1) counted as clicking on the currently highlighted item. It also made the DPad navigate in menus,
 and other changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be a nice feature for some, but I use a custom program to treat my gamepad as a mouse, and this change really messed with that.&nbsp; Is there a registry key or setting that I can change to stop this behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi bitcoinweasel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using any game-pad related app (<span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">Xpadder, Joy2key, Gopher, etc)&nbsp;</span>that would somehow allow this function? Do you also have a Steam
 app running in the background during this behavior? The reason why I asked is because these programs may have an option to disable the interaction between the gamepads and Windows 10 user interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know by posting back and I will get back to you as soon as I can.</p>

<h2>            NUMLOCK and CAPSLOCK on&#47;off status indicators do not show</h2>
                    <p>original title: NUMLOCK and CAPSLOCK on/off status indicators</p>
<p>My INSPIRON Laptop doesn't visually indicate NUMLOCK or CAPSLOCK on/off status.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I would settle for a sound or text message when toggled that would activate on bootup.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Is there any app or utility to accomodate the absence of onboard indicator lights for CAPS and/or NUM?</p>

            <p>Your Dell Quickset should give you a visual indication when you use the Caps Lock key.&nbsp; This utility is also the one that gives you the onscreen volume indicator when you use your F7-9 keys.</p>
<p>If Dell Quickset is not working any more then a new copy is available on the Dell support site [Drivers &amp; downloads section for your mode].</p>
<p>There are also Windows 7&nbsp;indicators at Control panel, Ease of access center, Make the keyboard easier to use.</p>
