<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the Skype account is not yet merged to the Microsoft account, yes you can. You need to merge the Skype account to a dummy Microsoft account.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the Skype account is already merged to a Microsoft account, you can move your Skype account to a dummy Microsoft account and then proceed to
 account deletion process. <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34822/can-i-move-my-skype-account-to-a-different-microsoft-account-if-it-s-already-been-linked?q=Move" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Important</span></em></strong><span>: Moving your Skype
 account to a different Microsoft account can be done once. After this, you will not be able to move the Skype account.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.

<p>just another week of absolutely nothing decent being added to the online store in terms of (new) game demos. really is sad that they clearly are just resting on their (probably) fat laurels and not bothering to offer up anything new or fresh in terms of
 content..but,&nbsp;i can buy Dying Light for 55quid though, or play some demos that are STILL there since last year. PATHETIC, absolutely substandard this is, im 41 years old and the content on the (store) doesnt appeal to me in any way shape or form.</p>
<p>PATHETIC! ,almost as Pathetic as the Farce that is the Dead Rising 3 demo, playable for 20 minutes.. seriously, the joke is on US in the UK ... beyond rubbish content thats still stinking the place out months later.. grossly over priced games &amp; nothing of
 interest worth turning the blasted thing on for..</p>

<p>I'm 43, I'm a bit annoyed at the lack of content being added, One of the selling points of Gold membership was free demo's , yet on Xbox One, its almost a treat to get one. Games for gold was "advertised" as an enticement to stay Gold (pay your subs!) yet
 we get Indie titles like people my age played as kids, i'm not being a graphics snob, but I didn't buy an Xbox One to play games from "yesteryear". I understand it being a young console, but I feel that retro games is not the way to go forward. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As for digital downloads, I do buy arcade games,( Trials &nbsp;,pool etc) but to pay £50-£60 on a game that has no demo, and can't traded in towards
 my next game is disgusting, they don't even drop in price over time, except maybe in a sale for a limited time, I buy from whoever has te best deal online, new or pre owned.</p>

<p>There are some great games on the ONE now.</p>
<p>You can buy them in shops. &nbsp;You can buy them online. &nbsp;You can buy digital downloads online for less than the marketplace too.</p>

<p>signed in few days ago to find this so called (ULTIMATE) sale .. i would buy Alien Isolation but whizz bang i dont get paid until next week when the sale will have ended. its actually nice to see a sale taking place, but when you compare it to Steam and
 even PSn its still sub standard. EVERY SINGLE week Steam has free play weekend games! sales of upto 85% and sales happening all week upto friday.. compare to the xbox1 store and xbox1 fails miserably. even SONY are doing more in terms of making games available
 to people on ps3 and ps4. okay there still some gross overpricing goin on there too, but the demos they get to sample (silent hill teaser) ever so slightly trump ANYTHING found on the xbox store imo. where is the Forest for xbox1? where is Daylight? where
 is No Mans Sky (is that exclusive?) MS is so far behind in terms of interesting content for me as an Adult its unreal!!! are MS not bothered about smaller (brilliant) games.. just HALO HALO HALO FIFA FIFA LEGO LEGO LEGO LEGO!!! ..CHILDREN!!!!! of course im
 aware that its possible to buy games cheaper at retail, but at present time, im struggling for funds (i know thats an excuse) but it still doesnt change the glaring fact that the xbox1 is so badly lacking in vibrant interesting online content.. &nbsp;its laughable
 in my humble opinion..</p>

<p>i also agree with bigNikUK .. i got the gold when i purchased my console and for the life of me, that was a swizz plain and simple. again, agreed, paying 50quid+ for a DD game your forever stuck with after purchase is a joke. both MS and SONY need to remedy
 their approach to DD purchases. if anything digital download games should be cheapest as your getting only code, no manual no nothing..</p>
<p>paying 55quid for dying light and knowing your stuck with it for evermore is bad medicine.. no matter how they trump it up with stupid variants on the base game for purchase. as for that 65/70quid version.. disgraceful. i know people will read this and think
 im just a whiner with no money, but really, there should be regular updates to gaming demo's. not just the same tripe left there to fester for this long. where are the games that arent naruto or some bogus old school trash someone was allowed to publish..
 (which also makes a visual mockery of your nice 400quid console)</p>

<p>Your whole post is laughable, it's widely accepted that Xbox is way ahead in terms of games. &nbsp;And the new flagship game for Sony Is getting panned for lacking gameplay in favour of cinematics. &nbsp;Sony has failed to deliver in the games sector, full stop. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Not sure what other demos are available at the moment but have you checked out the Scream Ride demo? Played this the other day and thought it was brilliant.</p>
<p>It's different for everyone though, some will be happy, others wont, one example, your not happy at Dying Light being £55 on the Xbox Store. I've been playing it since it was released, on my second play through, almost at 75 hours play time and it's been
 worth every penny and I know a lot more time will be put into it when a few other friends and family pick up the disc version when it's released.</p>
<p>But I'm not one of these gamers that will tell you how Xbox One is brilliant, blah blah, I'm more than happy with it but of course we are all different. If your really that unhappy with it and feel it's not good value for money then maybe it's time to try
 out something else as it doesn't sound from your posts that it would be worth you putting anymore money into?</p>

<p>I'm generally happy with the console and think it has a nice varied selection of games out considering it's just over a year old.
</p>
<p>I do however totally agree about the lack of demo's, I still think at least they should have continued with "arcade style" games getting a demo, in fact I think they should have continued to call them arcade games, I believe the only reason they stopped
 calling them that is so they could charge more and scrap compulsory demo's.</p>

<p>I'll try and find the link again but Eurogamer had an article not long back saying about the lack of demo's but they blamed a lot of developers for not allowing them ( I guess it's up to the devs, not sure myself ) ..</p>
<p>I know it was posted recently that after the EVOLVE alpha/demo was released, the pre-orders in Gamestop ( think that's what their called ) for the game went down by nearly 70%.</p>
<p>It doesn't help us but I can understand why some developers don't want to put demo's out if they think it will hurt sales, they should make better games then lol</p>

<p>Yep I'm sure it does hurt sales sometimes but they have in the past also made me buy games, most recently with Fantasia music evolved - had no interest in the game until I saw it in the recent sale, tried the demo, loved it, purchased it, then proceeded
 to wake up today with some very sore arms lol.</p>

<h3> sourabhtomar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgarde windows 10 to Pro edition from home edition after reinstall</h2>
                    Last year I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro from Windows 7 Pro with the one year free upgrade provided by microsoft at new OS (win 10) launch. I linked it to my outlook user Id also. My Laptop was running fine when recently its performance started to drop.
 I created windows 10 media for latest version available online using windows media creation tool. I formatted my laptop (C drive) and re-install windows 10 with the media. After installation I observed that the Windows newly installed is Windows 10 Home edition
 and not Pro edition. Please help to get Pro edn back. I dont remember the product key as I upgraded as part of offer. How can i get my previous product key or upgrade to Pro edition without paying money.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why an update fails is due to a security program causing the update to stop. To isolate your concern regarding the Creators Update, we'd like to confirm if there is an antivirus installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

                    I've checked for updated Drivers and the Screen Brightness Function still does not work on this Gateway Laptop.&nbsp; Maybe this laptop is too old, six years?&nbsp; The screen brightness function worked before this latest Windows 10 update.

            Hi Scott.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is this for the F keys which control brightness from the keyboard?  These are normally in Function Key drivers, sometimes a part of the chipset.  Go over all driver choices from Windows 10, 8.1, 8 and 7 on the PC's Support Downloads web page.  If you post back the full make and model we can help you look.
<br /> 
<br />In addition to keyboard F keys there is also a slider in Windows at Settings &gt; System &gt; Display to control brightness so I'd try that too.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

            That is a known issue where screen brightness cannot be controlled after Windows 10 April update.

<br />Option 1.Try Rolling back if you have an option:
<br />Go to Device Manager by typing in Devmgmt.msc in Run dialog box. 
<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version. 
<br />Option 2. Remove drivers completely and Install the the newest ones available from the OEM or the maker.
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of Display driver using DDU
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the driver from the OEM or the maker like AMD
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.

            Hi again Scott -
<br />
<br />We're seeing some brightness issues in the latest version so there's a chance there will be a fix, but it could also very well be that the hardware has reached it's end of the road for new WIndows 10 Upgrades - something MVP's are pressing developers to create a list so consumers will not be kept in the dark and guessing. 
<br />
<br />In that case if the functions key driver cannot be isolated, searched and found or made to work, you may want to go back to the last version and then hide the Version 1803 Update or else disable Windows Updates to avoid it pushing any newer version updates.  
<br />
<br />For 10 days after version upgrade You can roll back Version 1803 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />After that you can maintain it using Version 1709 media for repairs or reinstall from this download link:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

<p>Thanks for the assistance Greg.&nbsp; Yes, I agree this laptop may be too outdated.&nbsp; I also have a fairly new HP desktop (4 years old) and it has the same problem with the brightness controls.&nbsp; I am able to get around the desktop problem by using the brightness
 controls on the monitor luckily.&nbsp; For now on the laptop I am getting around the brightness problem by using it in "Night" mode all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your time and assistance.</p>

<h2>            Free Pass not Working</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased over £24 worth of in game purchases on the free game, Fallout Shelter. However, it has now been over 72h and the bar has only filled up just over half way, which with my purchases does not make sense-it should be fully filled and rewarded. Please can this be fixed.</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>bluetooth driver can not install with win 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samsl13  say:</h3>
<h2>            bluetooth driver can not install with win 8</h2>
                    Dear Friends,<br />
<br />
I upgraded (win 7 to win8) recently purchased ASUS N53Sm laptop as per the instructions from the Microsoft site and the Asus site. Both clearly mentioned that this model can be upgraded to win 8. Any way once after I complete the process I had to spent hours
 and hours to rectify issues and though I tried all available sources I did not get a solution. However many aspects settled the following are the errors now I am experiencing (I can use the laptop and I am using now also to send this email):<br />
<br />
1. In device manager Bluetooth device shows as unknown device. I have tried many options to install drivers did not work.shows this The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)<br />
Access is denied.<br />
To find a driver for this device, click Update Driver.<br />
<br />
I have tested both win 7 and win 8 drivers and studies all the other drivers from the ASUS site.<br />
<br />
Bluetooth_Atheros_Win8_64_Z800208<br />
Bluetooth_Atheros_AR3011_AR3012_Win7_64_Z74090<br />
<br />
2. When I try to troubleshooting hardware and drivers, system ran in to shout down and can not continue the trouble shooting process<br />
<br />
3. As per my understating except Bluetooth all others are OK.<br />
<br />
4. Even microsoft updates run several times and it also indicate that this can not be installed and find with an error as bellows:<br />
Qualcomm Atheros Communications - Bluetooth Controller - Bluetooth Module<br />
<br />
I expect a solution from Microsoft or Asus at your earliest convenient.<br />
<br />
Thanks and waiting a solution<br />
<br />
Sam<br />

            Thanks for the reply. This already I have done. However I did it again. Yes USB drivers get auto when restart. And then it shows yellow colour in&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;device in device manager. When try to install it it end with failure and there after the device
 name&nbsp;change&nbsp;from&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;to unknown device. So the issue is same.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Yes I already tried asus website and still it was difficult to get a solution from them too.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Waiting a solution.</div>

            <p>same for me. 2 different bluetooth adapters don't work. but i have a usb issue in general in windows 8. &nbsp;i only have usb mice/KBs and flash drives working. no printers, phones, bluetooth adapters working. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>all have error 28 and show up as unknown devices but when i try to update drivers then they have the actual description of the device in that window (these all work on other PCs btw).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>i can't uninstall the usb controllers either since my mouse and keyboard are usb and modern PCs only have 1 ps/2 port</p>

<h3> ceatlanta  say:</h3>
<h2>            no wifi connection Win 10</h2>
                    Win 10 indicates Norton 360 is preventing me from being able to use wifi. Norton help desk says that is not the problem. I am not able to turn wifi on. So frustrated. While this is the only issue I have have since upgrading, this is huge for me. I have
 an HP computer if that makes any difference.

</p><p>&nbsp;Sorry for the trouble. May I know the version of Norton 360 you have? May I know if you have tried to uninstall Norton and check if the issue persists? Also, may I know how did you get the message that Norton is blocking the WiFi connection? Let me know

            I had the same issue but it was my wifi adapter not working with windows 10. I installed the intel driver download assistant and then downloaded an update from intel, since they have the 64 bit version. All is working good now.

What happens if I've been banned? 
<div>
<p>Most bans occur because of unacceptable behavior or content, such as lewd player emblems. On the first offense, a player receives a temporary ban from using that feature. Subsequent offenses can lead to further temporary bans or even a permanent ban.</p>
<p>Banned players have limited access to the game based on the terms of their ban. Bans for hacking or using a modified console blocks access to all online features of the game. These types of bans are always permanent.</p>
<div>
<div>
Will you reverse my ban? 
<div>
<p>Currently there is no appeal process for bans. To keep your online gameplay privileges in good standing, it’s best to immediately cease any unsociable behavior and wait out the ban.</p>
<div>
<div>
How long will this ban last? 
<div>
<p>The length of bans vary on the type and number of offenses. This can be seen in the ban message that appears in game.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, please be informed that your backed up data remains unchanged in this process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backup and recovery is a feature that was implemented from Windows 7 operating system and you might see a pop-up stating: If you created a backup using the Windows 7 Backup and Restore tool, it'll still work in Windows 10.</p>

    <title>Как изменить тег игрока xbox live на ПК&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Как изменить тег игрока xbox live на ПК&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Не могу поменять тег игрока на ПК. Следовал инструкции с сайта: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/977901" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/977901.</a> Однако, в самой игре при попытке изменить тег игрока&nbsp;выдается ошибка: "Не удается получить сведения от службы Live. Повторите попытку позже". И так постоянно. Учетную запись создавал более двух лет назад, но тег xbox
 еще ни разу не менял. Как все таки можно поменять тег? Заранее спасибо!</p>

<p>Пробовал. Там нигде нет ссылки на изменение тега. Есть только ссылка на инструкцию, как его поменять на консоли и в Games for Windows Live. Я читал, что на сайте якобы можно бесплатно изменить тег один раз, но такой опции там нигде не нашел...</p>

<h2>            Disastrous Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>I have two laptops. They installed a windows update at the weekend and have not worked properly since. Office 365 freezes. printer won't connect. have reloaded office 365 and it gets a bit further before freezing now. won't let me find and remove printer
 let alone re-install it. control panel freezes. The settings options freeze. Have run all the trouble shooters and reloaded printer drivers with no effect. The update didn't seem to create a restore point so can't reset.&nbsp; Really stuck and extremely ticked
 off with this damn update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update has done exactly the same to both laptops (one of which is new). Am using Windows 10 (or was before it all stopped working). I work from home and am in so much trouble as I have deadlines and am at a complete loss.</p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times

<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />Once you are able to boot into safe mode, check the integrity of the system
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build

 see the task bar if I click my mouse and put my password to log it normally. I can press the windows key and it shows the menu but I can see any window.. not even the task manager because of that black screen with the spinning dot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me???</p>

            Hi ReneAlvarenga,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />How to Boot from a USB Flash Drive in Windows 10 - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Hi! When I go to safe mode I just see a black screen with the cursor. I got an error and can't do a system restore, same with system repair. Do I really have to reinstall my Windows?

<h2>            Display anomalies following update to Windows 10 v.1803</h2>
                    <p>A number of users have reported display anomalies following the April update to Windows 10. Only one user has so far posted a screenshot illustrating the phenomenon, and it's reproduced here:</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3cba9ab-3917-4a97-80bb-0f6a41cb5235" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Microsoft is not concerned about problems with unsupported software, so we're on our own here. With a concerted effort, we should be able to crack this, but it means we need some data to act on. I hope you'll be willing to help out.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>One user has reported that rolling back his graphics driver to an older version solved the problem, so it seems that the phenomenon is a result of an unfortunate driver update.
<del>To troubleshoot the problem, then, with a view to finding a solution, would affected users please reply here with the information requested. In the post below this one on page 1 of this thread, there is a data-entry table. Please click the
<em>Reply</em> button below the table, and then select <em>Reply with quote </em>
so that you have the table already in your post. Click in each <em>User's data </em>
cell and enter your information. Add any supplementary information you think may be relevant and then
<em>Submit</em>. Good luck!</del></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong> a few days later</p>
<p>Many thanks to those who posted details of their environment. I think we have enough data now to establish that only users with older Intel integrated graphics and using Intel driver 8.15.10.2697 are affected. One user reports that using an older
 version of this driver worked, while another reports that it didn't. There is a generic driver available on the Intel website, but we've yet to hear whether anyone has tried it out. If Windows Live Mail behaves with this driver installed, well and good, but
 there may be a price to pay in terms of performance degradation in other applications - Photoshop, for example, or PowerPoint. Gaming won't be as much fun, I suspect, and non-native screen resolution may not be available.</p>

 &nbsp; Any clearer</p>

<p>For Metro Apps to work, you need to have the following:<br />
1) Your screen resolution needs to be at least 1024x768. <br />
2) Next, if you have turned off User Account Control, your Metro apps will not work.<br />
You can check if UAC is enabled here: <br />
From the Start Screen, type in Control Panel. Click on Contol Panel tile. Then click on User Accounts. Change User Account Control Settings<br />
3) Try using a Local account instead of a Windows Live ID account.</p>
<p>4. If you have Sage thumbs installed remove it</p>
<p>5. </p>
<p><br />
<br />
If Metro Apps are still not working your other option would be to Refresh your PC.</p>
<p>8refresh</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Here is what will happen when you refresh your PC:<br />
· Your files and personalization settings won't change.</p>
<p>· Your PC settings will be changed back to their defaults. </p>
<p>· Apps from Windows Store will be kept. </p>
<p>· Apps you installed from discs or websites will be removed.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Create System Image option not working</h2>
                    Can someone please help.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I desperately need to create a system image of my laptop but when you click on "create system image" absolutely nothing is happening.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried connecting different external back up hard drives and checked that these are working correctly by using an alternative pc to create system image via same means and they work fine.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone please advise on what course of action I need to take to get my laptop to create a system image. Can I reinstall windows 7 file recovery software to overcome the problem and if so where do I obtain this from.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many Thanks,</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community Forum. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>1.Were any changes made on the computer prior to the issue? <br />
2.Which antivirus is installed on the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may be getting this issue as result of some services being disabled or not working properly, and some windows files corruption. I would suggest to try following methods and check if that helps. You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these
 methods:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer to article below to know how to logon as an administrator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How do I log on as an administrator?</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/How-do-I-log-on-as-an-administrator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/How-do-I-log-on-as-an-administrator</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to try following methods:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> Check whether Volume Shadow Copy Service, Windows Backup service also stop and restart the respective services.&nbsp;
<br />
1.Click on <strong>start <br />
</strong>2.Type <strong>Services.msc</strong> in search box and open it. <br />
3.Make sure that the Volume Shadow Copy and Windows Backup Service&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>Running
</strong>and set on <strong>Automatic.</strong> <br />
4.If the Status of System Restore Service is not Started, Start it. Also set it on Automatic if it is not.<br />
5.If the status is started, then stop and restart the services. <br />
6.Restart the computer and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
&nbsp;I suggest that you disable the Antivirus temporarily and then check for the issue.</div>
<div><strong>Disable antivirus software</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a></div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3</strong>:&nbsp; Place the computer in clean boot and check if issue persist.</div>
<div>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
</font></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Note:</strong> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from
</span>to reset the computer to start as usual.</font></font></font><font color="#000000">
</font></p>
<div>In addition to above methods, I would suggest you to perform Disk Cleanup.</div>
<div><strong>Delete files using Disk Cleanup</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-7</a></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope these methods are helpful. If the issue still persists, please post back for further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</div>

The native image creation tool can be temperamental. I would use a third-party tool, e.g. Acronis TrueImage (costs money!), which works even when booting the machine with its Rescue CD or Rescue flash disk.

            Hi Jayant,
<div><br />
<div>I cannot find the "System Restore Service" you have mentioned. This is not in the service section.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is it labelled as something else ?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Tried all other methods with no success.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Windows store won&#39;t open and I can&#39;t access settings.</h2>
                    <p>My laptop was originally a Windows 8.5 laptop but I updated to Windows 10 last year.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received several messages recently that my account needed attention, I didn't know what account it was talking about so I ignored it and now I can't open Windows store or access settings on my laptop. I don't know what caused this or how to fix it. Any
 ideas?</p>

            I changed my Microsoft password to make this original post which prompted a request to sign into my Microsoft account on another device. When I did, the Windows store and my settings started working again. I believe that was the account that needed attention.
 I also made sure all updates were downloaded and installed and I haven't had any more problems.<br />
