<h2>            FN &#43; F9 does not make volume go down</h2>
                    All of my other FN keys work, except for the F9 key, which <strong>should</strong> cause the volume of my PC to go down, but doesn't. I can raise the volume with the F10 key, but I cannot lower it with the F9 key. I've been trying to find a fix, but nothing
 will help. What should I do?

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Yours may be HP laptop with volume keys (f9 and f10)
<br />
<br />Kindly look at the history for Windows Updates, and figure out which update recently installed caused the problem
<br />
<br />Also download the newest hotkey driver and check.
<br />
<br />Since other FN keys work, except for the F9 key, 
<br />you can have a service check for the keyboard.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

<p>Thank you for replying, Ganesh. I forgot to mention that my PC is a literal laptop, and the keyboard is built-in. It's Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I don't exactly remember when the F9 key stopped working, so I don't know when an update might've caused it to stop working. It actually stopped working a while ago, and I just got fed up with it today. It's a TOSHIBA laptop. I've tried updating all
 the drivers I could, but it didn't seem to do anything.</p>

    <title>Xbox One stereo headset microphone needs calibration&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lept0n  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One stereo headset microphone needs calibration&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've bought myself the Xbox One stereo headset and it's been working great for awhile, however today I just tried using the microphone for the first time, and for the life of me I couldn't get the microphone to work.</p>

<p>Troubleshooting, I tried plugging the headset into my PC, and when I go to 'Control Panel' &gt; 'Sound' &gt; 'Recording' I see that the microphone shows up as a listed device. If I tap the large section that goes over my ear, I see sound registered just fine,
 however tapping the headset seems to be the *only* sounds that it picks up - talking into the microphone doesn't do a thing.</p>

<p>Does the microphone need some kind of calibration to work properly?</p>

    <title>Win10&#58; Constant Need To Reset Winsock and TCP&#47;IP Stack - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob kingsley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10&#58; Constant Need To Reset Winsock and TCP&#47;IP Stack</h2>
                    <p>For the past&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;weeks or so&nbsp;(possibly since a recent Win10 update), all my web browsers&nbsp;(Chrome - since uninstalled - and Safari and Edge) lose their internet connections, even though I'm still connected to the internet. After searching for a solution,
 I have now&nbsp;seen many posts (here and elsewhere) and YouTube videos that advise doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>From an Admin CMD Prompt, type:</p>
<p>netsh winsock reset catalog [enter]</p>
<p>then type:</p>
<p>netsh int ip reset reset.log hit [enter]</p>
<p>then reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does solve the problem for a length of time - sometimes&nbsp;for a day, sometimes&nbsp;only a few&nbsp;hours - but then the same issue reoccurs, the browser just goes "dead"&nbsp;and I have to go through the same process again. It's driving me crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's more, this is now happening on TWO Windows 10 PCs in this household.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my PC, I originally thought it was an issue with Chrome, so after several uninstalls and reinstalls I left it uninstalled&nbsp;and changed my default browser to Edge. It's made no difference. What's going on?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So many people seem to have been having the same problem over quite a length of time (going back into 2015 at least)&nbsp;- hence the several YouTube videos on how to fix it - and some seem to find the recommended fix works once and for all, but for me it keeps
 on occurring. I've run the Troubleshooter over the Network Adapter and no problems&nbsp;are found; I've tried updating the driver(s) but it says I'm using the latest available versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advise me on any other things I can try? Before I throw both our PCs out the window??</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is:</p>
<p>Acer Aspire M3910</p>
<p>Intel Core i3 CPU 550 @ 3.20GHz</p>
<p>8 GB RAM</p>
<p>64-bit</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Thanks ZigZag - I've not had time to follow this up today (and strangely enough my browser(s) haven't broken once so far today, or on the other PC either!) but I've downloaded the minitoolbox ready for use when I get a chance, or things break down again.</p>

            <p>It's ridiculous, but since I posted my question here on 1st February, I've not had ONE instance of the problem reoccurring on EITHER of the two affected PCs. Previously, it was happening at least once a day on&nbsp;both machines!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So on the principle that "if it ain't broke, don't fix it," I've left well alone - but I've got ZigZag's helpful instructions copied, and minitoolbox downloaded, in case it happens again, and I'll report back&nbsp;as and when&nbsp;necessary.</p>

            <p>Hi ZigZag,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to have left this hanging for a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both PCs <em>did</em> fall over again after a few more days; I carried out your instructions on both machines, including saving the files generated by minitoolbox, and followed the CMD instructions you gave. Both PCs behaved impeccably for a few more days,
 and mine's been behaving much better (though not perfect), but the other one's still got fairly regular problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't uploaded the files anywhere yet; I was a little concerned that I might be&nbsp;exposing info that&nbsp;might be useful to hackers&nbsp;(I'm sure you can understand my reticence); and things are further complicated by being away from my machines sometimes,&nbsp;and
 needing to use&nbsp;mine for work when I <em>am</em> here, so only have&nbsp;time to follow through&nbsp;on a piecemeal basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also about to change broadband provider and they've sent a new router, so I'm thinking I'm going to see if the new router improves things (well, you never know - could be something in my current router causing the problems?). I&nbsp;should be on the new broadband
 by the end of&nbsp;next week; I'm also trying life without McAfee on both machines and relying instead on Defender - maybe it's McAfee screwing things up? I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please bear with me - I'll report here again when I can!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

</p><p>I am facing several problems after upgrading to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It ran yesterday but today, I can't run Internet Explorer, cmd and maybe some other applications and services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read on the internet that I should run sfc/scannow but I can't access cmd.exe with or without administrator permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do now?</p>
<p>Device: Surface pro 3</p>

<h2>            Completely and absolutely disable all network restrictions.</h2>
                    I have 2 windows 10 PC's a laptop and a desktop, I just want to transfere some files over my network, I know login details for both, they are on the same network [wifi, 5ghz, AC] I can see both machines on each others windows explorer, but no matter what
 I try I get cannot access this drive/PC/etc, I want to completely and absolutely disable all the network restrictions, these PC are only accessed by me, I do not care about their security, I just want to transfer my damn files, Windows 7 was so easy, 10 is
 a living nightmare, please no replies that tell me how to enable sharing and whatnot, i've done it all, I just want to disable every "feature" that is making this simple task a nightmare.

            Been there done that, didn't work, never has, and sorry to be rude but I said I only wanted replies telling me how to disable all network restrictions, not things that might work or involve any of the useless "features" windows 10 offeres in regards to
 sharing, ALL I WANT TO DO IS DISABLE ALL RESTRICTIONS, IS IT REALLY THAT HARD TO GET A SIMPLE ANSWER THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE THE THE THINGS I'VE TRIED, WHICH IS EVERYTHING, NOTHING WORKS SO I JUST WANT TO DISABLE EVERYTHING SO I CAN SHARE MY FILES ON MY NETWORK
 BETWEEN MY COMPUTERS.

            Well this place is a complete and utter waste, I refuse to believe I am the only one with this issue, and that no one knows how to do what I want, it seems like there should be a simple fix, click a few buttons and disable everything, but no everyone just
 says nothing, well I guess i'm going back to 7, at least I know I won't be forced into a murderous rage by this bullsh!t.

            Hard to tell if you are having an installation issue that involves how you are pluggin in the hardware. &nbsp;(Which would only be having the printer powered on, OS up and running, and the USB cables firmly attached to both the printer and computer) -- Provided
 that is given, then I offer two pieces of advice.
<div><br />
<div>1) Brother claims you should be able to find the drivers via Windows 7 installation CD and/or Windows update.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2) Alternatively you can always feel free to use the Vista drivers from 2008. &nbsp;Most Vista drivers work just fine for Windows 7.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To download the Vista drivers, and for instructions on installation, look here:</div>
<div><br />
<div><span><a href="http://tinyurl.com/MFC5890CN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click for Vista Drivers/Instructions</a></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>Just note which operating system you are using, whether 32bit or 64bit, as that *can* have a difference on which set of drivers you choose
 to install.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>

    <title>Nightly DPC Watchdog violations since Oct 3rd Manditory Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billynewman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nightly DPC Watchdog violations since Oct 3rd Manditory Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>PC has been running fine since the update to Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the mandatory update that occurred for me on Oct 2nd, I've been having nightly reboots.&nbsp;&nbsp; The system log showed errors each night that Windows restarted due to an error.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Along with a bunch of app updates was </p>
<p>Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 (KB3176936)</p>
<p>Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 (KB3194496)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was finally next to the PC tonight when it happened and the Blue Screen stated it was a "DPC Watchdog Violation".&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet searches indicate this may be a driver issue, I'm assuming it was a driver installed as part of the update (or the update is incompatible
 with one of my drivers.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the Reliability Monitor, I can see the nightly restarts since Oct 3rd.&nbsp; They occur about every 24 hours and 15 min .</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error listed Is:</p>
<p>Windows stopped working.&nbsp;&nbsp; The computer had rebooted from a bugcheck.&nbsp; The bugcheck was 0x00000133 (0x00000000,0x00000501, 0x0000500, 0x00000000)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Oct 1st, the log shows a BUNCH of successful auto driver installations, not sure if that matters since the reboots didn't start until after the Mandatory reboot.&nbsp; (Which ticked me off since I was in the middle of something when it told me I had 10 minutes
 to get off...but that's another story)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone point me in a direction to figure what is dying?&nbsp; </p>

<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong>Do not use device manager it may tell you the device is up to date but will not tell you if it is corrupt&nbsp;</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><strong>Search</strong> Google for the name of the driver, or go to the computer makers site.</div>
<div><span><br />
<strong>Compare</strong> the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to<br />
<strong>Visit</strong> the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).<br />
If there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program<br />

    <title>Compatibility Issues with The Sims 4 and Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Compatibility Issues with The Sims 4 and Windows 10</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, so recently, I have been wanting to play The Sims 4. I haven't played it in a while, but last time I did, it was on Windows 8. I have recently upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; Now, when I attempt to open it, it goes to the theme screen thing, then
 goes to the loading screen with the green jewel spinning and all the tips and stuff. It stays there for a little while, then out of the blue, a message pops up saying that an issue with windows has stopped the game from running right or something like that.
 Well when I go to trouble shoot it, and I select Windows 8 as the compatibility setting, it does the same thing. I even tried Windows 7 and Windows Vista and Windows XP, and the last two it doesn't even open. I have restarted my computer and it didn't help.
 I also hit "Repair Game" from the Origin screen and it didn't help. I even completely uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it still doesn't work. Is this a Client side issue? Is

            - Is The Sims 4 the only game having problems ?
<p>- Have you installed a Win10 specific driver for your graphics processor ? </p>
&nbsp;<br />
<p><em>"I even completely uninstalled it and reinstalled it "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes you also need to delete the configuration files that may be in your User/Documents or AppData</p>
<p>folders (if this game puts one there, and does not delete it when uninstalling).</p>
<p>- I very much doubt that any Compatibility option is necessary for a game released in '14, so it's</p>
<p>probably better to leave them all off (except<em> maybe</em> 'run as admin').</p>
<p>
</p><p>- A lot of people seem to have problems with all versions of The Sims. </p>
<p>I don't follow the threads for The Sims games closely (I only have the original, and it runs well on Win10 ),</p>
<p>so can't offer a fix, of which there are likely several options.</p>
<p>Because all versions of these games have had issues on other versions of Windows, I expect the problem is
</p>
<p>with the game, the Origin client (perhaps -&nbsp; '<em>Enable Origin in game'</em> option, which can cause issues with some games).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"granted I didn't look very hard."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Bad boy... I expect you have been to&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/search/search?SearchTerm=The+Sims+4&amp;IsSuggestedTerm=false&amp;tab=&amp;CurrentScope.ForumName=Windows&amp;CurrentScope.Filter=windows_7-gaming&amp;ContentTypeScope=#/Windows/windows_7-gaming//1">
--this page --&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>You may have to dig a bit deeper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The Origin forums should be a good choice as well. </p>
<p>You may even find a fix for The Sim3 on the Steam forums that works for The Sim 4.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>The only way to change your rep is by playing and not doing things that people would flag you for (unsportsmanlike comments, quitting early, etc.). More information on what you can do can be found here:
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/Home/HowTo#sub-topic0-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">enforcement.xbox.com/.../HowTo</a></p>
<p>I would also recommend putting a passcode/passkey on your account so it cannot be accessed unless the code is entered. It will help secure it from unauthorized use when you are away. After all you are responsible for any actions that happen on your account
 per the terms of use when the account was created.</p>
<p>For steps on how to add a passkey on the Xbox One can be found here: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/security/create-xbox-one-passkey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../create-xbox-one-passkey</a></p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Automatically capitalize the first letter of a sentence while typing in Windows RT</h2>
                    <p>I just recently purchased the Surface RT. I've noticed that when I start typing, whether it be email, a forum, etc., it doesn't capitalize the first letter of a sentence automatically like it does on my Windows 8 Ent laptop. I'm used to not having to press
 the shift key to start a sentence. Is there a place where this can be enabled?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Regarding the Auto-capitalization for the Touch / Type cover, it cannot be disabled. It can only be turned on/off for the On-screen keyboard following the steps that JavanClark gave.

            So, despite having written "am <span style="font-style: italic">no longer</span> able to open my synced pics" you never have been able to open these files on your PC, correct?<br />

<p>Hi Gavin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like a corrupted system file or driver is blocking you to a successful boot. To diagnose and fix this issue, we suggest that you start your computer using&nbsp;<em>Last Known Good Configuration</em> from the Advanced startup options screen. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Remove any DVD from the DVD-Drive and any external USB drives, and then turn on your computer.</li><li>P<span>ress and hold the <strong>F8 </strong>key as your computer starts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you'll need to try again by shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong> screen, use the arrow keys to highlight</span><strong> Last Known Good Configuration (advanced).
</strong>This starts Windows with the last registry and driver configuration that worked successfully.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about system recovery tools you can use to repair startup problems, you may refer to the following link:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17419/windows-7-advanced-startup-options-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to reach the Advanced startup options screen, you will need to repair your computer using an installation media. You can download a disc image (ISO file) to create an installation media using either a USB flash drive or a DVD in the following
 link: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Download Windows 7 Disc Images (ISO Files)</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated on the status of the issue, and will be glad to assist you further.</p>

<h2>            WIMboot for tablets upgrading to Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    Just wondering if anyone has heard anything about WIMboot and Windows 10. I know that upgrading from 8.1 to 10 will probably work seamlessly, but they're also promising anyone who upgrades to Windows 10 to be able to do a clean install. You think they
 will provide a WIMboot compressed install media? I hate upgrading over an old OS, especially when there's limited space, because it gets messy.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can I find out if I have the latest version and/or update for Windows Live Mail?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
With difficulty. </p>
<p>First, find out which version you have. In WLMail, press Alt-H A. If this doesn't show you the version and build numbers, press
<em>Escape</em> twice, then Alt-FB. </p>
<p>Then compare with the version/build numbers on this page: <a href="http://liveunplugged.wordpress.com/2011/01/10/windows-live-essentials-2011-application-version-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Live Essentials 2011 Application Version Numbers</a></p>
<p>For the past eighteen months, WLSetup has been calling home twice a day to see whether your version of WLEssentials is current. For those who didn't update to 15.4.3555.0308, this check prompted a semi-automatic update which has caused severe problems for
 many users. </p>
<p>Incidentally, the four groups of digits mean<br />
</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
15</td>
<td>
Major version</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
4</td>
<td>Milestone within Major Version</td>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the latest version?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
For Vista/W7: 15.4.3555.0308<br />
For XP: 14.0.8117.0416<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has there ever been any updates specific to Windows Live Mail?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Not that I remember in recent years (i.e. since the invention of Windows Live Essentials in 2008)
<br />
<br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is a replacement for Windows Live Mail forthcoming?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Probably not for OSs up to and including W7. The Mail app for W8 may eventually include some more of WLMail's functionality than it does at present. I'd be happy to be proved wrong.</p>

<h2>            Getting service for a device bought in USA</h2>
                    If I bought Surface Pro 4 in the USA and if it malfunctioned while i live in the EU could i send it EU service centers (UK or german) for paid service? I understand limited warranty would only be applicable if i sent it back to USA.

<p>Most customers report having difficulty in situations like this. The North American hardware is different than UK/Europe. They don't have North American devices in the UK/European service centers. WiFi supported channels are different. Customers have found
 that in most cases they've needed to send their device to someone in the country in which it was purchased to get a support case opened. Those who have persuaded an agent to exchange (these are never fixed, they are always replaced with refurbs) receive a
 replacement that is from devices sold in the country/region where the service center is located.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>USA Surface tablets won't be able to use 2.4 GHz channels above 11, which has been problematic for some traveling abroad. There are similar issues with 5GHz channels.

            Are you implying i would have trouble connecting to the internet outside the US? Any chance you know if this is a problem only with the surface devices or with all laptops and tablets sold in the US?

            I'm telling you that on the 2.4GHz side that Surface tablets purchased in North America have not connected to channels 12 and above which are in use elsewhere and that there are similar issues with 5GHz. Other vendors may allow drivers to be downloaded
 specific to the country you are in that allow connections. Or have a setting that enables you to switch WiFi regions. It's called 802.11d (yes "D") - so depending on what channel a router is set to in any particular country..

                    I have had my xbox 360 for about 4-6 years now and I still play some games time to time on it, but mostly I use the 2 xbox 360 controllers it came with. I use them with a wireless receiver on the pc alot. Unfortunately one of them stopped working completely
 one day. I put in fresh batteries, cleaned off all the contacts and managed to get the 4 lights to blink at full brightness. The only problem-It doesn't connect to the xbox 360 or the pc. It just keeps on flashing 4 of it's quadrants and time to time shows
 the 'running out of battery' symbol. The other controller works perfectly fine with both- the xbox 360 and the pc. I know it's wayyy past it's warranty time and anything can break but I've seen tons of people online having the same issue even with new controllers,
 but none of them got answered, also no guides or tutorials online that have this problem adressed. Would really like some help. I've tried syncing manually, new batteries, switching battery packs between controllers, clea

<p>Try removing all power from the controller (take batteries completely out) and give it 2 to 3 minutes then put the batteries back in.&nbsp; If that doesn't work then there is a good possibility the controller has failed and will need to be replaced.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Spring 2018 Update and Game Explorer</h2>
                    I know with earlier versions of Windows 10 that you could get the Game Explorer by Win+R and typing 'shell:games'. I noticed with the latest Windows 10 version, that I no longer have that. Do you know if it was removed? Reason why I ask, is that I have
 Microsoft FSX and the only way it shows up as an icon is through the Game Explorer and the only other way to run it, is go the installation directory.

                    The names are things like APR2007_d3dx9_33_x86 and&nbsp;Aug2009_D3DCompiler_42_x64. they have a bunch of files in them. It spooked me when i opened my computer, and I assume it's not a virus, but at first i was sure it was. This happened after I restarted my
 computer. to be honest, i don't even know if this is the right update...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Can I delete these files? it still seems fishy to me.&nbsp;

There are many types of .avi files and most are not fully <br />
compatible with Movie Maker. The best bet would be to<br />
convert the .avi files to the .wmv format before importing <br />
into Movie Maker.</p>
<p>FWIW...the following free utility can identify the codec <br />
required to play&nbsp;an .avi file:</p>
