    <title>Will there be any way to prevent automatic updates in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robloxianwinnar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will there be any way to prevent automatic updates in Windows 10 Home&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'd like to know, when I upgrade to Windows 10 Home (I have Windows 8.1, standard), will there be any way to prevent automatic updates? I no longer trust Microsoft with automatic updates, as they have bricked 4 of my PCs, for a total cost of near $2000.
 Also, the last time I checked,&nbsp;<strong>I </strong>was the one paying the electricity bills, and
<strong>I </strong>was the one who bought the PC. If I have to pay that much, I expect at least MINIMAL control, and with the right to prevent automatic updates being taken away, a Windows PC is a load of sh**. I will NOT upgrade to Windows 10 Pro no matter
 what due to the EXORBITANT cost of it. Really, $99 to upgrade to a different version of an operating system?!
</p>
<p>To me, Windows 10 is a GIANT step back from 7.</p>
<p>But anyways, my question is, can I prevent automatic updates in Windows 10 Home? I don't care if it's a Windows hack, or even disabling Windows Update.&nbsp;<em><strong>I just don't want automatic Windows updates!</strong></em></p>
<p>Also, if I use the "Go back to Windows 8" feature, will the recovery partition also be reverted to reinstall Windows 8? And will all of my apps, etc. still be there if I revert back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>Microsoft has determined that we're just not bright enough to manage updates ourselves. What on earth were you thinking?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus, Windows 10 is the last numbered version of Windows. After that, it will evolve into a subscription service. So forced updates are necessary to drag you there kicking and screaming. Resistance is futile.</p>

            If Windows becomes a subscription then its over. I'm switching to Linux and I'll go buy CrossOver. Also, why is the pro pack for W10 $100? That's pretty pricey, as the cost of buying a license for regular W10 plus a pro pack is more expensive than buying
 a license for W10 Pro...

            <p>You said you will not upgrade to windows 10 no matter what. In that case you don't have to worry about disabling auto updates in windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are asking how to block windows 10 from updating you would need to block access to the servers windows update uses which will probably lead to you having a ton of error messages and unpredictable results of how your PC runs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You aren't forced to upgrade to any OS. Microsoft stops service of old OSes according to their terms of use

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is being released as SaaS however the majority of the system will be local. It is the future and helps protect against piracy and malware.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to be sure you have a windows 8 restore media use this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive</a> and read the other links so you know how to use it. You may also need the product key depending on how you bought windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your best bet would be to create a system image</p>

<p>Has this changed from a 4 month deferred update on pro with extent for another 4 months ?</p>
<p>Or is this tied to what branch the user decides on cb or cbb ?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, will that fix not being to access games saved to extra storage, or do we need to do something else.</p>

    <title>Application fails to open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oliverk_summerset  say:</h3>
<h2>            Application fails to open</h2>
                    <p>Right, first things first I'd like to establish that, in regards to technical problems, I'm not exactly illiterate but I'm far from adept, and I may have some trouble with terminology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nonetheless, my current issue is that I have recently reset my computer to factory settings, just to improve performance, among other things, now I use the Steam application to engage in recreational activities, namely, video games on my computer, and I
 have recently met with some trouble in regards to the first game I installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the game Total War: Attila and promptly attempted to play it, Steam told me that it was running, then it simply never came on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered that the problems seemed to be stemming from the launcher, specifically that windows was missing the msvcr120.dll and msvcp120.dll files, so I downloaded the Visual Studio 2017 package from Microsoft's website, it did nothing at all to help,
 so I was forced to utilise a second hand source to gain access to aforementioned files and place them within the system32 and SysWOW64 folders, once this was done the Launcher told me that it was suffering from the 0xc000007b error, which, after summary research,
 seems to be an error that can be caused from a number of reasons, I tried every expeditious fix, none of which worked, then attempted to reinstall Attila (at great cost to my time), but again, when met with the Launcher, it posed this very same error, then,
 following the trail of fixes through the internet, I came across the Dependency Walker application, and, utilising it, attempted to diagnose what exactly was preventing the Attila launcher from working, and to my great dismay, discovered that after the rest
 of my computer, I was seemingly missing hundreds of dll files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a full list of all files I am missing:</p>

</p><p>I now stand at dilemma of sorts, in theory I could download and place each of these files individually into the system32 and sysWOW64 folders, but this would come both at great risk to my PC, as it would involve downloading files from, to put it simply,
 untrustworthy sites on the internet (do note here that I have already attempted to install the Visual package, multiple times, to no avail.) and it would come at immense cost to my time, so I'm currently seeking a swifter and safer manner through which to
 acquire these d.ll files and place them within the system32 and sysWOW64 folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time, whomever reads this, and I hope, and pray, that you are able to provide me with an answer to my question.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Oliver,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue that you are experiencing right now is usually caused by the application that you’re using.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever you download an application in any platform, it should come with a specific file for it to run. You need to contact the support for Steam so that they can help you gather all the missing files in your system.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post back should you have other concern so we can assist further.</p>

<p>Hi Saikiran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for us to isolate what is causing this issue with the game app, and to provide you the best solution, may we know what are the recent changes on your computer before this happened? Is there any update on your computer prior to this issue? Is this
 only happening on a certain game app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to add any additional information in your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>With that being said, if this issue only occur on racing games, then this could possibly due to the game settings. Try to check the video resolution and video setup on the game settings. If it's still the same after checking the game settings, you can run
 the Windows App troubleshooter from this article:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027498/windows-run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Run the troubleshooter for Windows apps</a></strong>.<br />

<h2>            Wireless Connection DNS server is not responding.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> Wireless Connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recently switched our internet service provider from a Verizon Jet Pack to Time Warner Cable.&nbsp; Both are wireless.&nbsp; All other devices in the household will connect to the Time Warner network with the exception of my desktop.&nbsp; I can sometimes access the
 network but it cuts out and am not able to navigate the web and most times it will not make the connection at all.&nbsp; When I run the diagnostics, I will either get that it could not find any problem or that the DNS server is not responding.&nbsp; I have checked all
 settings against my daughter's laptop(also Windows 7) and everything appears to be the same.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;reset the modem with no success.&nbsp; What is really weird is that I can still connect to the Verizon Jet Pack and have full access.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I cannot afford
 to continue with 2 service providers so I really need some help.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Melody</p>

            <p>Hello Melody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which anti-virus is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the computer has the issue then it should cause the issue on both networks. There may be&nbsp;other reasons for intermittent wireless connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An intermittent loss of your connection to the Internet is often caused by electronic or physical interference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Large metal objects and electrical equipment such as televisions, home entertainment electronics, and microwaves can also cause interference. Try to keep your modem and wireless home networking router away from these sources of electronic interference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check with your neighbor. You may both be running wireless networks at the same frequency. The solution may be as easy as changing the channel of your wireless router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Physical obstructions such as walls, floors, home entertainment electronics, appliances, and furniture can cause interference if the wireless signals have to pass through them. Move your modem or wireless home networking router to another location so it
 isn't in the line-of-sight of these potential interference factors. </p>
<p>
</p><p>DSL filters are needed on all phone devices except the modem. If you have more than one phone line entering your home, DSL filters should also be installed on the second line, even if it is not connected to your DSL equipment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to use Network troubleshooter for Windows 7:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Network troubleshooter in Windows 7 provides a way for anyone to diagnose and repair network problems.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows7/using-the-network-troubleshooter-in-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows7/using-the-network-troubleshooter-in-windows-7</a>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have connected to various wireless networks before, your computer may have problems connecting wirelessly, especially when the wireless network name (SSID) is the same with the previous ones you have connected to. Removing wireless network profiles
 on your computer may improve your wireless connectivity to your current wireless network.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> When you remove wireless profile you may have to put the security key again for home wireless network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to remove the existing wireless network profile in Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step1</strong></p>
<p>Click Start-&gt;Control Panel, Select Network and Internet, and then click Network and Sharing Center</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
<p>In the task list, please choose Manage wireless networks.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
<p>In the Network table, please select the existing profiles and click Remove.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p>You may see a warning dialog box, just click OK.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
<p>Then please go back to Network and Sharing Center and choose Change adapter settings -&gt; right click Wireless Network Connection -&gt; click Connect/Disconnect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
<p>Click the refresh button to view available wireless networks. Highlight the network which you want to connect, double click it or click Connect button.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p>You can also refer to the following link to fix the wireless problem and the link is:

            <p>Thank you Rohit.&nbsp; I tried all 3 methods and none are making any difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Norton's 360 installed as an anti-virus program.&nbsp; The modem is right beside the computer so there are no walls that are interferring with the signal, and both are in the upstairs bedroom so there are no other electronic devices that might be interferring
 either.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any neighbors that are close enough but would be more than willing to change the frequency of the modem if it might help.&nbsp; Is that something that I can do or will I need to have my internet service provider do it?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also cannot get it to make a connection even if I hook up a direct connection.&nbsp; Could it be something in the firewall or security that is not letting the Time Warner in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Melody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Disable anti-virus software<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important Note: </strong>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Starts Windows in safe mode and includes the network drivers and services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try booting your computer in the safe mode with networking option and check if the issue persists:<br />
Start your computer in safe mode <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the system works fine in the safe mode with networking, try to clean boot the system:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,
 or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can contact your internet service provider to change frequency on the router.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.<span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I appreciate if you could answer the below questions to narrow down the issue and to provide you better assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. What is the make and model of your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Which version of Windows was installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have attached any external devices like pen drive, you may remove them and restart the system and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, you can use the windows 10 installation media to do a start-up repair and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to run Startup repair from Advance boot option. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>It may ask you to insert the Installation DVD/USB while doing startup repair.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you don’t have an installation media, I suggest you to create an installation media for Windows 10 Media Creation tool.</span></p>

                    <div>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>I just finished my first PC build (I am from a Mac family). When I turn on the computer with Windows 10 on USB (from Microsoft not a self-made ISO), the fans case/CPU are all working fine, every lights on MOBO, GPU and case
 are working.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>I can get to the BIOS (i didn't touch anything in it), I get tochoose which windows to install (32 or 64), it loads the files in 1-2min then black screen. The screen is still active, just black and it does not go to sleep.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>After getting some advices, I tried and got the same result with :</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>- CPU, GPU, HDD connected (SSD disconnected)</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>- CPU, HDD</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>- CPU, HDD and going to F11 to choose between "UEFI KDI MSFTWindows 10 PMAP, Partition 1"or "SATA1:ST1000DM010-2EP102" or "KDI MSFTWindows 10 PMAP"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Once I reach the black screen, I believe the debug indicator on MOBO indicates temperature. So I guess the MOBO post and then there is something messing up windows 10 installation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>During MOBO post, during a test I plugged some headphone and heardsome rapid short beeps discontinuously at the start and when the menu "enter BIOS by pressing DEL or boot menu by pressing F11" appears. Once I reach the black
 screen there is no more beeps or any sound.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>I have no idea what to do now. Reset CMOS ? try to load drivers via M-flash ?</span></p>

<p>You might want to simplify your configuration a bit just for the setup phase of Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Remove all internal storage devices to only the target storage device where Windows 10 will be installed.</p>
<p>- If your motherboard supports onboard graphics, switch to that instead of the discrete GPUs</p>
<p>- Reduce the amount of installed RAM to a single stick</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, only keep on the mouse and keyboard attached.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Since the scrabble game is not compatible with Windows 7&nbsp;,&nbsp;<strong>you can run the scrabble game</strong> installed on your system in compatible mode without any
 issues. To do so refer to the link provided below:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You can try to run Scrabble game either in Windows Vista or in Windows XP (service pack 3).</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, Microsoft does not support the&nbsp;<strong>online Scrabble</strong> now ,so I would suggest you to use your favorite search engine to search for scrabble
 game online. You can also play the game from the Website you have mentioned in the thread.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Hope it helps. Please let us know for further assistance.</span></p>

then Right Click TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - <br />
Processes - Services - this is a quick reference (if you have a little box on<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are <br />
the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab -
<br />
write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything <br />
as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT <br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback)<br />
and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get <br />
their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System <br />
Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot -
<br />
check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR <br />
SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using <br />
the methods above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker <br />
and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations<br />
in Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install <br />
drivers which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new <br />
driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if
<br />
you wish.<br />

<h2>            Computer clock shows wrong time</h2>
                    I am in Canada and my 2-year-old Acer Aspire has Windows 10. The time clock is always 1 hr. ahead of real time. I reset, change location from Canada/US to Eastern Standard time Canada. But it doesn't reset itself. Still&nbsp;showing 1 hr ahead of Ontario time.
 What can I&nbsp;do to fix this? It is critical for me. I m not allowed into a new business I am joining because my clock says wrong time.

    <title>Can&#39;t type in Greek alphabet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sonntagsforscher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t type in Greek alphabet</h2>
                    I have had Windows 7 for about a year and a half now. When I got it, I immediately went to Control Panel Regions Languages and installed the keyboards for a number of languages that I anticipated using, Greek among them. There was no problem; I have been
 typing in Greek ever since. There was a problem with Russian, but I downloaded a third-party keyboard and have had no trouble since. This morning I find that suddenly I cannot type in Greek. I switched the language bar to Greek and it continued to produce
 the Latin alphabet. The font has Greek; I have used it for years, so that is not the problem. I went back to Control Panel, went through the whole procedure again, verified in "Advanced Key Settings" that Greek was installed, and tried again. Same bloody thing--the
 keyboard was supposed to be Greek but is English--Latin alphabet again. What the **** is going on?

            <p>Hi Sonn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum. </p>
<p>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any significant&nbsp;changes to the computer prior to this issue (e.g. installed updates or language packs)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to reinstall the language pack one by one so that there isn't&nbsp;a chance of this issue. Please&nbsp;try the following steps and check if the issue persists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Start</strong> button, then go to <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>In Category view, click on <strong>Clock, Language, and Region</strong> link.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/129cf35c-e7e5-4fa2-9d39-337e5861e23c" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Install or uninstall display languages</strong> under “Region and Language” section.</li><li>In the “Install or uninstall display languages” wizard, click on <strong>Install display languages</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Browse computer or network</strong> to locate and install language packs manually.</li><li>Type or browse to the folder that contains the language pack files. The language file must be in .CAB extension, typical named as “lp.cab”.
</li><li>Tick the check boxes of all languages that want to be installed. Actually, the check boxes are checked by default, so you should untick and uncheck the check boxes of display languages that don’t want to be installed.</li><li>Click on <strong>Next</strong> button when ready.</li><li>Check the radio button for <strong>I accept the license terms</strong>, then click on
<strong>Next</strong> button. </li><li>Wait for the installation to finish, which may take a while. </li><li>Once all selected language files is installed successfully, a confirmation screen will be shown.
</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong> button.</li><li>Select the desired display language from the list of languages available. Then, click on
<strong>Change display language</strong> button. Optional is whether to also <strong>
apply the new display language to welcome screen and system accounts</strong>.</li><li>Check if you are able to type in Greek language.</li></ul>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. If the issue still persists, please post back for further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>Hi Eric,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and frustration you have been through. I will be glad to assist you.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Is the issue is with TV or computer?</p>
2. What is the make and model of the TV?
<div>3. Have you updated the graphic card drivers for the laptop?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>If you are facing this issue with your computer check these setting.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong><br />
1.&nbsp;Type Display Settings on search.<br />
2.&nbsp;Under Display and change size of text, apps and other items.<br />
3.&nbsp;Drag and drop to 100% recommended.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong><br />
1.&nbsp;Click on Advance Display Setting.<br />
2.&nbsp;Under Resolution; change to 1920 x 1080 (Recommended)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is with TV. I suggest you to check these settings. If you have zoom in screen then try to zoom out, select the different aspect ratio for screen refer the manual and check.<br />
</p>

            <p>I did as you suggested. .... The problem was with Laptop Settings.</p>
<p>I could not find out how to update my graphics drivers, ( I have Windows Automatic Updates turned ON. )</p>
<p>When I plugged in the HDMI to connect my Panasonic TV, the laptop screen went black.</p>
<p>The image on the TV was still too big....</p>
<p>I set the &nbsp;laptop to " Duplicate These 2 Displays " &amp; "Display" to 1080p &amp; Eureka !</p>
<p>I now have 2 good displays, although 1 on the TV would really have been enough.</p>
<p>I am happy that I can use the TV for the bigger image &amp; I don't dare change it back.</p>
<p>Problem ( as good as ) Solved......Thank You Very Much For Your Help.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t set environment variables for my user account</h2>
                    To edit Environment Variables in Windows 10 for your user account you can<br />
<br />
• Search for "environment" and select "Edit environment variables for your account"<br />
• Go to Control Panel &gt; User Accounts &gt; User Accounts &gt; Change my environment variables<br />
<br />
However, neither of these works for me. I get no response.<br />
I don't know if this is a bug in Windows 10 or just isn't working on my machine.<br />
How can I troubleshoot this?<br />

<p>I found the answer on the TechNet forum. It turns out that this feature in Windows 10 is currently broken. You can edit environment variables in admin accounts, but not your local environment variables in non-admin accounts.</p>

    <title>Minecraft Windows 10 edition crashes on timer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackbain1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 edition crashes on timer</h2>
                    Every time I open it, it seems fine, but then after a few seconds the game freezes and closes. I have no idea why this is happening, maybe because of the new update. But, I did sign into a different Microsoft account, but tried to change back, because
 it needed the password for a Microsoft account problem which I had forgot, and can't seem to retrieve, and this was the time when the problem started. I also tried deleting the other Microsoft account from my pc, but it still pops up, and uninstalling and
 reinstalling Minecraft didn't help either. It seems like it crashes when it's about to connect me to realms or the store. This has also affected my Xbox app, but I have seemed to resolved that one. Maybe they're linked?

            I haven't done any changes to my computer, and this isn't happening to any other games. I think it is linked to xbox live though. It seems to happen to my xbox app also. resetting the windows store didn't help.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,<br />
</p>
Try running StartUp Repair from a Windows 10 boot disk or USB drive. <br />
That often will work when running from the recovery environment does <br />
not. You can try Option 5 here and run StartUp&nbsp;Repair to see if it helps. <br />
You would need to make a bootable USB or DVD using the Media Creation<br />
Tool.

</p>
<p><br />
You can make a Windows 10 Install disk and try to use it to repair the present<br />
installation. Do not try to do a clean install with it however because if the upgrade<br />
was not fully activated for a few days then the clean install will not activate.<br />
<br />
Make a Windows 10 Disk using the Media Creation Tool - select to install on<br />
another computer and the same version you have now. You can make a USB<br />
or DVD to boot with. Select Troubleshoot - Advanced Options&nbsp; - Automatic<br />
Repair.<br />
<br />
Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool - create media then<br />
boot with it - use method I outlined above.<br />
