<h2>            Fender Fuse will not run in Windows 7.</h2>
                    <p>I have talked to the techs at Fender and still cannot get the program to run. The program is for controlling guitar amplifier settings. Program works fine on my xp desktop.</p>
<p>Anyone have an idea of what program may block the fender program?</p>

    <title>WINDOWS 10 MAIL KEEPS SHUTTING DOWN AFTER OPENING AN EMAIL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulanderson  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS 10 MAIL KEEPS SHUTTING DOWN AFTER OPENING AN EMAIL</h2>
                    <p>Just spent an hour with MS help and they can't fix my problem. &nbsp;Thought I would throw it out there to the Community. &nbsp;Last Thursday (20 Oct) my .msn mail program on my PC started shutting down when I open an email. &nbsp;I had migrated to Windows 10 from Windows
 7 some months ago. &nbsp;I am up to date with all updates including the Anniversary update. &nbsp;I can see the email for about one second, then the program shuts down with only my desktop showing. &nbsp;Nothing else seems to be effected. &nbsp;My Yahoo and GMAIL and WEB browsers
 are fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the strange thing. &nbsp;I then added my msn mail to my iPhone and can read my mail no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I then signed up on my PC for an Outlook.com account using my old msn address and can read all my mail as long as I do it from Outlook.com. &nbsp;When I open the mail account using the Windows 10 button, the program shuts down right after opening any email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tech rep repeated all of this, performed an hour's worth of procedures, which included integrity checks and re-installing the mail program. &nbsp;After all this, he said he could fix the problem if I paid for premium help. &nbsp;He said I needed "advanced help".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided not to do that. &nbsp;So, is anyone else out there having similar problems as of October 2016? &nbsp;Any suggestions? &nbsp;I'd like to get access to my emails logging in once to my computer and not having to log into Outlook.com.</p>

It will if you have the better configuration without the eMMC flash memory as the main storage and instead the solid state drive with modern NVME tech.

<p>Hi Phil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've asked this question too from Customer Service and they simply repeated the unit's characteristics of 128GB SSD and a 64GB EMMC drive.&nbsp; This told me the rep was not a techrep but a orders rep because I already knew that and it wasn't the information
 I needed.&nbsp; So I politely thanked her for her time instead of pressing her to get information she has no experience with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to know:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; The maximum capacity Micro SDXC card I can use and;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The maximum capacity regular SD/EMMC card I can use, I need clarification on whether or not I can go above 64GB or is that the limit for that drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Disks Characteristics are below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a199ebdb-891c-4e43-b93a-17911ca87490?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a199ebdb-891c-4e43-b93a-17911ca87490?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>This information should be on the specifications page instead of searching the internet high and low because Microsoft has tested these devices and knows what they can and can't do with the available accessories and possible configurations at the time of
 testing.</p>

<p>You basically answered your own question by stating you have the 128GB SSD model.&nbsp; There are only two SKUs for this product as of now in the United States in Los Angeles County...&nbsp; I was just at the Century City Microsoft Store and they were mums the word
 on an LTE i5 Surface Go but more than happy to talk about Surface 6...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as your perhaps salty / pointed feedback - I get it IMO.&nbsp; I have another very salty post on the Surface Go forum on Microsoft.com lambasting system performance et all... which is very lackluster to say the least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure, this information is not provided by Microsoft.&nbsp; But I can tell you the faster transfer speed is possible with the Pentium Gold &amp; 128 GB SSD SKU Surface Go - I use it frequently to transfer and view footage from a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 on a Sandisk
 Extreme 128 GB Micro SDXC and also from a Go Pro Hero 5 &amp; 6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't edit on this but it is a nice little transfer and backup and viewing device for my workflows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice if there were more resources for the Surface Go as you mentioned.&nbsp; The launch felt like a cold wet rag at the Glendale Americana Microsoft Kiosk near the Star Wars VR Experience.</p>

<p>Also this depends if you are opting to transfer using the USB C port or the Surface Dock with USB A 10 GBPS spec. Devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I use a SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD which supports USB C.&nbsp; Model: SDSSDE60-250G (250 GB) I got it from Wal-Mart because free shipping on 35$ + and I had a gift card.&nbsp; Might be cheaper on Amazon or B &amp; H or NewEgg depending on the weather.....</p>

            Tried the first link. Found it must have been because I cancelled Goggle Chrome a couple of days ago. The easiest thing to do was to download Chrome again but keep IE as the default browser.<br />
Problem solved.<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

<p>Did you run sfc /scannow more than once. sometimes you need to run it about 3 times with a reboot between each run as it will only fix 1 file at a time.

<h2>            How I solved C1900101-20004 error when installing Windows 10</h2>
                    I tried 5 times. After the fourth one Windows sent a message (in Windows Update from Control Panel) informing some updates for Windows 8.1 (before this it was supossed the OS was completely updated), then I installed them. After I rebooted the system and
 continued with Windows 10, for fifth time, but this time I set a fan directly to computer and it was on during all process.<br />
Before the fourth time I tried some suggestions I found on Microsoft forums and other webs, but none of them have worked.<br />

Many of these devices such as HP Stream came in a variety of colors with a full copy of Windows 8.1. Attractive qualities include an affordable price and a 11 or 13 inch display. Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations. This makes it difficult to install Windows 10 the conventional way.

<p>If you can't post top-1000 times - then the Indy Oval method Fyerball suggested is probably your best route to quick credits.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you mentioned that Windows says <strong>"it cannot find the driver"</strong> If the update are not available then you may try to update the drivers from the manufacturer website and check if that helps.</p>

            <p>Sorry, but I am afraid you suggestions are irrelevant:</p>
<p>1) Samsung support (website) - no drivers or Bluetooth is published (I have the latest Kies software installed, so whatever is supplied by Samsung is on my PC)</p>
<p>2) Reference to Microsoft - it is only of Windows Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Win 8.1 on my Lenovo X1 Carbon (20A7 model)&nbsp;- it can see my I9192, pairs easily, installs something in 3 sec (doubt that is enough to install all necessary drivers) and that's it. Connects for 2 seconds and then disconnects forever....
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solution/suggestion (other than visiting Samsung official support site)?</p>

            Hi <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/eebab4ce-e750-4990-890a-a4566cc7fcf8" title="ComputerGenius101">
ComputerGenius101,</a><br />
<p>
</p><p>I had troubles installing my S4 with BlueTooth (BT) on Windows 7 using Microsoft drivers.</p>
<p>I think my solution for S4 should also work with your S4 Mini-</p>
<ol>
<li>I uninstalled all BT software on my PC then cleared device driver build-up with
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb_devices_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">USB Deview</a>.<br />
</li><li>I installed <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/support/bluetooth/update.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Broadcom BT device drivers</a> on my PC--which apparently works with any USB BT adapter.<br />
</li><li>I installed <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.medieval.blueftp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
BT File Transfer</a> on my S4. <br />
</li><li>With the S4 BT turned off, using the BT File Transfer Widget: I activated "Bluetooth File Receiving Service (OPP) Port 12" and then the "Bluetooth File Sharing Service (FTP) Port 30".
<br />
</li><li>I turned S4 BT on and re-paired with Windows. All BT services found on my S4 were installed except one:
<ul>
<li>Bluetooth Hands-free Audio</li><li>Bluetooth L2CAP Interface</li><li>Bluetooth Remote Control</li><li>GATT Protocol</li><li>GAP Protocol</li><li>Bluetooth Headset AG</li><li>Bluetooth Hands-free AG</li><li>Bluetooth AV Remote-Control Target</li><li>Bluetooth AV Source</li><li>Bluetooth Network Access</li><li>Bluetooth Personal Area Network User (PANU)</li><li>Bluetooth OPP</li><li>Bluetooth FTP<br />
</li><li>Bluetooth Message Access</li><li>Bluetooth Peripheral Device--Not Installed.<br />
</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>My S4 appeared in Windows Explorer as a system folder under My Computer--with full upload/download capabilities--just as if I had connected via USB cable, though only the internal memory was available, not the SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can stream music from my S4 to my PC speakers, or use a PC headset or microphone and speakers for voice calls--though I don't have a headset nor a mic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a fancy BT dialogue window to view sms inbox as well as send and receive text messages and notifications, though I've found the inbox to be often out-of-sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can also use my S4 as a proximity device to lock my PC when I leave it and then unlock it when I return, this is good at work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't been able to use the BT Network Access--using the S4 as an internet connection--using the Broadcom drivers, even when I activate the BT Tethering setting before pairing. I have seen this service available when I used different drivers and I'm pretty
 sure it worked but audio streaming didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure the BT Peripheral Device that did not install with the Broadcom drivers is for using the S4 to control the mouse or keyboard on the PC, or perhaps visa versa, using the PC mouse and keyboard to control the S4. I have seen this service installed
 and available when I used different drivers, but it didn't work and nor did audio streaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps, feel free to ask if you want me to clarify anything.</p>

            <p>Hi DomsIs Me,</p>
<p>I read your way "how to install the right bluetooth drivers". I experience also a problem with bluetooth S4 and my sony laptop with WIN7 Professional. Bluetooth is working: I can sent files and make connection with my S4 and play music (which is on my S4)
 on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE BLUETOOTH SERVICES &gt; like using your phone and making calls and things like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My S4 is visible not in the category "bluetooth devices", but in "devices and printers". When I click on my S4 device and use the right click menu and open "properties". There is a warning that a device driver is not installed. &nbsp;What I can find on the internet
 is that there are no drivers available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I search on the web there are various workarounds. Your discription is one of them. But I have some functions active. What exactly I have to uninstall? I can see bluetooth at "network adapters", at "bluetooth radio's (2x entries) and "other devices"
 &gt; the entry is "bluetooth peripheral device"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I am Dutch and some descriptions are translations of Dutch, maybe it is stated in a different way in your version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I would like to know whether it is possible to use more bluetooth connections??? If I would use your workaround would I get al these extra possibilities?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance ;-))</p>

<br />Skype does not have an Account No. on Skype, you have a unique Skype ID
<br />
<br />Click your Profile Pic there you will see your Skype Name and Skype ID - the ID is the one beginning with Live:

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try a program called Parted Magic. I use version &nbsp;pmagic_2013_08_01....</p>
<p>It downloads as an ISO image that you burn to a CD.... You then can boot with the CD and use it's
</p>
<p>"File Explorer" to copy your files... providing the hard drive will work long enough to allow this....</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a LINUX based program, not Windows, so there is a bit of a leaning process involved...</p>
<p>It names the Drives differently then Windows.... All of the file names and stuff are the same, just the drive ID is different.... It calls the something like sd01 or similar, instead of C:\...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried to do a BOOT REPAIR on your hard drive... it may not be failing... maybe just a bad boot file.</p>

            <p>Dear Sir, I got your good recommendation.</p>
<p>I am downloading and will burn it and working on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But i was using Acronis that i can run from Live CD to attached that death Hard Drive.. I saw that Hard drive..</p>
<p>I can access some documents and copied it to the safe place.. but some data located on bad sector, when i was trying to copying it, it was always said, I/O error so this is that my worry even i saw it but i can't copy it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea to make it work more, it is very great.</p>

            <p>Hey there DiseasedBadger!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the activity alert issue! I see some recent recordings on your Xbox Live profile, so let's start by <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/security/remove-profile-from-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">removing your Xbox Live account from your Xbox One</a> and then sign back in and see if you can see them on your feed. Let us know if that helps out! :)</p>

            <p>Yup! Everything looks good when I view your profile. Are you checking your profile on the Xbox One Dashboard? Navigate to the Friends group and select the Friends tile. In the Friends tile, select 'My profile' on the left side of the screen. When you are viewing your profile, you should be able to see your Activity Feed on the right side of the screen. If you don't see it there, post back and let us know so we can get this issue sorted for you! :)</p>

            <p>I see, have you tried scrolling down to to the time frame you earned those achievements? It's easy for activities to be pushed down if a lot of your friends are super active on Xbox Live. Scroll down the Activity Feed inside the Friends app until you see "1d ago" or "2d ago", since that is when your more recent activities are.</p>
<p>If this isn't what you're speaking of, post a picture or screenshot of what you're looking at so we can narrow down the issue for you! :)</p>

            <p>Yeah go for it! Earn an achievement and post back if that shows up correctly. Keep in mind it could take 48 hours for achievements to come through in certain situations, so if you don't see it right away, keep checking back at it! :)</p>

<p>Go ahead and try a power cycle to clear the system cache. After that, try earning a few more achievements and upload game clips and let us know if the behavior keeps persisting.</p>
<p>To power cycle the Xbox One console:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Press and hold the power button on the Xbox One console for 10 seconds.</span></li>
<li><span>Once the unit is powered off, unplug the power cable from the Xbox One and let it sit for 5 minutes.</span></li>
<li><span>Plug the power back into the unit and power the console on.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Post back and let us know how it goes! :)</p>

            <p>Hi Rajeshwari,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run the Power Troubleshooter before posting my question, and it didn't help. It only changed the time to sleep to an HP recommended setting because I had to make it 5 hours to avoid the laptop going to sleep and not waking up several times a day (as I
 read that frequent use of force shutdown in this case can cause problems).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest updates installed on Feb 16 were:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security Update for Microsoft Windows (KB3135173)</p>
<p>Security Update for Adobe Flash Player</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shall I uninstall these updates to see if it helps with my issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

</p><p>I restored default power plan settings as you suggested but it didn't help - I put my PC to sleep, and the power button didn't work to open my laptop again, so had to force restart it once again.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I also wanted to mention that when I put my laptop to hibernate instead of sleep and want to wake it up, there is the same problem - pressing the power button doesn't wake the laptop. So I have to keep it pressed until the power button's led light goes off
 and then press it again so that it powers up. But unlike after waking up from sleep mode, when my laptop wakes up after hibernate all my files and open webpages are there, and I don't have to restore them.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Black Screen, Cant boot into recovery mode</h2>
                    When I booted up my laptop it suddenly would not boot and would just sit on a blank screen. I tried getting into my HP recovery mode which just showed a background but nothing came up and then tried getting into windows 8 recovery but that also did not
 load. I tired reinstalling Windows 8 if my disc and it just stays on "setup is starting" and the repair options on the disc do not load. All I can do is get into my BIOS which has no option to go to Factory settings unlike my custom built desktop pc.&nbsp;

<div>Someone please help I am completely stuck&nbsp;</div>

<div>My laptop came with Windows 7 when brought but did that windows 8 £20 upgrade offer a few months back, but wish I never did Windows 8 and 8.1 is just a total nightmare and even my Desktop sometimes gets blue screens!</div>

    <title>Windows automatically lowers my sound&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> astrocat17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows automatically lowers my sound&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I listen to songs on iTunes everything sounds fine, but whenever I launch a game from Steam the sound on iTunes automatically lowers itself, even though there is no change in the windows sound mixer. And I have also tried to change the communication
 settings by right-clicking on the sound icon in my task bar and then selecting playback devices, and then proceeding to the communication tab in the next window, I then change it from, "Reduce sound by 80% whenever windows detects communication", to "do nothing",
 so that it does not automatically level the sound when it thinks there is communication going on. But this still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not to sure what to do now, Here is the path I took just encase. <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt;<strong> Hardware and Sound</strong> &gt;<strong> Sound</strong> &gt;
<strong>Communications</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<em>Do nothing</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking your time to read this.</p>

            <p>Im having the same issue, that whenever a "new" sound appears, and it can be everything from UAC ping sound, or voice comms or music over Youtube or vice versa also any and all games so far are affected.</p>
<p>So, when a "new" sound appears, the already running sound(s) are having their volume lowered until windows figures out if the new sound is here to stay (music over Youtube for example, or music over game) then it levels the sound for both applications. But
 if the new sound is NOT there to stay, voice comms or UAC or Facebook notifications, the already running sound is having the volume lowered for the duration of the notification and for a while thereafter (3-5 seconds).
</p>
<p>Then it comes back up to normal. So this is especially annoying when dealing with voice comms or the Facebook page is open&nbsp;and alot of notifications are coming in. Makes the sound in game or in video really jumpy in the volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also checked and doublechecked the "Do Nothing" for voice comms. Help immensly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S I dl'ed this file you were talking about, but I dont know how to run it.</p>

            <p>I have exactly the same problem, whenever someone talks on for example on Teamspeak 3 (or any other application plays a sound), the volume gets lowered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already set the option under the sound settings for communication to "do nothing", but thats exactly what it does... nothing. It keeps lowering the volume.</p>
<p>I also tried to uncheck the "exklusive Control" checkboxes, both for mic and Speakers, but that also didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here is the dump from meters.exe: I was running teamspeak and diablo at the time, for testing, but at that time no one talked. I did a dump like 2 seconds after the volume was lowered in the game, alt tabbing out of it. But the info was exactly the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can do something with this, as this is really annyoing as hell.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Edit: </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think i have it. </p>
<p>I had Soundblaster Cinema application installed, wich worked perfectly on Win 8.1 before, but it doesn't work on Win 10 (and still no Win 10 Verstion from Creative or MSI available...),it always crashes as soon as it is clicked in the systray.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i removed it from the autostart, having believed to have gone around the problem this way.
</p>
<p>But that was not the case. </p>
<p>Now i completely uninstalled the Software and that seems to have fixed the Problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will do some testing now. </p>
<p>I will edit my post if my first observation is not right and it still isn't gone.</p>

<h2>            Hard Drive Filled Up After System Restore.  Half The Files are Still There After Cleanmanager.   Can I Delete More&#63;</h2>
                    A System restore fixed far more than I would have hoped.&nbsp; It also used up 30 GB of disk space.&nbsp; Windows Cleanmanager&nbsp;&nbsp;deleted about half.&nbsp; Is there a decent way to clean out the rest?

            It's hard to give advice without knowing the nature of the files in question.&nbsp; You can find out what's taking up your storage space with a tool like the free

Wiztree</a> and then if you still have questions you can post back with more specifics.
