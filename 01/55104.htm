                    <p>I tried for the first time today using Skype. When I signed in, using my Microsoft 365 account, my daughter's profile and all of her information for her established account shows up. She can't access her account and I can't get rid of her account's attachment

<h2>            Bluetooth speakers connect and disconnect immediately</h2>
                    Hello, I use windows 10 and after the fall creators update (1709) my bluetooth speakers (sony srs xb10) were unable to connect. After the newest update (1803) they do connect but after seconds they disconnect. Especially when I open a media player such
 as youtube or windows media player they don't function. Before these two updates the speakers worked properly. It seems like some frequency interference is taking place. Is there something I can do? Thank you in advance.

            Hi Œ§Œ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by the April Version 1803 Update you can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thank you for the response. I have done most of these in the past and din't work. I tried to install the old driver but nothing. It may help you the fact that when I open for example youtube suddently the bluetooth speaker disconnects and youtube also
 stops...Other times the speakers function for seconds and then stop again. It is very weird. I repeat that before these windows updates it was very easy to connect.

            In that case if you've tried all known troubleshooting steps I gave then I  think we need to get you back before the Updates that caused this.  Since it's too late to roll back and this began being trouble after Version 1709, would you want to go back to Version 1703 or even the old Windows Edition that came with the PC?  I can help you do this.  
<br />
<br />I agree that this is aggravating and should not be necessary if things had kept working like they were earlier in WIndows 10.   If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />Since there are enough cases of Bluetooth becoming problematic at about the same time you report it,  if you want to post back a share link to your feedback I will try to vote it up with my MVP badge and monitor it to see that it gets developers' attention.  
<br />
<br />One other thing before Clean Installing Version 1703 or the older Windows edition that it came on the PC (f applicable) is to try Clean Installing Windows 10 latest version if you had not yet because this is one thing that sometimes does work for many with these protracted Version Update issues.  If so here is the link for a Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Older versions of Windows 10 are downloadable from here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.

<p>The first thing I try with a Bluetooth device problem is to remove the device and re-pair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those speakers are supposed to have a way to reset them, including all paring info you could try if you haven't already.&nbsp; Make sure you don't have other devices close which might interfere with the signal.&nbsp; Wi-Fi might also affect a Bluetooth signal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have other connections which might be using the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth radios?&nbsp; Bluetooth Personal Area&nbsp;Network active?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried changing positions of the speakers in case the Bluetooth signal is being diminished?&nbsp; Laptop or Desktop unit and do you know where the Bluetooth antenna is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked the Device Manager and looked at the properties of both the Bluetooth radio and the speakers to see if any info is being listed on the Events tab when you try to connect?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a folder in the Windows directory named LiveKernelReports.&nbsp; You may find a dump file there even though your are not getting Blue Screens.</p>

<p>Thank you for the response. I tried to close the Wi-Fi and seems that the problem is fixed! Obviously it is not a solution! Before these updates there was't this interference.
<br />
There is definitely an interference between the Wi-Fi of my computer (I checked all other devices) and the speaker. I don't know why this is happening but I can't use the speakers only in offline mode...</p>

<p>If this is a laptop, the same device may be used for both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.&nbsp; If you can get to the card you might verify the antenna connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, you might try changing the location of the units.</p>

            It does say what files were skipped, but I have deleted the message I received.&nbsp; I will pose the question again the next time it skips file in the backup.&nbsp; It has happened before and I just ignored the message and now the same two files were skipped again.

<h2>            Sign in options windows 10</h2>
                    I have been abled to sign in with the pin I created when I first installed Windows 10. Then yesterday I was completely locked out of my pc and had to use my phone to create a new password to access my computer. I have been attempting to recreate a pin
 to sign in. Every time I go to settings, accounts, sign-in options there is no response. If I search sign-in and choose set up pin option the app says setting not responding. Is there a way to fix this?

            <p><span>Hi Deborah,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the inconvenience you are facing in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's try the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Check if the issue resolves in
</span><strong><span>Safe Mode with Networking.</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Refer this </span><strong><span>article to boot to safe mode:<span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">
</span></span></strong></span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue resolves perform a clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Put the computer into
</span><strong><span>clean boot </span></strong><span>state and check</span><strong><span>.</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow:<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> </span></span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run
 a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 3: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>I would also suggest you to
</span><strong><span>try creating a new user account </span></strong></span><span><span>and check if issue persists.<br />

            Thanks for the answer but I think you should fix the problem on Microsoft's end and I shouldn't have to keep doing this. I am not am engineer so I don't know how to do half of what you said. So my choice is to go back to windows 7, call my pc guy&nbsp;or buy
 an apple. Because Microsoft is to cheap to have real customer service.

<p>3rd party. </p>
<p>By taking away the requirment for 3rd party to have to use MS/Sony's PSN/XBL switchboard. No switchboard codex means 3rd party games sold on Win10, Xbox and Sony could be played with/against owners of other consoles etc.
</p>
<p>I sorta discussed this in my last thread. And now, it's likely to happen faster than even I suspected.

<p>I didn't think of that, Sony approval? I'm playing street fighter 5 on PS4 against PC players and it works fine. If this does become a regular thing I can only see it being positive for the XB1.</p>

<p>If Microsoft were genuine they would have reached sony/nintendo in private and make this a collaborative announcement.<br />
<br />
makes me think there is a few devils in the details and they are pulling a publicity stunt to strong arm sony into agreeing to&nbsp; lopsided/controled deal</p>
<p>Sony already has 2 crossplay games with wii u</p>
<p>here is 1</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Chess" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/.../Pure_Chess</a></p>
<p>Microsoft has almost always been the bottleneck here.<br />
<br />
360 had crossplay with ps2 for an mmo but Microsoft changed its tune soon after</p>
<p>love how all of a sudden they are the "enablers"</p>

<p>In the Sony camp, many are saying this will never happen. Why? Console sales according to most, not a negative impact. I honestly think it's a great idea, just not shooters with pc/Mouse/Kb support. So MS and Sony together would be great, if the Division
 supported it I'd be more than happy.</p>

<p>if Sony denies it then Microsoft is pulling something behind the scenes. nebulous,disruptive and harmful, simple as that.</p>
<p>Sony has cross play games with other consoles and pc already, and this is a proven fact.</p>
<p>this will be a litmus test of microsoft's intentions. If sony denies they can tell exactly why, cause they sure as hell are not signing any NDA's when the RL dev is putting on pressure pulling this stunt with ms<br />
<br />
if Microsoft was genuine this would have been talked about with more parties. its fishy and microsofts messging latly has been very confusing</p>

<h2>            reactivate windows after hardware change</h2>
                    <p>I know this has been covered a thousand times but the troubleshooter is not working for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to re-activate windows 10 pro ( 8.1 upgrade) after a cpu and motherboard change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried using the activation troubleshooter signed in as admin but I keep getting&nbsp; error code 0x803F700F</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also says my product key is not valid and since it's a 8.1 upgrade I don't, well, have a product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried calling but the tech treated me like I was a pirate even though it is a legitimate copy and gave me the run around and told me to call back later....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have no relevant options in my Microsoft account to add new hardware, I can however see my old motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>

            Hi Marc.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.   
<br />
<br />If Windows came pre-installed on the PC then changing the motherboard voids the license.  Free Upgrade inherits that restriction.  You'll need to buy a new license:  <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US...</a>
<br />
<br />If it was retail Windows then follow these steps for reactivating:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have any retail Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Product Key that's no longer needed you can use it to activate fresh, because that method is still in prolonged grace period which we have not yet heard has ended.  
<br />
<br />You can also ask for help from MS Support to get it activated:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/windows/setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>

            Ciao, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, a Microsoft Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, please try the below:
<br />
<br />1) Boot in WinRE (as you did in the video)
<br />
<br />2) Click on Troubleshoot -&gt; Advanced options -&gt; Command Prompt
<br />
<br />3) At the command prompt, type:
<br />
<br />    - bootrec /FixMbr and + ENTER 
<br />    - bootrec /fixboot and + ENTER
<br />    - bootrec /ScanOs + ENTER
<br />    - bootrec /RebuildBcd + ENTER
<br />    - Exit + ENTER
<br />
<br />The computer should reboot and allow the refresh or repair of Windows 10 to complete.
<br />
<br />(ref. <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/04/sln304076/hard-drive-locked-error-during-windows-10-recovery?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/04/sl...</a>)
<br />
<br />If the above doesn't work, can you please share make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helped somehow. 
<br />
<br />Ciao 
<br />Ugo

    <title>Can I erase taking ownership of C drive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meghanbaxley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I erase taking ownership of C drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I got a brand new Lenovo Miix from the store, but when I went through the regular set-up and installation of Windows 10 some of the Microsoft apps would not work (mainly Skype and the App Store). It would open for a millisecond and then nothing happened.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some Googling I saw that taking ownership of my C drive (changing ownership from TrustedInstaller to my profile) could fix this. Quickly I realized this was a dumb decision. The desktop would appear normal but no text would appear when I opened the
 start menu and none of the apps worked. I restarted the computer but that made matters worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all this I attempted to do a clean install, but at every stage of the set up (when Cortana introduces itself and walks you through), the message "something went wrong" appeared. I click "skip this step" for every stage until I can connect to a wifi
 network, but after connecting the message still appears and I can't work around it to get to the desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can give C drive ownership back to TrustedInstaller? Or is the root of the problem something else?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Meghan.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can try running a Repair Install using the latest media from Media Creation tool:  <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-repair-windows-10-using-in-place-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-repair-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />If that won't work then follow these steps for the gold standard Clean Install which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You must boot the media as a UEFI device if offered, delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space and then click Next to auto-format and  begin - anything less is not a Clean Install.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Meghan -  Let's try repairs from boot then where they will be more stable and WIndows has no say so can't interfere.  
<br />
<br />Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br /> 
<br />If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Startup Options here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br /> 
<br />From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn‚Äôt fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br /> 
<br />If Safe Mode doesn‚Äôt work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />An alternative is to run Factory Recovery from it‚Äôs  hotkey at boot; find yours by googling the ‚ÄúPC make/model + Run Factory Recovery.‚Äù    But keep in mind the Factory install is greatly inferior to a Clean Install, a Reset or a Refresh without the crippling factory bloatware.    After Recovery mitigate the inferior factory install with the Checklist steps from earlier.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and keep us posted on how it goes.

<br />Run it 2 or 3 times.
<br />
<br />RESET ALL STORE APPS / REREGISTER / APPS MISSING FROM WIN START MENU
<br />Re-register all store apps, so they appear again in start menu.  For that, open a PowerShell window as Administrator. Copy and paste the following line into the PowerShell window and press Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register ‚Äú$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml‚Äù -Verbose } 
<br />
<br />Note:	if you re-register all applications, all your apps are back, however all your pinned apps will be reset (the right panel will be empty) so you need to re-pin everything that you want. Personnaly I did a screen capture before, to remember what I pinned and where (use the ‚Äúsnipping tool‚Äù in startmenu/windows accessories, with a delay to be able to open the start menu before the capture)

<br />Learn how to reset apps in Windows 10, so that apps failed to start and work properly can be set back to default configuration, without reinstalling them.
<br />We all know that Windows 10 comes with some pre-installed apps called built-in apps. It means whenever we create a new user account, all of these built-in apps will be available on that account. So whenever users have issues with built-in apps, Windows experts give them the advice to create a new user account and sort the issue. But by following that advice, the newly created user account won‚Äôt have those app which are installed from Windows Store. Hence, in this way the advice of creating new profile has a limitation and it doesn‚Äôt helps for apps installed from Store.

    <title>Upgrading from Home to Pro &#40;Volume Licence&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> orrinwitt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading from Home to Pro &#40;Volume Licence&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I work at an non-profit organisation that recently acquired a volume licence. We have several computers that had been donated previously that have Windows 10 Home on them. I need to upgrade them to Pro to take advantage of some of the Pro features (networking,
 RDP, etc.). Unfortunately, I have discovered that I cannot simply change the product key and upgrade the version using the in-place upgrade feature because volume licence keys are not compatible with that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is: if I create an installation media, can I use that to upgrade to Pro with the new licence key, and if so, will it be like an upgrade where all my files and programs are still there? Obviously I could do a fresh install, but like anyone, I'd
 rather leave that as a last option.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Mouse 1850 Stopped Moving Without Warning</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I was having a problem with my Microsoft Wireless Mouse 1850. I recently bought it from a local store near my home. For two days, it working charming without any problems, but at the third day, my mouse getting some error. I was viewing websites,
 and suddenly my mouse stopped moving at all without any warning or sound played if you disconnect a device from USB. At first, I think I may have accidentally touch the Nano Transceiver and make it disconnected, but the problems still came after a few second
 I plug it in again (sometimes it can last up to 15 to 30 minutes, but mostly it only last for 15 second).</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is the some troubleshoot I've done:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>tried to plug it in on another USB slot, still having a problem</li><li>tried to uninstall the device from devmgmt.msc and restarting, still having a problem</li><li>tried to replace the battery to a brand new, still facing the same problems</li><li>tried to update the Driver Software, nothing came up and says that I have the best driver installed</li><li>tried to check Windows Update, also nothing</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running on Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Build 10586.71. Is there anything I can do to repair it, or should I ask a refund from the store?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

            <p>I have got the same issue.&nbsp; My child cannot sign in and play Overwatch on his account, even though I have an xbox live subscription on the Xbox One.&nbsp; The only way I can get into the game is to sign in as myself (the parent account) and start the game.&nbsp; One in the game then I press "X" to change profile.&nbsp; And then changing to my childs account sends me back to the Overwatch entry screen.&nbsp; But this time it lets him play.</p><p><br /></p><p>Can somebody help, this is a real pain as I need to be there to sign in if my child wants to play this game.</p>

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One possible cause of this error is due to a corruption on the Windows Store apps. In the event that you receive an error "Windows Store Cache may be damaged" after running the app troubleshooter, what you can do is Reset the cache folder in App Directory.
 To do that, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp;Open File Explorer, copy and paste the following path in the explorer address bar and hit Enter.<br />
Path: C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsStore_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState.<br />
</li><li>Now, in the <strong>LocalState</strong> folder, check whether the <strong>cache</strong> folder is present or not. If it is there, rename it
<strong>cache.old</strong> After that, create a new folder and name it <strong>cache</strong>. In case the cache folder is not there by default, just create an empty new folder and name it cache.</li><li>Once you are done with the above step, close the File Explorer and reboot your computer. After the reboot, run the
<strong>Windows Store Apps troubleshooter</strong> again. This time it will not only detect the issue, but also automatically resolve it.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to us with the result.</p>

<p>Hi ML,</p>
<p>Than you for your reply. &nbsp;I've just followed the steps above (I did have to create a blank Cache folder) but when I run the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter I still&nbsp;<span>get the pop up error: ‚Äúms-windows-store:PurgeCaches,
 Class not registered‚Äù before then getting ‚ÄúWindows Store cache may be damaged.&nbsp; Not fixed‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span>Any other suggestions?</span></p>

<p>If the suggested steps didn't help, you can run the following in a Command Window to re-register the Store app:<strong> powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore\AppxManifest.xml</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also use other media or video player. This is to check if the .MOV file that you're trying to play on Windows Photo can be played.</p>

<p>I tried your suggestion above (which is way beyond my capability!) and got an error - see attached image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with the .MOV files. &nbsp;They work fine in other video players and also on Windows Photo on other machines.</p>

<p>Hi Andy, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The possible cause of this issue is due to software conflicts. Let's try to perform clean boot in Windows and check if the issue persists.
<span>This is done to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. Also, it helps eliminate software conflicts of an update or when you run a program in Windows. Check this

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><span><span>You may also try to uninstall the Photos app via Windows PowerShell, and then reinstall it from the Windows Store. Doing so will basically reinstall the Photos app and fixes any issues that you might have.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>Here's how:</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span><span>Click on<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span>Start</span></strong><span><span><strong>,</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span>Search</span></strong><span><span><strong>,</strong> or<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span>Cortana</span></strong><span><span>,
 and then type<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><strong>Windows</strong></span><span>
</span><span><strong>Powershell</strong></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><strong>Right-click</strong></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>on the first result, and then select Run as administrator.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>In the Windows PowerShell window, type the following command, and then press<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span>Enter</span></strong><span><span>. This will give you a list of all Windows apps installed on your PC:</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>Get-AppxPackage ‚ÄìAllUsers</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Scroll through the list and locate the entry called<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><strong>Microsoft.Windows.Photos</strong></span><span><span>, and then copy its<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span>PackageFullName</span></strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>to<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span>Notepad</span></strong><span><span>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>To uninstall the Photos app, type the following command, and then press<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span>Enter</span></strong><span><span>:</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>remove-AppxPackage PackageFullName</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've already tried this (it was an earlier suggestion, up at the top!) but I thought I'd give it another go. &nbsp;Same result, didn't work, BUT I noticed something that I didn't notice last time:</p>
<p>I have 3 user accounts (including one which is the administrator account). &nbsp;When I remove Photos using PowerShell it only actually removes the App from the administrator account.</p>
<p>Any ideas?<br />
</p>
<p>Andy</p>

<h2>            Why are Xbox One games 70&#36; instead of 60&#36;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Why are Xbox One games 70$ instead of 60$? I went on Amazon to go and pre order some Xbox One games and noticed that there all 65-70$ why is next gen so expensive? I have been buying consoles forever and the games were always 60$ and up why is the starting
 point now 65-70$?</p>

<p>I'm assuming you're in the U.S., right? Standard X1 games are $60 or less at Amazon. What game are you looking at exactly? Are you sure you're not looking at the limited edition version or something like that?</p>

<p>Canadians are expected to pay more.... and we accept it. $69.99 seems to be the norm on my game marketplace. Keep in mind products that are produced in Canada that are exported to the USA are cheaper down there then up here. We are glutens for financial
 punishment, but I wouldn't ever think of moving state side.... </p>

<p>Also, gaming is a hobby. I don't like the increase in the game prices but such is life. I can afford it so it's not a bother.</p>

<p>Look at Sorny increasing the price of the PS4 in Canada by $50.... &nbsp;they blame the currency difference.... it's because we have a strong economy. That is a positive (but expensive).</p>
