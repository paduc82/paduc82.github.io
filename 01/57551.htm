<p>You can't. They are only for voice. You would need to buy some stereo headphones and a means to connect them to the console. Just don't get suckered into an overpriced gamer setup such as the ones made by Tritton or Turtle Beach. The only possible thing
 I can recommend made for console is the Astro Mixamp but not the headphones.</p>

<p>It would be plugged into the console itself. There are a couple ways you can do this depending on your budget. You can go cheap with something like a pair of Sennheiser HD 202 MKII's with a Zalman ZM-mic1 clip on mic and an inexpensive audio adaptor.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>A more expensive and recommended route would be the Astro Mixamp and either those 202's as a starter pair or go big with something a bit more expensive. The mixamp costs $130 on Astros site but is well worth it with 7.1 Dolby Digital surround sound and four
 presets for online shooters, campaigns, movies and sports. An ideal headset would be the Sennheiser HD598's and the same clip on mic I mention earlier but there are cheaper options as well.</p>

<p>Just try and stay away from the more convenient options of Tritton and Turtle Beach, Razer, etc console gaming headphones. While some of them may sound decent, none of them are worth the money they want for them. They are essentially $20 headphones with
 a $100 to $300 price tag due to the bells, whistles and marketing to a userbase that knows very little about audio. Lets just say there is a reason these companies don't make anything besides console gaming headphones. Meanwhile the other companies I mention
 and the companies in that faq make high quality equipment for professional recording, mixing and optimal listening. Lets just say its like the difference between buying an Emerson or Proscan HDTV vs a Panasonic or Samsung.</p>

<p>No problem. I kind of got ripped a bit myself when I bought my Astro A40 Audio system. Now while it did sound pretty decent, the actual headphones included were not nearly worth the price they are trying to charge. When it comes to these companies sound
 processors, they are very good. But in every case, the headphones themselves completely suck.</p>

<p>TB's being $20 headphones (quality wise) with a $100 to $300 price tag? &nbsp;that's a bit exaggerated there. &nbsp;entry level TB's, x12s, have a retail price listed as $60. &nbsp;You can actually find them all day long for $40-$45 (sometimes even cheaper). sure, there
 are better headphones out there, but for $40, you'd be pretty hard pressed to find better. at that price, they are solid, entry level sets.</p>

<p>Its not exaggerated at all. Have you listened to other brands to be able to dispute the comparison? Like I said earlier. There is a reason Turtle Beach makes nothing other than "Console" audio systems. Its an easy money grab at the expense of misinformed
 consumers. There is also nothing at all special about the X11/X12's and even an entry level pair of Sennheisers at half the price sound five times better.</p>

<p>BUT It is exaggerated; they are not at $100 to $300 price tag. &nbsp;They cost &lt; $40. &nbsp;There is no need to misquote prices in order to make your argument sound better (no pun intended).</p>
<p>Yes I have had/tried many other brands. That's not the argument being made. If your actually read my post, I stated that there are better headphones out there, but at $40, the x12's are a nice entry level set. &nbsp;What entry level Sennheiser's cost half, which
 would be $20, that sound 5x better? &nbsp;The 201's? I've seen the 201's for sale at an average for $35, about the same price. &nbsp;I'm sure those are nice entry level headsets too, but it doesn't change that the x12's are also nice entry level headsets.</p>

</p><p>Hi Tony, </p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why your are getting different errors on the Event Viewer is because of the high disk usage in your computer. Also, one of the reason why you are getting high disk usage is because of the program Runtime Broker. You may refer
 to the helpful post of taay007 by clicking this link: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_perf-insiderplat_pc/high-disk-usage-in-latest-build-90-100/2cc31982-3cad-41e9-9e42-a9b10d0cbcb3">
<em>High disk usage in latest build? (90-100%)</em></a>. You can find this post from the first page of the thread dated January 24, 2016.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the troubleshooting step<strong> 7: Fix your StorAHCI.sys driver </strong>
that you mentioned, did you also disable the MSI for the controller in the registry? If you haven't, you may access this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/3083595/task-manager-might-show-100-disk-utilization-on-windows-10-devices-wit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>link</em></a></strong> and refer to the second step to

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a computer tech or engineer.&nbsp; I do not know why this is happening or what I am doing wrong.&nbsp; I am sorry I am taking up your time :/&nbsp; I carefully re-read what you said<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.<br />
</span></p>
<p>This is the controller listed: Intel(R) 8 Series/C220 Chipset Family SATA AHCI Controller</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c:\windows\ystem32\drivers\<strong>iaStorA.sys &lt;----</strong><br />

<strong>I go here follow it to MSI and change it to 0?&nbsp; This will disable it.&nbsp; Then reboot.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>I completely removed(uninstalled) everything from my computer with the word<strong> Skype.</strong>&nbsp;<strong> I disabled notifications as you suggested(Taay)</strong>, but I want notifications.&nbsp; However, I did what Taay/you said. &nbsp; They are shut off!<br />
<br />
This is my virtual memory, I this is what I changed it to last time and this is how it remained through the fresh install. Can someone look, it is correct?&nbsp; 8mb total system ram:

</p><p>The amount of errors I am getting makes no sense. I do not want to over do it, provide too much information for you to read.&nbsp; But below is a copy and paste of a few of the errors from MSINFO. &nbsp; Keep in mind, this is all about 24 hours after a new Windows
 install.<br />

</p><p>Hi Tony, </p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why your are getting different errors on the Event Viewer is because of the high disk usage in your computer. Also, one of the reason why you are getting high disk usage is because of the program Runtime Broker. You may refer

</p><p>Regarding the troubleshooting step<strong> 7: Fix your StorAHCI.sys driver </strong>
that you mentioned, did you also disable the MSI for the controller in the registry? If you haven't, you may access this

<h2>            Permissions issue while editing the Action tab in Task Scheduler</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was going through my Task Scheduler and found something. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I hit "properties" and looked under the "Action" tab it says &nbsp; &nbsp;Custom Handler.</p>
<p>What the heck does that mean?</p>
<p>I hit the "edit" button to see what would happen and it said I'm not allowed to edit.</p>
<p>Why would that be? &nbsp;I own the darn computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be great. Thanks.</p>

<p>I am able to connect to the internet and to other computers in the workgroup, but I am not able to see the LAN connection for my network adapter. It is an NVidia NForce Gigabit Ethernet Adapter.</p>
<p>I've tried reinstalling the chipset drivers but they cannot load and I have to restore the system to before the re-installation.</p>
<p>Is there any way this can be fixed?</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to uninstall the Network adapter from the device manager and then restart the computer to let the Windows generic drivers for the device to be installed. To
 do this follow the steps below:</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>Click on start, in the start search box type device manger and then press enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the list of devices right click on the Network adapter and then click on Uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer after the device has been uninstalled.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Once the computer restarts, it will try installing the Windows generic drivers for the network adapter.</span></p>
<p><span>Check to see if your issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to download the latest drivers from the Nvidia website, you can follow the link below to download the drivers for Windows 7.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards with your concern, it seems there are new policies that was released by you financial institution, therefore, recurring payments wont be available as we are obliged to follow the new policies and regulation that was sent to us by your bank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a work around, you may try to purchase Skype credits and use this as payment method of your subscriptions. Just make sure that you have enough credit balance to finance the recurring payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may follow the steps on this link on how to change the payment method of your subscriptions:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10486/how-do-i-update-my-credit-card-or-other-payment-method-in-skype?q=how+can+i+change+the+payment+method" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Payment method.</a></p>

<p>Yeah, I have the same problem too.&nbsp; Even paying 'manually' with my card for Skype is a bit of a nightmare, I usually have to try 2-3 times before it goes through; but you know what, if MS discontinues Skype 7 and forces us to use the incomplete Skype 8 I
 might just not bother with trying to get my payments to go through anymore.&nbsp; MS is becoming increasingly incompetent.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope they wake up and decide to sort their issues out.&nbsp; If not, I will be sure to vote with my wallet.</p>

<p>I was able to pay for my Skype Number manually yesterday using the same credit card that I've always used. &nbsp;My other subscription is due in December. &nbsp;I'll see what happens. &nbsp;In the meantime, I continue to make recurring payments with that same card for
 all my utilities (electric, phone, cell phone, etc) with no problems that I am aware of. &nbsp;I guess I'll be calling my CC company to see if they can sort this out... but it sounds like a Skype thing if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your input. &nbsp;It's good to know I'm not the only one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>===========</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: &nbsp;I just contacted my credit card issuer. &nbsp;They said the problem is with Skype, not my credit card. &nbsp;I had a feeling this was the case. &nbsp;Here is my reply to Skype's agent, "Rain":</p>
<p>

</p><p><em>I just contacted my credit card company. &nbsp;To be clear, it is the credit card company that issued my Visa Signature Rewards card, the same card that I've been using on my Skype account. &nbsp;They assured me that recurring payments are NOT an issue for them

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards with your concern, it seems there are new policies that was released by you financial institution, therefore, recurring payments wont be available as we are obliged to follow the new policies and regulation that was sent to us by your bank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a work around, you may try to purchase Skype credits and use this as payment method of your subscriptions. Just make sure that you have enough credit balance to finance the recurring payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may follow the steps on this link on how to change the payment method of your subscriptions:

<h2>            Disk structure corrupted</h2>
                    G'day chaps/chappesses.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I replaced my HD with a super dooper SSD and reinstalled W7. &nbsp;</div>
<div>So far so good. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My intention was to mount the old HD &nbsp;(SATA) in a caddy and copy across the bits I needed via USB. &nbsp;</div>
<div>First attempt showed the full disk and I copied a few files. &nbsp;However, returning to transfer the rest, W7 tells me the disk structure is corrupted and unreadable. &nbsp;The disk shows up in disk management as the correct size, 180Gb with a healthy primary partition,
 but so far, all attempts to read the disk have failed. &nbsp;re-installing in the lappy and booting also fails. &nbsp;I am reluctant to install a fresh W7 on the disk as I may end up losing stuff. &nbsp;I do have most of the data that was on the disk saved elsewhere (having
 spent lots of time preaching about backing up, I am almost, but not completely, hoist with my own petard) &nbsp;so losing the HD isn't a show stopper, it will just be a lot easier to recover it all from the one place. &nbsp;Any ideas or suggestions gratefully received&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like you are experiencing disk failure. If the data still shows on the drive, it would be best to extract and save the data before completing more diagnostics tests that could possibly cause data loss.<span>
</span>As far as the 3rd party tool is concerned, the time it takes depends on that product and the size of the drive.</p>

    <title>error message MSXML is not correctly installed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chalfont  say:</h3>
<h2>            error message MSXML is not correctly installed</h2>
                    have Vista Home Premium. I recently upgraded Norton Internet Security in version 2010 and also a new router (NETGEAR 3300). Since then I have been receiving a message that MSXML is not correctly installed and also a message that certain paths are not correct.
 Have tried the recommended checks and all tell me that the system is OK and there are no errors. Would like to "repair" Vista. However when I give my product ID in, it does not recognize it. A have a shuttle computer - so I may have an OEM copy. How can I
 resovle my problems<br />

            Here's an article on how to install/re-install MSXML for various Microsoft Games which may work for whatever you need it for as well:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/810209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/810209</a>.<br />
<br />
Norton Internet Security sometimes interferes with other programs running on Vista (more than most anti-malware products).&nbsp; Try disabling the program and see if MSXML starts working without the error message - then you'll know it's a Norton issue that you'll
 have to resolve with them (if it can be resolved).&nbsp; You may need to change your anti-malware program if they can't help you and you want MSXML.<br />
<br />
If this doesn't work, try re-posting your question in the XML Forum at: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?query=XML&amp;dg=&amp;cat=en_US_d02fc761-3f6b-402c-82f6-ba1a8875c1a7&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=&amp;pt=&amp;catlist=&amp;dglist=&amp;ptlist=&amp;exp=&amp;sloc=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 assist you with your problem.<br />

I hope this helps.<br />

Good luck!

            It appears that the drivers might be incompatible with Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Step 1: Let us try to install the driver in compatibility mode and check if it helps.
<br />
<br />Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.
<br />
<br />Follow the below steps:
<br />
<br />Right click on the setup file of the driver and select “Properties”.
<br />
<br />Select “Compatibility” tab.
<br />
<br />Place a check mark next to “Run this program in Compatibility mode” and select previous the version of Windows from the drop down list.
<br />
<br />Let the driver install and then check the functionality. 
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, follow the below step:
<br />
<br />Step 2: Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter.
<br />Hardware and Devices troubleshooter checks for common problems and makes sure that any new device or hardware connected to your PC is installed correctly.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X key and Select Control Panel.
<br />
<br />Select Troubleshooting.
<br />
<br />Select View All on the top left corner.
<br />
<br />Select “Hardware and Devices.
<br />
<br />Follow the On Screen instructions.

<h2>            Why the new Surface pen&#39;s tilt functionality is not available on the Surface Laptop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>According to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/d/surface/8ZL5C82QMG6B/GNTD?icid=Cat_SurfaceAccessory-ContentPlacement2-Pen-052317-en-us&amp;SilentAuth=1&amp;wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft</a>, the new Surface pen't tilt won't work on the Surface Laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a joke or something? Even the Surface Pro 3 from three years ago would support it. It must be intentionally disabled (software-wise) on purpose on the Surface Laptop. As someone who wants to buy the Surface Laptop, this does not make me happy at
 all. (I don't want to live with the smaller Surface Pro or the bulky and expensive Book)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make it a software setting that user can choose whether they want to enable tilt or not. Give user the option. Yes, I fully intended to create/draw/ink on the Laptop with the screen side down. It works well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>It doesn't make business sense either - why wouldn't they want people to spend $100 on the new pen for the Laptop? Now that I know tilt won't work, I would simply pick up a used Pro 4 pen for $30. Microsoft's
 decision is totally incomprehensible.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p>Hello Wataru1, </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; You are correct. Tilt is a new feature available to customers using the new Surface Pen with no clip. It enables you to angle the pen at about a 45-degree angle, and mimic various artist techniques such as shading, sketching or edging.<br />
At time of launch on June 15, 2017, the Tilt feature is only supported on Surface Pro Model 1796 .

<p>Lane,</p>
<p>I was in the same boat as you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Too bad MS did not resolve&nbsp;this issue, it's actually quite simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;I figured it out myself.</p>
<p>Here's how to bring it back:</p>
<p>Right-click on the two parallel just to the right of the 'Task View' icon.</p>
<p>Left click on 'Search'.</p>
<p>Choose 'show search box.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;you do not like the search box being so long, choose 'show search icon' instead.&nbsp; It's that simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bob Stec</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you!&nbsp; But in my case there was a subtle difference.&nbsp; 'Show search box' was on a menu subsidiary to 'Cortana'. I was also able to show Cortana's icon (a circle) in the same way.&nbsp; Using MS software continues to be a good way to delay the onset of Alzheimer's!</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several ways for you to purchase the game so your daughter can play it on her account. With your permission, you can change the account settings online and allow purchases on your child's account. Allow purchases on a child account, you may follow
 the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Log in to your Microsoft account on the <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Family Page</a>.</li><li>Look for the <strong>Child </strong>account email address and click on <strong>
More Options</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Spending</strong> and click <strong>Change content restrictions</strong> to change the settings.</li><li>Once the settings are changed, you can purchase the game using your child's account and download it on her computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note </strong>Make sure that the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Live Service status</a> is up and running before purchasing or managing the Xbox Live accounts online.</p>
<p>

<h2>            New Windows 10 laptop froze up on initial use, now login issues</h2>
                    Brand new HP laptop, Windows 10, stalled/froze up on initial setup when selecting a PIN for login. Next time I turned it on, the setup completed, but I am now unable to login to use certain apps with a my Microsoft account, because it's asking for my old
 Windows password for ID authorization (which I never set up, only entered a PIN). Would love to be able to recover whatever was somehow entered as a password, or be able to reset somehow without completely resetting the laptop.&nbsp;

            <p>If you have a Yahoo mail plus account or if your address is ditto.marks@yahoo.ca, you can access the account using their pop3/smtp mail servers. That can be set up in a client such as Outlook. You can then set that
 client as your default email client. The account can still be accessed thgrough their usual web page.</p>

            <p>With the rewards program you can earn rewards credits for completing offers. All offers are listed on the Missions page of the Rewards site. Once you earn credits, they are added as pending to your rewards account. Credits are deposited into your Microsoft account as currency by the following 15th or 30th of the month after you have at least 5,000 credits pending. If you have at least 1,000 pending (but less than 5,000) You can request a deposit and the credits will be deposited on the date listed on the site at the time that you make the request.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 waking up from sleep inside bookbag and draining battery</h2>
                    <p>In the morning I grab my SP4 off my desk and put it into my bag and head to school.&nbsp; Then by the time I get to class (multiple times this has occured), I pull it out of my bag and it is hot with the fan running with the battery drained down to 50 to 60 percent.&nbsp;It
 is placed into my bag at 100%, I just unplug it and put it in my bag.&nbsp; I don't open it up or use it right before placing it in my bag (meaning I used it the night before and closed the type cover assuming it going to sleep).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have it fully up to date (I check everyday for updates)</p>
<p>I don't have many apps or programs installed. (Only have office 365, and acrobat reader)</p>
<p>I only use my device for office (onenote, excel, word) and the internet.</p>
<p>I had chrome installed but I un-installed it as I read it was possibly linked to the SP4 sleep issues. However this issues continues after the program was removed.
</p>
<p>I tried turning my settings to put device into hibernate when I close cover but when I go to turn it back on the blue loading screen flickers constantly (not something I think its suppose to do) and takes a long time to turn back on. I usually have to hit
 the power button a few more times after the blue screen for the device to come back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something I can do to fix this issue and or more people having this same problem.&nbsp; I read this was an issue before but was fixed but I can tell you it has not been(atleast on my SP4).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have the&nbsp;i5/8GB/256GB SP4 model and bought it brand new about 10 days ago (April 2016).&nbsp;

            <p>There is currently no fix. For many, the 2/17 "fix" made things much worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are in your return window, I suggest you take advantage of it as there are no guarantees that MS is going to fix it in a timely manner.</p>

            <p>Hello ScottTrax,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you can try is to go into Power options and disable fast start-up:</p>
<p>- Open Control Panel</p>
<p>- Go to Power Options and then choose what closing the cover/lid does</p>
<p>- Press "Change settings that are currently unavailable"</p>
<p>- Untick "Turn on fast start-up"</p>
<p>- Save changes and restart Surface Pro 4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this has made any differences for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>

<h2>            Remote Desktop Client app not working</h2>
                    I installed the RD client app on my android and went through all of the connection procedures to connect to my HP computer, but it always says that it could not connect or that my connection was refused. Does anybody know what I may have done wrong. PS
 I did enable remote access via system properties.
