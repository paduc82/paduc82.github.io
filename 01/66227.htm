<h2>            Windows 8.1 Explorer.exe does not work correctly</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>On my PC there is a common problem with explorer.exe , after some time explorer.exe stops working, it is responding and all, but clicking any button does not show result (for example Windows logo, or the clock), also Desktop turns black and shows no wallpaper,
 Icons on Desktop highlight when you click them, but doesn't work (doesn't start what they should).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I restart explorer.exe manually using Task Manager, it works for some time correctly (few hours more or less), then it stops working again... There is no error messages occurring, Event Viewer also does not contain any info that something gone bad...
 I've reinstalled my Windows 8.1 but everything happens again and again...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are facing the issue on explorer.exe.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will certainly help you with this.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you go through the below methods:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Try to run the system maintenance troubleshooter:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp;Press Windows key+X.<br />
b.&nbsp;Click on Control Panel.<br />
c.&nbsp;Click on Troubleshooting.<br />
d.&nbsp;On the left pane, click on view all.<br />
e.&nbsp;From the list, click on system maintenance.<br />
f.&nbsp;Run the troubleshooter.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Try to perform clean boot:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,
 or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />

            <p>Thank you for your reply. Letting you know the results.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: <em>System Maintenance Troubleshooter</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned error occurs, nothing that depends on <strong>explorer.exe</strong> does not work,</p>
<p><strong>Win+X</strong> key gives no result (which i assumed managed by <em>winlogon.exe</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Win+R</strong> or <strong>Win+E</strong> keys gives no result.</p>
<p><strong>Start Menu</strong> (<em>Metro</em>) is absolutely blank (<em>Pinned </em>
and <em>All</em>), no icons shown, search does not work.</p>
<p>Right Click on <em>Windows logo</em> seems to work, but clicking "<strong>Control Panel</strong>" or "<strong>Run</strong>" doesn't give any result.</p>
<p><strong>My PC</strong> (<em>My Computer</em>) does not shown by any usual or unusual means.</p>
<p><strong>Print Screen</strong> key also failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Showing Hidden tray icons works, also <em>Ctrl+Alt+Del</em> and<em> Ctrl+Shift+Esc</em> key combos seems to work fine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going to try and perform clean boot, and will write a feedback on the result.</p>
<p>There is no "Third Party" drivers installed on my PC.</p>
<p>Third party software installed:</p>
<p>Adobe Photoshop CS6</p>
<p>Google Chrome</p>
<p>AIMP2</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I've just reinstalled my Windows...</p>

            The Kindle Fire uses an Android operating system and the Homegroup is for networking Windows 7 computers only.&nbsp; Are you just attempting to connect the Fire to the same wireless router that your Windows 7 uses?&nbsp; If so, you will need your wireless security
 key not your homegroup password.&nbsp; (I don't know whether it is possible to have a Kindle Fire join a Windows network to share files by using a workgroup other than a homegroup, but it is possible to connect to the same router to access the internet.)<br />
<br />
There can be confusion over multiple different network &amp; router related passwords (e.g., Homegroup password, router administration password, and the wireless network security key which can also go by other names).<br />
<br />
If you are just trying to connect to the wireless router, you can obtain the security key either from the router itself or if you have another Windows 7 computer connected wirelessly, you can get it from that computer by clicking on the wireless icon on the
 taskbar at the lower right of the screen and then right-click on your wireless name and click on Properties and then on the Security tab click in the box to the left of "Show characters" below the "Network security key"<br />
<br />
If you need to get the key from the router, how to do that varies by manufacturer.&nbsp; In the following link in the section "Set up the router" if gives some information about how you can get to the router's configuration page and from there you might browse around
 for the wi-fi settings portion and look for the security key (or better yet, look for the manual that came with your router if you think you might have it and follow the directions there about how to display the security key):&nbsp;

</a><br />
A site that has the factory default passwords to access the router is: <a href="http://www.routerpasswords.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.routerpasswords.com/</a><br />
<br />
I have had a case where a Kindle reader (not a Fire) would not connect to the router even though the correct key was entered and that was resolved by rebooting the router and the Kindle.&nbsp; Amazon telephone support was helpful in resolving that issue.<br />

            The Kindle Fire has nothing to do with the Windows 7 Homegroup feature, which only works with other computers running Windows 7. You need your router's password. If you don't know it, ask someone else in your house for it or whoever set it up for you.<br />

<p>I haven't have that buti have been in a party and heard other players not in the party. When my friend talks I can hear another voice with his of (usually) someone trashtalking in the game. This has even happened when we were playing differnet games and
 I would each hear someone I'm playing with or someone he is playing with. </p>
<p>i think for u has something to do with the host of the party if I was the host with my one friend we would randomly get dissconneted but if he was the host nothing would happen.And that issue only happened if we were playing Gears together or if I was playing
 gears.</p>

<p>Had similar issues. &nbsp;One was caused by my xbox using my Kinect for my mic. &nbsp;Changed the settings on my Kinect, and people could hear me just fine. &nbsp;The other issue was caused by my privacy settings being set so that I could only hear people that are on my
 friends list. &nbsp;Changed those settings and now I can hear anyone using a mic, and they can hear me. &nbsp;Just a couple of things to check.</p>

<p>Sometimes if someone has certain securities set, they won't be able to hear you unless they add you as a friend. &nbsp;Otherwise, it could be a connection problem. &nbsp;Sometimes when I talk to my friends, they can't hear the first 5 seconds of what I say. &nbsp;It's

<p>I was able to stream my Xbox One to my Surface Pro 3 just fine last night and now tonight I'm getting this error message: "<span>We couldn't connect to your console. Make sure the console is still on and connected to the same network as this device." I can
 still turn the console on an off from the app yet somehow it says it can't connect. Huh?? How can it power the console on/off if it can't connect?</span></p>
<p><span>Any ideas on how to fix this? Also let me save you some time as I've already done the following:</span></p>
<p><span>1) power cycled my modem and router</span></p>
<p>2) Did a hard reset on my Xbox One&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Checked that enable streaming is in fact enabled</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Same exact problem. &nbsp;I was streaming it all day to my PC while my kids watched TV. &nbsp;Console was rebooted accidently, I tried to connect again and now I am getting this issue. &nbsp;I rebooted the XBOX, PC, Router, tested internet connection on XBox, ran a continuous
 ping, attempted to remove and re-add console, &nbsp; All the same results. &nbsp;Anyone have any insight or suggestions?</p>

<p>I unplugged my Xbox One for over 10 minutes today, reconnected it, and powered on. I was able to then stream with no issues and connect to my box via the SmartGlass app both on my phone and PC. Hope that helps!</p>

<p>I tried all of these potential solutions: checked for updates, restarted windows, hard reboot of the xbox, power cycled xbox, powered down xbox for about 20 minutes, checked streaming settings. I haven't yet been able to resolve this issue. Streaming had
 worked up until this point very well and even as recently as earlier today. Hopefully this will get resolved soon.</p>

<h2>            Download photos from an SD card</h2>
                    
<p>When I had Windows XP and downloaded photos form an SD card, it would always let me choose which photos I wanted&nbsp;and which folder they would go into.&nbsp; With Windows 7, it downloads them all automatically, and they show up out of order from the way I took
 them.&nbsp; Can I set this new computer to do it the old way?&nbsp; Or how can I choose which pics go into which folder, and in what order they appear?</p>

Hello <br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers<br />
<br />
How are you trying to transfer the pictures?<br />
<br />
You say that you want to select photos and want to download only those photos what you select from the SD card and don’t want duplicates every time you import. Am I right?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would suggest you to try to perform this operation manually and check.</p>
<p>Also perform the steps listed in the following link and check.<br />

<p>Hi Yassin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We may need to do further investigation to identify the issue and its cause. Can you recall any significant changes made on the PC prior to the issue? Do you have the latest Windows updates installed on your PC? Have you tried running the
<strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> troubleshooter? If you haven't done so, we suggest that you run the troubleshooter to scan your computer, identify the problem, and attempt to fix the issue automatically. You may refer to the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong> and type <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the search bar and click on <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>.</li><li>Follow the steps from the wizard to run the troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

<p>Hi Yassin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try to isolate the issue. If you have other headphone or earpiece with you, connect it to your device and check if it can be recognized. Try to plug in the device in question to other devices and observe if it can be detected. If this issue happened
 recently, we'd still like to know any changes that was made to your computer before the issue started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            Try to roll back your driver to its previous version. In Device Manager, right-click the driver and select
<strong>Properties </strong>&gt; <strong>Driver </strong>tab &gt; <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong>. Restart your device. If the issue persists, start your device in
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Safe Mode</a>. This will load Windows using limited set of drivers. Assuming that nothing's changed, that your device won't detect any headphones all of a sudden, the it could be a hardware failure.

            Thank you for the update, Yassin. Incompatible audio device drivers are known to operate against the method that Windows 10 follows. You can try downloading earlier version of the drivers for your operating system from the computer model manufacturer’s
 website and install it through Device Manager.
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, install the driver in compatibility mode. You may refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the driver and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Compatibility </strong>tab.</li><li>Place a check mark next to <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong> and select the operating system accordingly from the drop-down list.</li><li>Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

I get this error trying to install a mapping program called Quo from Mapyx.</p>

<p>The vendors say that they can install the program at their end</p>
<p>The installation file is the correct size (ie it is not corrupted and installs on Windows XP)</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>you need to update to use your console, but something went wrong.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Source OS: 10.0.17763.2023</strong></p>

</p><p>This appears everytime i try again at 441mb remaining and 1% progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed all the suggested steps; clear cache, reset profile, soft reset and finally hard reset which now means i cant access anything.... by the way this console is 3 weeks old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any similar problems/solutions or do i send back to Microsoft? Also i cant do the offline update as only macs at home.......</p>

<p>Hello Samson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your issue. Being it is only three weeks old and you did a lot of troubleshooting, you could try taking to where you purchased or set up a repair. You can go to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Device support<span style="color: rgba(176, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></a> to set the repair up. Also if there is a Microsoft store near you, you may be able to take it there and see what they can do for you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before doing so try rebooting router/modem and make sure the connection is strong. This is the biggest reason why updates fail usually is internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

            I've had the same issue. I'd say it's a problem/bug on Xbox's end, in which case, I'm not sure there's much we can do until it fixes itself. :/&nbsp; The only thing I've tried that gave me occassional success was to basically shut the Console Companion app
 down (on my phone I look under the apps, and then select the Xbox one, and select "Force Stop" but of course it may be different on different phones) and once it's "Force Stopped" then I'll go back and restart it fresh. Sometimes that will work with bugs like
 this and the app will work normally after that. Good luck! :)

            Try uninstalling the app (now can on windows 10 1903 may update), right click the app tile and select uninstall. Then restart the PC, and reinstall the app, hopefully that will fix the issue.<br />

            Sounds like a console companion bug of course or for some reason not all games have been coded to read for the companion which would be quite strange but either way you'll wanna contact support for that one&nbsp;

<h2>            App fails to reinstall from Store, Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>After an update to Age of Empires Castle Siege I lost the app. I share my tablet with another family member whose own installation of the app still worked. We uninstalled from his account,, then reinstalled successfully for him. However my reinstall fails.
 Windows Store recognises I own the app and offers a reinstall; reinstall process starts and is over in a few seconds with positive message that the app is now installed, but when I check, it is still missing.</p>
<p>I have used WSreset to clear the cache but this has not helped.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As per the description, I understand that you’re facing issues with installing your App from Windows Store. I will certainly help you with the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>On the metro screen in the bottom left there is an arrow pointing downwards. Click that and all the apps and programs are there. From there, you can right click any app/program and press 'Pin to Start' which will put it on the Start screen.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I would suggest you to Open search then type the app name right click then click pin to start.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>You may also refer to the link mentioned below:<br />

            <p>Thanks for the reply but it is not that simple. The app is definitely not installed, I have searched all over for it. If I leave then re-enter the Windows Store the situation is reset i.e. the app shows as being purchased and available for installation.
 Each attempt gives exactly the same failure: a quick burst of "loading" bar, a notice that the app has been installed, but in fact it hasn't.</p>

            <p>Hello again. I used the command as written above and got what appeared to be a successful message in the command prompt window. I also used wsreset again to be extra sure. Unfortunately the problem remains! Any other ideas? Are there setup files or a registry
 entry that are fooling Store into thinking the app has installed?</p>

<h3> kellypawlak  say:</h3>
<h2>            I feel ripped off after purchasing a surface dock. What is microsoft going to do to make up this let-down to their customers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been a loyal surface customer since my first Surface Pro. I shelled out over $2300 for the Surface Book 2 a while back and I love it. It's been a sturdy work AND game computer, and I'm very happy with everything about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The surface dock, on the other hand, is a disaster and a complete waste of $200. I couldn't believe my eyes... it can't keep my 13in Surface Book 2 charged (even when doing menial tasks) unless I'm in power-saving mode. I can't use my dual monitors (they
 are only 1080p too!) and usb mouse + keyboard to program in VScode without power drain. Even though I can go for about 5 hours, I'm forced to use a single monitor via usb c because daily cycling of my laptop batteries would kill it within the year. And don't
 even get me started on GPU intensive work: I get *at best* about two hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that wasn't enough, the cord which runs between the dock block and my laptop has developed friggin visible strain and eventually a tear from JUST SITTING ON MY DESK! One of the wires is clearly exposed and sheared, **just** from plugging-in and removing
 the charge adapter from the laptop. Now it only charges when plugged in with the adapter's wire running over the USB-C port, and my wired internet connection has taken a hit. Unbelievable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm so upset with this, I honestly can't recommend surface products to anyone who wants to use them for serious work or gaming. There is no excuse for the extremely shoddy dock Microsoft is selling, especially when there are tons of computationally equivalent
 laptops on the market (minus the touch screen, which drains power too fast on the dock when in use anyway!), with well designed docks that wouldn't be such a disappointment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are you going to do to make this up to us, Microsoft?</p>
<p>I used to speak so highly of Surface products that my friends would joke that I must be working for your sales department. Those days are passing.</p>
<p>I want my money back. I want my cord repaired. I want a better dock. Otherwise, I want to leave Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a Surface Dock purchased in 2015 together with the Surface Pro 4 that has been working fine. I used it with that device, the Surface Book with Performance Base that replaced it and now the Surface Pro 6. All work just fine. It has 2x4K screens plugged,
 a Logitech receiver for keyboard and mouse, a webcam and external speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your problem is probably related to the Surface Book 2 rather than the Dock. The SB2 seems to demand a lot more power, so much so that even the bundled charger seems to struggle to keep the battery fully charged:&nbsp;https://hothardware.com/news/microsoft-confirms-surface-book-2-battery-can-discharge-even-when-plugged-in</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I agree that Microsoft should make clear that this dock may not be the best option for the SB2, the dock itself does what it was designed to do back when it was first launched.</p>

<h2>            smart card</h2>
                    <p>Mr. Kiran,</p>
<p>thanks for the answer but unfortunately it was not helpful. When I try to uninstall as you told me to, this appears:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f19d8326-2ae4-4e60-ab37-f0617f581ac2" /></p>
<p>computer doesn't allow me to uninstall or install anything. I've noticed that at the top of&nbsp;this picture always stands&nbsp;"User account control"... maybe the problem is that I'm not the administrator, but I've tried to change It and computer doesn't allow it
 as well. I've tried it this way: Safe Mode with Command Prompt... type <strong>net user administrator/active:yes Enter,
</strong><strong>net user administrator&lt;Password&gt;</strong> Enter... and there was access denied (or something like this)</p>
<p>I'm very sad and frustrated about it... :(</p>
<p>I'm still waiting for an answer, please someone help me.</p>
