<h2>            Presenter view on different monitor.</h2>
                    <p>I am using three displays for a presentation. Actually, only two, but I have three displays. I am using a laptop to control the presentation that is being displayed by a projector. I want the presenter view to be on a second display, a TV set up in front
 of me. I would just duplicate my desktop to the TV, but for some reason I cannot. Is there a way to change which display presenter view appears on?</p>

    <title>Computer Keeps Dead Locking - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Computer Keeps Dead Locking</h2>
                    <p>This has been happening for awhile now where my computer will (What seems) randomly lock up completely, Won't let me move the mouse, keyboard won't work, the computer completely dead locks and then after a bit, it will blue screen and restart, and I don't
 actually know why. There seems to be not way to actually recreate the error since as I mentioned, it's random and sometimes it can lock up right after a lock up or something it won't lock up for an entire day, though this is only whenever I'm doing something
 it will lock up such as if I open a youtube video or am simply browsing through facebook, if I leave my computer idle then it seems to never lock up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally I thought it was the Hard Drive or windows itself because of these Blue Screen errors logs I got:</p>
<p><a href="https://prnt.sc/i0ypa8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://prnt.sc/i0ypa8</a><br />
<a href="https://prnt.sc/i0ypv5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://prnt.sc/i0ypv5</a></p>
<p>though I never really error checked my drive, I instead just brought a new one as I was going to anyway and reinstalled Windows 8.1 on it. The lock ups didn't actually happen for about 2 days after that till yesterday where they started to happen again.</p>
<p>Because of this, I next assumed it was the RAM but after running 2 different error checks on it (MemTest and Windows Memory Diagnostic), they returned zero errors (I left Memtest running for about 4 hours with it getting up to 4 passes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So at this point I'm not even sure what's causing it. I would look at the error logs to check but strangely ever since I installed my new hard drive, the blue screens won't report on errors and the blue screen itself seems to freak out, looking like this:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/338293c6-f4ef-4005-87ff-339e26e437da?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/338293c6-f4ef-4005-87ff-339e26e437da?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>My only guess now would be the GPU but that's not even 1 year old so I'm not sure. Does anyone know what the problem may be or what else I should test as I'm running out of ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also it's not cause of overheating, the temps seems perfectly normal when it locks up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>I've noticed that all of this started after I updated Windows. Like I said everything seemed fine for about 2 days after I reinstalled windows, didn't lock up or anything. But after checking my update history, the first time I updated windows was on the
 21st... the same day my computer started to lock up again.<br />

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
If a device driver of a software on your PC is not compatible with the version of your Windows, you might encounter a system failure. For us to elaborate the issue further, kindly answer the questions listed below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you still able to boot your PC?</li><li>Were there any changes on your PC before this happened like software or updates installed?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For initial troubleshooting, if you're able to boot your PC, we recommend that you
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17076/windows-8-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
boot your PC into safe mode</a>. While in safe mode, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17085/windows-8-restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
perform a system restore</a> from a restore point where the issue is not being experienced.<br />
<br />
We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>I've done a system restore already to a point where I basically just reinstalled Windows and before I installed any updates. So far it hasn't locked up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the only thing I can recall installing on the day my computer first ever locked up, before i reinstalled windows was a program called Voice Attack though if that was the issue then it doesn't make sense why the lock ups still happen even when i don't
 install it, they only seem to happen when I update Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can also boot the PC fine, everything works fine and like it should but just randomly it will lock up and I have to let it restart after it blue screens. Also as mentioned I did install a lot of Windows Updates the same day my computer locked up so I'm
 certain it's cause of certain Windows Updates though which ones, I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that a security update for Window 8.1 could have caused the Blue screen error on your system. May we ask if you can still get the KB numbers of those updates you have installed on the PC? Or if it's no longer available, you could check via the<a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 Microsoft Update Catalog</a> for the related Windows 8.1 update you have installed on the PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll look forward to your response. </p>

<p>Well I system restored so I no longer have the updates installed and considering I changed my hard drive as well, I don't actually have a record of the exact updates I installed. Though I do have the updates ready to be installed with one of them 100% going
 to be the blue screen update, the total download size of all the updates I've got to download is 718.0MB - 844.5MB if that's what you mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not exactly sure what security update it would be though as there is so many ready to be installed:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53cad347-1b9e-4838-a5e3-40a6d6cda389?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53cad347-1b9e-4838-a5e3-40a6d6cda389?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>It would of had to been an update for Windows 8.1 released between the 12-13th of January 2018 since I updated Windows on the 13th and then my computer locked up on the same day, before then it was fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking on the screenshot you have provided, there are a few security updates that are newer in number. We suggest installing the newest security update by KB3076949. Correct me if that's not the latest one though.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apply just that one particular system update and let us know if the system will go through the same Blue screen as before.

<p>If the newest update is determined by the number then KB3187754 must be the newest as that's the highest number it goes up too?
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b853af3-8004-4f57-b8e0-ddfe0ee66447?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b853af3-8004-4f57-b8e0-ddfe0ee66447?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Should I install that instead along with all the other non-security updates?</p>

<p>Well it did dead lock again after installing the latest update so I ran the troubleshoot and apparently it did find problems:</p>

<p>Perhaps they could do better to segment the groups more (campaign story, campaign misc, multiplayer, zombies) with different colors. The style doesn't seem that great with only orange and red.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)">Exactly.<br />
<br />
I have to say I like how the achievements and gamerscore are spread out. 15 gamerscore for beating the campaign on hardened or veteran is perfect imo. I never understood the reason for having 50-100 gamerscore for completing a game(on the hardest difficulty)
 Okay, you beat it. Congrats, here's a whopping 100g! But now it's 15g. No biggie for me.&nbsp; I'm still going to play and beat the campaign on veteran. Completing the campaign on the hardest difficulty is its own reward.
<br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)">Also I do agree with both Jag and Geek. They should have made each category of achievements different from one another. The achievement pictures are pretty lame. I wish they would have kept the color from Blops. That one
 was good, but these are just like what the. Meh, I really shouldn't care I guess. I mean they are just pictures lol.

    <title>What is the difference between compatibility mode and XP-mode&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jan kritzinger  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is the difference between compatibility mode and XP-mode&#63;</h2>
                    I have been using the RC for the past few months.<br />
I have used compatibility mode to get various XP programs running on w7.<br />
I have one program that I could not get to run on w7, even though it ran succesfully on XP.<br />
I now need to decide wether to buy home or ultimate.<br />
<br />
Does Home premium have the general compatibility mode, or will I have trouble getting XP programs to run?<br />
Is the compatibility mode and XP-mode (that home premium lacks) the same thing?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance....

            <p>&nbsp;It probably just needs cleaning.&nbsp; Get an inexpensive DVD drive cleaning kit from any place that sells computers and see if that doesn't fix the problem.</p>

 not sure what's up.<br />

<h2>            Custom Built PC Keeps restarting every 10seconds with no Display</h2>
                    Hi, I ordered PC Parts from a UK retailer, and got it delivered today. So, I was following the instructions on how to build a computer by yourself, and it was a video aswell. I followed the tutorial, everything was the same as he done, at the end, it worked
 for him, and thousands of other people. When I turned it on, it worked, I was happy.. to soon, Im afraid. The screen was blank, as in no signal, and then randomly the computer keeps restarting every 10seconds. With desperation, I started looking around websites
 and such, on what it may be the cause of the mysterious restarts. I found several suggestions. The PSU being damaged, which I highly doubt, since its brand new, tho there might be a chance, I suppose. The RAM cards not being inserted properly, checked several
 times, its fine. The cables not being plgged in. Everything, I tried!<br />
<br />
Im really devastated with the outcome that has happened, any one of you know how to fix this solution?<br />
<br />
Specs:<br />
<br />
MSI H61M-p31 G3<br />
4GBx2 Corsair XMS3 Ram cards<br />
AMD Radeon 7770 1GB<br />
Corsair CX500 PSU<br />
Intel i3<br />

<h2>            Why I wont take advantage of the &#34;FREE&#34; 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have been using 7 from its start. Then tried 8.1 for a few weeks and all those "Apps"</p>
<p>drove me nuts-couldn't find start button, etc. You all know what I mean. Don't you?</p>
<p>Anyway, I returned to 7 and&nbsp;&nbsp;then 10 comes out.&nbsp;Wait a minute, didn't 8 just come out?&nbsp;Long story Long, have you seen all the people's complaints, right here: community</p>
<p>questions on 10? All the problems, help, and returning to 7 people are screaming about?</p>
<p>I dig 7, my opinion,&nbsp;it should have stopped there. By the way, when does Windows 11</p>
<p>come out?</p>

            There won't be a Windows 11 as Windows 10 will be continually updated. Windows 10 is a great OS. and yes I have used Windows 7 as well which was also a great OS but it's getting Old now. Got to move with the times. Nothing stays the same. I have windows
 10 on a Desktop and a Laptop. The update to Windows 10 went flawlessy on both and both are working fast and stable,

The message could not be sent because the server rejected the sender's email address. The sender's email address was 'xxxxxxxxxx', (I have deleted my email address.)<br />
<br />
Subject 'test rec'<br />
Server Error: 452<br />
Server Response: 452 (IP, Sender) first encounter.<br />
Server: 'mail.btinternet.com'<br />
Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800CCC78<br />
Protocol: SMTP<br />
Port: 25<br />
Secure(SSL): No<br />
<br />
I have been using this email address on Yahoo for a number of years, so I don't understand the "first encounter" message.<br />
How can I sort it?<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>These are the two causes to this issue:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Incorrect POP settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) – check with provider if it is required or not.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Firewall blocking ports (usually port 25) – could be 3rd party since Windows Firewall generally allows this port through.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To resolve this, please re-establish the connection between your email account and Live Mail by following the steps in the article below:</span></p>

<h2>            accidently changed my file association to utorrent and now the game and program and browsers won&#39;t load</h2>
                    I accidently changed something in my computer that stops my computer from opening any files, I can't even open the Microsoft Fit It Online program because when i go to install it i get a pop up window asking me what program i want to run it with, but none
 of the programs offered in the window will work for opening the file. I remember a couple of days ago that i was downloading a torrent file and a pop up window opened and asked me what program i wanted to associate this file type to, i clicked the utorrent
 option, now none of my games, movies or programs will run, when i click on them and try to open them i get the same pop up box asking what application do i want to use to open the program with.<br />
am beyond frustration with this, i even uninstalled my UTorrent program hoping that would fix the problem, but no luck, the files/game/movies, and browsers won't start without changing the opening file with something that isn't offered in the list of programs
 listed.,<br />
<br />
I would really appreciate some help in reassociating my files so the games will auto start like before.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance<br />

<div>What happens, when you try to open any program?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would suggest you to try the following methods.<br />
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>When you run an .exe file on a Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7-based computer, the file may start a different program<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950505</a></div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong> </div>
<div>You can perform system restore to a system restore point where the computer was working fine.</div>

<p>The other day someone said they were going to send me something via a private message. So when I went to go check and see if he sent it yet, I noticed that I had 12 unread private messages dating as far back as August. I felt kinda bad. I don't want people
 thinking I'm a jerk who couldn't be bothered to reply. The old forums had an icon at the top of the screen that notified you when someone sent a PM. There is no reason for me to click on that "forum home" so I never do. Apparently I need to, though. Just to
 see if I have any messages. And now that I'm checking, I haven't got any. Figures.</p>

<p>That's not a PM, that is an xbox message. There are specific forum private messages. Although you can say "just use that then", it is not as simple as clicking that little message icon under their post. If you choose an xbox message and do not have them
 friended, you would have to copy/pasta their GT into a box.</p>

<p>Hi! I honestly dont know what is causing the issue, but it may be worth clearing your cache (all game Title Updates) and trying again. Head to System Settings \ Memory, highlight your HDD, press Y &amp; choose clear System cache.Then fire up the game &amp; try updating
 it again.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 version 1511 free upgrade</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
My OS is Windows 10 Pro 64-bit. If Win 10 free upgrade ends by 29 July 2016...... Let me say, I format is system &amp; reinstall Win 10 Pro OS using the genuine Win 10 Pro CD / USB. In that case, will Windows 1511 version update be still available freely for me.
 Please help me by clarifying this doubt.<br />
<br />

            <p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license
 you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key. </p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can keep doing this a year from now, 5 or even 10 years later.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is Windows 10 really free and do I have to pay for it after the first year has passed?</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users. This means, as long you upgrade within the first 12 months (July 29th 2015 to July 29th 2016), you will not have to pay for Windows 10 at all.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10.
<strong>Once you upgrade within the first year for free, its yours forever at no additional cost.</strong>&nbsp;As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">I heard Microsoft representatives mention they are moving to a servicing model for Windows 10, does that mean Windows 10 is going to require a subscription?</span></strong></p>
<p>No, Windows 10 remains a perpetual license, which means, you can upgrade to Windows 10 and use it forever without it expiring or going into any reduced functional mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Are you saying there will be no more versions of Windows after Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft is moving Windows to a servicing model with Windows 10. The days of major revisions or what are called big bang releases are no more. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><span>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
</span><span>–</span><span> at no additional charge. With Windows 10, the experience will evolve and get even better over time. We’ll deliver new features when they’re ready, not waiting for the next major release. We think of Windows as a Service
</span><span>–</span><span> in fact, one could reasonably think of Windows in the next couple of years as one of the largest Internet services on the planet.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>And just like any Internet service, the idea of asking "What version are you on?" will cease to make sense
</span><span>–</span><span> which is great news for our Windows developers. </span>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Why is Windows 10 free, is there some catch?</strong></p>
<p>No, its not a catch. We are computing in different times. Windows 10 is free so app developers can standardize on one platform and reduce the fragmented market of different versions and editions of Windows that have been an issue in the past. When everybody
 is on the same platform, it means better quality apps, a healthier ecosystem and more advances in hardware and software innovation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will I have to pay for updates and fixes for Windows 10?</strong><br />
No, updates, fixes, security updates, features all remain free. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What does lifetime of the device mean?</span></strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;logical conclusion is as long as the machine is operable, Microsoft will continue to support it with updates. So, if the machine still works 5 or 10 years from now, revisions and updates to Windows 10 will be made available to it. Please note that Windows
 10 uses the same life cycle policy of 5 years mainstream support and&nbsp;5 years extended support.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description it seems that you are facing issue with the reinstallation of Windows 7 on your computer.</p>
<p>As the computer does not seem to recognize the CD-R in the DVD drive probably boot order is set to Hard Disk Drive first. I would suggest you to change the boot priority to CD\DVD in BIOS and then try to perform startup repair.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>In order to make changes in the BIOS, I would suggest you to contact the computer manufacturer.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Unplug all of the external devices connected to the computer except for keyboard and mouse and check if&nbsp;issue persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>M</strong><strong>ethod 2:</strong></p>
<p>If issue still persists try to perform Startup Repair. It&nbsp;is one of the recovery tools in the System Recovery Options menu. This set of tools is located on your computer's hard disk and on the Windows installation disc. To know more about
<strong>Startup repair </strong>you may refer to the article mentioned below<strong>:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Also, if startup repair does not help, you can perform a system restore and check if it helps you to fix the issue. For reference you may refer the article mentioned below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the system recovery options in <span>Windows 7</span>?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Note</strong>: When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state, programs and updates you installed are removed.</span></span></p>
<p>

            Tried all of the above and more.&nbsp; Considering the multiple threads regarding this on the search engines, I would expect it's a software issue.&nbsp; The problem is, there is no backing out of this and as far as I can see, it means a reinstall of Windows 7 or
 8.&nbsp;

<p>Not a support question, Misses Quinzel? Seriously!? The guy obviously wants to know what's wrong with his controller! A few suggestions might've helped instead of ignoring the problem by moving it and hoping it'll go away...</p>
<p>You could've asked how long the OP had been using it, whether or not he threw or dropped it, or any other numerous scenarios. You also could've suggested any number of solutions too! Get an idea of what may be causing the problem; whether it's from over-use,
 poor abuse, or a manufacturer defect makes all of the difference in the world and yet you're not even going to bother even trying?
</p>
<p>I'm disappointed in you Misses Quinzel...</p>

<p>The most common reason that I've had to replace my controllers was because the either control sticks got jammed or the " A " button wasn't working properly anymore.</p>
<p>With that being said, do you guys realized that the most abused button on the Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers are the " A " buttons LOL &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>Get a replacement, analogues were supposed to be more durable etc but this still plagues em like it did the 360, its from the constant abuse they take eventually they go into drift mode, on fallout i used to always end looking at the sky when idle, skyrim
 i started walking off cliffs, mainly coz of fifa drilling the analogues.</p>
<p>My mate had the same and got a replacement sent out to him from support i might do the same soon coz my pads going the same way.</p>

<p>I'm not so sure all of this is faulty controllers.</p>
<p>Yesterday I started having an issue on the dashboard where the left stick wouldn't move to navigate the dashboard. It would last 20 to 30 seconds and then suddenly every input I had made with it when it wasn't responding moved through my dashboard.</p>
<p>Strange thing is, when the stick doesn't work the other controller buttons still do so it's not an issue with the dashboard being frozen (if the "TV" is up in the large box it's still playing too so definitely not a frozen dashboard). This is occurring with
 both my controllers.</p>
<p>I just sent Sniper Elite back to GameFly after only two levels because of what I believed was unresponsive controls, now it appears it may not have been the game.</p>

    <title>windows explorer stops working and I have to restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jfcdempsey  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows explorer stops working and I have to restart</h2>
                    <u>When I try to access a USB device (a memory stick)</u> it hangs and a message box appears, advising that "Windows Explorer has stopped working".
<br />
There are three options., but only one responds, which is to "close the programme".&nbsp;
<br />
It closes but renders invisible all the desktop icons and taskbars. <br />
I then have to use the Task Manager to restart the computer. <br />
<u>This happens many times a day even if I just open folder icons on my desktop. </u>
So it is <u>not</u> just the USB drives. <br />
There is no known malware on my PC. <br />
This takes at least half an hour out of my working day.&nbsp; How can it be corrected please.
<br />
<br />
Regards John<br />

            <p>If the&nbsp;command prompt window is minimised when you close Explorer then pressing Alt + Tab will switch to it. Is that what happened?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One correction. Press Ctrl + Alt + Del instead of Ctrl + Shift + Escape (which only works if explorer is running) to restart Explorer.</p>

            Thanks4 coming back, David.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I went through your entire sugestions and the problem still happens.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
As soon as I try to open any USB device to copy to and from, Windows Explorer closes and hides my desktop and icons.<br />

            <p>The error report you posted earlier was from Explorer hanging not from it crashing. Unlike a crash, hangs give no clues at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go back to <em>Problem Reports and Solutions</em>. The <em>Fault Module Name</em> will be present in a crash's detail. The
<em>Problem Event Name</em> will be <em>APPCRASH</em>. It has the time listed so match the time to a crash.</p>

<p>Each of the three steps turns of programs, services, and drivers in increasing amounts. Thus narrowing down the possible culprits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font><font><strong>Clean Boot</strong></font></div>

<div><font><font><font>Reboot. If this solves your problem reenable ½ of the services/startup items until you find which one.</font></font></font></div>

<strong>Advanced Clean Boot</strong> </div>

<p>Download Autoruns from&nbsp;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</p>

    <title>Xbox One Controller - Irritating D-Pad Spring Noises - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevieboixx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Controller - Irritating D-Pad Spring Noises</h2>
                    
<p>Since I've gotten my Xbox One, my controller's had a very annoying spring problem.&nbsp; Every time I press right or up on the D-Pad, I'm given a very annoying spring noise.&nbsp; It can be very distracting and sometimes I have to resort to using the analog stick
 to navigate because I just can't take the spring noises anymore.&nbsp; Does anyone know if there is an easy way to fix this, or do I have to send it in for repairs?&nbsp; Since Destiny is coming out tomorrow, I do NEED a controller to play... But I'd rather have a controller
 that operates correctly than to stick with what I have at the moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quick Note:</p>
<p>-Only the&nbsp;right and up portions of the D-Pad make the spring noises.&nbsp; The left and bottom do not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-The controller itself has no problem connecting to the console.&nbsp; It's simply the spring feedback I receive when I press right or up on the D-Pad.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>Hey there stevieBOIxx,</p>
<p>I'm truly sorry to hear about the noise issue you encountered with your Xbox One controller's D-Pad. The noise you explained is a bit odd and not a normal function of the controller. I would suggest setting up the controller for repair.</p>
<p>To start the repair process, it can be done through our <a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Online Service Center</a>&nbsp;or our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Contact Us</a>&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>Once again, I'm sorry to hear about this controller noise issue. Reaching out to either of those avenues I listed above are the best to assist you further and get things sorted.</p>
        </p>
