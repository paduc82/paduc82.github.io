<h2>            Using a credit card in a different region</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I was wondering, is it possible to use a credit card that's in a region different to my xbox live account region??</p>

<p>Thanks...</p>

<p>I don't think you can... Last time I did it, it just screwed up my billing address and it doesn't accept any CC from my region. I'm using Gift Cards by now. If you still didn't change your Xbox live region, then I suggest you keep it this way.

<p>I use gift cards too, but the problrm is lately, you have to enter ur cc info, for example for the games with gold out now, you have to enter a payment option and the only one is credit card, even though games with gold are free. About 1 month ago xbox converted
 all my microsoft poimts into dollars and I can't even use them without entering my credit card info, I guess this has something to do with the whole "no valid payment options" error</p>

<p>If you're trying to purchase the free games on the website, then that's why it's asking for a payment option. The website hasn't been updated to work with the new currency system yet so it requires a payment option. If you make the purchase on the console,
 you don't need to add a payment option.</p>

            Hi Alys. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />
1) With problems that serious I'd skip to the Clean Install. What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there
 would be endless issues. <br />
<br />
For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>. It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy. So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />
<br />
2) I'll give you everything possible to repair the store: <br />
<br />
See if the fixes here help: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows/3-quick-fixes-for-your-windows-store-problems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows...</a> <br />
<br />
Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />
Try resetting the Store cache: <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a> <br />
<br />
If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset. After it resets, restart PC.
<br />
<br />
If that fails then reinstall Store. Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:
<br />
<br />
<code>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</code>
<br />
<br />
3) Re-register the Start Menu from <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/re-register-start-menu-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.kapilarya.com/re-register-start-men...</a>. <br />
<br />
4) Re-register all apps from Option One here: <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a> <br />
<br />
5) System Restore is your first line of defense if Windows ever malfunctions as it can run even from recovery media to get you back before a problem started. It should always be turned on C drive with plenty of disk space (5-15%) configured.
<a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a> <br />
<br />
6) Fix Spotlight here: <br />
<a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-spotlight-not-working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-spotlight...</a>
<br />
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/82156-reset-re-register-windows-spotlight-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/82156-reset...</a>
<br />
<br />
7) If these all fail then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most
 thoroughly. <br />
<br />
8) If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest
 version. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> <br />
<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Installing Ubuntu along with Win 7</h2>
                    I've downloaded Ubuntu 14.10 (32-bit edition) and I want to install it without uninstalling my Windows 7. The setup gave me 2 options, one is to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7, second is to install it into a specific partition. My question is can I
 install Ubuntu into the 3rd partition of my hard disk without affecting Windows 7 which is installed in the first partition? Thank you.

<h2>            Microsoft Store not showing Forza Motorsport 7</h2>
                    I am trying to re-download the game because my computer was reset. When I go to the Microsoft store, it says Forza Motorsport 7 is not listed. It shows the previous installments but not the latest game. It shows up when you go to the store in a web browser,
 but it does not show up for me on my Store app. Why is this and how can I fix it, I really want to enjoy my expensive purchase of the game. This is highly frustrating.

<h2>            snmp problem on windows server 2012 R2</h2>
                    <p>Dear Support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a problem with snmp on windows server 2012 R2, snmp service doesn't work and we can't monitor the server performance and its hardware. I try to uninstall and reinstall service snmp on the server but it still doesn't work. Note that we got this
 problem on two servers and one server is working back as normal after i reinstall service snmp and another one still can't solve. Do you have any other solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Windows Update error message  - because service is not running</h2>
                    <p><span>I am helping with a problem for an elderly neighbourâ€™s computor. It is a Dell 1501 Laptop with Vista Home Basic 32-Bit.</span></p>
<p><span>I have fixed everything except one area I cant sort out. It wonâ€™t do Windows Updates. I just get a message</span><span> â€˜Windows Update cannot currently check for updates because the service is not running. You may have to restart your computer.â€™</span></p>
<p><span>Of course the computer has been restarted many times, so its nothing to do with that. I am also, of course, connected to the net, etc etc.</span></p>
<p><span>I went to Microsoft site to try and least get any critical Updates downloaded from the site. But but it just referred me straightt back to Windows Update on my computer - and doesnâ€™t give me another option.</span></p>
<p><span>I donâ€™t know how to fix this. Help please</span></p>

<p><span>Thanks. OK I got those two areas up fine. Services.msc and regedit.exe.</span></p>
<p><span>Security Centre was on Automatic and is already Started . Present status = Started.</span></p>
<p><span>Security Centre (called Security Accounts) Checked for those 6 items (Base Filtering Engine, etc. The ONLY one of the six that is there is Crypographic Service.</span></p>
<p><span>On the Registry - I opened HKEY Services. Again, of the list of 7 - ONLY CryptSve is there.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
<em>Background Intelligent Transfer Service, Cryptographic Service</em> and the <em>
Windows Update service</em> controls the Windows Update mechanism in your computer. So, if anyone of those services are missing, Windows Update will not work.
<br />
<br />
<em>Windows Firewall</em> and the <em>Base Filtering Engine service</em> helps your computer's firewall run properly. None of those services are in there.
<br />
<br />
<em>Windows Defender </em>and <em>Security Center</em> service related registry information are also not there in the computer, leading to the fact that those programs are also not working.<br />
<br />
I think, at this point, you should try running the <strong>Windows Repair all-in-one</strong> tool as suggested by
<strong>Jose</strong> in another reply. I was not able to gather all of your missing registry keys, way too many.</p>

    <title>Transfer XBOX profile or progress - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simon1306  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer XBOX profile or progress</h2>
                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son and myself used the same PC with the same (my) profile. Since few days, he's got his own computer. Now, we realized, that he actually could install Forza Horizon 3 on his computer as this game was bought with his Live account. However all the progress
 made on my PC is not available anymore.</p>
<p>So, now I was looking for a method to:</p>
<p>a) transfer the progress from my XBOX-profile to his profile</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>b) transfer my complete XBOX-profile to his LIVE account and create a new one for me - if needed</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you give me a hint, how this can be achieved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Simon</p>

<p>I've bought a new Xbox One controller with the 3.5mm socket built in, expecting my Sennheiser U 320's to just work like they do on the 360 once I'd plugged them in.</p>
<p>I have connected them to the controller though a 2.5-&gt;3.5 adaptor and can hear game audio, but the mic is not working.</p>
<p>From looking at the compatible headsets support page (<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/accessories/connect-compatible-headset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/accessories/connect-compatible-headset</a>) it
 seems they are designed to take TRRS CTIA plugs.</p>
<p>My Sennheisers only have TRS plugs, does anyone know if this would be the cause of the problem?</p>
<p>Has anyone managed to use a&nbsp;Sennheiser U 320 with the new controllers?</p>

<p>If you want to use your Sennheiser headset with your Xbox One console, you'll want to use an adapter. You could reach out to Sennheiser and see if they have a recommendation on how to best connect your headset to your controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep us posted! :)</p>

<h3> joel whitford  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 pictures folder empty &#40;but properties still shows data&#41; plus thumbs.db</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 a long while ago and recently tried to access my old photos. When I click the folder containing the photos on my old HDD, it says "This folder is empty" however when I click properties, I can see it has data in it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Things I've tried:<br />
View all hidden files and folders.<br />
Copying folders onto a new HDD.<br />
I used properties to show systems files and now I see in these folders thumbs.db but still no photos.<br />
Troubleshoot HDD.</p>
<p>Data recovery software.<br />
<br />
<br />
So far, no success. All my photos from childhood are on these drives so I'd really like to get this fixed.
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.<br />

            Hi Joel.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You said you UPgraded to Windows 10 from 8.1, so your files should be in their User folders under your account name unless the account was too corrupted to start in which they may be in your old account at C:\Users, or the install was too corrupted to Upgrade so it archived them in C:\windows.old.    Check both places now.  
<br />
<br />You said you checked for them "on my old hard drive" but is this the hard drive where Windows was upgraded, or a separate hard drive that was unwisely plugged in during an Upgrade install?  The Upgrade should never touch another hard drive, but it's always best to unplug it during install so that it doesn't interfere in other ways.
<br />
<br />Are other files in their User folders under your correct Account name at C:\Users?  Were your shortcuts and other links all present on the desktop when it started after Upgrade?  These are important things to know to help you best.
<br />
<br />Your files should always be backed up because the hard drive can die at any time.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />A better file backup to external disk is free Macrium which is the choice of the experts:
<br /><a href="http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Backing+up+files+and+folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/B...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hello, thanks for the reply, I'll try to answer the questions as best as I can;<br />
<br />
The folders are located in D:\users\joel whitford\pictures. I do not have a windows.old folder which may be due to the way in which I upgraded.<br />
<br />
I had previously installed windows 8.1 on an SSD (C:\) which failed. The pictures were saved on a separate standard HDD (D:\). When I purchased a new SSD and downloaded Windows 8 onto it, I was given the option to upgrade to 10 which I chose to do. I did not
 unplug D:\ when I did the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No other files are available in my \users\ folder. All documents, downloads, music and pictures have disappeared (but the folders still show as having large amounts of data in them).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try copying the folders into onedrive to see if it revives the files, and I'll let you know how this works out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to help me!<br />
<br />
Joel</p>

            While the drive was not the one Upgraded it might have had some attributes changed that make the pictures not appear.  Is the same true for any other files on D?  
<br />
<br />Can you plug D into another PC internally to see if the pictures can be copied out to safety? 
<br />
<br />If not can you boot with WIndows boot media to copy the files out?  See this guide for how to do this:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer to access Command Prompt.

<h2>            Windows 7&#58; Theme and Aero Issues</h2>
                    
<p>original title: having extreme difficulty acclimitizing to 7 from XP. None of the instructions online seem to resemble what I am experiencing either.</p>
<p>I don't know why this is but none of the instructions related to windows 7 seem to resemble what I am seeing on screen. My biggest hangup at the moment is with the "theme" of windows 7 which in theory one can change to the classic windows version - only
 the "personalization" routines outlined on several websites, inlcuding microsoft's seem to apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so how does one get the classic them anyways?</p>
<p>and how do I retrieve the function of the taskbar where rolling over any open programs gets you a preview of the window? it has disappeared and i can't see the option to bring it back.</p>
<p>and, say i wanted to see control panel in "classic" view, how would I do this?</p>
<p>I'm so lost...</p>

<p>yes, i know where the persolization window is but clicking on a classic windows theme gives me different colours but the exact same confusing functionality. I don't really see a huge difference. What I'm looking for is the neutral grey menus without the
 many outlines, strokes, shadows and transparencies I see when I click on a "classic" theme. I essentially want it to look like XP - which it does not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even when I am using an "aero" theme I still get only text when i rollover an item in the taskbar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this really shouldn't be so difficult and I'm beginning to wonder if there's something wrong with my computer itself. Windows 7 came preloaded with my new HP laptop</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Hi</p>
<p>If you have an Aero Theme enabled, you should definitely be seeing a thumbnail popup for a program that has files or websites opened. You might want to ask HP Support about this. You can also run the Aero Troubleshooter.</p>
<p><span><span>Open the Aero troubleshooter by clicking the&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span></strong> button , and then clicking&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Control
 Panel</span></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the search box, type&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Troubleshooter</span></strong>, click&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Troubleshooting</span></strong>,
 and then, under&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Appearance and Personalization</span></strong>, click&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Display Aero desktop effects</span></strong>. &nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation,
 type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the resulting window, select the&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Advanced link</span></strong> at the bottom of the window
 and place a check mark in the&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Apply repairs automatically</span></strong> option.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click the&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Next</span></strong> Button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the troubleshooter does not find any problems, select the&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Explore additional
 options</span></strong> button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As for making Windows 7 look exactly like XP, this will be difficult to do because so many components have been
 changed, first in Vista and then even more in Windows 7.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are using the Classic Theme, you can go to Personalize and click the Color Button at the bottom of the
 window. This will show the old style display options dialog that you can use to change the colors on many of the components, such as Menus, message boxes, etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps.</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span><span>Thank You for using Windows 7</span></span></p>

            While encrypting files or folders as suggested by Fisnik is a very effective way of denying access to other people, make sure to fully familiarise yourself with the technique before you encrypt anything. In this forum we see frequent posts from people
 who cheerfully went ahead and encrypted all their personal files, only to find that they locked themselves out. Permanently. Their backup files were encrypted too. You have been warned.

<p>Hiya Guys.</p>
<p>Info regarding the recent Xbox 360 update "Xbox 360 Spring System Update" Feature Updates:</p>
<p>â€¢ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; International Expansion of Xbox Video (Ireland, Brazil, New Zealand, Sweden, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway) - Xbox 360 users in Ireland, Brazil, New Zealand, Sweden, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway will now have access to the full catalog
 of Xbox Video in order view the their favorite movies as well as TV shows.</p>
<p>â€¢ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rent once, play anywhere - When you rent content on your Xbox 360, you can play it on any Xbox Video enabled device as long as you are signed in with the same account.
</p>
<p>â€¢ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cross tuner bookmarking - Like to watch your Xbox Video content on the go? &nbsp;On your computer? &nbsp;On your Xbox 360 or Xbox One? &nbsp;Now you can start watching on any of your Xbox Video enabled devices, then pick up right where you left off on another
 device.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;â€¢ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Subtitle support via CC system - This feature supports multiple subtitle languages for a single video. &nbsp;So for example, if you are in Sweden, the audio language might be English, but you can then choose between Swedish, French, German, etc.
 subtitles.</p>
<p>The important things to note here for users and support:</p>
<p>â€¢ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the offer details page, users will see "&lt;language&gt; with subtitles. &nbsp;See description for details". &nbsp;Users need to scroll to the bottom to see what languages are available. &nbsp;To access subtitling: (after purchase) once playback begins, the user
 can press (A) to bring up the transport controls, then look for the new subtitles and closed captions button (TV with lines across the bottom of the screen), and then select their desired language.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New Flexhubs in both Music and Video - Flexhubs are an exciting new addition to the Music and Video twists that will allow Xbox to share the latest news in the music and video service.
</p>
<p>â€¢ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Video: Feature/Studio sets - We've created a new twist where you can find collections of movies based on studios and subject. &nbsp;For example: &nbsp;find Disney movies in the "Disney" set or try "Romantic Comedies" for Valentine's Day. &nbsp;Sets are updated
 regularly to offer new content options.</p>
<p>â€¢ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Music: Programmed "Music News" - This is a new tile on the Explore twist that contains the latest information about Xbox Music features and promotions.</p>
<p>â€¢ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Playback of Music in OneDrive - If you are an Xbox LIVE GOLD subscriber, then you will be able to store music on your OneDrive, see it in your Xbox Music Collection, and then play it back in Xbox Music with or without an Xbox Music pass. &nbsp;If you
 have an Xbox LIVE Free account, then you will be able to store music on your OneDrive, see it in your Xbox Music Collection, but to play it back in Xbox Music you will need a Xbox Music pass.
</p>
<p>â€¢ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PayPal support for music subscriptions - You can now use your PayPal account to purchase your Xbox Music Subscription.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 10 Education edition product key got from my school. I ever used it to activate the windows on my old laptop. Recently, I bought a new laptop and formatted the old laptop HD without deactivate the Windows in old laptop. Now, after I used
 the product key for my new laptop, it shows the message "We can't activate Windows on this device as the product key you entered has already been used on a different device. Go to the Store to buy genuine Windows. Error code: 0xc004c008"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way that I still can use the product key, or release it from the previous installation?</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t get rid of livewire</h2>
                    <p>Livewire prevents me from accessing certain websites. How can I get rid of it? When I go to Disqus, for example, I receive a "page Not Found 404 error" and I am prevented from reaching the website.</p>

            <p>there has been a way around this - what i have done is go to the main menu and hit the x box button with guest controller and log in - use the guest controller to click find multiplayer/find games and it should pop up. let me know if that worked, otherwise there has been another problem with guest multiplayer once you try to find the game</p>

            <p>this is how you work around it.</p>
<p>1. Press the xbox button on your control.</p>
<p>2. Scroll all the way left and click "Add New".&nbsp; DO NOT CLICK ADD GUEST.</p>
<p>3. In order to play any multiplayer matchmaking on MCC all players must have a Microsoft account (This does NOT&nbsp;mean that everyone needs Xbox gold account).</p>
<p>4. If your guest does not have a Microsoft account, simply create one (it's completely free).</p>
<p>5. Sign in with this newly created account.</p>
<p>6. When you start a matchmaking game with this newly created account your still gonna have that stupid "family settings" message pop up. Ignore it, your Xbox live matchmaking game will work.</p>
<p>Yes this is really stupid of Microsoft, but it's the only way around it.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience. Let me assist you from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description of the image you provided, I understand that you are unable to install iTunes in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, before we start troubleshooting, let us know a few more details on the below questions.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any recent software changes to the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Do you face similar issues when trying to install other applications and software in Windows?</li><li>Did you check if any newer versions of the software you are referring to is available?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now, to answer to the query you have placed regarding if Windows Installer can be fixed. The Dialog Box clearly mentions two things.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a problem with this Windows installer package.</li><li>Contact your support personnel or package vendor.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>This signifies that the error message is due to the Apple's Windows installer package you are using (which&nbsp;is software manufacturer provided). Here, in most of the cases, for existing itune installations, the Apple Software Updater helps to update the iTunes
 program. But if it is a fresh installation, in this case,&nbsp;the issue is likely related to Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to start with the troubleshooting steps in Windows, check if the below methods helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, if this issue is&nbsp;due to system file corruption. I suggest you to run System file checker. System File checker (SFC) scan is done to check if there
 are any corrupted system files that could be causing this issue. Kindly follow the below given steps:</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<strong><span>sfc/scannow</span></strong> and press enter.</span></p>

 10</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
If it still does not help,&nbsp;<span>I suggest you to unregister and re-register the Windows Installer and check if it helps.</span><span>&nbsp;</span>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start,</strong>&nbsp;click&nbsp;Run, type&nbsp;<strong>MSIEXEC /UNREGISTER</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>. Even if you do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>Run,</strong>&nbsp;type&nbsp;<strong>MSIEXEC /REGSERVER,</strong>&nbsp;and then click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>. Even if you do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs, or you may briefly see an hourglass. After you run
 this command, the operation is complete.</span></p>
</li></ol>

<h3> nbgxl  say:</h3>
<h2>            After 1903 update&#58; CPU spikes and noisy fan</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>after installing the 1903 update the fan of my PC gets loud while using common programs (even while browsing simple text websites).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking via task manager shows high CPU peaks... this didn't happend before the update, even the fan was only hearable while doing difficult renderings etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My configuration (with latest drivers of course):</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>AMD A6-5400K APU with AMD Radeon HD 7540D</li><li>64 Bit</li><li>3.6 GHz</li><li>6 GB RAM</li><li>1000 GB HD (800 GB free)</li></ul>
<p>The only workaround was reducing the cpu speed via "AMD Catalyst Control Center" to 2.8 GHz (which makes the PC slower of course).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? Thanks!</p>

<p>Make sure your Power settings are set as Balanced. It may be (only a guess) that the new version is still sorting something out and causing the spikes.</p>
<p>Try restarting a few times Start &gt; Power &gt; Restart. How long is it since the update.</p>

            Hi  NBGXL
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />e have been noticing this trend with high CPU after a fresh install or upgrade. Normally, Windows Defender is the culprit, in addition, Windows 10 Update applying updates and Defender definitions. Sometimes it's hard to pinpoint what is the exact source of the high CPU usage.
<br />
<br />Sometimes, just giving it a few days to a week, it will eventually settle down - this has worked in most cases. So, please consider that first. 
<br />
<br />I would first check Windows Update and make sure any pending cumulative updates are actually being installed succesfully. 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />Other things you can also check include:
<br />
<br />If you have Chrome installed, uninstall then reinstall it. 
<br />
<br />Disable your audio adapter in the BIOS to see if it helps or check for an updated driver or reinstall the existing one. 
<br />
<br />Look for blank icons on the desktop and delete them.
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer
<br />Open This PC
<br />Right click your local drive where Windows 10 is install (you will see the Windows logo on it)
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Hardware tab
<br />What is the name of the drive listed?
<br />
<br />Is it an SSD?
<br />If it is, you might need to update the firmware.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps
<br />Disable all Background apps.
<br />
<br />Disabling Windows Update:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to Disabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Also, check whats starting up with Windows.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Click Startup tab
<br />Disable all except Windows Defender.
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: msconfig
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Go to the services tab
<br />Check the box, 
<br />hide all Microsoft services
<br />
<br />Disable the remaining services
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Restart if prompted
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: problem reports
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Delete any failed or pending reports.
<br />
<br />Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications and actions &gt; Turn off "Show me tips about Windows."
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type: powercfg -restoredefaultschemes
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Exit 
<br />
<br />Create an entirely new account and delete the current one.

<br />Set it to basic 
<br />
<br />Click Start 
<br />Type: regedit 
<br />Right click regedit 
<br />Click Run as administrator 
<br />
<br />Navigate to the following key: 
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection.

    <title>accidentally ejected DVD player - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            accidentally ejected DVD player</h2>
                    Hi, in the haze of the afternoon slump, I thought I should 'eject' the DVD player like you would a USB drive.&nbsp; Of course, this was not the thing to do and now I cannot read anything off the DVD player.<br />
<br />
What do I do?&nbsp; I cannot find the device in the Device Manager either.&nbsp; I am using Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
Cindy<br />

            Hello Cindy,<br />
<br />
I am going to guess you have a laptop.&nbsp; Did you try unplugging your DVD drive and plugging it back in?&nbsp; A reboot should fix the problem to.<br />

<h2>            Failed to connect to the group policy client services.</h2>
                    <p>Well, i've asked this question many times but never got the correct solution.<br />
I've been reading a message as" Windows couldn't connect to the group policy client services" whenever i turn on my computer.<br />
The folks at Microsoft suggested some editing in the services.msc. But i don't have the option to edit the status of the services listed under services.msc<br />
Next, i was suggested to type&nbsp;<strong>netsh winsock reset in the command promt.&nbsp;</strong>I tried this but this solved the problem temporarily. The problem came back.<br />
I even tried editing the registry under regedit. But again this solved the problem temporarily.<br />
The microsoft guys have been behaving extremely unprofessional. They are not even replying to my question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The links for the questions are:&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have lost all the hopes from the Microsoft. Those are the most careless guys i've ever seen.<br />
Does anybody here has the permanent solution to this problem.<br />
