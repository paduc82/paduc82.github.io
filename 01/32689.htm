<h2>            100&#37; Hard Disk Usage. Cannot repair</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having 100% disk usage problem on Lenovo laptop. So far, i have tried disabling superfetch, windows search, and background intelligence transfer service. In the registry i've set enableprefetcher and enablesuperfetch to 1. None of this has worked. The
 hard drive runs at 100 for some minutes and then seems to calm down. Howver, performance is still poor for reasons i don't understand - nothing is obvious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a programmer or windows professional so instructions to fix this need to be step by step.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the link to the Windows Performance Recorder - 35 seconds recorded while the disk problem was happening.</p>
<p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/8aehjh7pq333hh3/LENOVOLAPTOP.07-11-2016.12-50-14.zip?dl=0</p>

</p><p>note that there is a download button upper right hand corner to download the file.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Dead Rising 3 continues to disconnect while attempting coop</h2>
                    Unfortunately I'm having the same issue with attempting to connect with my brother. We have attempted to connect multiple times before I eventually gave up on the matter. I would really appreciate if Capcom got things together so that xbox live consumers
 such as myself could enjoy the coop of Dead Rising 3.

<h2>            Windows Updates Failing, Registry May Be Corrupted</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I'm really, really stuck guys. And please bare with me, it might seem like my title is misleading at first but I promise all my problems are linked. Basically, iTunes won't start no matter what I try, my registry may be corrupted,
 and my Windows Updates are failing.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Recently I plugged my new iPod 5th gen into my PC, but before I could do anything I got a pop-up telling me that I had to update my iTunes before I could sync my iPod with my iTunes library. So I started the update and at some point
 through the installation I got a notification from my Avast antivirus telling me that a file was trying to make changes to my PC (or something to that effect, I honestly can't remember exactly how serious it sounded), but in any case I clicked 'Do not allow'
 or whatever, on the off-chance that it wasn't to do with the iTunes installation. I didn't think anything could really go wrong if it had got something to do with iTunes that a re-install couldn't fix, however once it installed the update I was given a message
 telling me that iTunes had not installed correctly and now I can't open iTunes anymore. I have wiped it from my computer and reinstalled countless times and still no response. Not even an error message. I made a post on Apples community discussion forums and
 despite people trying their best to help me, still nothing. I spoke to an Apple technician on the phone for over an hour, he couldn't help me (he told me I needed somebody with more experience with Windows than him).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">With the help I did get I managed to make some progress as to figuring out what was causing iTunes to not open no matter what I tried, and I think I managed to narrow it down to a couple of Windows related errors. Eventually I used
 a program called Process Monitor that logged the events that occurred when I tried to open iTunes. From what I could read from the program, it had created 8 .wer files on my PC that identified some sort of issue when I tried to open iTunes. Each .wer file
 seemed to log the same issue. It told me that the 'exception code' was c000001d and that the 'fault module' was CoreAudioToolBox.dll. From what I've discovered I think that the c000001d exception code is related to a program installing incorrectly and corrupting
 registry files (I think). Please correct me where I'm wrong. Here's some pics of the first 45 lines of one .wer file (they're all pretty much the same and around 180 lines each):</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">I ran System File Checker to see if it would replace corrupt or missing files however when it finished it just told me "Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them". This also created a .log
 file recording the process which I can open but don't know how to read. It also looks like it is thousands of lines long. The first mention of the word "failed" in these logs says "Failed to internally open package. [HRESULT = 0x800f0805 - CBS_E_INVALID_PACKAGE]",
 but I've got no idea what this means and it would be pointless for me to keep reading without an idea of what I was doing. Basically I've got at least 3 issues that I can't resolve by myself and I don't know which one is causing which. I would greatly appreciate
 any input. </p>

<h2>            some network shares not accessible, but if you map as network drive works fine&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently we started receiving an error on accessing the Network Shares in our LAN, its giving a strange error "The specified path does not exist"/ "We can't find the &lt;address&gt;, please make sure you're using correct location or web address". I checked below
 article regarding this issue but didn't solve my problem.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.megaleecher.net/Fix_Windows_Cannot_Access_Error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.megaleecher.net/Fix_Windows_Cannot_Access_Error</span></a></p>
<p>Strange thing is that we don't face this issue with all the shares on the same server but some of them, very random, no common thread. Another interesting observation is that I am able to open the Share as a Network Map Drive not directly from Hyper Link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. TCP/IP properties are fine</p>
<p>2. Tried disabling antivirus on both server and clients.</p>
<p>3. Tried above mentioned registry&nbsp;edit</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your inputs are valuable on this</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Constant prompt for updates on XBox One</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I play my Xbox One once in a week or 2 weeks. Every time I turn on Xbox One, It prompts for an update. This update is about 370 some MB. I can not use Xbox One without updating it. This is quite annoying and frustrating as this happens every time I use it.</p>
<p>Please let me know if any fix.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I get the same thing, either a. 300mb or 3.4GB. I'm going to see if my son in law has me enrolled in the preview after the update is done so I can play my friggin games...it is beyond old at this point. My time is limited and when I get a chance to play
 I don't because it takes forever to update. </p>

<h3> margaretafoster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire and other apps error message &#34;This app can&#39;t open&#34;</h2>
                    I have an upgrade Windows 10 that has been stable for a number of years.&nbsp; I am a premium user of Microsoft Solitaire and it has never given me a problem.&nbsp; Till this week.&nbsp; The error message is always the same - This app can't open Check the Windows Store
 for more info about Microsoft Solitaire Collection.&nbsp; The store has offered no solution.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I had a problem with my EasyMail earlier this week.&nbsp; I uninstalled, reinstalled and that worked.&nbsp; No further issues.<br />
<br />
With the Microsoft software, it started with the calculator on Friday the 16th. I did the reset in add and remove programs, and it worked right away.&nbsp; Yesterday, Pictures had the same issue, and I went to add and remove programs, reset, and it worked right
 away.&nbsp; Today, it is my Solitaire.&nbsp; This has proven to be much more difficult.<br />
<br />
Reset did not work.&nbsp; I did the remove, and reinstall from the store, and that did not work. &nbsp; Multiple reboots to see if it would change in the process, still no success.&nbsp; Then the store stopped working.&nbsp; I did the reset on that, and it corrected the issue.&nbsp;
 Back to trying the Solitaire, and it still will not open.<br />
<br />
I am thinking part of that issue may be that I am using the premium version, not the straight download.&nbsp; However, on further examination, Microsoft Bingo does not work, same error message, as well as Bejewel and Audible.&nbsp; Media Center Gold and Media Player
 work.&nbsp; I have not gone any further with the apps. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
None of the programs or web browsers I use have been effected.<br />
<br />
One more thing....&nbsp; there was an update this week.&nbsp; I also noticed there are a few "reviews" this week saying other people are having the same issue with the Solitaire program.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate knowing how to resolve this.<br />
<br />

            The service is not the problem, the problem is the game executing (launching). 
<br />
<br />Here are some things you can try:
<br />
<br />Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />Reinstall the Store:
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (Admin) 
<br />At the command prompt, type the following then hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.
<br />
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.

I did a reset earlier, see my post.&nbsp; The store is working fine.&nbsp; It crashed, I did a reset, and it came back.&nbsp; No problem since.<br />
<br />
The game is not working.&nbsp; And as Sarah suggested, it could well be the game is not working because it is down.<br />

Thank you.<br />

If I am still having issues with the game tomorrow, and I am feeling brave enough to attempt yet another install, I will give it a shot.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I don't have a Surface Pro.&nbsp; I have an old HP I upgraded from Win7, cause it made me.&nbsp; While I was not exactly happy with the whole process, it seemed to work well enough.&nbsp; Had to reinstall drivers, programs and fortunately, no data was lost cause I did my
 backups.<br />
<br />
It crashed within 2 months, over a game I installed, then uninstalled, and the whole system crashed.&nbsp; I had a difficult time re-installing 10 again.&nbsp;
<span>For you, it may not be a big deal.&nbsp; However, I remember the last reinstall.&nbsp; Not everything came back, had to reinstall drivers and software and again, lost no data cause my stuff is backed up.</span><br />
<br />
And right this moment, I am working, I do not have my stuff backed up for today, and would rather wait, see what happens, and if need be, prepare to reinstall when I have an afternoon to kill.&nbsp; However, this is the second time a game app has had issues on this
 machine.&nbsp; And why all of a sudden it crashed, after working fine for a couple of years?&nbsp; Only thing different is there was an update this week. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am not sure how this is working.&nbsp; I just renewed my Solitaire premium beginning of this month, for this year.&nbsp; If the game crashed, and it is due to something with the store that was overwritten by the upgrade, cause I got a clunky old system, is this going
 to become something I am going to have to do each time MS upgrades, just to play a game.<br />
<br />
I am not as tech savvy as you are, but I understand more than you may think.&nbsp; Something changed my system, which was working just fine, till the upgrade.&nbsp; Absolutely nothing else has changed, not the virus protection, nothing new was added, and again, the only
 thing was the update a couple of days ago.<br />
<br />
I will hope the issue rectifies itself.&nbsp; My system downtime right now is not convenient, especially just to run a game.&nbsp; As I said, if I get an afternoon to kill, I will consider it.&nbsp; But if the store is going to crash my games, I think games may be off my
 menu for a long time.&nbsp;<br />

Interestingly enough, without having to reinstall Win10, my apps can now be restored.&nbsp; Some of them responded to the reset, others, like the Solitaire collection, when you go to the store, it gives you the option of install, and it restored the game and my
 premium status, and all stats.&nbsp; Did this for my EasyMail as well, and the other games and one or two other apps.<br />
<br />
So, being as how yesterday was Tuesday, and there are usually updates that happen Tuesday nights, I checked my logs. There were some updates last evening after midnight my time according to my logs.&nbsp; Hmmm...&nbsp; I wonder.<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway.&nbsp; I really did not want to have to reinstall the OS again.&nbsp; I guess I was OK with my OS.&nbsp; Just another glitch in the system.</p>

            Thats the default behavior. The quickest way to get to the classic sound control panel:

            That works however that isn't exactly what i'm looking for.&nbsp; There has to be a setting somewhere&nbsp; that changes this default behavior since it wasn't an issue before i reformatted.

            The classic sound settings are part of the classic WIN32 desktop. Microsoft is moving away from this for a modern user interface. Users expected to use the newer sound settings interface in Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Sound.

    <title>Windows 10 Pro &#38; Mozilla ThunderBird - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> copierguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro &#38; Mozilla ThunderBird</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 implied I could "schedule" the upgrade from Win 7 Pro to Windows 10; however, when I clicked giving permission, it took off &amp; fully installed Win 10 without the ability to backup to an image of my hard drive partition. That caused the following:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mozilla ThunderBird booted, but all of the individual account information was missing.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I restored (or so I thought), none of the hundreds of sub-directories off the INBOXES&nbsp;of each of 3 accounts existing for many years were missing &amp; never restored.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some time during this process I went to the Windows.OLD folder, looking for the entire database (a few GB in size), but was not allowed to inspect the folder in depth, or extract it to the old config which had worked in Win 7, 8, 8.1, XP, etc.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to continue using Mozilla TB, Firefox, etc., but it appears Microsoft desires to be kind of like the neighborhood bully; my way or the highway.
</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My desire is to think there may be hope that I have not lost over 20 some years of email communication; that there is a way to fix Windows 10 to be a friend to Mozilla; a creature of a major university originally.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is a fix, could it be in a step by step in plain English; ancient request I suspect, but the one pleading his case is ancient, a DOS whatever since 1985.</p>

            Hi CFalcon2 , that is malware, have you tried using MalwareBytes to remove that form your system?
<br />
<br />You should run a scan with the free version of MalwareBytes to see if it can remove this annoyance . . .

<p>If you’d like to manage your <span>Hotmail</span> account using an email app, you’ll need to set up your POP3 or SMTP server and port settings in your email app. If you don’t want email messages to be permanently deleted from your inbox after you download
 them to your mail program, select the <span>Leave a copy of messages on the server</span> option. For more information, please refer to the link below:</p>

<p>As I reviewed your issue, please check your POP folder to see if the emails are still there.
<span>Hotmail</span> keeps the email messages in the POP folder until you sign in to your

Hotmail</span> should respect or ignore the POP3 delete command.</p>

    <title>Windows Xp and Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dustyowens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Xp and Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Have a problem and was wondering if you guys can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My dad uses a sign maker program and large sign printer for his home work. He got the program a few years ago when he had Windows XP. Its called Signlab version 7. He was told it works with just windows xp. (though I have found some evidence it might work
 with windows vista and 7) It also has a thing called a "dongle" that he has to plug into a usb to open and run the program. I guess its a security feature of some kind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trouble is in two parts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. An updated program Signlab version 9 is $500 so we would like to skip that.</p>
<p>2. Xp is hard to come by since he has to use an old XP powered desktop that has limited ram to use. And sign making takes a lot of ram. Plus I do not think the system was made to handle much add on ram.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I am wondering is...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I create a dual boot on a new windows 8 computer with a copy of windows XP? I have heard there are some high versions of Windows 8 that have something called XP simulator or something that can make the program think its running on XP. Could that work
 with the usb dongle thing as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And does anyone have experience with signlab to know if version 7 would work on say a vista or a windows 7? (not sure if that program has a sub forum here.)</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Windows 7 (which is no longer available from Microsoft but may be available from online vendors such as Amazon or Newegg) included a feature called
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/install-and-use-windows-xp-mode-in-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
XP Mode</a> (for Windows 7 Pro or better).&nbsp; This was intended to ease the transition from XP to Windows 7.&nbsp; XP Mode is Windows XP Pro service pack 3 running in a "virtual machine" hosted by Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Windows 8 was introduced, Microsoft apparently decided that it really didn't want to help users stay with XP any longer and did not include an "XP Mode" capability for Windows 8.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a retail installation CD for Windows XP (including the license key), you could install that on a virtual machine hosted by Windows 8 ... but I suspect that your dad's old computer came with Windows XP pre-installed and so this option is not available
 to you (it is very difficult at this point to find legitimate copies of Windows XP for sale).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Theoretically, you could use that CD and product key -- if you have them -- to dual boot Windows 8 and Windows XP ... but only if there were Windows XP drivers for your new computer -- which there likely would not be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were to get Windows 7 Pro and install XP Mode, you still might have a problem using the dongle.&nbsp; See, e.g.,
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/xp-mode-on-windows-7-is-not-detecting-keylok/23f84d19-b328-4d1f-9f80-fb13d43a5fbe">

http://superuser.com/questions/128011/how-to-connect-a-usb-dongle-to-windows-xp-mode</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the following, you should probably get Windows 7 (while you can) and try to run Signlab 7 directly in Windows 7 --&gt;

    <title>Windows Update Error 8024402F - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abhijit bhagat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update Error 8024402F</h2>
                    I am using Windows Vista Home Premium on my desktop. I installed Windows 8 preview on this PC. Since&nbsp;online apps were not working properly in India, I decided to restore Windows Vista. After restoring, I was not able to copy my old files in Windows folder.
 So I installed using Windows installation disk. The updates were installed in steps. After installing Service Pack 2, the computer was working properly. But when I installed Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile for Windows Vista x86 (KB982670), windows
 update error "WindowsUpdate_8024402F" "WindowsUpdate_dt000" appeared and no further update was possible. When I restored the system using system restore to remove the update and hid the update KB982670, I was able to install other updates. This looks like
 the error 8024402F is due to update KB982670. Is there any solution to resolve this issue?

    <title>CHKDSK ran for 3 days and stuck at 11&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justaskingforum  say:</h3>
<h2>            CHKDSK ran for 3 days and stuck at 11&#37;</h2>
                    <p>About 5 days ago, I fell asleep with my laptop being left on (not put to sleep, so monitor was on overnight). In the morning when I attempted to close the tabs from last night and some of the files on it, I realized it took an unusually long time to process,
 prior to that morning the laptop was running smoothly the entire time and ran everything without any problems. My internet connection being horrible, after I managed to close all the tabs I had to reconnect to my wi-fi network, however the computer was taking
 an unusually long time processing my clicks on the icons and networks. As i tried to click on the network to bring out the connect button it froze for nearly 20 minutes and wasn't responding to my trackpad or mouse anymore. At this point in time i decided
 to force shut down the computer and try re-booting it up again. As I tried to reboot it took 3 hours to reboot to the login screen and after I logged in it lagged even more. So after 5 tries I was finally able to boot it in to safe mode and program a chkdsk
 for it after it was restarted. I ran the chkdsk and went to sleep. When I woke up I saw that the percentage was at 11% and so I left it thinking it was just taking a while.2 more days passed and it was still stuck at 11% so I shut it down and tried it again
 but again it stuck at 11%. I just shut it down again and was sent to the blue screen that says "Computer didn't shut down properly" and proceeded to the troubleshoot screen. From this point on I have no i have absolutely no idea what I should try.</p>
