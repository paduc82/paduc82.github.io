<h2>            Wifi goes off and on after installing Windows 10</h2>
                    After upgrading to Windows 10 my Wifi goes on and off every few minutes, I put it through troubleshooting, the switch will be turned off on Wifi after I've turned it on continuously. Am I missing something that I should of done? &nbsp;I've got a laptop, it
 doesn't have a ethernet plug in.

            <p>Hi BrenReed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It could be because
</span><span>Windows 10 was just installed and drivers would have not have been&nbsp;updated.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I suggest you to install the latest driver either from Windows update or from&nbsp;Wireless card manufacturer website.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope this helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Is the Xbox One Very Buggy&#63; Or is it just mine.</h2>
                    
<p>Ever since I bought this Xbox One (assassins creed bundle) I have encountered endless bugs.</p>

<p>As we speak, I'm in a bug.</p>

<p>Bugs can go from... xbox hud gui glitching out and when I hold the power button to turn it off it doesn't let me select but is still moving in the background.</p>

<p>Or like right now, the most annoying bug of all. Controller just loses power over itself and the analog sticks become disabled out of no where and only buttons work.</p>

<p>Sometimes even now, when I turn on the xbox the controller won't even turn on (wired).</p>

<p>I have tried other controllers but still.</p>

<p>WTF</p>

<p>Just the other day I was playing 2k with my cousin and I had to contiously unplug and replug the controllers because one of hour controllers would lose function over the analog stick.</p>

<p>And not just that I have seen so many bugs on this console man its crazy. What about you guys?</p>

<p>Haven't had these problems myself.</p>
<p>Are you connected to the interwebs and is your console updated? Did you update the firmware of your controllers? Did you throw salt over your left shoulder while praising the spirit of the OG Xbox? Have you or has anyone in your family betrayed this particular
 Xbox One for a Wii U at any point? Green is the colour of the Xbox brand, and also... jealousy. ((Ôº†_Ôº†;))</p>

<p>Never had those problems. Holding the xbox power button for 10 seconds is a force restart. It sometimes freezes(not to often), but I say just hard restart and leave it be. Don't do it to much either. You may need a new controller and that only happen to
 me with a controller I dropped maybe three or so times. </p>

<p>Make sure you have the latest updates on your console and controller, which you can do on the settings app. I have a launch day console and never had any problems with it.</p>

    <title>When I put Battlefield 3 or 2 into my DVD drive, the autorun window - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vin&#237;ciusferreira  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I put Battlefield 3 or 2 into my DVD drive, the autorun window pops up, but when I click in &#34;Open folder&#34; or &#34;Install&#34; the Windows Explorer freezes.</h2>
                    Hello. I'm having some trouble with DVD games... When I put one in the drive (Battlefield 3; 2) the autorun window pops up, but when I click in "Open folder" or "Install" the Windows Explorer freezes. I have already ran the "sfc/scannow" command (it didn't
 show anything wrong - Ran it 4 times) and my W7 Ultimate 64bits is fully updated. Does anybody knows what it can be?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PS1: It isn't a hardware problem. My notebook reads CDs and movie DVDs normally.</div>
<div>PS2: I'd already installed DVD games before... This problem is recent... I also tried to restore the system to a older state (20/03/12 Critical update) but it didn't work...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT----</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just want to add some info...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. I tried to open the setup.exe through the "My Computer", but when I try to open the .exe, after a couple minutes trying to load it showed the message "This isn't a valid win32 file".</div>
<div>2. Here is the error "Detailed description"</div>

            I did what you said. I ran a Clean Boot, tried to open the setup.exe directly, deactivated the antivirus, but nothing worked.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I copied the DVD files to another computer (Running W7 Ultimate too, but not the SP1) then transferred to my notebook by wi-fi, and it ran the setup smoothly. Looks like that my PC can't install the game directly from the DVD, but it can when the file
 is on the HD.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, thanks for the reply!<span>

<h2>            realtek PCIe GBE family controller issue. code 31</h2>
                    I just did an upgrade to windows 8 last night and things seem to be working fine except I am now seeing that my realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller has a yellow caution symbol when viewing device manager. When I went to update drivers it was installing
 and then said there was an issue updating the drivers and gave error code 31. Properties says drivers cant be loaded and gives same error code 31. Not sure what this controller does but I cant seem to get it to work properly. Any thoughts ? Not sure why after
 upgrading to windows 8 I would have this issue right off the bat. Also action center identified a problem with communication with the modem and suggested I reboot it but I didnt have any other issues with any other devices in the house. any help is appreciated.&nbsp;

            OK guys! Super easy fix, not as hard as you think. I recommend doing two things simultaneously as I did, but either one of them (or both) was the correct fix. I just did them at the same time.<br />
<br />
1. Start, all programs, accessories, system tools, disk clean up, (c) drive for me, the main drive i guess, i'm not a computer wiz by all means so this should give you even more hope. I just clicked temp files, recycling bin, stuff that seemed to junk up memory
 unnecessarily, but &nbsp;I did leave system error logs alone just in case to check report<br />
2. I went to control panel, programs, and UNINSTALL THE LATEST JAVA UPDATE, I did recall it was after updating this java one night I couldn't go online the next time (a night or two after)<br />
<br />
That's it! I rebooted and VOILA! No joke, I have internet connection again!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
FYE: yes I tried system restore, replugging both ethernet connection and power cord and a couple other things I read online. BUT THIS WORKS! Apparently there was a corrupt file which I deleted during disk clean up or just uninstalled a bad Java Update which
 turned off/ disrupted communication from my comp and its device drivers.<br />
<br />
Anyways, give it a try!

<h3> scut farkus sr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Purchase history blank</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>With the release of Castle Crashers remastered, and the fact that it's supposed to be free for people who purchased the original one, I decided to log into my Xbox Live account via the website to look at my purchase history.</p>
<p><br />
I have had an active Live account since 2007 and have made MANY MANY purchases since then. My purchase history is completely blank for every year from 2007 up to 2013.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I can see this being a problem if I ever have to redownload any software on my original 360, and also could see it being a problem later when backwards compatibility is fully implemented on the Xbox One so it'd be nice to know if there's a solution for this
 now.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the PC and phone?</li><li>How exactly do you want to transfer files (Bluetooth or USB)?</li><li>Are you facing any issue while doing so?</li><li>If yes, what is the exact error message/code?</li></ul>
<p>You can transfer data via Bluetooth as well as USB cable as well. If you choose to transfer data through Bluetooth to PC, your PC should be Bluetooth capable as well. Once the data is transferred to PC, you can then select files/folders to be uploaded to
 OneDrive as well.</p>
<p>

            Hi Tithira.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If this is for normal Windows Updates and not a Feature Update, then there is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />Are you trying to update to Fall Creators Update Version 1709?  If so What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br /> But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.       
        </p>

            Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv"multiple times
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.

<h3> grant1100  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 sleeping when all sleep settings turned off.</h2>
                    <p>I have tried to configure every setting possible for high performance, plugged in to prevent my computer from sleeping while netflix is paused, as it glitches out with my home theater and TV and I often have to cycle every thing on and off to get the sound
 back...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had this problem with 7 or 8, but Windows ten is now a real PITA when it comes to my computer going to sleep within 5 minutes of inactivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 pro on an HP laptop with a core I3 cpu &nbsp; M330 @ 2.13GHz &nbsp;8mb of ram and its plugged into my home theater via HDMI and the laptop lid is down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the advance power settings and turned off sleep when lid is closed, however the problem continues to exist when I've turned off every single thing I can find to turn off or disable sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any one can provide me some insight on what to do, or if you need me to provide more detailed info on my computer or power settings please let me know.</p>

</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have an infinite repair loop in my Windows 10.0.17134.1 laptop,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Firstly it says "Automatic Repair couldn't repair your pc.</p>
<p>Logfile:&nbsp; &nbsp;D:/......... Some path/Srt/SrtTrail.txt</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. I went to troubleshoot &gt; advanced &gt; cmd, and opened the log file, it says,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Root cause found:</p>
<p>Boot critical file: D:/efi/Microsoft/boot/resources/custom/bootres.dll is corrupt.</p>
<p>Repair action: File repair</p>
<p>Result: failed, error 0x4005</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. I tried to 'Reset this PC' - Keep my files, it says</p>
<p>There was a problem resetting this pc. No changes were made.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. I tried to do system restore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It says,</p>
<p>You must enable system protection on this drive,.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>5. I tried to enter safe mode by pressing F8. But automatic repair is still coming.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>6. In cmd, I entered "rstrui.exe /offline:c:". Now It does not tell me to enable to enable system protection. But it says that</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>System restore failed to extract the file (D:/program files x86/avg/antivirus/setup/crt/data/avg.vc140.mfc/x86/avg.vc140.mfc.cat) from the restore point. The restore point Was damaged or was deleted during the restore.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any help?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,
<br />You would need a recovery USB to fix this. Run Startup repair at least 3 times.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive

    <title>Chkdsk instantly completes, does not do anything - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ethanwdp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chkdsk instantly completes, does not do anything</h2>
                    <div>I am running a dualboot setup with Linux Mint 19.1 and Windows 10. Recently, I've started to notice that some of the files on my Windows partition have corrupted (so far I've only seen 3 corrupt files in Event Viewer, none of which are important).<br />
(It's also worth noting that a couple of days ago I received a notification that went something to the effect of "Restart computer to fix problems with drive", which ran chkdsk after I rebooted and had the same problem)</div>
<div>When I reboot into Windows chkdsk starts normally and silently exits a few seconds after the input countdown ends, then boots into the login screen. It doesn't even show the percentage. According to Event Viewer it checks 2/3 of the NTFS partitions on
 my drive (which are only a few hundred megabytes each), but does not check the primary 900GB partition. It's also not doing anything for the corruption, as the corrupted files are still there and cannot be deleted through the GUI or CMD. My drive is a five
 month old WD Blue WDS100T2B0A 1TB SSD.</div>

            Hi ethanwdp
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Advice on Regions</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>I've done a load of research on the subject of changing regions and moving countries with my xbox but wondered whether anyone had any advice for me in this situation.</p>
<p>I originally bought my xbox in the UK 5 years ago then moved to NZ and kept my UK gamertag. My xbox has RROD twice now and I got it fixed the first time but I think I'm just going to buy a new one now.</p>
<p>I'm going home to the UK for a holiday this week and was thinking about buying a new xbox there as they are so much cheaper than buying one in NZ.</p>
<p>I don't want to change my gamertag because I've bought stuff on it and have got all my achievements etc on it so really buying a nex xbox in the UK and then transferring my gamertag (along with all other HD contents) over to it won't change anything at all
 huh?</p>
<p>I already have to buy microsoft points online and download stuff from the UK market place and as long as it's available in NZ then there's no problem... right? I've downloaded extra missions for Mass Effect over here on my UK gamertag and didn't have any
 issues so I should be able to continue doing this I think.</p>
<p>I know I haven't really asked much of a question but it would be great if someone could just confirm that my thinking is correct and that I won't lose anything by getting my new xbox in the UK.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Let me explain:</p>
<p>When you have a UK account you are allowed to use it on any console in any region.</p>
<p>The issues you will have are with the marketplace content as the console is in a different region it will have a different marketplace, hence you will not be able to purchase the content.</p>
<p>If you purchase a new console you will still be able to play on it in NZ but you will still not be able to access the marketplace.</p>
<p>the region on your account will not change.</p>
<p>What microsoft recommend you do is have a console for each region you live in and have an account for each region (cough coughmoney hungry)</p>
<p>But everything should be the same when you transfer all of your content to your new console.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span>Not entirely true. The console would not matter since the UK and NZ are the same region coding. Meaning that games bought in either region would still play in his console. What MS does recommend
 you do when you move to another region is to create a region specific account. That is because international, copyright, license, local and government laws all play a part in what is and is not allowed in each region. Just because you bought content in the
 UK doesn't mean it is allowed in NZ. The only way to find that out is to have a NZ account (doesn't need to be Gold) so you know what is available in that region.
</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span>However, you can still use your UK account anywhere in the world so long as there is a broadband or higher connection for XBL. You just may experience problems accessing and/or using your UK
 content and you would not be able to get any REGION LOCKED content while you are out of region.

<p>Yeah all you need is a UK silver account for buying points and downloading DLC (that's the one I'm signed in as now, you can tell by the gamerscore!). Have you encountered any problems using your credit card on your NZ account, for example to buy a Gold
 subscription? You can also buy a card online for that. </p>
<p>Of course, the best option for the customer would be that when they move to a different country, their region should be &nbsp;changed for them to correctly reflect their new region so they can keep their gamertag, buy points, subscriptions, and DLC with no hassle.
 Of course, microsoft aren't willing to do that, even if you have proof that you now live in a different country. It doesn't &nbsp;matter how many times you phone support about this, they won't do anything for you. Thats kind of the opposite of customer support,
 really.</p>

            Hi  Thameen
<br />
<br />HP do not seem to provide Windows 10 device drivers for that model, it is not supported on Windows 10
<br />
<br />Have you tried installing the Windows 8 chipset driver and Intel IME driver from the page below
<br />

            You would find the drivers here:

<br />Go for Windows 8 drivers as no 10 drivers are available.

                    <p>Hello there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already updated to windows 10 1809 on a brand new DELL machine and everything was pretty OK until a couple days ago when

<span>after </span>5 office updates (which kept coming up even after successfully installed), an 0x800705b4 error appeared and since then no updating is possible, no matter my efforts based on solutions provided on the net (uncheck office updates, run troubleshooter,
 sfc /scannow, delete softwaredistribution).</p>
<p>Additionally, when tried to activate windows defender (because I read it is a defender-connected error) I got an 577 error, and found out that no defender exists in 1807 any more (correct?).</p>
<p>My system runs ESET and Malwarebytes on demand with no problem so far (I have tried disabling them as well, with no effect).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp; Would clean boot help somehow? Is a 1809 related issue?</p>
<p>P.S. The last SSU is for 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance, Panos</p>

<p><span><span>This error related to Windows Defender. Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG) introduced a new user interface inside Windows Security in 1809. Please check service
 responsible for Windows defender (make sure that you disable third party anti-virus before checking the services):</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press Windows key + R and type in services.msc then press Enter. </span>
</p>
</li></ol>
<ol>
<li>
<span>In services window, locate Windows Defender service in the services list.</span></li><li>
<span>Verify that the Status is started. If the Status column is blank, right click on the service and select Start.</span></li><li>
<span>If you get error trying to force start the Windows Defender service, try to change the Startup Type to Automatic, and then restart the computer.</span></li><li>
<span>Next you can download a Windows updates and check the issue.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above steps does not work, then you will need to uninstall the third party Anti-virus. Then update and enable windows defender. You can re-install the third party Anti-virus programs one
 all updates and defender is working.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: If you have Windows 10, you‚Äôll get the latest antivirus protection with Windows Defender. When you start up Windows 10 for the first time, Windows Defender is on and actively helping to
 protect your PC by scanning for malware (malicious software), viruses, and security threats. Windows Defender uses real-time protection to scan everything you download or run on your PC. Windows Update downloads updates for Windows Defender automatically to
 help keep your PC safe and protect it from threats.</span></p>

<p>Dear Naresh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your kind response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that my OS is <strong>Windows 10, 1809 (17763.55)</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The defender service cannot be changed to automatic because the relative selection (STARTUP TYPE) is DISABLED and of course when I tried to start it I got a 577 error message (signature verification problem).</p>
<p>2. Also, when I tried to install the SSU for 1809 didn't let me do it because it is already installed.</p>
<p>3. Further on, when I was to another company it seemed that it finally worked (no error message), but when I tried windows update at my office I got another error message
<strong>0x8024a223</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you understand, am totally frustrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I also paused my AV when trying the above actions (ESET Endpoint 6.6)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Panos</p>

<p>=========================================<br />
FWIW...WAV is an Audio format not Video so you cannot view it.</p>
<p>Do you have the .wav file saved in your Music folder?</p>

    <title>Win7 Hal.dll missing or corrupt. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sythe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win7 Hal.dll missing or corrupt. </h2>
                    Hello. I have been unable to find a solution anywhere for this so if it already exist please point me in the right direction.
<br />
<br />
Ok. I started out by having a power supply problem. While trouble shooting it my hal.dll suddenly went missing. I replace the PSU but I still have the missing/corrupt hal.dll error message when I boot.
<br />
<br />
What I have tried:<br />
&nbsp;Running the automatic startup repair option on the Win7 DVD. no luck<br />
&nbsp;Tried tweeking the bios and reconfiguring boot orders. no luck. <br />
<br />
My system:<br />
&nbsp; MB: Asus AN8-SLI premium<br />
&nbsp; AMD Athlon x2 4400. <br />
&nbsp; 4 gig ram<br />
&nbsp; nforce 4 raid 1tb. (this is partitioned into two drives, one i think 100gb for win and the rest for storage)
<br />
&nbsp; VC: nvidia 9800gt <br />
&nbsp; New 650W PSU<br />
&nbsp; plenty of cooling. <br />
<br />
Any help or ideas would be great. I'm stumped. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sythe <br />

<p>Hey Sythe,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Give a try with this:<br />
<br />
Boot to WinRE command prompt and try the command:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
copy x:\windows\system32\hal.dll c:\windows\system32<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To access the System Recovery Options menu:<br />
<br />
If you have a Windows 7 installation disc, you need to restart (boot) your computer using the installation disc. If you do not restart your computer from the disc, the option to repair your computer will not appear.
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer using the computer's power button.
<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do one of the following: <br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon
 prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to repair, and then press and hold F8.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight Repair your computer, and then press Enter. (If Repair your computer isn't listed as an option, then your computer doesn't include preinstalled recovery options, or your network administrator
 has turned them off.)<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select a keyboard layout, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the System Recovery Options menu, click a tool to open it. Means select command prompt option.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then type in the following command in the command prompt:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy x:\windows\system32\hal.dll c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
