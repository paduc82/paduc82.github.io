<h2>            Why Doesn&#39;t the Windows 8.1 Update X Close Button for Modern Apps actually Stop the Running Process&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Here's what I'm seeing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plug a thumb drive into desktop my PC running Windows 8.1 Update.</p>
<p>I open a pdf file from the thumb drive using the Modern (tile based) Reader app.</p>
<p>After I'm done reading my pdf I use my mouse to click the new X close button in the top right of the Reader app.</p>
<p>The app's window goes away and I try to eject my thumb drive from the notification center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But wait! I can't eject my drive because the pdf in question is still locked. &nbsp;And why is is still locked? Because if I open Task Manager, I see that the Reader process is still running. &nbsp;If I kill it, then my drive can be ejected. &nbsp;So at last my question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't the new X close button for modern apps do what the X close button does for desktop apps? &nbsp;And what is the correct way to get a modern app to let go of my files if the X button doesn't close things?</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>To close the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press Alt+F4.</p>
<p>2. Position the cursor at the top of the screen. Drag the&nbsp;app down to the bottom of the screen and hold it there until it "Flips" and then release it.</p>

<h3> darrkhawk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Blu-Ray player not working</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to play a DVD on my xbox one for the first time since purchase. I was prompted to install the Blu-Ray app which I have done. However, when i try to play any DVD (tested with 10 different discs), the app just stops on the blue load screen with
 the loading circle. The audio plays in the background but there is no image and the loading screen just stays.&nbsp;<br />
I have reset my console each time a new disc was inserted to no effect. &nbsp;Is there anything i can try to get the app working and play DVDs, Don't really want something I paid £400 for to not be able to do such a simple task.</p>

<p>The disc's audio was playing? Like, say you put Iron Man into the console. You only see the Blu-ray splash screen, but you hear Iron Man audio? Or do you just hear the Drive spinning up?</p>
<p>I've had a disc fail to load in the way you described, but I've never seen/heard it actually play audio back.</p>

            Custom Clean Install Steps<br />
<br />
You can use an upgrade disk, but you can't do an in place upgrade. You will have to do a custom clean install that will remove all your programs - this also means you'll have to reinstall all your programs, but you can save your files and settings to an external
 storage before doing so. Here are the steps according to Microsoft:<br />
<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</a> ) to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation
 and whether you should install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
2. Back up your files and settings. To avoid losing anything you'll need to save copies of all the files, photos, and other information you want to keep on to an external hard drive. Windows Easy Transfer (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer</a>
 ) is a free tool you can use to copy your information (but not programs) from your PC and then put them back after you install Windows 7. If you don't have an external hard drive you won't be able to use Windows Easy Transfer, instead you can copy files you
 want to keep on a USB flash drive, or on CD/DVD.<br />
<br />
3. Locate the original installation disks and any associated product/license keys for the programs currently on your computer because you'll need to manually reinstall all your programs after you install Windows 7. You might be able to download some programs
 from the Internet.<br />
<br />
4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC. When asked "Which type of installation do you want? click "Custom (advanced)."<br />
<br />
5. After Windows 7 is installed you can use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your files &amp; settings, and use your installation disks to install all your programs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p><span><span><span>If you are running
<strong>Windows Vista</strong> , in some cases you can upgrade directly to Windows 7 and in other cases you will need to perform a custom installation. The following table shows which editions of Windows&nbsp;Vista can be upgraded to Windows&nbsp;7.</span>

Upgrade means you can install Windows 7 by simply inserting the Windows 7 upgrade software into your PC's DVD drive and follow the instructions on your screen. While you're not required to backup and reinstall your files, or reinstall your programs, it's a
 very good idea to back up your files and settings before you start any software upgrade. Get more information about
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">software upgrades and best practices</a> .
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</span><br />
A custom (clean) installation erases the contents of your PC's hard drive. Your files, settings, and programs will not be transferred to Windows 7. That means that to install Windows 7, you'll need to:
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Backup all the files and settings you want to keep</p>
</li><li>
<p>Install Windows 7</p>
</li><li>
<p>Reinstall all your files</p>
</li><li>
<p>Reinstall all the programs you want to use.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>These four steps take time, some technical skill and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/features/windows-easy-transfer.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Easy Transfer</a> can help. However, If you're not comfortable with this process, please consider having the installation done by a local service provider.</p>

Many of these devices such as HP Stream came in a variety of colors with a full copy of Windows 8.1. Attractive qualities include an affordable price and a 11 or 13 inch display. Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations. This makes it difficult to install Windows 10 the conventional way.

                    Does Microsoft provide an upgrade from Windows Vista 32 bit service pack 2 to Windows Ultimate 64 bit? I have checked with the Windows 7 upgrade utility and it indicates that my laptop can handle Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit. Any help would be appreciated.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can't upgrade a 32 bit version to a 64 bit version. So you will have to do a clean install<br />
with the 64 bit. That is if you can find Vista Ultimate 64 bit.<br />

            <p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows&nbsp;Vista 32 Bit to 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

<h2>            How to change Windows 10 Gestures &#40;3 finger swiping&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded my Windows 7 Dell Inspiron Laptop to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have the Windows 10 three finger gestures on my touchpad that basically act as alt+tab (<strong>Swipe left/right:</strong>
<em>move between windows</em>, <strong>Swipe up:</strong> <em>task switch</em>, <strong>
Swipe down:</strong> <em>minimize all windows and show the desktop</em>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I absolutely hate this!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">In Windows 7, swiping up and down with 3 fingers allowed me to switch between tabs in my internet browser. And swiping left hit the "back button", and swiping right hit the "forward button" in the browser.</span>&nbsp;I
 liked this! It was SUPER efficient and SUPER convenient. But, this has been overridden by the new Windows 10, 3 finger gestures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to replace the new Windows 10 3 finger gestures with my old Windows 7 3 finger gestures?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked through all the settings and "additional mouse settings" and "touchpad settings" but I haven't found a way to change it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, is there a way to change my Windows 10 3 finger gestures back to the way they were in Windows 7?</p>

<p>
</p><p>We understand your requirement in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description, I suspect that the problem might be with the touch pad drivers or might be with the touch pad settings. I mean to say, problem with the Multi-finger Sensing that which enables advanced gestures such as pinch and zoom, 3-finger flick,
 and more. Suggest you to cross check with the touch pad settings to ensure that everything is set correctly. Do refer the article

            <p>Hello, thank you for your reply, but it didn't help. Everything is still the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not having at issue with the touchpad itself. Nor do I think the issue is with the drivers. Rather, the default settings of the touchpad were automatically changed when I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Let me restate my problem:</strong></p>
<p>The 3 finger gestures that are available in Windows 7 are different from the 3 finger gestures that are available in Windows 10. I just upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10, but I want my original 3 finger gesture capabilities back.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e51545f-4b80-421e-87ce-610dab78cc49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e51545f-4b80-421e-87ce-610dab78cc49" /></a></p>
<p>These are what the gesture options look like now, in Windows 10. See the highlighted portion? THAT is what's different. In Windows 7, the "Three Fingers Swip" had completely different functions. In other words, the "Three Fingers Swip" did something completely
 different in Windows 7. It allowed me to switch back and forth between open tabs in my web browser by swiping up and down with 3 fingers. Similar to what "ctrl+tab" or "ctrl+shift+tab" does now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is, how do I get the Windows 7 "Three Fingers Swip" functionality that I described back, instead of having the Windows 10 "Three Fingers Swip" functionality that is show in the picture above? Maybe there are Windows 7 touchpad drivers I can
 download, or something? Tell me if this problem makes sense to you.&nbsp;</p>

            Good luck. &nbsp;I tried and tried and complained to Microsoft to no avail. &nbsp;Someone at Microsoft decided that they did not want to have the same gestures as Apple, so they had to change that functionality, despite the fact that uses had become accustomed to
 it. &nbsp;The really stupid part is that people spend more time navigating back and forward in websites than they do switching apps. &nbsp;How hard is it to find an app on the taskbar anyway? &nbsp;This has been a frustration for many since Windows 10 launched, but as I
 said, they refuse to change it or even give us an option to change it. &nbsp;

            <p>Hi Uriel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know what is the make and model of the Computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue you are facing is because the SATA port you have it plugged into on your motherboard is a separate controller which supports a SCSI driver. You will see a SCSI controller in the device manager too. Motherboard SATA controllers that are not part
 of the main chipset will often appear as SCSI devices. These extra controllers have their own BIOS so the drive will not appear as a drive in your motherboard's BIOS SATA drive page. You can configure the controller to display devices that are plugged into
 it as the computer boots up in the boot menu of your bios (you may have to turn off the splash screen to see it). Only drives on the SATA ports that are associated with the chipset will show up in your BIOS SATA configuration page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, you will have to contact your computer manufacturer regarding this issue for making the necessary hardware changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the answer</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>I re-checked the drives connections and they are connected to SATA port 0 and 1 which are controlled by the Intel Z87X chipset.&nbsp; I checked the BIOS and these ports are defined as AHCI ports not SCSI.</p>

<p>Hi Uriel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is&nbsp;due to&nbsp;the controllers to which the Hard Disk Drive&nbsp;is connected to (Intel Z87X chipset)</p>
<div><br />
Depending on the Controllers where the Hard Disk Drives are connected,&nbsp;the Operating System picks up the Hard Disk Drives and displays them as the Controllers This information is passed to the Operating system.</div>

I would suggest you to&nbsp;please get in touch with the Computer manufacturer or the Motherboard manufacturer for assistance on this issue.</div>

            <p>This seems to be a known issue and has been mentioned on many forums. It looks like there are some Sata controllers that windows will do this with. Although this shouldn't affect the performance of the hard drive.You can try to uninstall and reinstall the
 SATA drive driver and then see if it helps you to fix the issue.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do so, follow the steps to uninstall &amp; reinstall the SATA drive driver from device manager.<br />
1. Click on Start and in Start search box type in "Device Manager" (with quotes) and press enter.<br />
2. Device Manager Window will be open.<br />
3. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
4. Look for the device under Disk drives, right click on it and select Uninstall.<br />
5. Restart the computer.<br />
6. On restart, Windows 7 should re-install the generic drivers automatically.<br />
7. Download &amp; install the SATA drive drivers from the manufacturer's website and check if it helps.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, or if the drive performance is slow, you can try contacting the hard drive manufacturer and check if they are aware of this issue and have a solution for the same.</p>

            <p>Thanks for all the replies. </p>
<p>I resigned to the fact that the Z87X chip-set on my motherboard (Gigabyte GA-Z87X-UD4H) reports to Windows that the drives are indeed SCSI.&nbsp; I redid teh computer in the sense of re-format and re-install everything and got the same results.&nbsp; Both drives are
 rep[orted as SCSI.&nbsp; Talking to Gigabyte both in the USA (nice techs) and in Taiwan (very bad support) yeild not answer.&nbsp; So I guess I will have to live with this issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>After re-doing everything it seems, as was mentioned in the answers above me, that it does not affect the proper working of the computer as a whole.&nbsp; So if I encounter any issues in the future I will keep your guys posted.<br />

new laptop from Best Buy</a> this August and wanted to install Windows 7 Professional on it. It came with Windows 10 and 8.1 worked on it besides most of the drivers. When I try to boot the Windows 7 installation in Legacy mode the "Loading Windows Files" loading
 screen appears along with the "Starting Windows" boot screen however shortly after I get this Blue Screen error every time I try to do so.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(215, 218, 220, 1)">If I try it in UEFI mode the same thing happens except instead of getting this blue screen error it freezes on the "Starting Windows" boot screen and has a weird red bar at the top of the screen. I have
 secure boot disabled and have tried both UEFI and Legacy mode. I even tried disabling TPM, and the Optimized OS defaults option. Lastly I flashed the BIOS but still got the same results. I'm stuck I have no idea what to do. I don't know if there's something
 I'm supposed to enable or disable in my BIOS or whatever. I know that this laptops processor is not a Skylake or Kaby Lake model because I looked through the list of models and didn't see it there, so shouldn't I be able to run it? It ran 8.1 fine. Can some
 please help me fix this? Thank you :)</span></p>

<p>1st to get youre pc hardware info,in run type: Msinfo32&nbsp; And/or if&nbsp; Intel-based hardware,go to intel.com/support/drivers-software/browse man./ use search for Processor Identification utility,once thru,type: Chipset Identification utility.These small utilities
 get all the info you need.ACPI is the/one of Power Mgmt features of the pc..Being a Win 10 OS/pc default,you have ACPI ability.Try in Windows R.click my computer/properties/advanced/virtual memory tab/advanced/change button.With&nbsp; C:&nbsp; highlited,set to "Let

<p>close out,restart pc...The wrong setting is a normal pc default,who knows why...</p>

    <title>Downgrade to 1607 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Downgrade to 1607</h2>
                    <p>Man did I screw up....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 version 1607 was working great on my HP Envy 17.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I could not boot up into Windows.&nbsp; I tried everything I could think of to boot, but I kept getting critical errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, since the forced upgrades to 1709 never worked, I downloaded the iso for the current build of version 1709 and tried to install it.&nbsp; Everything seemed to install okay until I got to the 'welcome to windows' window.&nbsp; At that point my system froze.&nbsp;
 I could not use the mouse, nor the keyboard.&nbsp; I was forced to re-boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon reboot, everything seems like it was going to work, until the rotating circles stopped rotating.&nbsp; After waiting awhile, I had to re-boot, resulting in the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, maybe I had a bad 'clean' install, so I re-installed version 1709 from the downloaded iso.&nbsp; Again, system freeze at the same point.&nbsp; Again, freezes with the rotating circles.&nbsp; Okay, it seems that 1709 is not going to work on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked for a safe iso of the current build of version 1607, but could not one.&nbsp; Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Maybe the April Creators version of Windows 10 might work on my computer, but Fall Creators version (1709) does not.)</p>

            Step 1: download Windows 10 1607 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1607
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

<p>Thank you Andre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I was not able to get a recent backup prior to yesterday's crash.&nbsp; I do, however, have a backup from a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; Since very little has changed, I should be able to re-create the changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wish that the Windows version upgrades were as seamless as the many linux version upgrades that I have done.</p>

            Windows 10 is still maturing it seems. Hopefully, starting with version 1803, the dust will begin to settle.

<p>I have an Canon <b>CanoScan</b> <b>N650U</b> <b>scanner</b> that I use a few times a year. Canon never released
<b>Vista</b> drivers for this <b>scanner</b>, using the instructions below made the
<b>scanner</b> work on <b>Windows</b> <b>7</b> for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the XP drivers from <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;tabact=DownloadDetailTabAct&amp;fcategoryid=351&amp;modelid=6858" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Canon’s website</a> </li><li>Install the drivers </li><li>The driver didn’t install, but unzipped to C:/Temp/CanoScanCSUv571a </li><li>Go to C:/Temp/CanoScanCSUv571a and uncompress CanoScanCSUv571a.exe </li><li>Plug in your <b>scanner</b> </li><li>Go to your device manager. </li><li>Click on Add a Device and select the <b>scanner</b> </li><li>Right click to update driver information </li><li>Select browse my computer for driver software </li><li>Type in: C:\Temp\CanoScanCSUv571a </li><li>Click next and my <b>scanner</b> worked </li></ol>

                    I installed Windows 7 on my Dell pc.&nbsp; The os is in d: drive.&nbsp; When I run windows easy transfer to retrieve my old files I get an error saying there is not enough disk space.&nbsp; Yet I have 198 gb free, it's supposed to take only about 116 gb.&nbsp; Now accordeing
 to the easy transfer program it also wants to transfer&nbsp; some information to drive C:, though I didn't run the transfer program on drive C:, only on drive D:&nbsp; Dell uses the c: drive with a only a small partition for some diagnostic programs.&nbsp; According to the
 tranfer program, it wants to transfer about 83 megabytes of data, and theres only about 11 mb of free space left.&nbsp; Am I going to have to get a partition program to make it a larger partition, or what?&nbsp; Also, when I run the transfer program and go to advanced
 options where it shows the drive mappings, it show's the drive mappings as c: -&gt; c:,&nbsp;&nbsp; d: -&gt; d:, and&nbsp; Maxtor (where I&nbsp;had the&nbsp;easy transfer program store my files -&gt; Maxtor.&nbsp; I assume I need to change the Maxtor to Maxtor -&gt; d:,&nbsp; Is this correct?<br />
<br />
Thanks.&nbsp;

            Thanks Debleena<br />

I solved the problem.&nbsp; Dell puts some diagnostic files in c: drive.&nbsp; (the&nbsp;OS is on drive D:)&nbsp; I shoud say, Single drive,&nbsp;just logical&nbsp;partitions .&nbsp; I did a disk cleanup on the D: drive&nbsp;and removed windows.old,&nbsp; but that didn't help, because it was getting an
 error in the c: partition, where the Dell diagnostic files are stored.&nbsp; So I backed up those diagnostic files and then deleted them from C:&nbsp; I then was able to run the easy transfer and restore my files.&nbsp; Apparently when I ran the easy transfer wizard to back
 up my files on the D: drive to begin with, it also backed those up on C:, since it technically is part of the same physical drive.&nbsp; When you then run the easy tranfer wizard to restore those files it insists on restoring all lthe files on C: as well, not checking
 the old files still resident on C: to see if they are the same.&nbsp; (if it had checked it&nbsp;might have asked me If I wanted to replace the files on C:, and I could have said either yes or no.)&nbsp; But since I didn't know the Easy tranfer wizard was going to do this,
 I really had no idea what files it wanted to put onto C: drive (it really didn't need to put any.)&nbsp; I guess the moral of the story is if it's a single drive with logical partitions, if you backup the logical&nbsp;partition where XP resides, it's going to back up
 the other logical partitions as well.&nbsp; Then when restoring with the ETW, it's going to restore all the partitions as well.&nbsp; In my case, the c: partition had just enough room for the Dell diagnostic programs, and that was it.&nbsp; I ended up with the same Dell
 diagnostic files on drive C: after the restore as before.&nbsp; Thanks Alot for responding to my inquiry!<br />

<h2>            How can you create&#47;edit playlists in WMP 12 without affecting what&#39;s now playing&#63;</h2>
                    My problem relates to Windows Media Player 12 which I've just installed as part of new Windows 7 bundle. In previous versions of WMP, I have been able to create or edit Playlists in the pane on the right hand side of the screen independent of what music
 was now playing. Now I no longer seem able to do this - the moment I add a new song to a playlist, for instance, the music that was previously playing is closed, and the particular song I'm trying to add to the Playlist begins to play. It's as if WMP now expects
 you to create playlists in silence, then hit Play. Can one decouple, as it were, the creation of playlists from the 'now playing' functionality?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Your touchpad likely has a scroll function. Your solutions are limited to either disabling the function, disabling the touchpad, or resting the base of your thumb elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Control Panel/Mouse/Device Settings tab, click on the touchpad listing, then on the Settings button. Controls can be found here. If no controls exist, you may need to download and install touchpad software from the manufacturere.<br />
<br />
Some laptops also feature a switch to turn off the touchpad.
