    <title>Start Up Not Always Connecting Profile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rayhalligan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start Up Not Always Connecting Profile</h2>
                    <p><span>For some weeks I’ve been having problems with my machine on start up and I can't relate this to any software installs or changes that I've made.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Occasionally, but not always, I get a black screen with a white cursor for a while, then I get a message “Failed to connect to a Windows service.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Couldn’t&nbsp;connect to&nbsp;the System Event Notification Service...”.<span>&nbsp; </span>
It then loads some desktop programs, but not all, and these are not shown in the normal sequence or format.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, it has not loaded my profile.<span>&nbsp; </span>The thing is that this doesn’t happen every time but, perhaps,&nbsp;a third&nbsp;of the time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>On the other times, the machine starts normally.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the machine loads normally, System Event Notification Service is running and when the problem occurs, it is not.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The service is set to Automatic.<span>&nbsp; </span>So far I have tried</span></p>

<p><span>Nothing has made any difference.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The odd thing is that the problem only occurs occasionally.<span>&nbsp; </span>
It may load 2 or 3 times without problem then it may fail a few times.<span>&nbsp; </span>
If I force a closure, the machine always then loads normally the next time.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>

<p><span>The only other problem I get, and this occurs every time unless I am in Safe Mode, is that if I try to use the Restart facility, I always get a BSOD (with an error code of 0xc0000212a).<span>&nbsp;
</span>This may, of course, be totally unconnected with the start up problems.</span></p>

<p><span><span>Having tried everything I have found in various posts I seem to be left with two options.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

</li></ul>

<p><span>Has anybody got any suggestions as to what else I could try?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’m currently using Windows 8.1 Update 64 bit.</span></p>

            <p>Hello Ray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur either due to software conflicts or if any infection like virus or malware is present in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
<strong>Perform clean boot and check.</strong><br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not help, use method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
I appreciate this fact that you have already run virus scans. However, I would still suggest you to<strong> run Microsoft safety scanner</strong> and check the issue.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Microsoft safety scanner</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p><span><span>Thanks very much for your response.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The computer is an Asus G75VW, </span><span>i7-3740QM 2.7GHz, 16GB Dual Channel DDR3 at 1600MHz.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I tried to do a clean boot a number of times but at first this kept failing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In System Configuration, after I clicked on Hide All Microsoft Services and Disable All, whenever I clicked on OK or Apply, it froze with the wheel continuously spinning.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It then showed as System Configuration is Not Responding.<span>&nbsp; </span>I therefore made the changes to System Configuration whilst in Safe Mode and this worked OK.<span>&nbsp;
</span>From then on, the machine loaded and restarted normally.<span>&nbsp; </span>I tried this at least a dozen times and all appeared to be well.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I then ran the Microsoft Safety Scanner.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This detected 2 problems, one a password checker that I have had installed for a few years and the second a routine that allows browser add ons.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Both of these have now been deleted.<span>&nbsp; </span>Further testing showed Start and restart continuing to function normally.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I then performed the Reset to come out of the clean boot state.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In doing this I did notice that when I clicked on Normal Startup in General, it reverted to Selective Startup whenever I clicked apply.<span>&nbsp;
</span>From then on, startup ran correctly for about a half dozen times. <span>&nbsp;</span>Restart did not fail with a BSOD but, although the desktop is presented, the shortcut icons are blank. These take a couple of minutes or so to appear and are not responsive
 in that time. Clicking on one of the icons while they are blank leaves the wheel spinning and the program only opens when the icons appear.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Having got that far I was happy to leave things at that as I rarely use restart, but on about the seventh or eighth startup, the original
 black screen appeared. <span>&nbsp;</span>It is now back to responding as it did when I first posted, that is failing about 40% to 50% of the time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I would now be keen to gradually add things back from the clean boot but I cannot see a way of doing this.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It appears only to allow disabling or enabling everything.<span>&nbsp; </span>Is there a way to enable the services selectively?</span></span></p>

            Thanks very much for your response on this.&nbsp; As you will see from my response to Ratandeep, I am no longer able to replicate the BSOD on Restart, the symptoms having now changed.&nbsp; If, whilst continuing to clear&nbsp;the problem, I receive the BSODs again, I
 will post the log files as you have suggested.&nbsp; Alternatively, if a log at any other point would provide any useful information, please let me know.&nbsp; Thanks again for your interest.

            <p>Thanks for this.&nbsp; The long delay in replying is due to me&nbsp;trying lots of different things without wanting to give you a blow by blow account.</p>
<p>The new user account option didn't prove much.&nbsp; I created a new account but it would not take my real email address as this was already in use.&nbsp; I created the account with an email address that I don't use but, when it restarted, it came back to my real
 account.&nbsp; I did not want to delete my real account as I have so many things (virtual machines etc.) that would have taken an age to recreate in the new account.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;therefore gradually worked through every program that was opening at startup, deleting some and reinstalling others and clearing out any processes that I did not think were relevant.&nbsp; I have been down many roads that have eventually proved fruitless, including
 uninstalling the virus checker I use and installing another one.&nbsp; After every change the symptoms were still the same.&nbsp; However, for no reason that I can discern, the problem with startup has disappeared.&nbsp; I have tested this over and over again and over many
 days and not once has the machine failed to load properly.&nbsp; It could have been the virus checker change but there was certainly one failure after the new AV was installed.&nbsp; Therefore this part of the problem has gone.</p>
<p>The problem with restart still exists, though, that is it freezes on restart with desktop icons showing as white for about a minute or so.&nbsp; I notice that some of the error codes shown in event viewer for restart are different from those shown in a normal
 start but these don't mean a great deal to me.&nbsp; As I use restart very rarely and, even when I do, the problem is only temporary, I think it best that I let this matter now drop.&nbsp; It would be wrong to continue to take up you time for something that is now so
 trivial.</p>
<p>Thanks again for all your help.</p>

<h2>            0x8e5e03fe error on installing windows 8.1 apps</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently installed Windows 8.1 - a clean install. &nbsp;I was initially able to download and install Windows 8 apps, but now am unable to do so. &nbsp;I have tried many different apps - from mainstream apps like Facebook to games. &nbsp;Each app install errors-out
 with this message:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Something happened and this app couldn't be installed. &nbsp;Please try again. &nbsp;Error code&nbsp;0x8e5e03fe.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I found a similar question at this web page:</div>

            <p>Hello Nirmal,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not see a notification that you responded. Sorry for the lateness here. However, some months later I still am in the same boat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your steps exactly and still get this issue. I did a clean boot and disabled all startup programs. I Still get the same error code being 0x8e5e03fe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did create an entirely new account and I am able to get apps installed on the different accounts, so this is a problem with this particular account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>More information on this matter may help. I linked the MS account that is having the problem to my work domain. What is interesting is that I did not need nor did I ask my domain administrator to add me. There was an option to add myself. Most of the time
 I work remotely and I have full admin right to the machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My IT staff does not officially support Windows 8 and there are no domain policies that keep me from purchasing apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also went into settings and attempted to change accounts in the store to the account that does work. This also produced the same error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's somewhat frustrating that their is an error code, yet that error code does not get enough information to point to the exact problem when searching. I guess I could create an entirely new account and move all of my applications and settings, but that
 should not be required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any other thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            I have had this identical problem since upgrading to 10 from 8.1 on a 2015 Dell. I have tried everything suggested, including the clean boot troubleshooting suggestion and even, reloading Windows 10&nbsp;&nbsp;all without results. Just finished a chat session with
 Microsoft tech which ended&nbsp;after hours spent examining my system remotely, finding nothing "wrong", telling me what I already knew, and only increasing the&nbsp;frustration.&nbsp;From what I have been reading, this is a problem experienced by many and Microsoft has
 yet to let us know whether it is even working on it, let alone how to fix it. Good luck. If anything works for me I will let you know.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hi I found Microsoft technicians not helpful at all-they have specific protocols to follow which costs the user time ,which is not helpful if you are a busy professional.</p>
<p>I took my PC to an Independent IT company/small business as I do not have hours to spare rectifying/troubleshooting issues&nbsp;which are a result of the upgrade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It did cost me approx. £50.00 but it was worth it especially as he offers an excellent follow up&nbsp;.</p>

            <p>I upgraded from XPpro to windows 10 about 3 weeks ago.</p>
<p>Windows 10 is rubbish, microsoft should have sorted the problems before it was launched.</p>
<p>My pc constantly reboots on startup every time.</p>
<p>I get --</p>
<p>unexpected kernal mode trap.</p>
<p>page fault nonpaged area.</p>
<p>driver IRQL.</p>
<p>critical process died.</p>
<p>IRQL not equal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I havent a clue what they mean, I just have to keep retyping my password and the process starts again and again. Eventually I can use my pc and emails etc, but after 30 mins approx it shuts down again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did Microsoft bother? why not upgrade windows XP to XP mk2?</p>
<p>Should I have upgraded to windows 7 instead?</p>
<p>Perhaps 8.1? but I think that is for laptops?</p>
<p>NOT HAPPY.</p>

            <p>Please clarify that although your user is an Administrator you actually launched Powershell by right-clicking on the .exe and selecting the "Run as Administrator" option.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do so even if your user is an Admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Does your user have access permissions for a folder similar to this on your machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\USERNAME-xxxx\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsStore_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Error code 0x80070005 is also known as "ACCESS DENIED." It usually occurs when you lack file or registry permissions that are required to install the update.

            What is Drive E:?&nbsp; Have you searched the install media to see if the file is on it or exists?<br />
<br />
Do you have any Setup.exe that you can right-click on and choose the "Run As Administrator" option that will be accessible if you right-click?<br />
<br />
Have you tried temporarily disabling any running security programs such as Anti Virus or Defender?<br />
<br />
Type %temp% in the Start Run box and delete all the files in your Temporary folder that Windows will allow you to do so.&nbsp; Run the Disk Cleanup tool also, especially choose any box that has Office Setup files listed, plus all the temporary files you can and
 let the tool clean up your hard drive.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Kik messenger</h2>
                    Hi there<br />
I would like to ask if Kik messenger will be available for downloading on Windows phone 8.1 and 10 any time soon? Because currently it isn't available. Is it only available for downloading on Android and iOS phones now? Also, i stopped receiving push notifications
 a month ago. I even tried to reinstall the app, but it didn't change anything.

            Abdul, Than you for your time and sharing your knowledge. &nbsp;I deleted the icon for (copy 1)in the control panel, but still couldn't print because the setting in most applications is to print to the original, not a copy. &nbsp;I changed that to copy 2, and now

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/514ca2c0-38e4-4b49-b505-fcec81531a9b" title="SofiaGoddess">
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question 1</strong>: <em>when purchasing a Skype number and someone leaves a message, is there an additional fee for the minutes used when the person leaves a message ?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Answer</strong>: No, there isn't any additional charges when the caller leaves a message as voice messaging is a free feature. Voice messaging is activated automatically when a user purchases an unlimited subscription or a Skype Number.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Question 2</strong>:<em> I am wondering if there are any additional charges to get a Skype number. &nbsp;or if everything is included within the payment of the subscription of 1, 3 or 12 months.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Answer</strong>: The cost of a Skype Number subscription varies depending on which country you want the Skype Number for and how long the subscription lasts
<em>(3 or 12 months). </em>You can check the cost when you go to the <strong><a href="http://www.skype.com/go/store.buy.skypein" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get a Skype Number</a></strong> webpage.

<h2>            Japanese Input on Win7 appears as in tiny floating window instead of in the document</h2>
                    I recently got a new laptop from my company. &nbsp;We are standardized on Win7. On my previous laptop, I set up Japanese input. &nbsp;After a lot of trial and error, I got it to work (albeit with a lot of keystrokes just to change between English and Japanese input.)
 On my new laptop also with Win7, I set up a Japanese keyboard, and it works BUT now Japanese does not appear in the document, but appears in a small obnoxious "floating screen" which is really difficult to read (and quite unnecessary.) Once the character is
 selected, it is then placed in the document! Very primitive and ugly! &nbsp;And why this method? &nbsp;Why can't it just appear in the document? &nbsp;Nowhere in any setting is there any option for changing the input from "floating box" to "document." &nbsp;I've spent hours trying
 to figure this out - and can't understand how the exact same Windows OS works differently on two different computers (same brand even!) &nbsp;The current Japanese input method is so bad I just

            <p>Thanks for your response!!! &nbsp;I'm not sure I understand your first question, "How are you accessing documents?". &nbsp;The Japanese text is supposed to be activated within any document, just as typing Roman letter text.　You are suppose to be able to switch back
 and forth. On a Mac, it is seamless. &nbsp;You just hit CMD-SHIFT and go right into another language. &nbsp;On Windows, it is more complicated, but ultimately, the same. &nbsp;例えば、ここで和文文字を簡単に書いてある。I can go in and out of Japanese (or any other writing system.) In this case,
 it seems to be a problem with WORD and OUTLOOK. &nbsp;Foreign Language Input works the way it is supposed to in PPT and Excel, NotePad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps...</p>

Thanks so much!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and we will provide the information required to help you resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Age of Empire 3 is made for Windows XP operating system, if you want to run the game in Windows 10 the game latest release of the game should at lease be made to run on Windows 7 or 8.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having stated so, I would suggest that you check if the system requirement meet that of Windows 10. If the specifications of the game is meant for XP you will not be able to assure that the game will run even in Compatibility Mode</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t turn off display or sleep because of USB device</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 10 install will not turn off display or sleep because of 2 USB devices.</p>
<p>I have around 10 USB devices, and I have worked out that it is my Thrustmaster Warthog HOTAS joystick and throttle that are preventing the system to turn off display and sleep.</p>
<p>If I turn those off then everything is OK.</p>
<p>Any suggestions, or is this a bug?</p>

            Hey imacken,
<br />
<br />I'm here to help. Yeah, that's weird, but we can try overriding them in powercfg, if you haven't crossed that path yet.
<br />
<br />Can you perform the following? Be sure that your devices are enabled and on.
<br />
<br />Go to Start, look for cmd, right-click Command Prompt, Run as administrator, then enter the following: powercfg /energy
<br />
<br />It will generate a new energy efficiency problems report. After that, I'd like for you to send me C:\Windows\System32\energy-report.html through <a href="http://expirebox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://expirebox.com</a>
<br />
<br />Once you've uploaded the file, please let me know and copy and paste the download link under the box Download-Link in the confirmation page once you've uploaded it.
<br />
<br />Let me know.

            imacken,
<br />
<br />Thank you very much for your time and patience, I think I might have come up with a potential solution. Go to Start, type in Edit power plan, then click Edit power plan.
<br />
<br />Go into Change advanced power settings in the new window (this will overwrite settings in your new plan, so if this is not your power plan, click Cancel and choose the right one! You can restore plan defaults later, as you will see, should you choose to) then you should see a new dialog box with the tab named Advanced settings. Under USB settings, then USB selective suspend setting, change that setting to Enabled.
<br />
<br />Any power plan you change to in the future may not have this setting on, so you should keep that in mind in the future.
<br />
<br />You also have experienced this error: Platform Power Management Capabilities: ACPI _PSD Object Failed Validation
<br />
<br />You may need to update your BIOS or UEFI system firmware, which is what Microsoft recommends. You can find new system firmware updates in your manufacturer's support page.

<p>Hi, thanks for that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had already tried changing the USB selective suspend setting. It made no difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue is new to the 1803 build - both the Insider Preview one and the public release. On 1709 and prior, this did not happen.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />Ouch, that's not good.
<br />
<br />Have you tried going to Device Manager, and to go through these devices one-by-one in the Power Management tab just to enable "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" and disable "Allow this device to wake the computer"?
<br />
<br />If this also doesn't do it, can you run an administrator Command Prompt session and enter the following, and tell me what you get?: powercfg -lastwake OR powercfg /lastwake
<br />
<br />I greatly appreciate your patience, please keep me posted.

            imacken,
<br />
<br />Thanks for the information. When you first set it up (it's alright if you don't remember, must've been a while ago), have you let Windows install the driver or did you use accompanying media or go on their website to install the drivers?
<br />
<br />Here it says that the firmware update for the Warthog was made back in 2014, so this could be no good, but maybe reinstall it just to be certain? <a href="https://support.thrustmaster.com/en/product/hotaswarthog-en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.thrustmaster.com/en/product/hot...</a>
<br />
<br />Also, in this forum thread here, it seems to be an issue with the Thrustmaster line of products, and it hasn't been fixed yet, or just happened to start with the release of 1709 or 1803: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings-winpc/screensaver-and-sleep-mode-not-working-with-game/32299fb3-55ab-45b5-9813-48a9bfeda6cf">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />One final thing you should consider is rolling back to 1709, and wait for 1803 to smooth itself out through cumulative updates and patches. If you'd like to do this, hit Windows key + I together to go into Windows Settings. Go into Update &amp; Security. On the left pane, click Recovery. Under "Go back to the previous version of Windows 10", click Get started, and see if this issue would persist in that version.
<br />
<br />Above all, you could report this to Microsoft and see if they can do anything about it, since 1803 must've changed something about how it interfaces with your equipment. Hit Windows key + F and file a bug report whenever you have the time.
<br />
<br />Let me know, imacken. If you need any further assistance, I'm a reply away.

<p>The thread you linked to has people with issues using Saitek, XBox controller, Logitech as well as Thrustmaster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People there are saying that ANY HID device causes the issue, and that is not true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Thrustmaster TFlight Pedals, Logitech G27 wheel and XBox controller, and none of them cause the issue. It is only the Thrustmaster Warthog throttle and joystick that cause the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TM TARGET software says the firmware is up to date.</p>

<h2>            BitLocker</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Surface 2&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows updated, machine restarted and would not allow access to computer. I was asked to enter 4 digit code which I obtained from Microsoft. I can now access my one drive from my PC but not from Surface 2. I have a screen which heads as BitLocker and asks
 for key to be entered. This is not the same as given by Microsoft. I can only enter numerical digits and the continue button is greyed out. On inputting any numbers the continue button is still greyed out. Any suggestions on how to resolve this?</p>

    <title>Xbox One&#58; Jeden Tag Passwort eingeben, kein automatisches Anmelden - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gume1970  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One&#58; Jeden Tag Passwort eingeben, kein automatisches Anmelden</h2>
                    <p>Hallo,</p>
<p><br />
ich habe mir erst vor gut drei Monaten eine XBox 360 und XBox One mit gut hundertfünfzig Spielen dazu geholt. Ich bin als alter PC Nutzer einfach zu spät in den Genuß einer Konsole gekommen. Witcher III, Fallout 4: Solche Titel (und mehr) lassen sich (für mich) auch gut und bequem am großen TV spielen.</p>
<p><br />
PROBLEM: Kein Kinect oder so: Jeden Tag muss ich beim Einschalten der XBox mein Passwort neu eingeben um mich anzumelden. Ich habe die "automatische Anmeldung" auch aktiviert. Auch alle paar Tage geht das Gerät gar nicht erst online. Das ist mehr als nervig.</p>
<p>HILFE ALSO: Ich habe kein Kinect, Netzwerk ist wireless und läuft absolut stabil. Das einzige, was ich mache: Ich schalte habe die Konsole auf "langsames hochfahren" eingestellt, also kein Stromsparen. Ich verstehe und habe es so herausgelsen, dass die Konsole nun im HIntergrund auch abgeschaltet ist, also weder etwas herunterlädt noch groß arbeitet. PUNKT DAZU: Alles an Entertainment hängt bei mir an einem einzigen Ausschalter. Ich trenne die Konsole also, irgendwann Nachts oder wenn ich tage nicht im Haus bin, zusammen mit TV und Musikanlage komplett vom Strom. Liegt es daran?</p>
<p><br />
Ich möchte das Ding ungerne ewig "Standby" laufen lassen. Ich habe sonst hier in der Zweitwohnung kein Gerät standby laufen, schalte von BluRayPlayern bis Fernseher alles eben mit einem Schalter an, wenn ich hier bin und nutze die Geräte ab und an.</p>

            <p>mmmmhm....vielleicht mal die Konsole zurücksetzen (oder erst nur den Account runterwerfen weil wenn du die Konsole zurücksetzt, dann wird alles gelöscht - Speicherstände sollten in der Cloud gespeichert werden, wenn du aber digitale Spiele gekauft hast, dann musst du die neu runterladen und das kann je nach Leitung dauern.) und den Account neu hinzufügen mit automatischer Anmeldung und Passwort speichern~</p>
<p>Weil eigentlich sollte es auch klappen wenn du die Konsole vom Strom nimmst.</p>

<p>Hallo,</p>
<p>vom Strom genommen habe ich die Konsole des öfteren schon. Und so gesehen: ist ein Abschalten des Hauptschalters ja nichts anderes. Den Account habe ich auch schon einmal gelöcht und wieder hinzugefügt. Komplett neu aufsetzen: Ich habe hier DSL 3000, da
 dauern die vier erstandenen un 10 XBox360 Spiele eine Ewigkeit.</p>
<p>Okay, schade. Das ist mir zu nervig, dann wird das Ding verschenkt und ich schwenke in Richtung Playstation. Ist zwar nur eine Kleinigkeit (!) aber jeden Morgen oder jeden Abend, für 30 Minuten Minecraft oder schnell Fallout etwas schauen wollen: einschalten,
 warten, noch mehr warten, anmelden, Passwort eingeben, wieder zurück, ...</p>
<p>Wirklich nervig.</p>
<p>Danke Euch, dann weg mit dem Ding. Dank umfangreicher Software (Witcher 3 GOTY, Dutzende andere) sehe ich da gute Chancen.
</p>
<p>G.</p>

            <p>Naja...und was machst du wenn du bei der Playstation auf ein Problem triffst?</p>
<p>Auf Nintendo umschwenken?</p>
<p>Nvidia? (Android)</p>
<p>Und dann?</p>
<p>Es ist kein globales oder dauerhaftes Problem sondern eher ein lokales~ und dürfte wie gesagt sich erledigen wenn du den Account nochmal richtig einrichtest (im Zweifel auf einer sauberen Konsole)~</p>

<p>Schmunzel: das Problem ist einfach störend. Auch, wenn meine Frau an die Kosole möchte (Minecraft), muss sie zuerst mein Passwort eingeben, dann auf ihren Account wechseln und Ihr Passwort auch noch eingeben. Das liest sich einfach. Aber macht das jedes
 Mal mit dem Gamepad. Das stoppt einfach. Es ist kein Problem für mich, Ihr mein Passwort zu geben. Nur ist das irgendwie nicht der Sinn, oder?</p>
<p>Ich habe das Gerät zum entspannten Spielen geholt, nicht, um jedes Mal ein Passwort einzugeben. Für mich hat das Gerät meine Anspruch nicht erfüllt. Und dabei komme ich noch aus Zeiten von 8bit Rechnern: mich beeindruckt also Grafik, Spielerlebnis durchaus,
 ohen das ich die üblichen, übersättigten "Zockeransprüche" stelle.</p>
<p>Es bliebe mir somit wirklich nur: Komplett neu aufsetzen. Also Reset, Werkseinstellungen. Vermute ich. AUA!</p>
<p>Jeder Titel bedeutet etliche Gigabyte herunterzuladen nach der Installation = Update. Gigabyteweise, weil es einfach bequemer ist für die Hersteller, texturen zu ersetzen, statt zu optimieren. Und jedes Spiel für die 360, das ich bewusst auch gewählt habe,
 müsste ich noch einmal herunterladen. Das ist zeitlich...</p>
<p>...einfach zu viel (hier) und nicht mein Ziel, sorry. Bedeutet: Durch den Umstand, mich nicht einloggen zu können, würde ich wieder etliche Tage mit herunterladen verbringen, das Ding stupide laufen lassen, tagelang. Ehrlich?</p>
<p>Sorry, bei Eurer Zuneigung zu dem Gerät: Das kann es auch nicht sein.</p>
<p>Da kann man natürlich spotten: Was als nächstes. Keine Frage ! ;)</p>
<p>Aber sorry: ich habe zwei Ansprüche:</p>
<p>- muss laufen</p>
<p>- und bitte keine zig Gigabyte erneut laden.</p>
<p>Beides wird nicht erfüllt, also erfüllt das Gerät keine Nutzbarkeit für mich. Mit abertausender DSL Superleitung mag das für jemanden anders aussehen. Schnell mal aufsetzen, 800 GB laden in der Mittagspause. Hier ist das so: nicht tragbar.</p>
<p>Ich hoffe, Ihr versteht, warum das Ding so gesehen nur Technikschrott ist.</p>
<p>ZWEITE MÖGLICHKEIT: Ich kaufe mir einfach noch eine XBox One zum testen. Würde gehen, wäre eine Lösung. Nur: sorry: auch das kann es nicht sein.
</p>
<p>Ich stehe hier auch vor der Ungewissheit: Ist es das dann? War es das? Lohnt sich der Aufwand? Zu Beginn habe ich die Konsole in den ersten Tagen mit zwei, drei Spielen (Black Flag, etc) dreimal neu aufgesetzt. Also das wurde schon zweimal erledigt. Nicht
 akut aber auch schon. Und den Account mit Problemen habe ich entfernt und wieder neu eingerichtet.</p>
<p>Es sind auf dem Gerät zwei Accounts: Der meiner Frau und meiner. Sie nutzt das "Ding" nur eine Stunde am Wochenende, wenn wir hier mal in der Ferien- / Zweitwohnung sind für Minecraft. Ich würde gerne Fallout 4 ab und an abends, wenn Zeit eine halbe Stunde
 weiterspielen. ;) </p>
<p>Die 360, also das veraltetet Gerät läuft nat. auf Grund der verglichen einfachen Architektur absolut rund. Mit gut 30 installierten Spielen. (Nicht, dass ich die alle gleichzeitig spielen will. Aber ich mag es: die DVD einlegen und loslegen zu können).</p>
<p>Genau das würde ich auch von der "One" erwarten. (!) So gesehen "hakt" es also bei mir, immer noch oder immer wieder oder generell.
</p>
<p>Ich hoffe, Ihr versteht, was ich als Anspruch setze.</p>
<p>Ich habe heute eine PS4 testweise erhalten. Das Ding ist LAUT. Wirklich LAUT im Vergleich. Auch solche Kleinigkeiten waren / sind mir wichtig gewesen. Keine Option.
</p>
<p>Würde das Ding ab und an hängen bleiben, abstürzen oder verzögern: Mit so etwas kann ich locker leben. Das wäre nur ab und an. Dies hier ist permanent. Das eine wäre unangenehm, dies hier ist störend.</p>
<p>Bin also ratlos. Lösung bleibt nur: Zwietgerät erstellen, testen, nochmal schauen und das jetzige Gerät ggf. behalten. Weil: hunderte GB laden dauern hier viele Tage. Nicht, das ich das müsste: aber wie bei der 360: ich mag es gerne, die Spiele bereit zu
 haben. Im Laufe der letzten Wochen habe ich das DIng immer mal laufen lassen, saß ich im Büro. So gut vier Wochen, bis alles auf dem aktuiellen Stand und installiert war. Einfach zu viel Zeitaufwand hier mit DSL 10.000.</p>

<p>TECHNISCHE FRAGE ALSO:</p>
<p>wenn ich beide (!) Accounts entferne, also lösche, der meiner Frau und meinen, herunterfahren und neu starten lassen:</p>
<p>bleiben da die Downloads / Titel aktuell enthalten? &nbsp;Spielstände liegen ja in der Cloud. Hoffe ich zum.
</p>
<p>Dann würde ich das noch einmal versuchen. Also ohne absolut zurückzusetzen.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Zur technischen Frage:</p>
<p>Wenn du die Accounts löschst - Dann bleiben die Spiele auf der Konsole gespeichert.</p>
<p>Was du auch machen könntest:</p>
<p>Externe Festplatte (mit min. 256GB Speicher und USB3.0) anschließen - Spiele darauf kopieren - Konsole zurücksetzen.</p>
<p>Und auch wenn es dir nicht passt - Sowas kann halt passieren~</p>

<p>Externe Platte: DIE Lösung. Natürlich, das kann ich machen. Platten liegen hier genügende herum. Ich hatte nur nie ein Menü unter "Verwalten" gefunden zum verschienben. Klar: Wenn nur eine (!) Platte herumliegt ;)</p>
<p>DAS werde ich probieren: Zuerst beide Accounts löschen, dann ggf. kopieren.</p>
<p>Auf die einfachen Lösungen komme ich gar nicht mehr. Wenn das so ideal funktioniert, alsp "Spiel verschieben", ähnlich der 360 (auf der ich auch alles, was möglich, gesichterh habe), dann setze ich das um.</p>
<p>KLASSE, Danke.</p>

            <p><strong><span>Hi scunnybabe,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community Forums.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You have an issue with arrows being displayed on the thumbnails on the computer.
</span><span>It can be difficult when something that is important to you does not work as expected. It is pretty simple and we are here to help you fix the issue. We will work as a team and get
 this sorted out.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>Please answer these questions-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the color or arrow? Is it green in color?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>version</span></span></a> of Windows installed
 on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this issue occur on all the thumbnails on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have Norton 360 installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I would like more information regarding the issue.</span></p>
<p><i><span>Note: Assuming that you are running Windows 7, I will be suggesting common troubleshooting steps.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>This issue generally is seen on computers running Norton. I would be suggesting a fix for the issue assuming
 that you have Norton installed on the computer.</span></i></p>
<p>Method 1-</p>
<p><span>Step 1-</span></p>
<p><span>I would have you check if the issue persists in Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link-</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Note: Make sure you log back into Normal Mode after following all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Proceed to Step 2, if the issue does not occur in Safe Mode.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Step 2-</p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to perform a
</span><span>Clean Boot.</span><span><br />
<br />
Placing the computer in a </span><span>Clean Boot</span><span> state helps in identifying if
</span><span>any third party applications</span><span> or
</span><span>startup items</span><span> are causing the issue. You need to perform the steps from the article</span><span>-</span><span><br />

<p><span>Note</span><span>: You need to follow
</span><span>Step</span><span>
</span><span>3</span><span> from the article to get the computer back to
</span><span>Normal Startup</span><span> after performing all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Method 2-</p>
<p>I would have you perform the steps to clear the thumbnail cache-</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Navigate to the path-</p>
<p><strong><span>Start</span></strong><span>&gt;
<strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>&gt;
<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong>&gt;
<strong><span>System Tools&gt; Disk Cleanup</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Check “Thumbnails” and click on “ok”.</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong><span>
<em><span>Notice the size of your thumbnail cache. The more you navigate, the bigger it can get.</span></em></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on “delete files” and then restart the computer and check.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Method 3-</p>
<p>Perform the steps only if; you have Norton installed on the computer-</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open Norton and then select “settings”.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Uncheck the box next to “Backup status indicators” and click on “close”.</p>
<p>

    <title>How to Optimize Windows 10 System Reserved Partition - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to Optimize Windows 10 System Reserved Partition</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP laptop with Windows 7 on it. I have upgrade to Windows 10 about a 6-8 months ago. Now, I am noticing poor performance. Since then off and on I defragmented my hard disk drive C only. However, recently I noticed that System Reserve is showing
 100% defragmented even though my C drive shows 0% defrag. &nbsp;It does not allow me to defrag System Reserve. I read so many articles on line but failed to obtain a clear answer from anyone. Everyone talks about defragmenting Drive C only.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I Optimize Windows 10 System Reserved Partition</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be really appreciated. Need your help</p>

            <p><strong><em>How do I Optimize Windows 10 System Reserved Partition</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not need to optimise a System Reserved partition. A System Reserved partition only contains the Recovery Tools image and related files.&nbsp; It is only accessed when recovery operations are initiated or&nbsp; for boot operations, and fragmentation&nbsp;has no significance&nbsp;I
 suggest you leave it alone. </p>

            <p>Gerry,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your advise. The System Drive Partition was never 100% fragmented before with my PC when it was running on Window 7. All problems started with 6-moths after I updated operating system to Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to defrag this drive &nbsp;if I need to in the future. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, &nbsp;suggest why my PC is performing so slow day by day. I almost stalls when I have 7-8 tabs open at the same time along with my Yahoo e-mail. Read lots of article on line trying to figure out hoe to speed up my PC. There are some recommendation to download
 some programs to clean the registry and &nbsp;the PC overall. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a better and safe that you know to improve the performance of my PC? Appreciate your guidance and feeback. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not being so savvy about the&nbsp;computer, I unsuccessfully tried my best to insert screenshots per instruction provided in the link but with no results. Hence, I decided to type it in the numbers&nbsp;that you may be looking for... see below.</p>
<p>Windows 10 on my computer is 64 bit. The RAM memory is 4 MB (2 x 2MB in pairs) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hardware Reserved- 203 MB &nbsp; &nbsp;In Use - 2350 MB &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Modified- 33 MB &nbsp; &nbsp;Standby- 1468 MB &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Free- 34 MB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Available- 1502 MB</p>
<p>Cache- 1503 MB</p>
<p>Total- 3893 MB</p>
<p>Installed- 4096 MB</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try again to send you a screenshot for what you are looking for. I can not paste screen shots right in this box. I took screenshots and copied them to a word document then try to insert here. It did not work. How do I insert the screenshot in here.
 It says it has to be a JPG file to upload and add an&nbsp;image in this block. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
