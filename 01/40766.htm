<p>The Doctor speaks the truth. &nbsp;If you are ever trying to get through a level in COD (especially a stealth mission), stay close to the AI teammate. &nbsp;Is this the part where you turn to look left and there are enemies? &nbsp;Then a helicopter comes?</p>

            This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

            Hi Joseph.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What are you trying to do when this happens?  We need to know everything your'e doing, not just the resulting error.  
<br />
<br />1) Run the WIndows Store apps troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />2) Reset the Windows Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><span>USB Tool Bootsec - 32 Bit
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>﻿</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you bought Windows 7 from the MS Store:</span></p>
<p>
To make the USB device bootable, you need to run a tool named bootsect.exe. In some cases, this tool needs to be downloaded from your Microsoft Store account. This may happen if you're trying to create a 64-bit bootable USB device from a 32-bit version of Windows.
 To download bootsect:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
&nbsp;<span>Login to your </span><a href="https://store.microsoft.com/account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Microsoft Store account</span></a><span>
 to view your purchase history</span></li><li>
&nbsp;<span>Look for your Windows 7 purchase.
</span></li><li>
&nbsp;<span>Next to Windows 7, there is an "Additional download options" drop-down menu.</span></li><li>
&nbsp;<span>In the drop-down menu, select "32-bit ISO."
</span></li><li>
&nbsp;<span>Right-click the link, and then save the bootsect.exe file to the location where you installed the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool (e.g. C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Apps\Windows 7 USB DVD Download
 Tool).</span></li><li>
&nbsp;<span>Once the file has been saved, go back to the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download tool to create your bootable USB device.
<br />
</span></li></ol>
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you didn't buy Windows 7 from the MS Store:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1) Download and install the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool program as indicated on theMicrosoft Store web site.
<br />
<br />
2) Download a working 32-bit version of bootsect.exe . Below is a link to 32 bit bootsect.exe:<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/attachments/installation-setup/47060d1263222191-32-bit-bootsect-bootsect7600x86.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/attachments/installation-setup/47060d1263222191-32-bit-bootsect-bootsect7600x86.zip</a><br />
&nbsp;From: <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/installation-setup/54443-32-bit-bootsect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/installation-setup/54443-32-bit-bootsect.html </a><br />
<br />
3) Once downloaded, copy the BootSect.exe file to the same folder that includes the installed Windows7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool.exe file. The default install directory of that file in Windows Vista isC:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Apps\Windows 7 USB DVD Download
 Tool\ (you'll need to look for it in XP)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4) Run the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool application as indicated on theMicrosoft Store web site. The end result will give you a bootable USB flash drive that contains everything you need to install the 64-bit version of Windows 7.<br />

<h2>            Xbox one smartglass and IOS</h2>
                    So I have the xbox one smartglass app on my iPhone 5 and whenever I try to connect withy xbox, it doesn't find it even though they are on the same network. I have retried for days now and it's simply frustrating. Also, when using the smartglass app on
 my laptop, it works perfectly fine so I would like to know why it isn't working on my iPhone 5 and what is being done about it. Thanks

<p>Sorry you are having trouble connecting your iPhone 5 @robrulesall2. &nbsp;Since your tablet is able to connect, that is a good sign (and I assume you installed the Xbox One SmartGlass app verses the 360 SmartGlass app on your iPhone as well).</p>
<p>The SmartGlass FAQ has a number of suggestions for trying to resolve connectivity issues:</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4274/t/1628885.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../1628885.aspx</a></p>
<p>One thing to try is to disable the cellular data on your iPhone to ensure the device is only communicating over your home wifi network. &nbsp;Also double check that it is connecting to the exact same wifi access point as your laptop. &nbsp;We have seen some people's
 devices are connecting to the "guest" network on their wifi router and the guest network has wifi isolation enabled by default which prevents devices connecting on that SSID from talking to each other.</p>
<p>@Dun28, in your case it sounds like you can connect your SmartGlass app to your Xbox One but not all functionality is working. &nbsp;In your case, please unplug the power cord from the Xbox One for like 20 seconds then power it back up. &nbsp;Kill your SmartGlass
 app and re-launch it. &nbsp;Full functionality should be back. &nbsp;We are working on a fix for this occasional issue, but until we get it released, a hard power reboot (or using "energy savings" power setting instead of "instant on") is needed to get everything functional
 again. &nbsp;Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>

    <title>Console stuck in restart loop after initiating download - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> muffin of doom5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Console stuck in restart loop after initiating download</h2>
                    
<p>I posted about this in another thread, but I'll copy/paste the important part here:</p>
<p>"Every time I try download a game (or anything other than an update, for that matter) my system gets caught in an infinite restart loop. I've found that I can quickly open my active downloads when my console starts and cancel anything I have downloading,
 so I can still use my system, but I am unable to get any more games or media. In particular, I'm trying to get AC2 from the Free Games for Gold deal, but every time I start the download I'm caught up in this issue.</p>
<p>I've had the problem for several weeks, but until now all I had to do to get it to work was delete my cache and any corrupted data (which everything I tried to download was after my system crashed) and I would be able to download what I wanted maybe 25%
 of the time.</p>
<p>Now I don't know what to delete anymore, and I'm getting a little frustrated with the lack of information on this matter. I've had an Xbox since they launched, switching over to a 360 S when my old one got past it's prime. I've never encountered a problem
 like this before."</p>
<p>Since I posted that, the problem has gotten worse. The console restarts before I can even load up my guide menu or sign out. As of five minutes ago it's started to go into the restart loop without me being signed into a profile, which it's never done before
 and severely hampers any effort on my end to do much. I've removed my hard drive and the console seems to be working all right without it, but I'm left without everything I had on the hard drive. I realize that this change may mean that I'm posting on the
 wrong part of the site, but it originated with downloading. I believe it started around the time I downloaded Fable 3, when it was free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and when it restarts, I can hear a click and soft whirring from the console right beforehand, when it freezes up.</p>
<p>I realize I have a bit of a block of text, so thank you for reading this and for any assistance possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm going to assume here that you have a hard drive. Now what happens when you <strong>
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">remove this hard drive from your console</a></strong>&nbsp;and use a secondary storage device like a USB Flash Drive (enough to store at least one game for this test that's been giving
 you this issue).<br />
<br />
I suspect that if the console is restarting when it's attempting to download something, it's because of the hard drive, this also seems to be further confirmed by you stating that you can delete items and make the hard drive have less data so it doesn't keep
 doing this sort of thing. It's quite possible that you have a bad hard drive on your hand causing this trouble.<br />
<br />
Doing the above can help us to see if this is in fact the case.</p>

<p>I took my hard drive out and downloaded the system update so I could get on Live. I don't have any flash drives around that I want to format with the 360, but I started the download for an arcade title's demo on the memory unit. It seems to be downloading
 just fine, so I'm afraid you might be right. </p>

<p>You can continue to test my theory out by downloading something larger than an arcade game. Something around the 3-7GB mark should prove to be optimal for a test (Fable 3 which you should have in your download history, or perhaps Assassin's Creed II). If
 you're able to download anything larger without an issue, then I'd say it's your hard drive that's causing you this problem.</p>

<p>I'll see what I can find in terms of a flash drive to test this on, but I don't have anything at the moment that I could use. Assuming it's my hard drive, though, do you have any advice on what to do in order to get my data transferred to another, or is
 it too late at this juncture?</p>

<p>You can certainly attempt to copy your saved games, and that's honestly all I'd copy. Everything else you've purchased can always be re-downloaded for free. The only reason I say this is because you don't actually know what's specifically caused this to
 happen in the first place. It's safest to only take the valuable data and download everything else that you're playing or need to play later from your download history.</p>

<p>I seem to have the same issue. &nbsp;Xbox 360 Slim console started a restart loop after I started download of FREE Crackdown game. &nbsp;I pulled the hard drive, cancelled the download and it stopped the restart loop. &nbsp;Reinserted HD and everything is fine. &nbsp;Attemped
 the D/L of Crackdown again the the restart loop happened again. &nbsp;This HD isn't that old either. &nbsp;Is there something else to try before replacing the HD?</p>

<p>ECereal, you're not alone. I still have this exact same problem on my big brother's Xbox 360 4GB slim. It keeps restarting after initiating download of Crackdown full game on the upgraded 250GB hard drive. Fortunately, I was able to resolve the issue quickly
 by cancelling the download on the active downloads section from Xbox Guide. Following on Hassassinade's theory, I deleted 5.61GB of Fable III and proceeded to re-download the game from my download history. So far, there is no infinite restart loop during the
 download process. I believe the hard drive is not the only issue. There is definitely something wrong with the Xbox Live servers.</p>

            Hi Ray Abel,<br />
<br />
Windows 10 automatically downloads and installs updates to make sure your device is up to date. You can set active hours to let us know when you're usually using your PC to help prevent inconvenient restarts. You can follow the steps in this

<br />
Should you have further queries, feel free to post it.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail Table</h2>
                    <p>When I open Windows 10 Mail app I get this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"A TABLE IN THIS DOCUMENT HAS BECOME CORRUPTED"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option I have is to click OK.&nbsp; This happens every time I open the mail app, regardless if I have mail or not.</p>

<p>This is not an answer, the update says that it is recommended&nbsp;and it installed fine on my laptop but wont install on my Desktop and your saying to hide it without giving any explanation. There seems to be quite a few people with this problem and cant do&nbsp;a
 manual install because it says its NOT APPLICABLE. Does anyone actually know whats going wrong or do you hide every update that fails?</p>

    <title>Redirecting sound to connected devices - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Redirecting sound to connected devices</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to have Windows 7, and whenever I connected a new device (i.e. speakers or the TV through a HDMI) it would automatically redirect the sound to that device. Unfortunately this isn't happening for me on Windows 10. I have to manually go into the sound
 settings and set the device I wish to use as default, which is tedious. I was wondering if there was a way to automatically redirect the sound?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

            <p>Hi Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have caused due to any compatibility issues with the Audio drivers. I suggest you to try installing the Audio drivers in compatibility mode and check if the issue persists. This is to check if this is caused due to any compatibility issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following Windows 8.1 article to install the Audio drivers in compatibility mode. The steps apply to Windows 10 as well.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 clean installation - boot loop after logo shown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 clean installation - boot loop after logo shown</h2>
                    <p>Hello.<br />
The problem is I can't install Windows 10.<br />
This is what happened.<br />
I've been using Windows 10 as an insider since the beginning of the world, and around 10074 it got a bit buggy.<br />
<br />
Reinstalled to 10130, through an ISO, so a clean installation. <br />
Then I couldn't update anymore. The actualization downloaded, installed, but then, on restart, an error happened and so it reverted, being stuck at 10130 forever. The error I was getting was
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-windows_install/error-0xc1900101-0x20017-when-installing-windows/8631668d-1924-4259-8280-494f9f94f8b3?page=7" title="Error 0xC1900101">
0xC1900101 error</a>. Signed up on that thread, found no solution. Again, it was not because of any drivers, it was a clean installation.<br />
<br />
When Win 10 opened to the public, I downloaded the ISO, tried to install (USB, using the official Microsoft software for creating USB isos). Here it began. When I inserted the USB, it showed up the blue Windows logo, for like 20 seconds. Then reboot. Continuously
 rebooting until ejecting the USB.<br />
<br />
So I wiped Windows, patched it with an Ubuntu. This one worked fine, no errors, nothing.<br />
Later downloaded the Win 10 again, this time the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Enterprise</span> edition. Burned to flash (again, official burning software), and ended up with the same situation.<br />
Which means, it can't be a driver error (as they say on 0xC1900101 error thread), because it was Ubuntu.<br />
<br />
<strong>When I insert the USB into the computer, the Windows logo shows up for like 20 seconds and then then computer restarts. No error, no message.</strong></p>
<p><br />
*All the versions before worked just fine.<br />
<br />
My rig is Gigabyte Z87X OC, Pentium G3258. Graphics GTX 750 Ti. No SSD.<br />
<br />
Also tried messing with the BIOS, changing all the buttons, settings, and so on. Nothing helped.<br />
<br />
Please, Microsoft, respect the time I invested into this.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Tomas,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand the inconvenience that you are experiencing. I will definitely assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try the simple troubleshooting and check if it helps to resolve the issue. Follow the below method information provided.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to connect the power cable and try to install the Windows and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persist try the below method.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to run check disk on the hard drive to see if there are any corruptions.&nbsp;<br />
Follow the below steps:&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Windows</span></strong><span>&nbsp;key +&nbsp;</span><strong><span>X</span></strong><span>, click&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin).</span></strong></li><li><span>In the&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Command Prompt</span></strong><span>, type the following command, and then press&nbsp;</span><strong><span>ENTER</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
</span><strong><span>chkdsk /f</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p><span><strong><span>Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: While performing check disk on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found then check disk will try to repair that sector. Any data available on a bad sector might be lost.</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Once Check Disk completes, boot the computer and then check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persist, I recommend you to update BIOS driver. Contact the system manufacturer to get BIOS driver updated and let us know the status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Disclaimer:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft
 cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.</span></span></p>

    <title>Dark Theme incomplete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardevans80231  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dark Theme incomplete</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an observation on Microsoft's incomplete implementation of the Dark Theme. I hope by raising this issue enough people will agree that Microsoft will correct the fault in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have eyesight problems, specifically my eyes do not adjust to bright light. Thus, looking at a computer screen with all that white is painful. I switched on the dark theme, and I have my monitor's brightness, contrast and colour temp turned down. Together
 these have helped considerably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there are still windows that do not implement the dark theme. Whilst I understand that Microsoft has no control over individual developer's implementation of a dark theme. It does have control over the windows it implements. Yet, to use a
 specific example, the File Explorer does not implement the dark theme. Other windows that Microsoft has control over, do not implement it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me this makes using Windows very difficult and painful. I would be grateful if the Dark Theme could be extended, optionally or not, to all the windows in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely R A Evans</p>

            I would love this as my eyes are very light sensitive as well. &nbsp;It is actually painful to use file explorer and the fact that this is not included in the Fall Creators Update along with tabs is shocking given how much feedback Microsoft has been given.

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 System Repair Disc</h2>
                    <p>Is there a reason why the System Repair disc could not be in the form of a USB key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it silly to have to plug-in an external DVD drive to do the job.</p>

            <div>Welcome to the "new world".. it is a lot easier for tech support to standardize</div>
<div>on this being the first choice. And I personally agree it is a pain in the you</div>
<div>know what to need to reinstall software. It is easier with cloud based stuff</div>
<div>like CC.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you search for "system image backup" or similar, nothing appears, but it IS</div>
<div>possible to take image based snapshots you can restore.</div>

<div>is pretty good for starters. This may serve your needs.</div>

<p>Although I will admit, I am not a fan of the Resident Evil games since Resident Evil 4 due to its " shooting gallery " mechanic as opposed to its roots, which was " I don't have enough ammo, I have to be smart and pick my battles ".</p>

<p>im with digital on this i want 2 &amp; 3 Remade, the earlier games made me a fan of resident evil before they took the evil out and replaced it with action. Out of the &nbsp;4, 5, 6 i liked 5 the most but just had to forget about it supposedly being resident evil,
 i found 6 to be a load of old boots </p>

<p>^ It's not like there's a drought of new games going forward and nobody is forcing you to buy these ports. Let's face it, this is Capcom and they will always try to make a sale rather than go back compat. Resi remasters are making them a pile of money right
 now and so will these 3 games. If it leads to new games and a Resi 7 I'm all for it.</p>
