    <title>Windows Live email 2012 will only send using one account address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steven kiernan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live email 2012 will only send using one account address</h2>
                    <p>Windows Live email 2012 as part of windows 7 essentials (Build 16.4.3528.0331) will only send from one
<del>account</del> address i.e the default <del>account</del> "From" address even though I have the option of using either my Hotmail
<del>account</del> alias address it will only send from the default Live <del>account</del> address. It shows in the sent box as being sent from Hotmail when i choose Hotmail from the drop down menu, but when it is received it always shows as being sent from
 Live mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem only applies to my microsoft emial accounts not the other non MS accounts I have added to windows Live 2012, which send perfectly correctly. I will be grateful if there is a solution (other than changing the default account , which will only
 work by changing it via the online Outlook.com), although I suspect that this is a bug that MS should sort out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you</p>

            <p>I realised, as you could see from my original question that this is because there is one default account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I use the webmail "Outlook .com" with the same email addresses as Windows Live, wich ever I&nbsp; choose, whether it is the default or not then the address in my sent box is the same as the one the person I have sent it to receives. These email addresses
 were set up in Outlook.com and imported/downloaded into Windows live when I downloaded the essentials software a few days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it works correctly in Outlook.com then there is no (good) reason why it should not work correctly in Windows Live, the software being produced by the same company. It is absolute nonsense that I should be given the option to choose when there is not actually
 an option there. It is even worse nonsense that my sent box shows that my email has been sent with my choice when the recipient sees another email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the point of having multiple email addresses&nbsp; and a choice of which one to use if the recipient can only see the default adress. The default can only be changed successfully in Outlook.com although once again there is a false option to do so in Windows
 Live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People like myself have good reasons for using different email addresses, privacy, security and convenience, spring to mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be grateful for a reply which will advise me of a setting which can be changed to resolve this or at least to confirm that it is a fault with MS software/systems and a committtment to repair it.</p>
Thank you,
        </p>

            <p>Please read my posts more carefully. Maybe i am using the wrong terms(download/imported). I did set up each account seperately and i can get it to send hotmail and live mail both correctly but only by changing the default in Outlook.com. I am using Windows
 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever way you look at it to send a hotmail and have it record that it is hotmail in the sent box but have it received in the recipients inbox as live mail and vice versa is plain

            <p>Thank you Ron. You are right of course. However there must be huge numbers of people who don;t realise this, as I didn't, til I discovered, by accident, what was happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When users set up Windows Live email this needs to be made very clear, and, still, under no circumstances, should an emaill be sent using an address the user did not select, without their permissiion or knowledge. That is a definite abuse of the users right
 to control over their emails and raises privacy concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This needs to be escalated and resolved. Either, ideally, Windows Live software should be upgraded so that that functions it appears to offer work, or those functions to choose between MS email adddresses are no longer offered,&nbsp; If the dropdown menu to select
 emaill address to use, were carry an error message when selecting the non default account, warning users that they must change the default account in Outlook.com, before they can use it, that would be just about acceptable also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is no longer an issue for me, personally, as I now know what is happening, but it can potentially cause problems for other users and in turn reflects badly on MS. The ball is now in your/MSs court.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help, Steven Kiernan</p>

 feature introduced instead. However, aliases don't have the same functionality that linked accounts had even though users expect them to. It will for many users be better simply to set up a new account rather than an alias, or use plus accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The linked accounts feature was introduced about the same time as Windows Live Mail, but it wasn't discontinued until long after development of the program had stopped (in 2010). You won't see any changes in this respect. The
<em>Default "From" address</em> notice on&nbsp;Outlook.com's <em>Your email accounts</em> page is quite clear.

<p>When aliases were first introduced, to have the address available in Windows Live Mail, you had to add the address as an account with the main address listed for the login to the server.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Over a year ago when the change was made were you could login to your account using an alias address, the default "From" address was added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it needs to be made more clear.</p>
<p>In the article describing aliases, this statement is made: "You can send email from an alias whether you’re using Outlook.com, a mail app like Outlook or devices such as a phone."</p>
<p>That statement needs to be changed to let people know that the default "From" address may have to be changed for the alias address to actually be used.</p>

<p>try a triple-click or a quad-click.</p>

<h2>            Permanent file loss in Downloads folder.</h2>
                    <p>Hello. This is Daniel here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I'm in an urgent mood right now, because I was planning a Disk Cleanup for my Windows 10 computer, and when I selected the option to delete the downloaded files along with the temporary files, most of the files were "permanently" deleted from the Downloads
 folder, and I can't get them back. I really need a solution to this problem. What can I do to bring back the downloaded files? They were very important to me. Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi Dan
<br />
<br />I'm afraid there is not much we can do.
<br />
<br />You could try performing a system restore to see if it helps.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: rstrui.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />This will start the system restore wizard. Choose a point earlier in time before you initiated Disk Clean up.       
        </p>

            HI Dan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did you check the Recycle Bin?  
<br />
<br />Do you sync those files to OneDrive?  If so it has an online Recycle Bin which keeps them much longer.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Dan
<br />
<br />Depending on how far you chose to go back and the amount of files needed to be restored, it can take some time.
<br />
<br />If it does not work, I would recommend you try using Recuva. 
<br />
<br />Download Recuva | Recover deleted files, free! - CCleaner

            No, System Restore does not restore files, everything but.  
<br />
<br />Please look in the Desktop Recycle Bin, Select all and choose Restore Files.

            But the Recycle Bin didn't show the files the Disk Cleanup removed. Disk Cleanup only permanently deleted most of the files from the Downloads folder. I guess I should try something else to get this situation over with.

            Then you'll likely not be able to recover them.  But let me give you some backup strategies that will give you backups that will help this never happen again.  
<br />
<br />Your files should always be backed up because a hard drive can die at any time without notice.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can sync your Desktop, Documents and Pictures folder in Onedrive using Folder protection, or just drag valuable files into OneDrive folder, offering 5gb free with additional space for cheap: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud in real time so it always has the latest version.  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can manually drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive.  Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>   You can even use the Macrium program to mount and extract files from this image so it can serve as both image and file backup too.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

<p>So, I did the "System Restore" option, and it worked, but in the Downloads folder, it only showed the .ttf font files I recovered, but not the .mp3, .pdf, and other extension files!</p>
<p>

Check Control Panel - Device Manager - Disks&nbsp;- double click on the USB drive - Under Policies tab -

check Optimize for Quick Removal - Apply / OK as needed and reboot.<br />

Hope this helps<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many factors can be involved with the<strong> Unexpected Store Exception </strong>
blue screen error such as a conflict with some third-party software, a faulty RAM, or a hardware failure. To rectify such issue, we'd like to ask a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any changes made on your computer settings prior to this issue?</li><li>Does your computer have the most recent update for Windows 10?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest that you follow the series of steps in this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> which lists some troubleshooting instructions suitable for blue screen errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
        </p>

<p>Regarding the changes, I might have uninstalled some programs that I don't use anymore. And my pc has the most recent update for Win 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is I can <strong>NOT </strong>recreate this error. Seems it happens <em>
<strong>randomly </strong></em>- sometimes when I leave my pc on or when using my pc and similar. The Event Viewer shows some error and critical events. If it would be of any help I will upload it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I would go for a clean installation of Windows 10 but can <strong>not </strong>
afford to lose all my precious files/data. I tried running <em>System File Check </em>
and<em> Checkdisk </em>already with no luck. Checked if Windows apps are correctly installed via Command Prompt and wasn't surprised either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anymore suggestions?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 not letting me use my 2nd hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rohardin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 not letting me use my 2nd hard drive</h2>
                    I upgraded my Windows 7 PC using the Windows 10 upgrade. My PC has two SATA drives in it. One is a 500Gig drive my OS and programs are on, the other is a 4TB drive I use as a data backup and a place to move older file to. After the install I open Windows
 explorer and do not see the 4TB drive. If I go into disk manager I can see the drive with no drive letter assigned and it says it is a healthy GPD drive. All my options in Disk Manager for assigning drive letters formatting and what not are grayed out. MS
 Answer desk had me revert back to Windows 7 (I could see the drive again when I did that) and reinstall Windows 10. As you may have guessed if you do the same thing twice and expect different results, that's insanity. I still can't access my drive. Any ideas?

            <p>I appreciate the response even though it didn't fix my issue. After I tried it I had a Microsoft tech log on to my computer and have a look. They tried the exact same thing and couldn't get it to work either. I tried reverting back to Windows 7 and removing
 the second hard drive and upgrading back to Windows 10 and then trying to install the hard drive and that didn't work. I finally bit the bullet and re-formatted the drive and reinstalled it. That worked but I will have to put back on a ton of data I lost.
 For some reason Windows 10 did not like that second drive that had been set up as GPD in Windows 7. The only upside is I learned where all the configuration windows are in Windows 10 now. &nbsp;I do think if I had bought a third party disk manager I might could
 have fixed it. The one I was looking at was about $40 and I decided not to buy it because there was no guarantee it would have saved my data either.</p>
<p>I appreciate the help.</p>

            <p>I know this is a late addition to this thread, but I had the same problem on a 4T WD hard drive. Computer management showed the disk as&nbsp; 'healthy protected gpt.. ' or similar, with no assigned name or letter.</p>
<p>All options except 'Help' were greyed out. Luckily, the disk had no important data on it. All disk management progs &amp; tools I tried showed the disk as unallocated/unformatted.. but with more than 1 partition &amp; would not format; therefore were not helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-gained use of the drive using Windows <strong>diskpart </strong>tool</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with this tool it <em>can</em> be lethal, so great care is needed. To be safe, you can always physically remove any other good disks - apart from the system drive.</p>
<p>Determine your problem drive's hardware allocation number using:</p>
<p><strong>R click Start -&gt; control panel -&gt; system &amp; security -&gt; administrative tools -&gt; create &amp; format hard disk partitions</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note the number of the 'problem' drive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Right click Start</strong> again &amp; select <strong>Run</strong></p>
<p>Type in <strong>diskpart</strong> &amp; a command console prompt will open.</p>
<p>Type <strong>list disk</strong> at the prompt &amp; the tool will return all disks installed with a number next to them -
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Disk 0 is the OS</span></em>.</p>
<p>At the next prompt type <strong>select disk <em>[n]</em></strong> (n is the disk number noted earlier). the tool will respond confirming which disk you are working with.</p>
<p>At the next prompt type <strong>clean</strong> - please check, re-check &amp; check again that this is the disk with problems as this operation will completey re-initialise the drive &amp; data will be un-recoverable afterwards.</p>
<p>Close the command console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back to the computer management window &amp; the dirve should now show as a single unallocated block. Assuming the drive is working properly, you should be able to initialise it as a basic / raid etc. volume &amp; format it as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is of some help.</p>

            <p>An error in this case would disable my TeamViewer session and I would be unable to continue trialing and erroring until proximity to the computer was restored. &nbsp; I actually started trialing and erroring locally by trying to enable every service with a network-sounding
 name but came up empty and hoped someone could give me the magic combination of services that made basic networking possible so I could continue trialing and erroring remotely since my local window of opportunity ran out.</p>
<p>

            In your first post you did not make it clear that you want to find the magic combination remotely instead of sitting in front of the machine. This is about as high-risk as it gets. If I am unable to avoid such a scenario then I make sure to have some recovery
 script in place that will automatically put the machine back into a safe condition in case I lose access.

            I don't want to find the magic combination remotely. &nbsp;I want a magic bare minimum combination that would be just enough to sustain a TeamViewer connection so that I could turn on the remaining services one by one remotely until the broken service is uncovered.
 &nbsp;I didn't even think such magic as a recovery script could exist to rescue me from a remote wipeout. &nbsp;How could such a script be triggered if no connection exists to trigger it? &nbsp;That sounds to me like an impossible chicken/egg scenario. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>When you examine what exactly happens when you untick a service under msconfig.exe then you will see that it modifies a key in the registry. This modification can be undone with script. A safe backout path would be based on a scheduled task that runs every
 10 minutes. Here is what it would do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use ping.exe to check if network connectivity is present. If yes, don't do anything.<br />
</li><li>Restore the disabled service.</li><li>Reboot the machine.</li></ol>
<p>Creating such a scheme requires patience and skill. It would be much easier to do the job while physically sitting in front of the machine.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 and bluetooth file transfer from phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vonniecalemine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and bluetooth file transfer from phone</h2>
                    <p>Prior to upgrading (had 8.1) I paired my phone and my laptop. &nbsp;I would open a picture on my phone, select share, choose bluetooth and my computer's name and the file would transfer in 1 second from my phone to my computer. &nbsp;In the bottom right by the clock,
 a box would pop up telling me a file had been received. &nbsp;They all went into a bluetooth folder under Documents--that was the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't do this anymore. &nbsp;If I try to send a file this way, it fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did figure out that if I click on the bluetooth icon near the clock, there is a "receive a file" option. &nbsp;If I use this, the pictures now take like 5 or more seconds to download. &nbsp;I know it seems petty but when I am transferring a 100 pictures and videos
 at a time, several times a day, having it be 5 times slower is a lot. &nbsp;Also that extra step slows me down too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want it back to how it was before</p>

            <p>Hi Isha,</p>
<p>I'm also having some problems with bluetooth transfer.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what build version your advice refers to but I am running Version&nbsp;10.0.10240 Build 10240 and I can't find the Settings you refer to in Method 3, Step 1</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Method 3:&nbsp;</span></span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Update&nbsp;the&nbsp;Bluetooth drivers.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Step 1: Check for the latest driver update through Windows Updates.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>At the Start screen, type </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows Update</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Click or tap </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Settings</span><span> on the right side of the screen, and then select
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Install</span><span> optional updates from the left results.</span></li></ol>
<span>
<p>Where are these "optional updates" settings you are referring to?</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried Method 1 ... and I all got from that was a pretty unhelpful bit of advice that "<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Unknown
 device doesn't have a driver</span>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried Method 2... but not surpisingly ... that didn't do much ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, the Bluetooth transfer process actually ended up working. But only after I realised that I had to instruct Windows to receive the files I was trying to send. Don't understand why a pop-up didn't appear when the phone was detected trying to send a file
 to the laptop. Also don't understand why the laptop receives all the files and THEN asks where you want to save these to. Wouldn't it be more logical to:</p>
<p>a. automatically notify the recipient when another device is attempting to send a file</p>
<p>b. ask the recipient if they want to receive the files?</p>
<p>c. if the recipient says 'yes' then ask where do you want the files saved to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole interface for Win 10 seems quite badly designed and counter-intuitive</p>

            I am searching for answers to the same issue - its very tedious and counter-productive to have to go through all those steps to receive files from another device, like my phone.&nbsp; I used this feature a LOT prior to Win10 but now this issue makes bluetooth
 almost worthless in Win10.

            <p>I was able to transfer one file from my phone to my laptop (which has windows 10).&nbsp; It used to work with some twiddling in w8.&nbsp; After the one time it did work, now it does not work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has broken something that was barely working, a very basic feature:&nbsp; bluetooth networking.&nbsp; Was it the marvelous new code that comprises the amazing new operating system? My laptop came with W8 home version.&nbsp; In terms of usability, this was several
 large steps backwards from W7.&nbsp; Now with the upgrade to W10, many things are broken, and, if I don't really with to adapt to the whiz-bang new graphic 'apps' with their lack of control and functionality and surreal disconnection from process, I don't know,
 it's like MS is trying to push out existing users and people who want to get something done in favor of those who want to spend all their time trying to figure out how to make all this broken stuff work.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Is it sadism? Is that why the company has gone
 through and so thoroughly broken its working products?</p>

            The last time Bluetooth was useable was in Windows 7. I have now turned off Bluetooth in my PC. The driver that windows has created for Windows 10 is useless. It seems that in the push for Mobil ,surface,etc. PC users are expected to one by an Xbox in
 order to use a DVD to play a movie.You need to use MS cloud&nbsp;for the functions of Bluetooth networking .Also fully expect MS to tell you what settings&nbsp; you may have for the OSS . I can see the default possibly for the home user but for Pro and beyond user control
 is paramount as most of us a doing real world business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Concerning the tedious nature of sending one file at a time between an Android phone and Win10...<br />
</p>
<p>It's still annoying (and not pleasantly workable like Win7), however I have figured out a way to send more than one file at a time. &nbsp;(This assumes you are already paired up between devices, and you already know how to transfer a single file.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Android, from the Play store, download an improved file manager, like File Commander (or another one that allows multiple file selections.)</p>
<ul>
<li>In File Commander, from the Home screen, go to Pictures (or wherever the files are)</li><li>Once you have a list of files, press on a file you want to transfer, and hold... until the background turns gray. &nbsp;It is now selected, and will remain selected.</li><li>Now press on another file you want to transfer, hold, etc, like the step above. &nbsp;</li><li>Repeat the previous step as many times as you want to select more files. &nbsp;(I've successfully done 20 files at one time. &nbsp;There may be some limit on either the sending or receiving side.)</li></ul>
<p>Once you have all of your files selected, set your Win10 computer to receive a bluetooth transfer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to the Android phone... &nbsp;In File Commander, press the triple-dot menu, then share, then bluetooth, and select your Win10 computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the files will transfer in one shot. &nbsp;You still need to confirm the location of the files in Win10 once the transfer is complete, but you have multiple files transferred at one time. &nbsp;It helps.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update failed&#58; Couldn&#39;t download updates &#47; Downloads stuck at 0&#37; &#47; Installation failed with error code 0x80240034</h2>
                    <p>Hi Support,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've clean-installed (from scratch) Windows 10 onto my laptop 4 months ago without any problem. But Windows Update process doesn't work from the beginning until now. It can detect new updates, but cannot download them: all downloads stuck at 0% and finally
 says: Couldn't download updates - restarting device may solve this problem. I can see the error code in History: 0x80240034 with all the items.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've tried almost all the suggested solutions without any success:&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Windows Update Troubleshooter: cannot identify the issue (says no issue for every check-item)</p>
<p>- update services: set start=auto, stop and restart all of them: wuauserv, bits, cryptsvc, trustedinstaller, msiserver, AppIDSvc&nbsp;</p>
<p>- SoftwareDistribution folder: rename / delete</p>
<p>- DISM.exe: Scanhealth, Checkhealth, Restorehealth: No component store corruption detected.</p>
<p>- sfc /scannow: Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So all checking processes say: everything seems fine - but Windows Update still cannot install the updates.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've no clue what can I do more, help me please!</p>
<p><br />

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Try doing a repair install. A repair Install keeps everything including Files and applications and reinstalls Windows.

                    Hi, I am running Windows 7 64-bit. Installed Skype and it worked. Installed Magijack and Skype sound does not work. I rememger a warning years ago that sometimes Majicjack gets erroniously set as the default sound device. This is not the case this time
 since my sound works fine except for in Skype. I have a Microsoft camera w. built-in microphone. When I unplug Magicjace, Skype video calls w. sound works great. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Scott P

            <p>Sorry for any inconvenience. I found the problem right after I posted. While the Magicjack did not hijack the normal audio settings, it did hijack the Skype audio settings. Once I changed them (microphone and playback) within Skype, all became well.</p>
<p>Thanks though. This seems like a helpful forum.</p>

            That article (KB187876) is a bit dated.&nbsp; The suggestion to convert to FAT32 is f<span style="font-weight: bold">rom FAT16</span>!!&nbsp; And the references to Scandisk and DriveSpace3 similarly reveal that the article most likely was written with Win 98 in mind.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I realize that the header of the article says "Last Review: February 3, 2011 - Revision: 4.1", but Microsoft probably should have deleted this article or at the very least added Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me to the list of "products this article applies
 to" rather than just leaving it at "Windows Update" (which makes it sound as if it applies to current versions of Windows).<br />
<br />
<br />
If D: is on your hard drive (rather than referring to a CD drive), then TechGeek2 is probably correct that it's a restore partition and should be left alone.&nbsp; Here's my canned response to the "low disk space" issue:<br />
<br />
<p>There are a number of things you can do to --
<b>temporarily</b> -- free up disk space.&nbsp; The only real solution, however, is to get a larger internal hard drive or a second
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">move your My Documents folder</a> in its entirety to an external drive, although you certainly could do that by following the linked instructions. Moving My Documents to a second internal drive
 would be OK.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can run Disk Cleanup (Start &gt; Run &gt; cleanmgr &gt; OK)</li><li>You can reduce the size allocated to System Restore to about 1 GB (right-click My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; System Restore &gt;Settings)</li><li>You can turn off Hibernation (if you don't use it) (right-click empty spot on desktop &gt; Properties &gt; Screen Saver &gt; Power &gt; Hibernate)</li><li>You can disable Disk Indexing, which will also speed up your computer a bit (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/031440/turn-off-indexing-and-speed-up-windows-xp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://lifehacker.com/031440/turn-off-indexing-and-speed-up-windows-xp</a>)</li><li>You can reduce the size of your Internet browser cache (varies depending on which browser you use)</li><li>You can remove most of the $NTUninstallKBxxxxxx$ folders following the directions here:<span>&nbsp;

<p><br />
But none of the above will really gain you significant amounts of space for very long.&nbsp; The only long term solution is a bigger hard drive.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, download and run <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
JDiskReport</a>, which will graphically show you what files are taking up the most space and thus suggest what files you should move to your external drive.&nbsp; If you want to move an application to another drive (either an external drive or a secondary internal
 drive), you'll have to uninstall it and then reinstall it specifying the other drive as the install location.&nbsp; You can't simply move the files.&nbsp; Even when an application is installed to another drive, however, it may well put some files on the system drive
 (i.e., the drive where Windows is located).<br />

<p>While using Adobe Audition 1.5 for recording, the sound breaks in between quite frequently. The recorded audio result is distorted and not continous. I am using I-Ball microphone and tried that with other laptops and its working fine. I don't know what is

    <title>Battery wear since first use&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fabioz96  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battery wear since first use&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;<br />
I purchased an Asus original battery for my Asus X750JB-TY002H.<br />
Since first use, I noticed that the battery has a 6% of wear and that charge/discharge rate starts to decrease when battery percentage reach 88%.&nbsp;<br />
I report this to my seller who sent to another new.<br />
The new battery has the same behavior of the first and a 6-8% of wear.&nbsp;<br />
I want to know if it is normal that an original battery has already wear. Could it caused by some tests which the batterie are subjected before sale?<br />
Could the problem be in the driver?<br />
I'd like to know if this wear level will increase quickly or it could stabilise in future.<br />
What is considered the normal behaviour and the normal wear level in long time?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you
                </div>

            Hi Fabio,<br />
<br />
<br />
Wear calculations are based on the factory specified wattage, but not all batteries come out at that level when manufactured. A difference of a few percent, either way, is entirely possible even with brand new batteries.
<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.

            <p>Actually the wear is 12,5% but its value change frequently. It can takes a value from 5 to 12%. It go up and down.</p>
<p>It's normal?</p>

<p>Hello everyone, I wanted to report a problem with the game Deadfall Adventures. In level 6, the Mines. At the end of the level when you have to move the cranes to blow up the engine, it is impossible to move the cranes with the buttons.&nbsp;Other people have
 had problems with this level and have suggested various solutions, such as climbing on the engine and place the dynamite. I tried but it is impossible. It 'a game bug? In other versions for PC and other platforms there is no problem. How can I fix? There is
 a patch? I'm stuck and I can not continue !!! thank you all for the help.</p>

            Hi Nancy.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Can we see a screenshot so we know what you're talking about?  Here's how to take one and post it back:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/o...</a>
<br />
<br />If it's a volume slider appearing on screen then you can use your mouse to click it or scroll up or down.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Nancy
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If the Volume button in the Taskbar is not working, you might need to restart Windows Explorer.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Processes tab
<br />Scroll down to Windows Explorer then select it
<br />Click Restart
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />1. Open Notepad.
<br />
<br />2. Copy the following text into Notepad:
<br />
<br />@echo off
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /im shellexperiencehost.exe
<br />
<br />timeout /t 3 /NOBREAK &gt; nul
<br />
<br />del %localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\TempState\* /q
<br />
<br />timeout /t 2 /NOBREAK &gt; nul
<br />
<br />start explorer
<br />
<br />@echo on
<br />
<br />3. Click File and Save.
<br />
<br />4. Choose a location to save the file.  Enter a File nameù of ClearTileCache.bat and select Save as typeù of All files (*.*).  Click Save.
<br />
<br />5. Open File Explorer and navigate to the location that you chose to save the file to.  Double-click ClearTileCache.bat to run the file.
<br />
<br />Restart. 
<br />
<br />Check if it now works. 
<br />
<br />Still not working?
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, then try to uninstall and re-install the audio driver.
<br />
<br />    Press Windows  Logo Key+X. Click on Device Manager.
<br />    In the list of hardware categories, look for the device that you want to update, and then right-click on it to Uninstall.
<br />    Follow onscreen instructions to uninstall it.
<br />    To re-install, either you can restart the system or install the driver from the manufacturerís website (recommended as they will have updated drivers).
<br />
<br />For reference:

            Hello my name is Bradford and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I will try to resolve your problem. 
<br />
<br />It sounds like your Icon database in Windows is corrupted and has to be rebuilt. In Windows 10 the procedure is a bit long but I've outlined it below for you:
<br />
<br />To rebuild the icon cache database on Windows 10, close any application that you may be running, and then do the following:
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows Key+R to open the “Run” box. 
<br />2. Type “cmd” into the box and then press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to run the command as an administrator.
<br />3. Type the following command to navigate to the icon cache database location and press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>cd %homepath%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer</code>
<br />
<br />4. Type the following command to verify the icon cache database files are at the location and press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>dir iconcache*</code>
<br />
<br />The output of the dir command should list these database files:
<br />
<br />iconcache_1280.db
<br />iconcache_16.db
<br />iconcache_1920.db
<br />iconcache_256.db
<br />iconcache_2560.db
<br />iconcache_32.db
<br />iconcache_48.db
<br />iconcache_768.db
<br />iconcache_96.db
<br />iconcache_custom_stream.db
<br />iconcache_exif.db
<br />iconcache_idx.db
<br />iconcache_sr.db
<br />iconcache_wide.db
<br />iconcache_wide_alternate.db
<br />
<br />--VERY IMPORTANT about step 5: Once you terminate File Explorer, your desktop background and taskbar will disappear, leaving a black screen — but it's OK, it's only temporarily. You need to close File Explorer to be able to delete the icon cache files. Otherwise, you won't be able to do it.
<br />------
<br />
<br />5. Type the following command to stop File Explorer and press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>taskkill /f /im explorer.exe</code>
<br />
<br />6. Type the following command to delete the iconcache files and press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>del iconcache*</code>
<br />
<br />Note 1: If you get access denied trying to remove the files, you're probably not running Command Prompt with as an administrator. Repeat these steps, but making sure Command Prompt starts with administrative privileges.
<br />
<br />7. Type the following command to verify that you successfully deleted the icon cache files and press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>dir iconcache*</code>
<br />
<br />Note 2: If you still see some iconcache files, then it's likely that some apps are still running, which will prevent you from deleting the database files. Make sure to close them all, and repeat the steps.
<br />
<br />8. Type the following command to start File Explorer and press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>explorer.exe</code>
<br />
<br />9. Close Command Prompt to complete the task.
<br />
<br />Once you completed the steps, Windows 10 will automatically recreate the database files with fresh icons, this should fix the problem
<br />
<br />If following the above steps doesn't resolve the issue please let me know!

            Hi Nancy
<br />
<br />May I ask, is this button your are referring to on the actual side of your physical monitor or is it the volume icon on your screen?
