<h2>            How to fix a corrupted Windows Live Mail Contact List</h2>
                    <p>Since the merging of my Hotmail account with Outlook plus with Gmail+ and others accounts, &nbsp;all contact lists in such accounts&nbsp;have now</p>
<p>hundred of repeated contacts.&nbsp; Duplication of contacts in enormous.&nbsp; Modification of original groups has been made without a</p>
<p>valid criteria, the one used&nbsp;was that&nbsp;the more contacts we put in&nbsp;one single place&nbsp;the easier for you.&nbsp; A totally wrong policy that ignore our needs</p>
<p>for interacting with our contacts.&nbsp; I believe Microsoft or whoever has done this has no right to modify our interacting priorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From&nbsp;contact lists I had that&nbsp;had not even 200 persons on them, now in my Windows Live Mail contact list I have 620. !!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question I need you to answer is this.... HOW CAN I DELETE ALL THOSE CONTACT LIST and start all over again by myself without</p>
<p>merging or synchronizing such list.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want those contact lists to be independent.&nbsp; Once Microsoft has been unable to do a proper job, we
</p>
<p>should be allowed to operate our systems the way we want. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will appreciate receiving the answer by email, once finding answers to questions we post is not an easy job either.!!</p>
<p>My email account that scape to the OUTLOOK TSUNAMI is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***

<p><br />
Please can we clarify that you are using the mail client program Windows Live Mail? If you're signed in in Windows Live Mail, you will see the same contacts list as you see at
<a href="https://people.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://people.live.com</a> if you sign in there with the same Microsoft Account.<br />
<br />
The top left-hand corner of the Windows Live Mail contacts window looks like this:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fpublic.bn1.livefilestore.com%2fy2pGQSquQiwN8RVuf4NkM8F9EXEMYqyCgh27RseNvHRwoMvxSu0yXsKPTZhGbLvD8l34_60OsruXcgYHeeKjvNEtMBQZqxv2RpvrBpFI19peOs%2fWLMail-contacts-window.png%3fpsid%3d1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The top left-hand corner of the People window looks like this in Internet Explorer 10:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fpublic.bn1.livefilestore.com%2fy2pRVSIUAN_DsRJguLyWeGSdDd99Bjuuw4MppIQZrdqYiydv_g1b9cg2hO-QGCtK0R3OTZwwCsTbmR1q9McFNbGRAh_iiYl3yoQvTayce76hlM%2fOL-People-window.png%3fpsid%3d1" /><br />
<br />
In the People window, you can specify which of your contacts lists to see if you've connected to other services like Google, Facebook and LinkedIn. Click the settings button
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2f5s39ew.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy2p9y5qB0HDq4OS9PwGXfIGORYt9UD4QV4k6XZz08QvhRXSQXkTOS9q4YoJys-W71ncmEPSVk-GCmYzQOwTbrkP0lW8fdzkpH1cEX8XuH43yLk0vOUmy7R4RPAoQ6ZMV7Wr%2fPeople-cog.png%3fpsid%3d1" />&nbsp;to see the filters available:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fpublic.bn1.livefilestore.com%2fy2phxdmXS_E2Y-HJ2FPlbkTnjjrh3AVkmbO-5vVD-hbYur8S1ADeRRUZ6xHRdCRbnJ17Kx-iKKxraEKM0huoBhaVetvp-7bLWKt4lP1MC1qtw0%2fOL-People-filter-contacts.png%3fpsid%3d1" /><br />
<br />
You can then see which of your duplicated contacts in fact derive from connected services. If you want to delete any of these, you have to delete them from the service they come from. If you select the Outlook filter alone, you'll only see the Windows Live
 Contacts you've entered either here or in Windows Live Mail. You can also make sure that the contacts you may have added to groups are in fact the right ones - either Outlook contacts, or ones from a connected service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows Live Mail, you can also see which contacts come from where. In the contacts window, select
<em>View as &gt; List</em>. Right-click on&nbsp;the column headings to add, remove or change columns. Make sure you can see at least
<em>Name</em>, <em>Email address</em> and <em>From</em>. The <em>Preview </em>pane will show you the data recorded for a contact. If you'd rather see more columns, you can disable the preview pane using the button on the ribbon. Double-click on a contact to
 see the data recorded in a multi-tab dialogue box where you can also edit the information. The&nbsp;<em>From</em> column will show
<em>Address book</em> for your Windows Live contacts. All the others come from somewhere else.<br />
<br />
Does this help you to sort out your contacts list? </p>

    <title>Windows 10 Black Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> echomorrow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Black Screen</h2>
                    <p>I've read many forums on this topic - START UP DESKTOP/LAPTOP AND END UP WITH A BLACK SCREEN AND A CURSOR AFTER LOGO - but none of the suggestions have worked for me. I went back and reread EVERYTHING and realized that nothing I read resulted in them being
 able to log in. So here's MY story. Maybe someone will have an updated suggestion for me because I haven't been able to use my laptop for coursework for two weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the Windows 10 free update/installation about a month ago. It booted up great and worked fine for like a week. One day, I left it sit too long, and I believe it went into sleep mode. I couldn't wake it up so I did a hard shut down with the power
 button, and it brought up the logo and the login screen. I was able to put in my password and it started logging me in. I noticed it was taking way longer than it should before the login screen disappeared and I was left with the black screen and cursor. I
 tried restarting probably a dozen times before I finally got my desktop again. It worked fine for another couple of days until it went into sleep and no matter how many times I try restarting it or hitting ctrl+alt+del or the ctrl and entering my password
 method, i can NOT get my laptop to fully boot up. Please help me. This is a new laptop that never had a problem before this update.</p>

<p>
If your PC experiences a black screen after signing in to
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>, try the following steps:
</p><p>

<p>
</p><div>
<p>Sometimes, your PC’s external devices can be the cause of problems. Try unplugging all your devices, and then plugging them in one at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that worked, but one of your devices causes your display to go black when you plug it back in, unplug your devices again, plug them in one at a time—except the device causing the problem—and restart your PC. If you can determine which device
 is causing the problem, contact your device manufacturer for support.</p>
<p>
</span></span>
</p><div>
<p>If unplugging external devices doesn't fix the problem, start your PC in Safe Mode and then try the following troubleshooting steps below.</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Restart your PC. When you reach the sign-in screen, hold the Shift key and select the Power button, and then select
<span>Restart</span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>After your PC restarts, select <span>Troubleshoot</span> &gt;
<span>Advanced options</span> &gt; <span>Startup settings</span> &gt;
<span>Restart</span>. After your PC restarts, you should see a number of options. Press 5 or F5 for
<span>Safe Mode with networking</span></p>

                    <p>I have two Windows 10 computers. &nbsp;One is hardwired to my router and the other is wireless. &nbsp;After the Windows 10 update in October 2016, neither is able to access my Networked Attached Storage Device. &nbsp;When I try to connect via file manager,, I get the error
 message: &nbsp;"the specified network name is no longer available." &nbsp;I am able to access the device's administrative page via my browser, so I know it is working.</p>
<p>

<p>I went to File Explorer and entered the path, &nbsp;It displayed the titles of the NAS's two volumes (it has two drives). &nbsp;When I clicked on a volume, I got this message:</p>

<h2>            Resident Evil 5 Mercenaries</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all. I'm having difficulty finding players in Resident Evil 5 that can help me with attaining "SS" ranks on all characters across all stages. I know there's no achievement or anything for doing so, but I'd like to accomplish it all the same.</p>
<p>If you're a half-decent player and/or can attain an "S" or "SS" on your own, let me know!</p>
<p>P.S. Also looking for Mercenaries Reunion players.</p>

            Hi Jeff.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Make sure you're following these steps to set up multiple monitors:
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-connect-and-set-multiple-monitors-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-connect-and-...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-setup-dual-monitors-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />3) Troubleshoot:
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-fix-your-second-monitor-not-being-detected-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-fix-your-sec...</a>

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <span>I don't know if this issue is&nbsp;with Windows or something else so not sure if I am posting in the&nbsp;right place. I&nbsp;have an issue with the letter E not working on the keyboard. The issue is resolved when I reboot the computer. The
 issue does not happen to any other key on the keyboard. The issue happens so infrequently that it really is not an issue. However it is a pain to have to reboot to resolve the issue. I also do not like not knowing the cause of it or how to resolve the issue.
 I have researched the issue and cannot come to a resolution or the cause of it. </span>
<p>If anyone knows the cause or permanent fix to the issue, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Here is what I have done to troubleshoot</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;I have always used Microsoft Natural Keyboards. I have tried replacing the keyboard with a new Natural Keyboard but the issue continues.</p>
</li><li>
<p>&nbsp;I just replaced the keyboard with a Logitech wave keyboard and the issue continues so it is not the brand or model of the keyboard causing the issue.</p>
</li><li>
<p>I have done clean reinstalls of Windows and the issue continues</p>
</li><li>
<p>&nbsp;The issue has happened on Windows XP Professional, Windows Vista Professional, Windows 7 Professional, Windows 8 Professional and Windows 10 Professional</p>
</li><li>
<p>&nbsp;I have built a new computer using all new parts and the issue continues</p>
</li><li>
<p>The issue happens with USB keyboards and wireless. I haven't tried PS2 keyboards due to the fact that they don't make them for the style of keyboard I use.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When the issue occurs, it can occur in different programs so cannot pin point it to any specific program</p>
</li><li>
<p>When the issue occurs, the letter E will not work in any program even Windows programs</p>
</li><li>
<p>&nbsp;It may be a piece of software that I have installed. However I can't test it by leaving software off my computer because the frequency of occurrences is so drawn out. I need the software before the occurrence happens again.
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>My original system had an Asus P8B75-M motherboard and 32 gigs of memory. single 2 gig video card NVidia GeForce GTX 770, SSD 1 gig hard drive</p>
<p>My existing system has an Asus X99-A motherboard and 32 gigs of memory. two 2 gig video card NVidia GeForce GTX 770, SSD 1 gig hard drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only hardware on my existing system that was used on my original system is the single 2 gig video card NVidia GeForce GTX 770, and a dvd drive. Everything else&nbsp;is new included the computer case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Certain sites like Play-Asia have this game listed as Region-Free. You can take a look

<p>Well it seems play-asia is blocked by the great firewall here in china, so not only can i not access youtube or FB but cant access play-asia site too haaaaaa.</p>
<p>Anyway i took the chance and ordered a US version of the game from Hong Kong and am willing to take the risk.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the replys.</p>

    <title>MaxxAudio app no longer available - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hkmcrkm  say:</h3>
<h2>            MaxxAudio app no longer available</h2>
                    Windows 10 Creator was just installed and a pop-up notification alerts me to the deletion of MaxxAuddio app.&nbsp;
Clicking on the notification opens a browser window that takes me to AMD streaming technology.
My CPU is Intel i3 - Dell Inspiron

Audio appears to work properly
The pop-up notification repeats each time I log on to the desktop local user account.


sfc /scannow did not find any integrity violations. (Whatever that means.)

It is a minor annoyance, on a growing list of minor annoyances.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to do further investigation so that we can identify the cause of the issue. Please check if MaxxAudio is still listed in
<strong>Apps &amp; feature</strong><strong>s</strong> (<em>Settings &gt; System &gt; Apps &amp; features</em>), if yes, try to uninstall it and see if it helps. If you still need the MaxxAudio, we suggest that you download a fresh copy of the program and install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Lo peor de todo esto, ( a mi tmb me pasa), es que compro una consola para JUGAR JUEGOS y no puedo ni hacerlo offline, no se que pasa, pero es vergonzoso, una cosa es que no puedas entrar al live, o problemas con el gametarg, que es más o menos comprensible,
 pero que no pueda jugar ni a los juegos en DVD y en offline, es vergonzoso y yo quiero explicaciones y compensación, por que hablando por el chat con el soporte técnico, he conseguido arrancar el fifa 14 en formato físico....pero haciendo un triple mortal
 con doble tirabuzón escarpado...vamos una ***, por que aún haciendo eso, no puedo jugar a mis juegos en hdd, lamentabla microsoft, lamentabla.</p>

                    <p>I have a new all in one lenovo FOBF desktop but when i try to log-in sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt. When i finally get in I cant make any account changes because again..it wont recognize my password. It came with Windows 10 already installed so
 i didnt upgrade it. Sometimes when I restart it already says "incorrect password" and sometimes I have two usernames on the bottom left of the desktop but the password wont work for either. Ive also tried my Microsoft password. Its all so random.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t redownload Minecraft, even though I bought it previously</h2>
                    So a year ago, the Minecraft got the a big update and basically made you pay for a whole new game, except if you had the old version, it was only 5 dollars. So I bought it, didn't like the changes, and uninstalled. Today I went to redownload it so I could
 play it with my high school friends who also got back into it, but it's gone from my "Ready to install" list (yes, I checked hidden games too), along with the old version. So I went to the store and lo and behold it's charging me twenty dollars to buy it,
 even though i already had. Can anyone shed some light on this?

<h2>            Volume rocker switch on Surface Pro 3 not working correctly</h2>
                    The volume level rocker on the side of my surface pro 3 doesn't seem to be working all of a sudden. When trying to raise the volume, nothing happens. When trying to lower the volume, it takes a screenshot. The WINDOWS button is not stuck as it happens
 with or without the keyboard attached. and the button works fine by itself when using the keyboard. Any help/suggestions would be appreciated.

<h2>            I cannot purchase anything i want to</h2>
                    
<p>I have been trying to buy a item and i went to the troubleshooting area, it said i might have a purchase violation, or due charges, or that it wont allow for online purchases, however, i went through all of my past purchasing history, and i have nothing
 due to pay, i have purchased other things online from other sites with this same card, so im confused, in all sense it should work but it just doesnt, ive cleared my system cache, and my marketplace data, as per the troubleshooting advice, i have done everything
 and nothing will work, the item i am trying to purchase is Tales of Vesperia, the full game, it only says "Sorry and error has occured" no code number or anything, when i tried from my xbox iteself, the error code was 80164D94 or something similar, any advice?
 The Sorry an error has occured, happens everytime i try to purchase something, im really frustrated x.x</p>

<p>How about transferring the season pass from the Xbox One version to the 360 version, is that possible? A few of my friends are getting COD Ghosts on 360 but won't get an Xbox One until sometime next year. I know downgrading isn't the greatest idea, but I
 still want to play with my friends.</p>

<h2>            Skype Room System&#58; own camera picture is very, very small</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we are using Skype-Room-System with different cameras and face the issue, that the picture of the own camera (in-room-camera) is very small compared with videos of other participants. In a setting where a front of room display is used it is nearly impossible,
 to use the own picture to optimize the camera zoom or even to verify that the persons in the room are captured by the camera in a good way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to customize the size of the in-room-camera-picture?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Oliver</p>

            Heya Oliver
<br />To my knowledge, there is no way to resize the camera window. This feature was available in skype classic I believe so if you wanted to you could downgrade temporarily here: <a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>

<p>Thanks for that link - which I had tried and failed to find at the weekend. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It installs the older version 7.41, which works well, at least for the present, but it will try and update automatically to version 8.28, which while having great potential is not yet, in my opinion, fit for purpose, because it doesn't reliably indicate
 to my contacts whetherI am on line - especially as I only run it when I want to use it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly I have become fed up with having to notify my contacts when I am on line, to ignore what the program says about my status, so I am happy to have this older version back. Hopefully Microsoft will sort out the replacement properly before making this
 version inoperable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will however have to be vigilant and ensure that it doesn't update itself.</p>

<p>Hi Wafflewizard1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your post, please note that this is not related to the Skype client but to the Skype Room System, which is in a way a product built around the Skype client.</p>

            Hey again
<br />With your version of Skype, I believe there is no way to customize the size of the in-room-camera-picture. With older versions it was possible. Are you talking about the box in the bottom right corner in this picture(my skype)? <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3ZvUpZj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/a/3ZvUpZj</a>

<p>Hi Wafflewizard1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>no, you are using a Skype client, we are using the Skype Room System. In my screen shot Outlook is external content from HDMI-In-input, the picture with the green border is how you see another participant, the red-bordered picture is the in-room-camera-picture.
 It is much smaller than the picture of the external participant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

            My bad. I think this could be a design flaw but I am not knowledgeable about Skype room systems. Here is a link about the Hardware: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/skype-room-systems-version-2-help-e667f40e-5aab-40c1-bd68-611fe0002ba2?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-GB&amp;ad=GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/skype-...</a>

<h2>            Windows 7 PC crashes while playing League of Legends only.</h2>
                    laptop freezes up while in game (recently crashed while just the client was open for the first time)<br />
have to manually hold down the power button to shut it off<br />
wont respond to anything while frozen<br />
makes a buzzing noise while frozen<br />
screen literally freezes in place<br />
it'll stay like this for a while unless i force a restart<br />
doesn't happen always but it's been happening alot recently especially today 8/28/2015<br />
had to keep hitting the power multiple times to restart my pc<br />
would show a black screen for a few seconds while trying to turn on and then shut back off<br />
would make it to the login screen where my profile is and i would put in password and it would show the load thing for about 1s then a black screen and just stay like that with the fan running still<br />
cant figure out what the issue is<br />
no blue screen or warning or anything shows up<br />
flat out powers off without a cause being shown<br />
"view reliability history" shows a red circle with an white X in it and when i click it for todays date it says "Diagnostics Tracking Service" - Has stopped working.<br />
i click "View technical Details" and this is what it shows.<br />

            <p>My research so far has brought me to the conclusion that my pc can't 'page files' fast enough to keep up with league and it's high cpu usage and needs, i'm in the process of defraging my hdd so that i can shrink it to make a seperate 10gb partition (currently
 only allowing 6mb of shrink space, hopefully the defrag allows more) so that i can make it a new file page partition to allow for better performance. Hopefully..</p>

<p>I turn on my camera and put it on play mode. I plug in the IE 1394 cord into my port on the camera and on the pc. I open up windows movie maker and click import from digital video camera. A error noise is made. A message comes up
<strong>"Import video is already started and running on this computer. You cannot start another instance of import video until the first instance has stopped. To fix this issure, wait for video to&nbsp;be imported, close Import video, wait a fe w seconds then start
 import video again."<br />
</strong>I do that but i know that I havent started importing anything. and i can sit there all day and wait and try it again and again and the same message comes up. I also tried restarting the pc and starting the process over again. Same thing happens. I
 even tried it on my friends laptop same thing happens. i have recorded before on a destop with a different type of fire wire but my laptop can only use the 1394 cord.</p>

<p>I turn on my camera and put it on play mode. I plug in the IE 1394 cord into my port on the camera and on the pc. I open up windows movie maker and click import from digital video camera. A error noise is made. A message comes up
<strong>"Import video is already started and running on this computer. You cannot start another instance of import video until the first instance has stopped. To fix this issure, wait for video to&nbsp;be imported, close Import video, wait a fe w seconds then start
 import video again."<br />
</strong>I do that but i know that I havent started importing anything. and i can sit there all day and wait and try it again and again and the same message comes up. I also tried restarting the pc and starting the process over again. Same thing happens. I
 even tried it on my friends laptop same thing happens. i have recorded before on a destop with a different type of fire wire but my laptop can only use the 1394 cord.</p>

<p>It is against forum rules to post another users Gamertag in an attempt to "call out" or "name and shame" them, please refrain from doing this in the future.</p>
<p>File a Complaint, Block Communications and Avoid them, this is the proper procedure for dealing with these folks.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that what the person is doing to you is not just against Microsoft's terms of use but is an actual criminal offence. So if this continues then a visit to the police could be in order.</p>
