<p>This calls to comeback with only 10% health. Does your opponent have to be at full health when you are at 10% to unlock this?</p>

<h2>            Search bar, menu start, task manager, downloading things doesnt work all together</h2>
                    Search bar, menu start does nothing when i click on them, when i try download something from google it doesn't do anything. when i open programs and try do something it takes 10 mins to load and either if you click on it or not it will become unresponsive
 for no reason. then i would randomly get a box error with no text at all with the only answer that says "ok" and you can't even click or move it, if you click it, it will become unresponsive. maybe is it because i disabled or uninstall a few apps from settings
 but right now my laptop is a living hell please help me. thanks

            Hi Ken.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Will it function in Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>?  Try that first.
<br />
<br />If so go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Try doing a System Restore, if necessary from Repair Mode:
<br />System Restore:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />Repair Mode access:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps or it won't function in Safe Mode, run a Repair Install which reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files, programs and most settings in place,  by installing the Media Creation Tool, open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now.  This will solve most problems and also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> You may need to create bootable media to access Repair Mode or do the Repair Install or even a Clean install:
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br />Transfer the media back to the PC, open it to run Setup to Repair Install which is an Upgrade over itself saving files, programs and most settings.
<br />
<br />To access Repair Mode or do the Clean Install, insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then System Restore.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.  
<br />
<br />If you have files that aren't backed up you can use the same bootable media to rescue your files using this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? See article for details:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_7-system/how-to-what-are-my-options-for-obtaining-windows-7/528163c1-0b2e-4ad2-a26d-7112851d1dc2"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">How to: What are my options

<p>What to do if you cannot get recovery media from your manufacturer, refuse to use or purchase it or the Microsoft Software Recovery Website is not working?</p>

</p><p>

</span></p><p>Because Windows 7 is in limited stock because Microsoft ended sales in October 2013, this has created demand because of its scarcity. This means retail boxed copies demand a premium, while OEM System Builder copies remain affordable.</p>

            Hi Raghu27,<br />
<br />
If you're having the same issue as what the original poster I suggest you r<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>epair the Mail.MsMessageStore file, to do this please follow the steps below.<br />
<br />
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>1. Restart the computer (this is to ensure that Live Mail is fully shut down, and that none of it's components are in use when the computer starts)</span></span></span></span></span>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>2. Click Start, type CMD but do not press enter</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>3. You will see cmd.exe in the search results, right click on it and select Run as Administrator - type
 your admin password if asked, and if UAC pops up asking premission, allow it</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>4. You should now see the command prompt, with the following displayed:</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><i><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7600]</span></span></span></span></span></i></p>

            I am having the same problem; tried to repair through add/remove programs but it only changed the error from 0x8000FFFF.1400 to 0x80070002.&nbsp; I am afraid to uninstall because I don't want to lose my emails and contacts; will uninstalling/reinstalling cause
 these to disappear?<br />
<br />
I tried your Mail.MSMessage store fix but I think the procedure for getting to the command prompt is different in XP because I am getting C:\Documents and Settings\AA Sue&gt; where AA Sue is the user profile name; the top of the same Command prompt window says
 C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe.&nbsp; Nothing happens if you just enter "CMD" under Start then Run so you have to hit enter.&nbsp; Assume it's due to running XP.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Any further help you can provide would be great.&nbsp; Just want to open my email without losing the message store!<br />

            Hi Paul, <br />
<br />
I can't open Windows Live Mail at all in order to follow the backup instructions you linked to. Indeed, it was problems with a Norton360 backup file eating up the rest of my entire hard drive (38GB of 71GB) and attempting to fix it that led to the problem with
 Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; (the hard drive space issue is resolved.)<br />
<br />
I think I may have found the missing database because after defragmenting&nbsp; the now-freed up hard drive, a series of folders in Outlook Express under Identities were not defragmented; upon looking at those folders (changed over to Windows Live Mail from Outlook
 Express in 2011), I discovered about 4 folders with a current modification date on them (everything else in the folder was dated 2011) and I suspect this is the missing message store etc.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Before I uninstall and reinstall Windows Live Mail, I would like to try Vivien_M's solution above but I need assistance getting the Command prompt to the correct place in Windows XP before entering the user prompt she provided.&nbsp; Also, wondering if "%userprofile%
 is to be copied as shown or should I insert my user profile name there?&nbsp;&nbsp; When I open the Command prompt in XP&nbsp; I get C:\Documents and Settings\AA Sue&gt;, where AA Sue is my user profile name.
<br />
<br />
Otherwise I am going to run a general backup and proceed with the uninstall.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
My webmail server does not have all the messages dating back to 2005, which I have archived, so would like to backup the files as they were before the error began to occur.&nbsp; The current webmail doesn't go back that far as my server switched email services awhile
 back.<br />

<br />
Thank you for getting back to us. With regard to your issue, kindly go to this location<strong> C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;userlogon&gt;\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail</strong> on your computer, check for the&nbsp;.eml files that needs
 be&nbsp;back up.<br />
<br />
Also as for user profile question, you can change your &lt;userprofile&gt;your log in name, but either way it should work fine.<br />
<br />
<font>Hope this helps. Let us know if you need further assistance.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</font></p>

            Hello Vivien_M, <br />
My question is not so much how to back up the files; I am running a full backup of my system before proceeding further regardless.&nbsp; My question is about your instructions for repairing the MSMessageStore in answer to the original poster above.&nbsp; Is there a different
 Command prompt for XP users for <span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>the solution you mentioned previously for Windows 7 and 8?&nbsp; When I go to the system's command prompt in&nbsp; C:\Program
 Files\Accessories\Command Prompt, I get</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>C:\Documents and Settings\AA Sue&gt;
<br />
<br />
where AA Sue is the user profile, and you are saying to copy the repair command (</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><b><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>esentutl.exe
 -d "%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Mail.MSMessageStore"
</span></span></span></span></span></b></span></span></span></span></span>) following the Command Prompt
<br />
<br />
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>C:\Windows\system32&gt;

<br />
</span></span></span></span></span></i><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>in your instructions for Windows 7, above.
<br />
<br />
Can I use that repair command in DOS from Windows XP, and if so how do I get to the correct&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>C:\Windows\system32&gt;&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>prompt
 from C:\Documents and Settings\AA Sue? <br />
<br />
Otherwise will also try uninstalling and reinstalling but from what I have seen on this problem it doesn't usually fix it.
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> <br />

<p>my guessing it's due to some registry twist or third party software I'm not sure...</p>
<p>although I did remove (Wise Care, Advanced systemcare, CCleaner)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if there is anyway to restore the default explorer...</p>
<p>Edit : All my drivers and Windows are up to date&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit 2: I would like to fix this manually in other word I'm not counting on Windows Restore Settings stuff never helped me so far...</p>
<p>Update : I have "delayed launched" from Intel i'm gonna look into it</p>
<p>Note : System Restore is not an option.</p>
<p>Also please don't tell me to use sfc scannow i'm not that dumb&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks !</p>

            Hi Ishaq.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you used those optimizers to tweak WIndows then it might already be ruined.  Windows will not tolerate that kind of tweaking when all it needs is a great install in the first place follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Until then Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If you try all the above and the problem persists with RAM usage way out of proportion to CPU usage, then I'd run Crucial System Scanner to consider a RAM Upgrade using the best tool to determine this:  <a href="http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/</a>
<br />
<br />You can also Test your RAM overnight to stress it with a more reliable bootable test, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I have a gold account and have downloaded the free games on my Xbox One, but I can not find any games with gold on my xbox 360. Am I only allowed to get games with gold on one console? I've asked this before and told I should be able to get the free games
 available for each console yet I can not for the life of me find a games with gold tab or window on my xbox 360.</p>

<p>Depending on which region your account is set to, then your dashboard will be different to others. My xbox 360 dashboard (uk) shows the gold tile on the home tab at the bottom of the screen. &nbsp;It just says gold. &nbsp;If you select it, it shows deals with gold,

<p>&nbsp; When I use the online stores free games with gold sectios, even though it says right there I have gold. I still see prices for games that should be free. However when I click the price to buy it, the next window says confirm purchase, price=free. I'd test
 this further by clicking confirm but I'd hate to have it charge my credit card and create another mess.</p>
<p>Can anyone help? The fact that I haven't been able to get games with gold on my 360 for over a year is infuriating.</p>

<h3> stonesword184  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t delete a file folder off my desktop, it says it&#39;s not found but I&#39;m LOOKING AT IT</h2>
                    <p>So I have a folder on my desktop. I don't like it. I've tried deleting it. When I do it says "file not found". I'm looking right at it. I have restarted and refreshed my computer. I even tried re-downloading and replacing the file. I can't even rename it.
 When I try to change or delete it, it says "file not found, try again". Clicking try again just instantly pops up the EXACT SAME dialouge box. Does my computer even "try again"? Doubt it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please help it's been a <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>year</strong></span></em> and the folder is misspelled</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no option to move back the chat window to its original interface. By design, the new Skype&nbsp;will show the chat windows on the left side&nbsp;panel of the application.

            <p>Sorry pommie, I wasn't very explicit.&nbsp; Here you go:</p>
<p>Select Accounts in settings</p>
<p>Select the email account you wish to sync</p>
<p>Click on Change mailbox settings</p>
<p>In the Download email from box area click on the drop down list arrow</p>
<p>Click on "any time"</p>
<p>Click on Done</p>
<p>Click on Done again at next window</p>
<p>Click on Save</p>
<p>Depending on your sync settings, you may see your older emails come in later.&nbsp; To immediately receive them you will need to sync each of your folders.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>After upgrading yesterday from 8.1 to 10, all of my emails in Mail prior to May 4th of this year (at least a year and a half worth) are missing.&nbsp; That includes emails in my Inbox, and all of my separate folders.</p>
<p>Anyone have an idea of what happened here?&nbsp; My Mail account is tied to my Gmail account, and after looking directly at Gmail all of my emails are there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I lost all sent items in Hotmail account and all received items in Yahoo account. I regained them by opening up on an older computer, which runs on XP, and found they were there. So I opened a folder in each e mail account, named it "old messages" and moved
 all the contents into these folders from the Sent and Inbox. Closed the old machine and opened up in Windows 10, and all the information was in my new folders.</p>
<p>I have since had further loss of recent mail, and have had to repeat the procedure to re gain the recent lost items.</p>
<p>Hope this helps, but&nbsp; I NEED a better answer, if anyone has one.</p>

<p>File History still sees a File History on the drive:</p>

</p>
<p>But if I reselect this drive it asks me to reselect the drive it claims "We found errors in your File History settings": Reselecting the drive does not solve it.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Default location is the location to which&nbsp;you want to move the files. You may check your File History drive for errors and repair it. To perform the same try the steps under the section "<strong>Check your File History drive for errors</strong>" in the following
 article.</p>

            Hi Zachary.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />No, once they've given it to you via free Upgrade or you bought it retail then they will not try to charge you for something you already own.  Microsoft is pretty good about protecting your property that you own and doesn't really do sneaky things that I've ever seen.  There would be quite an uproar in Community here if they ever did.  
<br />
<br />There is the possibility that like Office Windows may some day go to a subscription service but it wouldn't be Windows you already own as you own that for its life.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Zachary, Windows 10 is not a subscription product. 
<br />
<br />Once you have it, it is yours, there is nothing to pay
<br />
<br />Your PC/Laptop will have a digital entitlement to run Windows 10 stored on the Microsoft Servers and you can reinstall Windows 10 on that device at any time in the future . . .
<br />
<br />I hope thes alleviates any worries you might have :)

            <p>I didn't know Pandora had any "download" at all, I thought you just listened to them from their website using your browser.&nbsp; Maybe I never noticed the download for it.&nbsp; But yes the Spotify program does indeed work just fine on Windows 8, I use it myself.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Note that it does not work on Windows RT, because it has a cell phone type (ARM) processor inside (instead of regular computer's 32-bit or 64-bit processors) and Spotify would need to reprogram their app to work with that kind of processor (which they would
 gladly do if customers like you politely tell them you'd like them to do that).</p>

                    I have installed 2 updates.<br />
<br />
I installed both of them using stand-alone installer that.<br />
First I checked for updates using Windows Updates and then Download stand alone installer from the more information link so I can use this update later on.<br />
<br />
These are 2 updates that I am trying to install:<br />
1. Windows8-RT-KB2756872-x64<br />
2. Windows8-RT-KB2768703-x64<br />
<br />
I restarted my system after installing both updates.<br />
Windows configures updates till near about 30% and system gets shut down and re-started.<br />
Then It went it 100% and suddenly I got a message something like:<br />
"Failure Configuring Windows Updated. Reverting Changes"<br />
It it just reverted<br />
<br />
Here are all the logs files (CBS.log, WindowsUpdate.log, WindowsUpdate (1).log)<br />
http://bobdn.com/Files/Logs.zip<br />
<br />
Please tell me how can I get these update successfully installed.<br />

            I have finally resolved my problem with update kb2756872 ("update failed, reverting changes" ). It was caused by the windows reserved partition not being set as active (I'm dual booting using GRUB). Go to
<b>Control Panel-&gt;Administrative Tools-&gt;</b><b>Computer Management-&gt;</b><b>Disk Management
</b>and make sure that the reserved partition is marked "Active". This also solved many other problems I've been experiencing like not being able to enable Windows Startup Settings.<br />

    <title>Laptop Hangs on Boot - &#40;stops at classpnp.sys&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Laptop Hangs on Boot - &#40;stops at classpnp.sys&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a 10 week old Acer 8943G laptop which failed to boot about 2 weeks after buying it, startup repair fixed the issue but it returned about a week later. This issue is the same as that which other users have experienced in which&nbsp;upon attempting to boot
 into safe mode the system stops at classpnp.sys. Now nothing short of a full factory reset fixes the problem but it always returns in a few days to&nbsp; couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Here is the startup repair error report:</p>
<p>Problem Event Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Startup repair offline<br />
Problem Signature 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.1.7600.16385<br />
Problem Signature 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.1.7600.16385<br />
Problem Signature 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unknown<br />
Problem Signature 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -1<br />
Problem Signature 5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Autofailover<br />
Problem Signature 6:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4<br />
Problem Signature 7:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corrupt Registry<br />
OS Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.1<br />
Locale ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1033</p>
<p>Here is what I have tried already to fix the issue as recommended by other users with this issue:</p>
<p>Factoy reset - problem returns.<br />
Disable write behind caching on all drives - runs very slowly and eventually fails to boot.<br />
Change BIOS sata mode from AHCI to IDE - Blue screen on boot.<br />
Update all device drivers - no effect.<br />
Update BIOS - no effect</p>
<p>I am at a loss as to what to do next short of sending it off to try and get a new motherboard or HDD. Any ideas would be appreciated as would info as to whether a new MB or HDD would help or not. The laptop is still under Acer warranty so this is not an
 issue.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You definitely need to work with Acer Support. The more you do the more they will say it is something<br />
you did. Added that the issue needs to be documented if there are down the road issues.<br />

<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7</strong>.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;a serious error and "may" not be repairable without professional tech support from<br />
a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox Stores) or your<br />
System maker's Support.</p>
<p>Go into Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch screen as you startup. Set the<br />
boot order to CD/DVD to use Vista disks. Remember to set back when done.<br />
<br />
With a Windows 7 or Repair disk try Startup Repair - (the possible fixes are same as these though<br />
the titles are named differently.)<br />
<br />
Here are the troubleshooting methods to try to fix the issue :<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>

=========================================<br />
<br />
If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.<br />
<br />
If you need to make repair disks - these help repair Windows not re-install.<br />

<p>==========================================<br />
<br />
These "may" help :<br />
<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Windows 7 disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you can retry System Restore from the Recovery or Windows 7&nbsp;disk.<br />

<br />
Or from the Command Prompt :<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\System32\rstrui.exe<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p>@BENNEL552 &nbsp;when you turn on your console go to settings and then select storage and then select profiles, then select your profile and delete profile only. Once you have done that go to the sign in menu and look for recover profile and when it prompts you
 type in your email and password. This will recover your profile from xbox live back to your console as sometimes the data can become corrupt on on your hard drive,</p>
<p>If this does not work you will have to do the following delete all multiplayer content off your hard drive for Battlefield 3 including the multiplayer disk &nbsp;and gun packs if you have the hardened edition. Then reinstall the multi player disk if you want
 and follow the prompts when the game restarts and re download any updates. If you have the hardened edition you will have to re download the gun packs and map but you won't have to pay for them again. I had to do this recently as i had the same problem one
 day then the next day got an error message saying your data is corrupt and can not be retrieved.
</p>
<p>I Went to live chat at EA games and that is what the person told me yo do and now everything is working well. I did ask her how it could be corrupt and she said it happens sometimes when you download map packs or just when your stats and profile down load
 over xbox live.</p>

<p>If your console can't read the disk it will be a disk issue or disk drive issue or dirty pick up lens it won't be because you deleted it from the hard drive. Try cleaning the disk with a damp cloth wiping inside to outer edge then wipe dry the same way.
 See if it reads the disk the console only needs the disk info and security code to start the multiplayer part of the game if you do the steps i said above it should now work. Also if you have a lens cleaning disk run that in your console to clean the pick
 up lens.</p>

                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>My iphone was importing photos perfectly fine until today, when the message came up 'Error 0x8007041: device is unreachable.&nbsp; It will only import 1 or 2 files at a time.&nbsp; I've followed a couple of the suggestions on other threads for the same problem, such
 as checking the device driver is up to date and troubleshooting, but the problem is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

<h2>            Installing Windows 7 to a Windows XP laptop</h2>
                    <p>My wife has an old Laptop running Windows XP. I have a brand new version of Windows 7 never used on any PC and would like to install this on her laptop. I have saved all necessary files and folders for her. Can I just do an install of Windows 7 on her lappy
 and if so are all the drivers and utilities on the Windows 7 version that I have? I have a 32 and 64 bit disk but no drivers and utilities disk. Will I be able to complete the install? Any answers would be helpful, thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps before you&nbsp;try to install&nbsp;Windows 7:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to your&nbsp;Laptop&nbsp;Manufacturer's website and see if Windows 7 Drivers are available for your Make and Model&nbsp;Laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not available, Windows 7 will not&nbsp;work correctly for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run the "Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor"</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, Skype status does not sync across all devices and we always recommend to sign into Skype using one device at a time to avoid conflicts. In addition, to manage your&nbsp;presence status in the new Skype, please access
