<h2>            Windows File Protection- missing DLLs, CD drive not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello, Windows XP, trying to run WFP, getting an error: files that are required must be copied to the DLL cache.</p>
<p>I have the XP CD but the CD drive is not working.</p>
<p>Is it possible to download the DLLs?</p>
<p>Could this be why Windows updates are failing as well?</p>

            One doesn't run WFP - Windows File Protection is normally running all the time and you can't run it manually.<br />
<br />
Do you mean you are running <span style="font-weight: bold">sfc /scannow</span> and see a message like this:<br />
<br />
Files that are required for Windows to run properly must be copied to the DLL Cache.<br />
Insert your Windows XP CD-ROM now.<br />
<br />
It is important that you tell us exactly what you are doing and exactly what you see if you are having a problem.<br />
<br />
That doesn't necessarily mean there is anything wrong and is quite common and normal.<br />
<br />
Even if your CD drive worked, if order to make sfc /scannow happy, you would have to have a genuine installation CD with the same Service pack as your installed XP Service Pack (most people don't).<br />
<br />
In other words, if you have SP3 installed and try to run sfc /scannow with a CD that is NOT SP3, it will complain and it will complain a lot just like I mentioned above.&nbsp; Most people either don't have any XP media or it they do, it often does not match the
 Service Pack of their installed XP meaning they are in for a long and frustrating waste of time.<br />
<br />
What is the problem you are having that you think sfc /scannow will correct?<br />
<br />
Who suggested that you run sfc /scannow or are you just running it for practice?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I find that people that suggest it as a troubleshooting tool really have no idea how it really works and suggesting it is equivalent to stating:&nbsp; "I have no idea that the problem is or how to fix it".&nbsp; Then that is usually the last you will hear from them.<br />
<br />
Running sfc /scannow is extremely unlikely to help you anyway unless you are trying to make sure your DLLCACHE folder is current (that is what it does).<br />
<br />
What you should do instead is tell us a little about your system, what the problem is and why you think sfc /scannow will correct it (it won't) and then perhaps somebody can help you out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving
 these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<br />
What do you not see that you think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />

    <title>All my Documents turned into JPG files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wolfles  say:</h3>
<h2>            All my Documents turned into JPG files</h2>
                    What happened was that I decided to move most of my USB documents which includes word, excel etc. onto my desktop, so then I can clear my USB and have it clean. However, because I was careless, I deleted the files on my USB, only to find out all the documents
 that I transfered turned into JPG files, varying size from 50KB-2300KB. I cannot open these images either, the names also changed into IMG20120101_181759, IMG 20120102_105524 etc. As shown here:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b332f26-5bc8-4de6-8928-91b4f3e7093f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b332f26-5bc8-4de6-8928-91b4f3e7093f" /></a>If
 it is corrupted or damaged, is there any way I can recover it? These are very important documents as they are tax-related.

            <p>first, turn off <strong>hide extensions for known file types</strong> in folder options</p>
<p><br />
then you will see the full name<br />
<br />
IMG20120101_181759.jpg<br />
<br />
rename one at a time<br />
to the extension of whatever program they should be opened with<br />
<br />
replace the .jpg with whatever opens them<br />
eg.<br />
word<br />
.doc or .docx<br />
<br />
excel<br />
.xls or .xlsx<br />
<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
if one extension doesn't work try the next until the file opens<br />
<br />
also if you haven't done anything with the USB (add new files etc.)<br />
you can try some undelete programs on the USB<br />
eg.<br />
<a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TestDisk &amp; PhotoRec</a><br />

            maybe virus / malware / crypto type infection<br />

cryptolocker type infections go undetected by AV scanners because they only use legit processes and don't use malicious code to do their dirty deeds<br />

<h2>            Getting Error message &#34; &#34;Windows cannot be installed on this disk. The selected disk has an MBR partition table. On EFI systems, Windows can only installed on GPT disks&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Problem Installing Windows 8.1 on "Asus S550" Laptop (EFI/GPT)</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I'm facing a very bad problem (EFI) on installing Windows 8.1 on "Asus S550".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says: "Windows cannot be installed on this disk. The selected disk has an MBR partition table. On EFI systems, Windows can only installed on GPT disks."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched and I found some ways to resolve it. But almost all of them say to format the whole disk and convert disk to GPT (using diskpart).</p>
<p>I don't want to format my disk and lose my data. One of my friends said that he solved such problem with booting into Ubuntu Live Disk and doing some tricks with Ubuntu (Of course without formatting and losing data).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could somebody help me through this problem?</p>
<p>I will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Computer keeps freezing, crashing, and sometimes blue screen</h2>
                    <p>Ever since last week, my computer keeps freezing with the speakers making some weird noise. I will then have to manually turn off the computer by pressing down the turn on button. It will then start up smoothly until the next crash. Sometimes, instead of
 the freezing, there's a blue screen.<br />
<br />
This happens a lot, always when I'm about 2 minutes into a game. I could be doing something minor, like watching a youtube video, and then I'll crash.<br />
I have a Windows Vista, but my friend rebuilt the computer around 2 years ago. I've already used Malware Bytes to delete any malware, and CCleaner to clean my computer out.</p>
<p>Here is a log from one of my recent crashes:<br />

            While using that Norton uninstaller, my computer had 2 BSODs, I couldn't read the first one but the second one said PC_INDEX_MISMATCH and STOP: 0x00000001.
<br />
<br />
After the computer restarted, there was a black screen that said: Checking file system on C: The type of the file system is NTFS. I guess the disk was checked.
<br />
<br />
I then went on safe mode to fully uninstall Norton, and then after it fully uninstalled, I went back on normal mode and got another blue screen. This one said STOP: 0x0000008E<br />

    <title>windows can&#39;t find 3 missing Bluetooth drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> khaledjoudeh  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows can&#39;t find 3 missing Bluetooth drivers</h2>
                    Hi,,<br />
I've had this problem since yesterday. I think I deleted some essential bluetooth drivers by mistake and can't get them back ANYWAY.<br />
<br />
device manager says there are 3 unknown devices which have the hardware IDs bellow:<br />
<br />
- BTH\MS_BTHLE<br />
- BTH\MS_BTHBRB<br />
- BTH\MS_BTHPAN<br />
<br />
(ERROR CODE 28)<br />
<br />
after many searching I found that they relate to microsoft bluetooth enumerator, LE enumerator &amp; another one. However, Windows fail to download the drivers through windows updates or even the latest manually downloaded driver for Atheros bluetooth on ACER.
 I can't even find the drivers online anywhere even on microsoft itself !<br />
The Atheros bluetooth driver itself installs normally and bluetooth icon appears (enabled) in tray area but t he device doesnt work. it cant connect or find any devices. it's just there.<br />
I tried to do a system restore but system always fails due to antivirus blocking some files although I deleted the antivirus. In fact, I don't trust this option cause it says those drivers will come back but might not work properly and need reinstall. I don't
 want errors/corrupted files in my machine.<br />
please help.<br />
windows 8 64-bit<br />
acer aspire v3 571g<br />
<br />
EDIT: (SOLVED)<br />
<br />
I could solve it by restoring the deleted folders from recycle bin !!<br />
Thank god I'm so lucky that they went there. <br />
but what if I couldnt find them ? what is the solution ?<br />
please tell how to get these drivers online if they even exist.<br />

            <p>As I mentioned above, installing the manufacturers driver doesn't solve it. not acer not even Atheros. it's something within the windows. Problem is back now after updating to latest driver and it keeps the device under OTHERs with "unknown device" as it's
 name. I've&nbsp;tried installing&nbsp;many versions of the same device. windows can't recognize my device and doesn't even give an error code. however when I open the properties I see the error code 43. it means device is not connected. well it's a built in device :P<br />
I even did a refresh for the whole windows and lost my apps. it restored all the original drivers for every device except the Bluetooth. always unknown device. no tray icon no nothing.&nbsp;I'm very frustrated.</p>

            <p>KhakedJoudeh.&nbsp; What registry fix did you use please.&nbsp; I am having the exact same problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Bluetooth devices will not maintain connection.&nbsp; Devices and Printers window indicates a problem with Bluetooth drivers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>MS troubleshooting does not help. (says can't fix the problem)</p>
<p>Bluetooth drivers will not update (says I have the latest version)</p>
<p>Dell troubleshooting does not work</p>
<p>No driver download/install available from MS</p>
<p>No driver download/install available from Dell</p>
<p>No driver download/install available from Atheros</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I love this new Inspiron 15r 5537 and I am enjoying W8. but I will send it back to Dell&nbsp;if I can't get some support here...</p>

<h3> thorny264  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft store missing&#47; You&#39;ll need a new app to open this - ms-windows-store</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Following a reset on one of my PCs, the microsoft store is missing and so far I've been unable to get it back. It doesn't appear in the start menu or search and no games/apps will launch. Attempting to launch a game gives the ""You'll need a new app to open
 this - ms-windows-store"" error.</p>
<p>It also doesn't appear in the app list in settings.<br />
<br />
What I've tried so far:<br />
<br />
Resetting again but no change<br />
<br />
Doing wsreset.exe on run but that just opens a blank CMD window for about 3-4 minutes then a popup appears saying "You'll need a new app to open this - ms-windows-store"<br />
<br />
Running the following in elevated powershell:<br />
<br />
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}<br />
<br />
That gets mostly through it but fails as cortana is still open, tried stopping cortana in task manager but it always comes back instantly<br />
<br />
Ran the windows troubleshooter which attempts to reset and open the store but says the cache may be damaged when it finishes but not fixed<br />
<br />
Installing a 3rd party program (10appsmanager) to add or remove windows apps, uninstalled and reinstalled through this but no change</p>
<p><br />
created a new user account on same PC which has same issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can try?<br />
<br />
Cheers,</p>

            <p>Hi Raju,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not worry Raju, it can be fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart the phone a few times and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check for&nbsp;updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the&nbsp;issue persists, reset the phone and check. Resetting your Windows phone will return it to the same state it was in the first time you turned it on. All of your personal content will be erased, and the phone will be restored to its factory settings.&nbsp;If
 you decide to reset your phone, you can back up apps, text messages, and more in the cloud beforehand.

<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, then you need to go back to previous version of Windows using WRT and then re-install Windows.</p>

<h2>            Fallout 76 Refund Not Eligible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought Fallout 76 with high hopes, but after playing for a while my data has been erased nearly three times. One time, all of my progress was deleted, and twice over all of my inventory items deleted (This is all post-release, not in the beta.) I understand
 you cannot get refunds after 30 days of purchase, but this game is defective and broken on my side, and I would like my money back as it is not the product as advertised. I want to know why they will not give me my money back.</p>

            <p>Hi Alex,&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glad to hear from you.&nbsp; I am running Windows xp (all service packs loaded) on an HP pavilion dv9000 series laptop computer.&nbsp; My problems are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; Very high memory use and cpu use in windows internet explorer, google chrome and also when I first boot up the computer.&nbsp; In addition task manager often shows high memory use by svchost.exe.&nbsp; At times there will be many svchost processes even when I
 am not running any programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2&nbsp; Thinking that it would be malware of some kind I ran malwarebytes, pcmatic, three amigos and advanced system care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3&nbsp; I attempted to run the same as in step 2 during safe mode with networking.&nbsp; I started with malewarebytes.&nbsp; As soon as I start the program the computer shuts down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4&nbsp; Also the computer boots fine in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What could cause the&nbsp;the problems and what can I do to make repairs?&nbsp; I am not a tech but I do have a little knowledge about computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Some malware knows the products you might use to try to find it and get rid of it and prevents them from running.&nbsp; They all hate Malwarebytes.<br />
<br />
MBAM is top drawer for me, but it it won't start, you might want to look on their support pages for ideas like this:<br />

            <p>If MBAM is already installed on pc, you can go to program files, malwarebytes, chameleon and run from there, there is a help file to help you know which .exe to run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it is made for when malware won't let mbam run.</p>

<h2>            Looking for a decent Halo 3&#47;ODST&#47;Reach clan.</h2>
                    
<p>Howdy, I have no idea how recruitment works, so I'll just be brief.</p>
<p>I'm looking for a Halo clan, for several reasons. I'd love to improve my skills, have a solid group of players that I can have matches with, and even work on finishing off some remaining achievements together if needed or possible. My stats are pretty easy
 to find on Bungie, but to say them here, I'm a Commander G1 with a 0.95 KDR on Reach, mainly because I spend a great deal of time in Arena, and if not there, I'll be on Team Classic, BTB, Infection, or occasionally MLG for kicks. On Halo 3, I'm a Captain with
 just above a 1.0 in ranked, and about a 1.1 in social slayers, I usually play Lone Wolves, SWAT, or some sort of BTB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not too knowledgeable on strats or calls, but I pick up things pretty fast, and I'm a pretty good sport, I don't rage or teammate blame, I play for fun while playing to win.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you have a clan out there that's pretty good, and willing to take on an extra and work with me a bit, give me a reply, and we'll see what happens.</p>

<p><b>Hello I am <i>Specialist</i> <u>ODST Venomous</u> of Charlie Company in the Dropshock Brigade, I'd like to offer you a chance to be in one of the most mature, active and structured clan around. Currently we have 36 members who are from different parts
 of the world, whether its the U.S., U.K., Canada, or Australia. We have three companies, basically three sections of the clan that you can be put into depending on your location. Our clan is filled with great members who like to have fun and be competitive,
 sometimes at the same time . If this clan interests you, please read on:</b></p>
<p><u><b>I. Basics</b></u></p>
<p><b>Introduction:</b> We are the Dropshock Brigade ( http://www.dropshock.net ). We are the best the UNSC has to offer. We are the protectors of earth and all of her colonies. We are the fastest, strongest, and craziest in the universe. We are an all volunteer
 outfit.</p>
<p><b>Motto:</b> <i>"I am an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper. Those words may be used often but we are unique. We are the best trained, best equipped, and craziest outfit in this collection of colonies we call the UNSC. I will defend her to my last breath and give
 my enemies the death that can only be provided under the tread of my black combat boots. I am no normal marine. I push my mind, body, and soul further than most human beings ever will. I instill fear in my enemies as I drop from the heavens like the wrathful
 gods of Greek lore. I show no mercy. I show no fear. I am a UNSC Helljumper and I go feet first."</i></p>
<p>"Feet First Into Hell".</p>
<p><u><b>II. Enlistment</b></u></p>
<p><b>Enlisting:</b> There are 3 easy steps into getting into the Brigade.</p>
<p>1. Register on the site ( http://www.dropshock.net/register ). Please use your gamertag or something similar to it as your username.</p>
<p>2. After registering on the site, please fill out the Enlistment Form and then click submit. It is located on the bottom left on the website (where it says enlist today). Make sure to fill everything out and read the page following the form. Also put ODST
 Venomous as your recruiter.</p>
<p>3. Attain the minimum merit requirement(varies by age). The merit system is a type of points system in which you are rewarded for posting in our forums. You must attain 100 merit before taking boot camp.</p>
<p><u>Merit Earnings</u></p>
<p>+3 merit per new thread</p>
<p>+2 merit per reply</p>
<p>+1 merit per shoutbox post</p>
<p>Failure to heed to a warning will result in loss of merit or overall denial of your enlistment request.</p>
<p><u><b>III. What We Have To Offer</b></u></p>
<p>Ribbons- In the Brigade, a ribbon signifies a soldier who has achieved a certain requirement and has been rewarded a ribbon for it. These ribbons are shown on your site profile. You may see yours and other ODST's ribbons on the side of each post. To receive
 these awards is a very great honor.</p>
<p>Promotions- Promotions in the Dropshock Brigade are given upon either the completion of a training, or the achievement of a quota. Be active, loyal, show leadership, achieve merit, etc and you may just receive a promotion. Do NOT ask for a promotion. Doing
 so will most likely result in a demotion or loss of merit.</p>
<p>Organization- We are a well organized clan with a Roster. Personnel are organized into divisions based upon where they live, and what timezone they are in. We have a wide variety of forums to discuss different things with other members.</p>
<p>Gaming- Unlike a lot of clans, we do actually play games with members. We play Matchmaking a lot, the playlist varying on how many members are on. If we begin to get 7-8 or more we switch over to custom games and have fun. We have game nights usually around
 weekends at nights(EST time) and play whatever.</p>
<p><b>IV. Ranking Structure</b></p>
<p>(Highest to Lowest)</p>
<p>~ Lieutenant Colonel</p>
<p>Commanding Officer of the Brigade</p>
<p>~ Major</p>
<p>Executive Officer of the Brigade</p>

<p>The more detailed Ranking Structure explains everything about each rank.</p>
<p><b>V. Lastly</b></p>
<p><b>As you can see, we are a very organized clan, and have been around for a while now. It's a great place to meet new friends, learn how to play better, play competitively, or a place to call home. We are the best around, and "We Go Feet First!"</b></p>

<h2>            disable permanently Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated to the latest slow ring Win 10 insider build, and this strange driver appeared and enabled suddently along with my wifi card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling it doesn't work, it makes another one appear (as "Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter #X ) same for uninstalling it from the device manager. It just keeps appearing without my permission</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to kill this driver/service definitively, is causing severe problems to my external wifi adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: I been using Windows 10 for a long time and the driver suddenly appeared after I updated to the latest insider build.</p>

                    <p>Computer went to a BSoD&nbsp;with a stopcode&nbsp;of "Kernal Security Check Failure". Computer habitually does not reboot after the dmp&nbsp;files download. I manually&nbsp;powered the computer down, let it sit for about a minute and powered it back up. Computer cleared POST,
 shows that it is reading all the drives. I get the Windows logo and the idiot lights running in a circle, but after several minutes windows has not come up. Usually, it takes less than a minute for Windows to launch. Powered the computer down again, powered
 back up, checked the BIOS settings, all look okay. Proceed on. We re-boot, POST looks normal. Windows just sits there spinning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Win 10 Pro 1607 (not sure of the build) .&nbsp;Frustration level is just about at the point where I am ready to "adjust" this computer with a sledgehammer.</p>

            <p>Fortunately, at some point, I managed to get the computer to boot to Windows and was able to uninstall the recently installed software that I suspected was the root cause of my problems. Since that time I have not had a reoccurrence of the BSoD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Post-Mortem, I found a lot of what happened was my own damn fault. You would think that after all my years in Tesh Support and Change Management I would know better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the exact sequence of events that led to my problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I installed supplemental software that came with my ASUS M5A97 LE Release 2.0 Mainboard.</p>
<p>2. Sometime after the install of the above software, Driver Booster 4,0 (normally a benign and helpful utility) advised that drivers for my Asmedia USB 3.0 hub were out of date. Allowed the program to install new drivers.</p>
<p>3. Noticed that Windows was not "seeing" any of the USB 3.0 devices attached to the Asmedia&nbsp;hub now. Recalled that there was "USB 3.0 Booster" Utility included in the Supplement&nbsp;ASUS software. It said no devices attached either. Concluded that installation
 of new drivers via Driver Booster had overwritten or otherwise killed the USB 3.0 Booster software.</p>
<p>4. Re-installed the USB 3.0 Booster software by itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shortly after that the BSoD's started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem&nbsp;was apparently resolved by uninstalling the Supplemental ASUS software in it's entirety.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under lessons learned, here are the critical mistakes I made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Failed to have "Crash Media" (DVD/USB) on hand prior to starting this operation.</p>
<p>2, Failed to create a Restore Point prior to installing an application that could possibly change the Operating Environment.</p>
<p>3, The Biggest Mistake: being overconfident.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moral of the Story: No matter how much you know, or, <em>think you know</em> about computers and/or Windows,
<strong>never, ever</strong> tinker "under the hood" without a means of falling back. Take it from a guy who spent over 25 years in Tech Support and has been with Windows practically from the beginning, (I was on the Windows 3.0 Beta team,) and who just got
 bit by his own arrogance.</p>
