<h2>            windows crashed and nothing works cannot reboot cannot use recover f11 at boot doesnt work.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;could see c: drive at command prompt and have copied files.&nbsp; I did create a recovery drive on a usb only a few weeks ago, but it will not work either</p>
<p>
</p><p>have tried switching from UEFI to legacy and that doesnt seem to have worked either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>While it could have been a virus, have had up to date Norton Premium always running, so i think it is more likely to have been a windows crash or hardware failure than a virus?</p>
<p>
</p><p>how do i rebuild this pc?&nbsp; it is a fairly new Lenovo desktop with 2014 components.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it was only using about 400 GB of 2TB HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop (also running windows 10) crashed about 3 weeks earlier, but I got that one repaired at the computer shop.&nbsp; I am reluctant to keep spending £60 every few weeks if there is a problem with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help appreciated</p>

            I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:<br /><br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to restart PC three times to trigger the Startup Options.<br /> <br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a><br /><br />Insert

<p>Thanks for prompt reply, but unfortunately it doesnt work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC goes straight into automatic repair from restart (after running "diagnosing your pc".&nbsp; I can either restart or go to advance options:</p>
<p>1. exit and continue toWindows 10 -..... doesnt work .... goes around the diagnosing loop again.</p>
<p>2.Use a device - goes to Keyboard layout choose language..... when i choose language it goes around the loop again.</p>
<p>3. Troubleshoot........... has a: reset this PC&nbsp; OR b: Advance Options-&nbsp; &nbsp;has i: keep my files or ii) remove everything</p>
<p>................ option i) keep my files has "there was a problem resetting this PC. No changes were made.&nbsp; GET same&nbsp; 'problem resetting' with remove everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp; so go on to advanced option which are:</p>
<p>1 - system restore - but it says that no system restore points have been created&nbsp; ( however from the command prompt i think i can see one)</p>
<p>2 - system image recovery - but there isnt one</p>
<p>3 - startup repair - couldnt repair your pc</p>
<p>4 - command prompt -- can see c drive</p>
<p>5 - startup settings - just goes around the loop again</p>
<p>6- go back to previous version - we ran into a problem and wont be able to take you back to the previous version....</p>
<p>
</p><p>so - if nothing at all is going to work - how do i reformat the drive and re-install windows?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Karen.  Have you tried the repairs from the Booted media per the steps I gave yet?  These sometimes will work better as it's a more stable platform that uses files in the media instead of a possibly corrupted hard drive.
<br />
<br />If that isn't fruitful then I gave how to do the best possible reinstall and even if necessary rescue your files first in Steps 6 and 7.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Reset your UEFI firmware to Defaults so that you boot the media as a UEFI device only.  
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Karen, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h2>            Headphone 3.5mm Jack doesn&#39;t output sound correctly</h2>
                    Hi there,
<div>I recently updated to Windows 8 and installed everything fine, however I have noticed when I plug in my headphones or speakers into the 3.5mm headphone jack, the sound is very bad. I can hear the music but it seems a bit fading, you cannot hear the lyrics
 and only hear certain parts. I have the latest update Audio drivers from Realtek. When sound is playing from the Internal Speakers on the laptop it plays all music fine.&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            Have tried all of the above,
<div>Yes in the previous version Windows 7 64bit, everything was working perfectly. Playing from internal speakers is perfectly fine, however when plugged anything into the headphone jack the music becomes disorientated regardless if it headphones or external
 speakers.</div>

            Lot's of people are having trouble with headphones in Windows 8, it's clearly a serious problem. But everywhere you go you get the exact same steps of solution which invariably don't work. My headphones work perfectly for a while then some days at random
 they just completely don't. I'm betting it's got something to do with the&nbsp;disastrous&nbsp;Windows Update program.

<h3> foslt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Driver conflict amd radeon 8670M on windows 8.1, windows can&#39;t properly shut down&#92;hybernate&#92;ecc</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hello everybody,<br />
</p>
<p>I've a Dell Inspiron 15R 5537 equipped with an Intel HD Graphics 4400 and an AMD Radeon HD 8670M 2GB DDR3, driver Intel Graphic 15.33.18.64.3496 and AMD Mobility Radeon 14.4, windows 8.1 64 bit updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In "device manager" everything is fully installed and drivers are updated to the last version.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My problem is: I can't shut down\hibernate\suspend\close the lid properly. No probelm in rebooting.<br />
When I click on "shut down" windows starts the shutting down process but at the end of it the computer power stays on with black\empty screen, and then I can only hold the power button to turn it off.&nbsp;<br />
From windows the only way I can correctly shut down the pc is by pressing "shift" and clicking on "shut down".<br />
<br />
Almost the same goes with the hibernation\suspension\closing the lid, when hibernating at the end of the process the power doesn't go off and again I can only hold the power button; when suspended\lid closed I can't awake the OS and one more time I can only
 hold the power button.<br />
<br />
I've tried a clean boot but that does not change a thing.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty confident the problem is some conflict with the amd driver, in fact if I uninstall the amd graphic card and its drivers from the device manager, then windows works properly (except the device obviously). But if I reinstall the driver the problems
 come back again.<br />
<br />
So, what can I do? How can I have the amd card installed and windows working properly?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help, much appreciated.</p>

            <p>Ok finally I've found the solution to my problem, I'll write it here so that maybe can help sombody else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First and formost I was wrong, it wasn't the amd driver but the intel ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solutions was quite simple, yet it has take me some time to figure out:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not install the drivers suggested in the dell product page, in windows update or in &nbsp;intel\amd websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If already installed you need to uninstall the devices and their drivers from the device manager.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Install these and only these drivers downloaded from here:</span></p>
<p>http://www.dell.com/support/home/sg/en/sgbsd1/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=Y3FHH&amp;osCode=WB64A&amp;fileId=3287881735&amp;languageCode=EN&amp;catego&amp;dgc=SM&amp;cid=266884&amp;lid=5009646</p>
<p>http://www.dell.com/support/home/sg/en/sgbsd1/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=C50TD&amp;osCode=WB64A&amp;fileId=3291482091&amp;languageCode=EN&amp;catego&amp;dgc=SM&amp;cid=266884&amp;lid=5009361</p>
<p>It's important to install the intel driver before the amd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's it, hope it helps.</p>

<p>What version of Windows are you using?</p>

<p>One of the files necessary for the game to initialize is missing.&nbsp; You may need to uninstall the game and make sure your OS is updated with the most recent frame work.</p>

    <title>Searching a download for Windows 8.1 Pro x64, I have a product key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> semx11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Searching a download for Windows 8.1 Pro x64, I have a product key</h2>
                    <p>What's going on:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A year ago, I upgraded my system from W7 to W8, by buying &amp; downloading it from the Microsoft Site. Because I had 32-bit W7, I got the 32-bit W8.</p>
<p>This means I have a valid product/license key. Currently, I am still running 32-bit Windows 8.</p>
<p>If I am correct, I can download Windows 8/8.1 64-bit version with the same license key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I bought a SSD, and I'd like to install Windows 8.1 x64 on it.</p>
<p>I think I need to do that with an USB stick, and that it can install it from that. However, I do not know where I can download Windows 8.1 x64, with or without using my license key, and then activate Windows with that key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I want to get a download link for 8.1 x64, and that I can download it on an USB so I can boot my new PC from that USB.</p>
<p>I have never actually installed Windows on a machine, but somebody's helping me with that. I do have built my own PC's, so I don't really know how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help me with this, thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sem</p>

            <p>No, you can't use a Windows 8 or 8 Pro key with Windows 8.1 install media. If you have key for Windows 8 or Windows 8 Pro, you need to install it first, then upgrade to Windows 8.1 through the Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To install an upgrade version of Windows 8, you must already have Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP installed on your PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you formatted the drive before the upgrade version of Windows 8 was installed, you won't be able to use your upgrade product key to activate Windows 8. To activate Windows 8, you'll need to install your previous version of Windows, and then reinstall
 Windows 8. For help with the activation process, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=260480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>

</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>- Make sure you apply the latest updates before upgrading.</p>
<p>- Try switching to a wired connection if you are downloading over Wi-Fi</p>
<p>- Disable/uninstall any third party Antivirus you might have installed prior to updating.</p>
<p>- Do a clean boot.</p>

<p>2. You have not installed all pending Windows Updates. You can find details <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/why-can-t-find-update-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>If you are having issues with installing Windows Update we recommend you post for help with that issue.
</p>
<p>You may also attempt an automated fix by running the Windows Update troubleshooter</p>
<p>3. You need to sync your App License; you can do this by:</p>
<p>* On the Start screen, tap or click Store to open the Windows Store. </p>
<p>* Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Settings.</p>
<p>(If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then click Settings.)
</p>
<p>* Tap or click App updates </p>
<p>* Tap or click Sync licenses </p>
<p>4. The Windows Store Catalog is not refreshing correctly. </p>
<p>To refresh the catalog, try pressing the Windows and R key together to open the run box, type WSReset.exe and hit Enter. Reboot and check the Windows Store again.</p>

<p>Nintendo isn't ever this bad, but they are in their own World. When I buy a console, I want the most powerful one with the best multiplatform games. Nintendo doesn't offer that. Sony is offering that for Next Gen, and I respect Mark Cerny. Go read up about
 him. He was the main guy who designed the PS4</p>

<p>If I could say this. Spread the word about how the forum is handling people's opinion here and how there are sticking the post that support the Xbox 1. This is wrong we should have our say and say it as much we like just as same of those supporter for X1.

<p>I still don't see how the forum is being mishandled. There is a stickied thread for the aggregated issues that have threads being made every 10 minutes including official statements straight from xbox.com, threads appear to only be deleted if they're blatantly
 anti-Xbox with no substance or explanation (or poor explanation with little room for civil discussion). There are still many negative opinion threads floating around and still being contributed to. What's the deal?</p>

<p>It's clearly not balanced censorship though is it?</p>
<p>The planted fan boy rants have been have been hitting page one and two consistently for some time now without anything of substance other than 'hater bashing' and encouraging little kids who want forum badges and don't understand what's going on to back
 them up.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You want civil discussion, I'm totally open to that. I think a dialogue with the entire community lovers and haters is a good thing (that could possibly give m$ a shred of dignity and room to admit failure) but we're not going to get one with biased damage
 control censorship running riot and I wouldn't even try to broker anything like that while it's happening.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)">Nintendos problem was that the ps3 and xbox were similar to one another. Since the xbox was released earlier than the others it ended up getting the most 3rd party AAA titles, Nintendo couldnt run the ports from the 360 because
 they had to be heavily trimmed or drastically altered (just look at the dead rising port)The playstation however could run them. Developers make their best games for the multiplatform.</span></p>

<h2>            Rainbow Six Siege, can&#39;t invite or join my friends party</h2>
                    Me and my brother have recently got Rainbow Six Siege on Xbox. We both have Xbox One s's. We can both play online in games and have Xbox Gold. But when we try to join each others parties we can't. We cannot join or invite each other to our parties. I have
 tried with my brother and one of friends and we both can't join or invite each other. Is there some thing I have to do inorder to be able to play in a party or is it a bug?

<p>Hello Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with joining your friend. This could be due to one or both of your NAT type. If the NAT is anything but open it will cause issues as joining each other in party or game. Here is a guide for
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
nat error solution</a>, it explains what NAT is and how to fix it.</p>

            Same thing here bro, its happened to me for years on multiple games. I have dedicated service through att. Xbox support will say the same thing every time, that its your internet service. It’s their go-to. You’re better off looking at youtube for help.
 Good luck!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least I have SSD and I&nbsp;only&nbsp;lost 1 hour.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are the two error messages (0x80070005 - 0x4000D) meaning?&nbsp; I do not know if this is common problem, however I was expecting more smooth upgrade process from MS.&nbsp;I was planning to upgrade my laptop&nbsp;to Win 8.1&nbsp;as well, instead I will have hold and struggle
 only with my PC.</p>

<p>I hope that you could come with workable solution.</p>

            <p>Hi luisflorespt,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you be more specific about any old admin profile in C:/user folder?&nbsp; What is an admin profile?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was stuck at 87% gathering info.&nbsp; Then, I deleted all user accounts except my main account with admin rights and one Admin account that I cannot delete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, the install went all the way to "fixing a few more things 3%" and stuck there with the pop-up that said the install must be restarted.&nbsp; And, hitting Enter cause the system to revert to my previous Windows which completed back to my Windows 8 PRO and
 no 8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the error 0x80070005-0x4000D was shown as the reason for no install.&nbsp; Still, some progress but still no complete install.&nbsp; I have no idea what this error points to and a search in IE and in the MS Community provided nothing that help gain a complete
 install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did notice a new Windows Update file and I installed it but still the install would not complete.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked moving my "user" file from my boot drive to another HD but the size is tremendous at over 10.5GB and noted that it would take 4 hours to move.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still looking for help to get a complete install.</p>

            1st of all, have you tried the method 1 and 2 above described?
<div><br />
<div>you did the correct thing on the users account. so, that should be ok.</div>
<div><br />
<div>another question: is your windows installition in english us? if not, change it in the control panel.</div>
<div><br />
<div>then, try all again: method 1 and then the 2.</div>

            <p>Yes, tried methods 1 and 2 with no success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, my installation is English.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, during the install I reach "install a few more things 3%" and then get the error 0x80070005-0x4000D with the comment to reinstall 8.1 and my system is pushed back to my Windows 8 PRO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cannot find a fix for this error.&nbsp; Did install a new Windows update that showed up.&nbsp; But, it made no difference.</p>

<p><font color="#000000">Thanks -- something similar worked for&nbsp;me.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Although the userid I was using to update to win 8.1 was a member of the administrators group, my user account apparently did not have access to all the user accounts on the machine.<br />
<br />
I did not have to delete these accounts.&nbsp; Rather, I clicked on each user account, whereby a dialog popped up telling me I did not currently have access but would I still like to continue. After clicking on continue, full access was granted.&nbsp; I was then able
 to return to the windows store and update to win 8.1 without any problem. <br />
<br />
(This is an artifact&nbsp;left over from the early days of Windows 7, where belonging to an administrators group did not give you full control.&nbsp; I am still unclear as to why Microsoft thought this was a useful control.)</font></p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>Be sure to check with your System Maker's Support, on-line documentation and&nbsp;drivers,
<br />
and ask in their forums&nbsp;(if any) where there would be others with the same model&nbsp;if a built-in
<br />
WebCam&nbsp;or the actual WebCam Maker if a separate device. Links to HP&nbsp;Support below.<br />
<br />
Check the Start - All Programs Menu for&nbsp;Camera,&nbsp;WebCam, a Folder/Program with the System
<br />
Maker's name or similar to see if you can locate the WebCam software.<br />
<br />
These may help :<br />

<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Troubleshooting methods if needed :<br />
<br />
Troubleshoot camera connection problems<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software (usually included<br />
with the drivers and&nbsp;installed at the same time).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Imaging - write down make and model of camera - double click<br />
on it and on driver's tab get version. Now click Update Drivers (which may not do anything as MS<br />
is far behind certifying drivers). The RIGHT CLICK on the camera - UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and download the latest camera driver and other related camera<br />
software (if no newer get the same ones).<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to them and RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN - reboot after each driver.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers.<br />
<span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
<span>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
</span><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
</span><span><br />
Then leave windows updates on however stop it from loading drivers which are often older than the<br />
ones you have installed. If Updates suggests a driver then HIDE it and look manually to see if their<br />
really is a newer one (at both system maker and device maker's sites).<br />

<h2>            USB wireless Mouse Driver Installation File Missing Entry</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to use a Microsoft Mobile Wireless Mouse 1000 - when I plug in the Nano receiver, Windows trys to install the driver but says -&nbsp;Windows found driver software for your device but has encountered an&nbsp;error while trying to&nbsp;install it. The driver installation
 file for this device is missing a necessary&nbsp;entry. This may be because the INF was written for Windows 95 or later. I'm running Windows Vista Home Premium.</p>
<p>Appreciate some help in resolving this please.</p>

<h2>            Problem adding a family member to my laptop</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to add my wife to my laptop in windows 10. I have gone into settings /accounts / family and other users and added my wife. It says that she can log in. When we go to the lock screen I can select my login and have no problem logging in. When we
 select my wife's login we put in he password and get the following message. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The ProfScv service failed the sign-in.</p>
<p>User profile cannot be loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried several times with the same results. What can I do to solve this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded my windows from 8.1 to 10 today. During the installing period, I got an error message: 0xC0000185, it says a required device isn't connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But after continuing the installation, the installation was completed, it seems working OK after login. But when I do login, my keyboard is funny, press \ key, the out put is #, press ", the output is @, and so on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are 1) does 0xC0000185 causes the keyboard problem?</p>
<p>2) if 0xC0000185 error is not relivent to the keyboard error, How to fix the keyboard error?</p>
<p>3) Do I need fix the 0xC0000185 error? and how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.<br />

            <p><span>Hi Stephen,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above issue might have occurred due to the following reasons:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Non-updated or corrupted keyboard drivers.</span></li><li><span>Default keyboard language layout change after upgrading to Windows 10.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we assist you further, did you get the above mentioned error code after upgrading to Windows 10?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The <strong>error code 0xC0000185</strong> might have occurred due to corrupted or missing boot files which might have been resolved on continuing with Windows 10 installation if you are not getting
 the error code any more on the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may be facing the above issue due to the changed keyboard layout/language on the computer. If the system language is different from the keyboard language set on the PC the above issue might
 occur. Setting the appropriate keyboard language layout according to the Region &amp; language set on the computer might help in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

                    I'm having problems changing my Resolution to 1080 but I can't since the adjuster is locked. I have tried to uninstall and reinstall the GTX 960 and updating drivers and to no such luck. but my GPU is showing code 43 which I seem to not be able to get
 rid of either. My BIOS also shows up at 800x600 and cant change much on it either. Need Help since I can't figure out how to fix it.

<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Here are four ways:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">2. Write (for example in Notepad) a 1-line text file:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">DIR %1 /O &gt;LPT1:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Save it as "printdir.bat" in the "Send To" folder.</span></p>

<br />
<br />Then you can re-install that printer . . .

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately there's not an option inside Windows that restore printers, and yes you can install the printer without the CD, just go to the manufacturer website and look for your exact printer model drivers and software.
<br />
<br />Regards.

<h2>            High DPC latency overnight and high hard pagefault dxgkrnl.sys</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I've read other threads about that problem, this happened overnight and I can't work in my DAWs anymore...</p>
<p>I also experienced some crackling and popping when reading simple audio with Vlc or online sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run a Windows Performance Recorder but I don't really know what to look for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked my ram with a memtest, checked my drives with crystaldisk, all my drivers are updated. And I've installed all win7 updates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi SebWam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either software or hardware issues may be causing issue with dxgkrnl.sys or (DirectX Graphics Kernel). For us to isolate the issue, please answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What's the make and model of your computer? Is it a laptop or a desktop?</li><li>Any recent changes before the issue occurred?</li><li>What's the current driver version of your graphics card?</li></ul>
<p>For now, please download the latest driver for your graphics card from the manufacturer's website then uninstall your current driver in Device Manager. Reboot your computer and install the driver that you have downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your response.</p>

<p>Hello, it's a desktop,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>motherboard msi gaming 970</p>

<p>16Go Ram&nbsp;</p>

<p>sound card : onyx blackbird firewire</p>
<p>
</p><p>No change before this happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the last on Nvidia's website which is 397.64.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did made a clean install of only the graphic driver (no 3d sound fancy driver nor Geforce experience)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run a windows performance analyzer, here's the link, might be helpful, 'cause I don't really know how to interpret those datas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the update. Based on the information that has been provided in the thread, I believe that your GPU is failing. To remove the possibility that this is a hardware issue, please disable your graphics driver in Device Manager then plug your HDMI or
 VGA to your computer's built-in graphics port.</p>

<p>Unfortunately my motherboard does not have any HDMI or VGA plugs. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have however a Geforce gtx 550 ti that I could plug instead the gtx 650 ti. But it's using the same driver as my current graphic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will it help if :&nbsp; &nbsp; - I replace my graphic card by the old one and run WPR?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - I just disable the Nvidia driver and run WPR?</p>
