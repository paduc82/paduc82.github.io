<h2>            Error - Windows shell common dll stopped working</h2>
                    
<p>Upgraded a 4-yr old Dell XPS 600 with original&nbsp;NVIDIA MB and&nbsp;dual GeForce 6800&nbsp;SLI graphics cards from Win XP x32 to Win 7 x64 Ultimate N and boosted RAM to 8G.&nbsp; Clean install of Win 7 went smooth and the computer&nbsp;was stable and fast.&nbsp; Then upgraded all&nbsp;hardware
 drivers to Win 7&nbsp;x64,&nbsp;reinstalled all apps that Win 7 Advisor said were compatible, and found everything worked - EXCEPT the audio.&nbsp; After trying everything suggested on multiple Forums I finally uninstalled and reinstalled all hardware, graphics, and&nbsp;Sound
 Blaster&nbsp;X-fi ExtremeMusic&nbsp;drivers.&nbsp; Now I have noticed that when I access Control Panel-Sound-Speakers-Properties-and clk on the Sound Blaster tab I get the error message shown in the Title of this thread.&nbsp; I have recently acquired some updated settings info
 for the Sound Blaster sound card, but with the error message coming up whenever I access the tab noted, it is not possible to configure the sound card.&nbsp; I have already tried running the Win System File checker from the Command Line prompt&nbsp;via &nbsp;sfc /scannow
 , and that reports no file problems.&nbsp; Likewise I have purchased and scanned the system with two different recommended reg and sys file fixers with no positive results.</p>
<p>So, the question is: how can I&nbsp;reconfigure or fix the OS software to eliminate the "Windows shell common dll stopped working" error message when I attempt to configure my sound card?</p>

<p>I found the fix for my problem with "windows Shell Common Dll has stopped working", and it could be a fix for other related issues posted in this forum section.&nbsp; In a nutshell the problem had to do with Certificants and the running of Scripts to allow Certificates.&nbsp;&nbsp;According
 to Win 7 help, Certificates&nbsp;"are used primarily to verify the identity of a person or
device, 
authenticate a service, or encrypt files.&nbsp; In my case I had upgraded a number of older device drivers after installing Win 7 x64 onto an older Dell computer, and also installed several x86 applications -- some of which
 apparently&nbsp;had issues involving Certificates for authentication of identities after the install.&nbsp; The fix involved using the new Win 7 Power Shell Scripting capability to alter which Certificates are accepted by Win 7.&nbsp; The link below will take you to an excellent
 explanation of Power Shell and how to easily alter Win 7 to accept some or all Certificates.&nbsp; Turns out the default setting&nbsp;on my Win 7 was&nbsp;"Restricted" which blocks all Certificates, and via some very simple Command Line entries one can check their Win 7
 setting and alter the default setting.&nbsp; Use of Power Shell completely eliminated my problem.</p>

            To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />

            Hi Sonof
<br />
<br />The minidump file indicates your ATI graphics card device driver as the root cause of that crash
<br />
<br />If that was a one-off crash, I would not worry too much about this. If that persists, you should note down the exact model No. of that device,  uninstall that device driver then download and install the latest version of the driver from the AMD website along with its associated software and install that . . .

<p><strong>Oh dear ... I'm really in trouble!</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
<li><span><span>I started using an external USB drive and backup program. It makes both Image and File backups</span></span></li><li><span><span>I have 3 physical HD’s in my computer. 2 came with the computer and the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; was from a previous computer ( Drive H: )</span></span></li><li><span><span>When I ran the backup program, it was, to my surprise, auto-configured to make an image of Drive H, but of course, it should make it for Drive C</span></span></li><li><span><span>I contacted support for the backup drive and they said there was no way to change the drive and that it selected the first physical drive for the image
 backup</span></span> </li><li><span><span>I thought that odd since the two original drives, including drive C, naturally, came installed with the computer. The 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; drive I added should
 not have been the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; physical drive, but it should appear as Drive H, which it did. The drive name was correct, but the computer saw it as the first physical drive.</span></span></li><li><span><span>So, I opened Disk Management and sure enough, Drive H: was listed at the top as Drive 0, along with it’s 3 partitions. Drive C was listed as Drive 1</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Wanting a workaround, I opened Explorer, right-clicked the drive H, clicked the Hardware tab, highlighted the drive, clicked Properties at the bottom,
 then the Driver tab, then the Disable button.</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Then, I restarted my computer, ran the backup on the external drive, and this time it configured itself to backup drive C instead of H. So far, so good.</span></span></li><li><span><span>When it finished backing up, I reversed the above steps and Enabled drive H once again and rebooted</span></span></li><li><span><span>Then I went back into Disk Manager and was horrified to only see one large partition for Drive H. The other 2 did not show up.</span></span></li><li><span><span>How do I recover the other partitions???</span></span></li><li><span><span>Just rebooted and now the drive is totally missing from Explorer but it shows up normally in BIOS</span></span></li></ol>

<p><span>Hi hxl77,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you still have the data on your drive H? Is it accessible?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you try disabling it again and then re-enabling the driver for the hard drive?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As of now, I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Use the DiskPart command to manage the partitions on your hard disk volumes</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start; in the start search type cmd.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on cmd.exe and choose to run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type
 the following command and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Diskpart</span></strong><span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Diskpart\&gt;<strong>List Disk</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Diskpart\&gt;<strong>Select Disk O </strong>(Disk number refers to the Hard Disk)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Diskpart\&gt;<strong>List Volume</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Check
 if it displays the partitions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: You can use the partition name instead of the drive name argument, for example, \<strong>Device\HardDisk0\Partition1</strong>. If you use
 no arguments, a user interface for managing your partitions appears.<br />
<br />
<strong>Warning</strong> If you use this command on a disk that has a dynamic disk configuration, you may damage the partition table. Do not modify the structure of dynamic disks unless you are using the Disk Management tool.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Try installing the drivers for the hard drive</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If your hard drive came with the driver disc, then I would suggest you to try installing the drivers for the hard drive and check if the partition
 re-appears.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, if your hard drive came with a diagnostic utility, then try using the utility for that hard drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>

                    <p>Boa tarde,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eu cancelei a assinatura do game pass do xbox one e depois me arrenpendi. Fui reativar a assinatura e por engano, reativei duas vezes a mesma assinatura. Constam as duas na minha conta (29,00 duas vezes). Como eu consigo cancelar uma delas?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[Edit - Translation] - <span>I canceled the game pass signing of xbox one and then I quit.</span></strong>
<strong><span>I reactivated the subscription and mistakenly re-signed the subscription twice.</span></strong>
<strong><span>Both are on my account (29.00 twice).</span></strong> <strong><span>How can I cancel one of them?</span></strong></p>

<p>Hi Kaitlyn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows do not provide any feature for protecting files or folders with a password. However, file encryption helps protect your data by encrypting it.&nbsp; You can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click (or press and hold) a file or folder and select&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced</strong>&nbsp;button and select the&nbsp;<strong>Encrypt contents to secure data</strong>&nbsp;check box.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>OK&nbsp;</strong>to close the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Attributes</strong>&nbsp;window, select&nbsp;<strong>Apply</strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Note:</em><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><em>Encrypting is only available in Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you may be able to find a third party software online which can perform such task.</p>
<p><span><br />
</span><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from
 the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other concerns, please don't hesitate to keep us posted.</p>

            I received an email with instructions in which I go into NtfsDisableEncryption to change the Value to 0. I restarted my PC and was hoping to see the box "Encrypt contents to secure data" not be grayed-out. However, it was still not letting me click on
 it.

            For this you must update the billing info in your Microsoft account. Here's how:
<ol>
<li>
Go to <a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/PaymentHub/Profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
account.microsoft.com</a> and sign in to the Microsoft account you want to update.
</li><li>
Select <strong>Edit profile</strong>, and then make the changes needed to update your billing information.</li></ol>

<p>Couple places to look all under account.live.com once signed in with your account&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to Payment and billing and go to address book email under preferred billing is where they will send receipts for purchases to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Click on Family if you are set as a child in the family it may be setup to receive emails when you make purchases also.</p>

            First, try signing out of the Microsoft Store. Click your Profile picture at the top right, click your account then sign out.
<br />
<br />Restart your computer, launch the Microsoft Store app, sign in again, then attempt downloading again. 
<br />
<br />Other things you can try...
<br />
<br />Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />Reinstall the Store:
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (Admin) 
<br />At the command prompt, type the following then hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.
<br />
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.

    <title>PCIMCIA card problem with Lattitude E5500 and Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tkconsult  say:</h3>
<h2>            PCIMCIA card problem with Lattitude E5500 and Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Latitude E5500 with windows 10 Pro version1089</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PCIMCIA compactflash adaptor is visible in Device manager, and when I insert a CF card into it, it is recognised correctly in "Devices and Printers" and "Safely Remove Hardware" as a "Kodak CF card". HOWEVER, I cannot find the card in Windows Explorer
 or any programs. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked fine until windows 10 was installed. Clearly there must be a missing link somewhere preventing it being displayed as a drive in explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions please?</p>

            Hi TKconsult 
<br />
<br />I am sorry, Dell only supports that laptop up to Windows Vista, you may experience difficulty getting some devices on that laptop, like the Compact Flash card reader t work in Windows 10, because Windows 10 device drivers are not available for that model . . .

<h2>            Flashing windows and disappearing menus</h2>
                    Running Windows 7 without any &nbsp;problems for two years. &nbsp;Installed via upgrade. &nbsp;About two weeks ago, started getting a blink or flash on open windows - not the whole screen, just the window border. &nbsp;The flashes are random, but happen every second or so
 on average, and often interfere with entering text or closing/moving the window, etc.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, at the same time, the start menu and other context menus disappear too fast for me to make any selection or type in text field. &nbsp;Have tried updating drivers, registry fixes, virus scans, disk repairs, etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Very annoying and makes it difficult to complete any task.</div>

            <p>Hey Meister Rorich,</p>

            The tutorial says you cannot install with Pro Pack product Key so how was Windows 8 or 8.1 originally installed on the PC?  That's how you'd need to install it then follow the specific instructions in Step 4 for how to add Pro Pack to it.

            From where did you buy Windows 8 Pro Student? AFAIK no such version exists.

<p>I have 3 email addresses and I did not update the password reset information on this account (*****@outlook) when I moved to a new residence in August of 2016.<br />
<br />
The password reset information Is showing the email address *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, but it seems to have another character added.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And it's showing my old telephone number: *** ***-****, which I could not carry to the new residence.<br />

I forward *** Email address is removed for privacy *** in its entirety to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***,<br />

                    <p>Original Title: USB 2.0 vs 3.0 " </p>
<p>I have a HP Photosmart c4280 Printer/Scanner. &nbsp;I have it connected to Lenovo Laptop via USB cable. &nbsp; I'm using it to scan, after working fine all day yesterday, when finished i completely disconnected it. &nbsp;Today I hooked it back up the same way and and the
 troubleshooter read "USB COMPOSITE DEVICE IS AN OLDER USB DRIVER AND MIGHT NOT WORK WITH USB 3.0". &nbsp;When i access the HP's settings it reads " YOU NEED A [WIA] DRIVER TO USE THIS DEVICE" &nbsp; It seem like some days it will scan and other days it will not. &nbsp;It's
 happened before, but somehow fixed itself and now it's returned to being uncooperative. &nbsp; I have three USB ports on the laptop and all say the same thing.</p>
<p>Any input would be helpful, Thank you.</p>

<br />Also go over the Power Plan Settings to make sure Display Timeout is set correctly, along with all others:

<h2>            Wireless adapter pro Xbox One se nenainstaluje automaticky&#91;Translation-Wireless adapter pro Xbox One is not installed automatically&#93;</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 30px">Dobrý den, koupil jsem si Xbox One ovladač s bezdrátovým adaptérem pro Win10.</p>
<p>Když jsem adaptér dal do počítače, čekal jsem, že se sám nainstaluje a můžu tedy v klidu začít používat produkt, ale nestalo se tak. Adaptér se nenainstaloval a když jsem se podíval do Správce zařízení, ukázalo mi to pod kolonkou "další zařízení" zařízení
 s názvem "XBOX ACC"</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7f93e25-0579-42b1-9db0-33465486a392?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7f93e25-0579-42b1-9db0-33465486a392?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Jediné, co mi Microsoft poradil, bylo odinstalovat a znovu připojit zařízení (což nepomohlo), jinak požádat o reklamaci.</p>
<p>Vyhledával jsem proto různé návody a našel jsem jeden, při kterém je potřeba najít ovladač manuálně a poté nainstalovat, jenže i když jsem prohledal seznam ovladačů skrz na skrz, nenašel jsem onen požadovaný (zkoušel jsem i jiné slibné, ale nefungovaly).
 Poté mě napadlo, že bych mohl ovladač najít a stáhnout na internetu - nejlépe na stránkách Microsoftu - ale nějak se jim podařilo všechno, co by uživatelé Windowsu potřebovali, ukrýt do nejhlubších hloubek internetu. Nakonec jsem narazil na stránku, kde člověk
 vysvětloval zcela totožný problém - a taky jej vyřešil - viz.&nbsp;<a href="https://mattpilz.com/fix-for-xbox-one-wireless-adapter-not-working-in-windows-10-xbox-acc-driver/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mattpilz.com/fix-for-xbox-one-wireless-adapter-not-working-in-windows-10-xbox-acc-driver/</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Jenomže i když jsem postupoval přesně podle instrukcí, v bodě 6 (tedy nalezení a instalace ovladače počítačem) se to</p>
<p>zvrtlo a já byl zase na začátku. Počítač můj soubor prostě nenalezl. Nepomohla ani přeinstalace systému.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Proto vás žádám o radu, jestli je vůbec ještě nějaká, mám totiž pocit, že už jsem zkusil všechno.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Děkuji.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>[Translation-Hello, I bought a Xbox One controller with a wireless adapter for WIN10.</strong><br />
<strong>When I put the adapter on my computer, I waited for it to install itself and so I can still start using the product, but it hasn't happened. The adapter was not installed and when I looked in Device Manager, it showed me under the box "Other devices

<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>The only thing Microsoft has advised me was to uninstall and reconnect the device (which did not help), otherwise ask for a complaint.</strong><br />
<strong>I searched for various tutorials and I found one in which it is necessary to find the driver manually and then install, but although I searched the list of drivers through to through, I did not find the desired (I tried other promising but did not work).
 Then I thought that I could find the driver and download it on the Internet-preferably on Microsoft's website-but somehow they managed to conceal everything that Windowsu users needed to hide into the deepest depths of the Internet. Finally, I came across
 a page where one explained a completely identical problem-and solved it-see https://mattpilz.com/fix-for-xbox-one-wireless-adapter-not-working-in-windows-10-xbox-acc-driver/</strong><br />
<strong>But even though I followed exactly the instructions, in point 6 (i.e. finding and installing the computer driver), this</strong><br />
<strong>And I was back in the beginning. My computer just couldn't find my file. It did not help or reinstall the system.</strong><br />
<strong>That's why I'm asking you for advice if there's any more, I feel like I've tried everything.</strong><br />
<strong>Thank.]</strong></p>

<p>Hello Vojtech,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your issue. There is a guide for <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-windows/accessories/troubleshoot-xbox-wireless-adapter-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
troubleshooting Xbox wireless adapter</a>. There is a section for adapter didn't auto install which is the first one. Try this out and let us know.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Because the drivers for the Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows are embedded within the Windows 10 operating system, the adapter should auto-install. If it doesn't, try the following solutions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Make sure your Windows 10 device is connected to the Internet. </li><li>Make sure your Windows 10 device is up to date by going to Windows Update on your device and checking for available updates.
</li><li>Reboot your device and try again. </li><li>Ensure your USB ports are not disabled in your Device Manager. </li><li>Try another USB 2.0 or 3.0 port. </li><li>Try reinstalling the drivers in case they have partially installed. To do so, you need to uninstall the drivers. Follow these steps to complete this process:
<ol>
<li>Go to your <strong>Device Manager</strong>. </li><li>Locate <strong>Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows</strong> in the <strong>Network adapters</strong> section.
</li><li>Click <strong>Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows</strong> to bring up the Properties window.
</li><li>Click on the <strong>Driver</strong> tab. </li><li>On the <strong>Driver</strong> tab, click the <strong>Uninstall </strong>button.
</li><li>On the confirmation window, check <strong>Delete the driver software for this device</strong>.
</li><li>Unplug the Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows and reboot your Windows 10 device. Once the device is back on, plug in the adapter.
</li><li>If the Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows still does not install, follow all of the above steps thoroughly one more time. If this doesn't work, your adapter needs to be replaced. See How to get service for
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-windows/accessories/xbox-wireless-adapter-for-windows-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
your Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows</a>. </li></ol>

<p>Where it is telling you to uninstall try the steps for the Xbox acc. you found.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p><span>Hi Dorothy,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is the device an USB/wireless mouse?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d recommend you to uninstall the device from device manager, restart the computer and let Windows 7 install the generic
 drivers. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Device-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open Device Manager</a>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Expand “Mice and other pointing devices.”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click the mouse and click “Uninstall.”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, enable windows updates to fetch the driver updates for your hardware device.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For instructions on installing drivers via windows update, refer the following article:

<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Won&#39;t lock on sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> progrenath  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Won&#39;t lock on sleep</h2>
                    I have my computer set to ask for a password when it wakes up from sleep but it doesn't ask me to sign back in. I made sure the settings were correct in both the Windows 10 settings and the control panel settings.<br />
<br />
Edit: 8-20-16 After I updated my computer I no longer have the issue. My computer requires my pin whether it sleeps on its own or if I manually put it to sleep. I don't know if the same is true for my email password and offline password.

            Now that I set up my Pin my computer will automatically sleep and that requires my pin on waking up. If I manually put my computer to sleep (either by the sleep button on my keyboard or by the start menu power option) it doesn't require a pin or password
 when it wakes up.

            <p>Unfortunately, neither method fixed the problem. Method 1, the troubleshooter couldn't find any problems. Method 2, The setting was already set to require a password on wake-up. I did change the setting to not require a password and then switched it back
 so that it now requires a password again, but that didn't help.</p>

            <p>I'm having the exact same problem. It started a couple weeks ago and has persisted through the anniversary update.</p>
<p><br />
Before the anniversary update, the setting would continue to say "when PC wakes from sleep". After the anniversary update, "when PC wakes from sleep" disappears from that box after waking from sleep and there is nothing selected.<br />
<br />
Method 1 and method 2 did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that Win+L does not lock my computer anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a <em>serious</em> security issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that pressing Windows key + L key does not lock your computer and even when your computer wakes up from sleep, it does not prompt for a password. The issue that you face could be due to some internal software conflicts. So, please try running
 a clean boot and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in</span><strong><span>Clean Boot </span></strong><span>state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform
 a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

</p><p>In the registry, I went to the following location: </p>

<p>I found an entry named "DisableLockWorkstation". It was set to 1, so I changed it to 0.</p>
