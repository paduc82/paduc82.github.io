<h2>            BANNED&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    


<p><span><span>I tried signing into XBOX.COM a few seconds ago and I can not sign in because I was banned, which is weird because I was able to sign in to XBOX.COM just a few hours ago. I called 1-800-4MY-XBOX and I was instructed to make my presence known
 about my suspension&nbsp;</span>on the XBOX LIVE support forum. I am going to repost my comment from today just to make sure my message is getting through.
</span></p>
<p><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;FROM TODAY&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;:</span></p>
<p><span>I was on my Xbox, while connected to XBOX LIVE; playing the R.U.S.E. Demo when I was disconnected from XBOX LIVE. When I went to re-sign in it notified me that I was banned until the date: 12/31/9999. Now I have checked my email and read the reason
 why I have been banned. I can honestly say that I have in no was shape of form used any means necessary to "<span>Offering to trade Xbox LIVE or in-game services for Microsoft Points or money".<b> I have been an XBOX LIVE GOLD member for 3 years.
</b>And because I have placed the Microsoft Point symbol in my profile, it is assumed that I have used measures to gain money from people on XBOX LIVE?. I have been nothing but a
<b>loyal customer</b> to Microsoft and its third-party member, such as buying video games.
<br />
<br />
Is there anything that can be done to resolve the issue? If the Microsoft enforcement team feels that I have still in fractured the rules then only take away my ability to type into my profile. Like I said I have been nothing then a loyal customer for 3 years,
 there must be something that can be done. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;My gamertag that was banned was: GENERAL CANADA</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank You,<br />
General Canada<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p>It always seems like the majority of bans are done to COD players who can't just play the game the way it's meant to be played. Enjoy your ban, they wouldn't ban you unless they had a damn good reason to.</p>

<p>You agree to a ToU and a CoC when you sign up to use this service meaning, you accept that Microsoft is the judge, jury and executioner in all things related to their service. &nbsp;If these are terms that you cannot accept, don't accept them, and don't use their
 service.</p>
<p>The XBLPET does not meander blindly through their network, willy-nilly banning people, for no reason. &nbsp;If you don't think that they have actual evidence of the offense that a user has committed stored on their servers, you'd be sadly mistaken. &nbsp;Have a peek
 at the Account Suspension and Ban Forums and notice how they can quote, verbatim, the exact messages (voice and text,) profile content and game play behaviour that has been the cause for the suspension or ban.</p>

<p>I am 21&nbsp;years old.&nbsp;My account at the family settings says I&nbsp;am an adult, but I can't change my online xbox privacy settings so that I&nbsp;can play with other people.&nbsp;And it pisses me off. Because I&nbsp;just bought a new game for 50 dollars, but I can't play it because of my xbox live privacy settings. when I try to change it, it says "unexpected error, please try again later.</p>

<p>please microsoft i beg you, fix this! or make it possible to change the&nbsp;account I'm using on the game. PS: the other article that says the same was from the wrong account.</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The D3DRM.DLL file is the Dynamic Link Library for Direct3D Retained Mode, an older DirectX display technology that was not included with Windows Vista. Direct3D is used to render three dimensional images in applications where performance is important;
 the most common examples of which are games, CAD drawing programs and graphics editing software.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This error is usually a sign that the d3drm.dll file has been deleted, corrupted or altered in such a way that makes it unusable to your program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I’d suggest you to do a System File Checker (SFC) scan on your computer. SFC tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.<br />
b. Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<br />
c. At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER:<br />
&nbsp;sfc /scannow</div>

<div>Also follow these steps and check if it helps.</div>
<div>a. Put in the disc of the program you're trying to run<br />
b. Go to Computer, right click on the disc in the DVD drive, and press Open<br />
c. Open folder called DirectX that contained files for DirectX , open that folder; otherwise find the D3DRM.DLL file online<br />
d. Find the D3DRM.DLL file, copy, and paste to C/Windows/SysWOW64</div>

<p>Yes. But it only happened once and I restarted and then the problem was fixed but I don't know if it could happen again ( so I want to understand why that could happen again if it ever will ) and I'm a little bit worried because if something's broken then....

            Hello,
<br />If that happens again, you can try reinstalling Display drivers.
<br />
<br />Please see the below options:
<br />Option 1.Try Rolling back if you have an option:
<br />Go to Device Manager by typing in Devmgmt.msc in Run dialog box. 
<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version. 
<br />Option 2. Remove drivers completely and Install the the newest ones available from the OEM or the maker.
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of Display driver using DDU
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the driver from the OEM or the maker like AMD
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.

            You could let the repair shop do a diagnosis. One thing you can do right now is make sure you backup all your files.

<p><strong>I started upgrading to Windows 7 from Win Vista and encountered a problem. During the installation the computer told me that there would be several system restarts during the install process. On the first restart, a blue screen appears and says the

<p><span>Hi Jackschwartz,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Uninstall the security software before attempting to upgrade. Follow the link given below to disable security software.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>Also, make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications), disconnect any external devices before starting the installation. Contact manufacturer to check for the updates.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>Check your hard disk for any errors as well.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type:
 CMD, from the results, right click CMD</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 'Run as Administrator'</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>At
 the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When
 you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor, it will scan your system and provide a report telling you if your PC can run Windows 7 and if there are any known compatibility issues
 with your programs or hardware.<br />

            <p>If you're referring to an activation error - it means that your computer could not contact the activation server to properly activate your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To properly analyse and solve problems with Activation and Validation, we need to see a full copy of the report produced by the MGADiag tool (download and save to desktop -
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012</a> )<br />
Once saved, run the tool. <br />
Click on the Continue button, which will produce the report.<br />
To copy the report to your response, click on the Copy button in the tool (ignore any error messages at this point), and then paste (using either r-click/Paste, or Ctrl+V ) into your response.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please open an Elevated Command Prompt window (in Start, type 'Command' - a Command Prompt icon will appear, right-click on it, and select Run as Administrator)</p>
<p>At the Prompt, type</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(note the spaces!)</p>
<p>two files will be put on your desktop -
</p>
<p>open the 'report.txt' file in Notepad, and copy/paste the results to your response - you can ignore the repfiles.cab file for the moment, as it's only backup data</p>

            <p>In that case, you're not running Windows 8, are you?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please repost your problem in your own new thread in the appropriate forum for your OS with an MGADiag report...</p>
<p>To properly analyse and solve problems with Activation and Validation, we need to see a full copy of the report produced by the MGADiag tool
<br />

http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012</a> )<br />
&nbsp;Once saved, run the tool. <br />
Click on the Continue button, which will produce the report.<br />
&nbsp;To copy the report to your response, click on the Copy button in the tool (ignore any error messages at this point), and then paste (using either r-click/Paste, or Ctrl+V ) into your response.<br />
&nbsp; - **in your own thread**, please<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please also state the Version and Edition of Windows quoted on your COA sticker (if you have one) on the case of your machine (or inside the battery compartment), but do NOT quote the Key on the sticker!<br />

<h2>            Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact Skype issue</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>after installing Skype for Android on my new Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact (Android 8.0.0) phone speaker started to act weirdly. My colleague has the same issue&nbsp;with the same phone.</p>
<p>90% of the calls I end I hear loud ending beep from the loud speaker. Sometimes new outgoing call voice comes from loudspeaker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to uninstall Skype and then everything is normal. Installed Skype back and error again back...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to solve this?</p>
                </div>

<p>
</p><p>Just to verify, the issue did not happen during a normal phone call or outside Skype, correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward for your response.</p>

<h2>            End of windows xp.  what is the best thing to do</h2>
                    <p>Windows xp is ending. &nbsp;I will no longer have support or security for my computer, which i consider unacceptable, and consider an upgrade a necessity. &nbsp;I ran the computer analizer to check my computer and programs to see i could upgrade. &nbsp;All it said is some
 programs were compatable, some weren't, and that an online upgrage/ download was unavailable for my computer or region.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My point is that if i can't get a upgrade/ download for windows for my computer, if it is even compatable, which the analizer didn't say, how can i keep my computer protected? &nbsp;And if I can't get any upgrade for my computer, will microsoft pay for a new,
 compatable computer, since they are the ones ending the service for my version of windows? &nbsp;It is no fault of my own that my computer isn't compatable and that support is ending for what is compatable. &nbsp;I don't have $500-$1000 to put out for a new computer,
 just because microsoft is ending security and support for my current one.</p>

            <p><strong>If you want to keep using Windows XP you need to make sure it's as secure as possible otherwise it will be vulnerable to attack by hackers. You need a good Internet Security Suite. A good one is Comodo Internet Security. &nbsp;There is a Free version
 available and it is not a watered down version. It's the Full program unlike some other Security suites.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Also it's a good idea to install a separate Anti-malware program like MalwarebytesAnti-Malware or Super Anti-Spyware just for extra protection</strong></p>

            <p>You can do your best to keep your XP protected as mentioned by PeterGilgen. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware and software is not supported for an eternity. Many companies upgrade their software on a yearly or two yearly basis. The fact you have had Windows XP for all these years, consider it a bonus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At some stage&nbsp;it may be necessary for you to upgrade to the latest hardware and software. When that happens will depend upon when you're ready to or need to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're happy as you are and do your best to stay protected (and are aware of the risks involved), then stay as you are until the computer is no longer serviceable. The decision will always be yours as to if and when you decide to upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will also need to at some stage consider the software you're using, what is compatible with the latest operating system and what needs to be upgraded to run on a new operating system. Another thing you would need to consider if&nbsp;your printer/scanner are
 compatible with the new operating system.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Windows XP had an end-of-support date from the day it was released and back in 2006/2007 that date moved from December 31, 2011 to April 8, 2014. &nbsp;It is not a surprise nor do you HAVE to change what you use, but you would have to accept the risk and mitigate
 if you maintain that OS.</p>

            Boy, don't I agree with that. My 3.5 Service Pack failed to upgrade. I have McAfee to protect my computer but now I'm having problems with that because Windows won't update the 3.5 Service Pack. Already snowballing and they haven't even stopped support
 yet. I think we're in trouble and I'm already frustrated. They won't even provide Live Support for Windows Update. Not too impressed with Microsoft right now since I've already tried most of the 'fixes' and all that did was screw up my computer even more.
 I spent all those hours trying to fix what won't update and had to resort to Restore. What a waste of effort...&nbsp; And I still like Windows XP better than Windows 7 or 8.

            <p>Are you speaking of ".NET Framework 3.5"?&nbsp; That's not unique to Windows XP by a long shot.&nbsp; ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because you want to hang onto Windows XP after the pre-printed "End-of-Support" date (originally it was December 31, 2011 - that changed in 2006/2007 to April 2014) isn't any reason to down Microsoft for your decision.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds like your particular installation has some issues - but they can likely be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Likely a clean installation, patching and such (starting out clean and fully patched NOW) would probably be the best way to go if your plan is to hang onto Windows XP given after April 8, 2014 you will not be receiving any further patches to do with the
 Operating System itself.&nbsp; I know if I was going to hang onto it - that is the way I would go about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>[EDIT: I just installed a Windows XP with SP3 and fully patched it with everything but "BING" and "Windows Search" and it takes up 8.61GB of space and has Security Essentials as an AntiVirus and Windows Live Mail 2012 (or Outlook Express) as an email client.&nbsp;
 Of course you are stuck with Internet Explorer 8.x and won't be getting updates after April 8, 2014 for Windows XP itself.&nbsp; I also wouldn't personally recommend Microsoft Security Essentials - but it is available and will update for some time.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;You can go to Windows Download catalog and save all critical and important updates to disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Get SP3 download and any updates after that which would be after May 2009.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Then when your system&nbsp;gets corrupted you can format the HD and reinstall XP with all the needed updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Or spend $99 at Newegg.com for Win7. Which will get you by until Win9 comes out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;There is not much difference between XP and Win7 that would keep someone from easily adjusting to a new OS.</p>

<h2>            Strict or Moderate NAT</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had to reset my router preferences. Now, I can not connect correctly to XBOX LIVE.</p>

<p>I opened the same ports, that I did before resetting, but it shows me the same window about Strict NAT.</p>

<p>What else can I try?</p>

<p>It's not a nighmare, it is worse.</p>

<p>I visited portforward.com recently and still nothing. My router is Sagem Fast 2804, and I use wired connection (ethernet cable)</p>

<p>PLEASE, HELP!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>Turn off UPnP on the router (if its on) and set-up portforwarding like this:- <a href="http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Sagem/2804STC/Xbox_Live_360.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
portforward.com/.../Xbox_Live_360.htm</a></p>
<p>If you set-up a static/manual ip address and forward the ports correctly it will work fine</p>

<p>Thanks for respond but still nothing, got the same window I got before.</p>
<p>I went to the site you show here, set up different IP adress that my router has. Seems like I have a static adress (following portfoward).</p>
<p>I turned off Upnp service then. I also set up the preferences that portforward says.</p>
<p>And the same error.</p>
<p>I'm not sure, but it looks like my 80 TCP port is not open or reachabl. &nbsp;I downloaded the tool from portforward, that can check my ports are opened or are not.</p>
<p>I checked every port, but when I'm checking 80 TCP port, programm says that it is not open.</p>
<p>It's hell, isn't it?</p>
<p>I dunno what to do else.</p>

<p>For some reason it seems to be hard to find a user guide for your router. What ip address have you given the Xbox for a static ip address and in your router settings what is the start and end address of the DHCP server?</p>

<p>I've given 192.168.1.21 IP adress for Xbox. And about DHCP - there is clear window, if I click on the DHCP.</p>
<p>Also, I set up 192.168.1.10 as a local adress, and my router has 192.168.1.1.</p>

<p>Hmmm there must be some DHCP settings in your router?</p>
<p>It will say something like "Enabled DHCP Server" and a start and end ip address?</p>

<p>And, by the way, my PS3 network works absolutely perfect. NAT is ok and I can play with everyone without any troubles. But my router connects with PS3 system via wi-fi, and Xbox uses wired (ethernet cable).</p>
<p>I dunno what kind of trouble my one is, but I think there is something with 80 TCP port, cause it says that it is not open, but it is.</p>

<p>Ok see that "End IP Address" change that from 192.168.1.254 to 192.168.1.200 and click Apply/Save</p>
<p>Wait 20 secs</p>
<p>Power off the router</p>
<p>Wait 10 secs</p>
<p>Power on the router</p>
<p>Manually change the Xbox ip address to</p>
<p>IP Address: 192.168.1.210</p>

<p>Gateway: 192.168.1.1</p>

<p>It drives me crazy, looks like there is not way out. -_____________-</p>
<p>Btw, I use 88 (UDP), 3074 (TCP/UDP), 53 (TCP/UDP), 80 goddammit (TCP) ports. And about DNS. There are two columns - default and alternative. Which one should I choose?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do you have an option for UPnP on the router? If so can you try turning that off? Is it saying strict or moderate at the moment?</p>
<p>Also do you have the modem up to date firmware on the router and does it have an option on the router menu called DMZ?</p>
<p>Not sure what you mean about DNS, if its not failing on DNS don't worry about it</p>

    <title>Problems with Gold Account Redemption Code - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pekaapekaabaaa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Gold Account Redemption Code</h2>
                    Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE MicrosoftInternetExplorer4
<p>My account expired due to the credit card on file being replaced.&nbsp; The problem is with the poor communications and follow-up from Microsoft that followed.&nbsp; I spoke to support and gave them a new credit card and was told that the redemption code would be
 created within 24 hours and verified a&nbsp;new email address to be used to send the redemption code to.&nbsp; 2 days later I called to check on the code I was informed that the it 24-48 hours so I should have it shortly, again confirmed the email address, The next
 day I call again to check and now informed that it takes 3-5 days to create the code.&nbsp; At this point I got frustrated and asked that someone escalate my case, the same support person put me on hold and returned with information that it takes 5-10 days.&nbsp; At
 this point I got mad, not rude but definitely mad and explained that I didn't trust the information and doubted I would ever get the code and requested to speak to a supervisor. After being on hold for 10-15 minutes the support person returned and explained
 that he spoke to the supervisor and he said that was the policy and nothing could be done.&nbsp; I insisted on speaking with a supervisor anyway to officially complain about the support I was receiving.&nbsp; The manager took issue with me "demeaning him and Microsoft"
 because I suggested I was lied to and suggested that the process was extremely flawed that not only did the support staff not know the policy but they all had different answers and I felt I was being lied too.&nbsp; I expressed frustration with a company of Microsoft’s
 size having these issues.&nbsp; He suggested that I was given mis-information. Semantics aside this was ridiculous.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>After expressing my frustration I asked that he attempt expedite the redemption code, which he agreed to do and also reconfirmed my email address.</p>
<p>The following day I received a voice mail confirming that the redemption code request has been made, but not yet created and that the caller would monitor the account and let me know as soon as it was created.&nbsp; 5 days later after not getting a call I call
 back to find out that the code was created the same day that I got the most recent call, they claimed I was called again and a voice mail was left.&nbsp; Which I doubt because I have never appear to miss voice mails and didn't miss the one from earlier the same
 day.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I received the code from the person I was speaking to.&nbsp; Then shared my concerns and asked why I didn't get an email as well after being assured that would be the delivery method, she confirmed that the email that I gave them and confirmed on 3 different
 occasions would not have received the code because they were not allowed to change email addresses I would have too.&nbsp; I then confirmed that the code was not sent to the original email address on the account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Turns out they are having server issues and I got an error when I tried to change the email address on line.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>My problem appears to be solved for now, but this has to be a case study of how not to provide customer support, not to mention how flawed of a system it must be that it takes up to 10 days to create a 25 character code and process a credit card order, by
 one of the world’s largest software companies.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

<h2>            Adding music to the start of the video</h2>
                    I have made a video with images and have added three songs to play through it. Now I would like to add a short 10-second music intro at the beginning and maybe a short music riff in the middle of the video, but when I put my slider at the beginning and&nbsp;
 "add music" I get a message that "Music starts after the last item." So how do I add the new music?

    <title>Windows Explorer stops responding when accessing Downloads folder - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Explorer stops responding when accessing Downloads folder</h2>
                    I'm having a problem with Windows Explorer not responding when I try to access the Downloads folder. The problem seems related to one file,a Java update .exe &nbsp;file that I downloaded. Explorer hangs up as soon as I try to do anything with this file,I can't
 even delete it. I was able to move other files out of the folder by going to My Computer and using search and move file,but the when I try to do anything with this file,Explorer again hangs.&nbsp;

            No video files in the folder,the problem file seemed to be a Java update file. I managed to delete it using a third party uninstall program and the problem seems to be gone. My best guess is the update program was corrupted during download.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 pops-up now and then saying&#58; &#34;How do you want to open this file&#63;&#34; and error&#58; &#34;Cannot find the C&#58;&#92;Program.txt file. Do you want to create a new file&#63;&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><div>I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 the other day.</div>
<div>Every now and then i get the pop-up out of nowhere with the question "How do you want to open this file?"</div>
<div>There is no file extension showing so i have no idea what Windows is trying to open.</div>
<div>
<p>Tried choosing Notepad to see what would happen, but&nbsp;I get "Cannot find the C:\Program.txt file. Do you want to create a new file?"</p>
<p>How can I identify what file windows is trying to open?</p>
<p>This pops up after a while from a freshly rebooted computer without me using it. And it keeps popping up like after 30-60 min or so.</p>
<p>Any ideas would be much appreciated!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, we appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned you get the pop-up to open the files with now and then even if you are not trying to access any files, we will help you with&nbsp;this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1:
</strong>I suggest you to run SFC scan to check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>System File Checker</span></span></strong><span><span>is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files
 and restore corrupted files.<br />
Follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right click on the <strong>
Start</strong> button, click on <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Type “<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>” without the quotes and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>After the scan, restart the computer and check for the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong><span>I suggest you to perform
<strong>Clean boot</strong> to avoid any third party software conflict&nbsp;and check.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> Putting your system in
<strong>Clean Boot</strong> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well)
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean
 boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope it helps. Reply to the post with an updated status of this issue to assist you better.</span></span></p>

<p>Thank you for the swift reply Deepika!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had actually already tried step 1 but did it again as suggested but the pop-up still appeared after reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did step 2 late yesterday evening and the pop-up has not yet appeared.</p>
<p>So now I just need to turn them and see which one is causing the pop-up, I'll post that as soon as i have identified the service/startup program causing this.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently i was a bit quick when i said that the pop-up had stopped appearing after doing the Clean Boot.</p>
<p>It is still happening.. although not as frequently as it did before.</p>
<p>There are three AVG services that wont be disabled. other than that everything else is currently disabled.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/81f8b274-60c1-46ae-9ff1-5d92adf88e71" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/81f8b274-60c1-46ae-9ff1-5d92adf88e71" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And with a freshly booted PC the pop-up still appears after a while.</p>
<p>Any ideas what i can do next do figure out what is causing this?</p>
<p />

    <title>Scrollen im Surface Book - Rubber Band Effect - Scrolling doesn not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martinstucki  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scrollen im Surface Book - Rubber Band Effect - Scrolling doesn not always work in some applications.</h2>
                    <p>If I scroll on my Surface Book, it might be especially after connecting the screen again to the keyboard, scrolling does not work properly again. There is a kind of rubber band effect which means I scroll but the scrolled part of the screen goes back into
 the initial position. I did not investigate into all details but in Settings it was vertical in One Note vertical and horizontal scrolling. The effect becomes worse, effects more applications&nbsp;but I was able to get back into normal behavior after shutdown and
 restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I scroll on the screen with a very wide&nbsp;stroke it scrolls nearly O.K. If i scroll with the pad whether with two fingers or the mouse buttons in the scroll bar&nbsp;or with small strokes on the screen the rubber band effect is there. The outlook mail (not the
 surface outlook program) seems to work. PP vertical no problem horizontal rubber band. No idea what the rule behind is but would be nice to get it fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it is connected to Battery Safe Modus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
