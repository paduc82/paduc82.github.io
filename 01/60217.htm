<h2>            Poor window resolution for some programs</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Some time ago I updated to windows 8.1. For some reason I have a very poor resolution while using some programs. The resolution problems arise for example with all setup wizards, device manager, Mediamonkey, Inkscape and MatLab. Especially the Inkscape and
 Matlab are very critical because they have graphical output! I cannot use them now. Browsers and windows explorer seems to work just fine.<br />
<br />
It cannot be fixed with any standard screen resolution settings. How can this be solved?<br />
<br />
I have a screen resolution of1920x1080 (Dell XPS system, NVIDIA GeForce GT 450M)<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help,<br />
<br />
Robin<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>This issue might occur due to outdated display driver apart from display settings that is setup on the laptop. It could also occur due to incompatibility of the list of programs with Windows 8.1.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>1) What is the Model of the Dell XPS laptop?</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>2) Did you try changing the screen resolution to troubleshoot such issues?</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>First of all, if you have not tried to change the display settings such as screen resolution, you can refer to the link and do so:</font></font></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>As per the compatibility of the programs that you have mentioned is concerned, they are compatible with Windows 8.1. But, it all depends on the voting that is done by other users for that product. You can refer to the link

<p><font><font><font color="#000000">c) Check the box which says “<b>Disable display scaling on high DPI settings</b>”. Click on
<strong>OK</strong>.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Thanks a lot! The Program Compatibility Troubleshooter does the trick.<br />
<br />
For device manager, I can't use the program compatibility troubleshooter. Is there any way to fix that? I don't use it often so it's not important. But I guess I must be able to solve that one too somehow?<br />

<h2>            Computer running extremely slow</h2>
                    <p>My wife has a Samsung N150 Plus (Intel Atom N450 1.66GHz, 1 GB RAM, Windows 7 Starter) wich is aprox 1-1.5 years old. Lately is has been running really slow. Startup takes quite a while and starting softare can take half an age. Just getting the task manager
 up takes aprox 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
It came with Norton, but I got rid of that straight away (I used their removal tool) and it now runs with Norman. I however now found Norton Online Backup running on it but disabled it in autostart. Made no difference on preformance though. My wife has recently
 done a full system search and it found no viruses or trojans.<br />
<br />
It's got around 85 processes running at "idle" and then uses about 75% physical memory. (I AM planning to upgrade it to 2 GB RAM)<br />
<br />
The disk (2 partitions and Recovery and System) are regularly defragged, so theyr'e on 0% fragmented.<br />
<br />

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several points:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Getting rid of Norton was a good idea. It's one of the worst security applications, in my view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I don't know anything about Norman, but it's not one of the anti-virus apps that I recommend.
<span>
For an anti-virus program, I recommend eSet </span><span>NOD32</span><span>, if you are willing to
 pay for it. If you want a free anti-virus, I recommend one </span><span>(do not run more than one)
</span><span>of the following three:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Avira AntiVir<br />
</span><span>Avast<br />
</span><span>Microsoft Security
</span><span>Essentials<br />
</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
You also need anti-spyware software </span><span>(even if you run a program like Microsoft Security Essentials, with anti-spyware capability built into it)</span><span>.
 I recommend that you download and<br />
install (freeware) </span><span>MalwareBytes</span><span> AntiMalware
</span></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; 85 processes running is not an unusually high number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. If the computer presently has less than 2GB of RAM, there's no surprise that it runs slowly. Almost anyone who does more than play solitaire needs at least 2GB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. If upgrading to 2GB doesn't solve the problem, it's possible (probably even likely) that it's a malware infection. Doing an anti-virus scan with a single application (not matter which application
 it is) does not prove that the computer is not infected. No such program is perfect.</p>

</strong><strong>icon </strong><strong>settings</strong>.</li><li>A new dialog box should appear, click on <strong>Recycle </strong><strong>bin</strong>. (There should be two, either would work)</li><li>A list of icon choices will be given to you. You can choose from these set.</li><li>If you prefer a different one and it's not among those options, you will have to download an your preferred image in an .<strong>ico

    <title>DVD&#47;CD combo drive not reading DVDs anymore, still reads CDs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slickrcbd  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVD&#47;CD combo drive not reading DVDs anymore, still reads CDs</h2>
                    I just popped a DVD into a CD/DVD combo drive that I've been using for years and it refuses to recognize that there is anything on the disc.<br />
It also seems to take a long time to mount it.<br />
<br />
I've tried device manager and "update the driver", but it says I have the best driver.<br />
<br />
I've been using this CD-RW/DVD-ROM combo drive for years and it hasn't had a problem. I've tried several burned DVD-Rs and two commercial DVD movie discs and I get the same results as in this picture<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/637f4aa6-c2e2-4308-a5ac-6a81779b312d" /><br />
However, I've also tried several CD-Rs both music and audio and it recognizes them perfectly.<br />
I've also tested the DVDs in my Windows 7 computer and it recognizes them without issue. I was able to open a text file on the data DVD and see a few seconds of a movie before I closed it.<br />
<br />
I can't recall the last time I watched a movie DVD, and I THINK the last time I used a DVD on this computer was when I played Baldur's Gate II, which according to the save files was back in June since I've been playing something CD-based instead.
<br />
I've only burned DVD versions of Baldur's Gate I, II, Planescape Tormenet, and Final Fantasy VII and VIII from the CDs for this old computer (it came with Windows 98SE, it's NOT a new system), so it's not that hard to determine when I last used a DVD on it.<br />
<br />
I haven't noticed any issues using the drive as a CD-ROM, but haven't used the cd-burner aspect or the DVD-reader aspect in several months. I generally use data DVDs on a newer Windows 7 computer and only use this one for some older games or music that usually
 use CDs, although it's primary purpose is to share my parallel printer with the newer Windows 7 system that lacks a parallel port and be a central server for my resume, cover letters, and anything else I might want to access from either my modern desktop or
 the laptop.<br />
<br />
I'd think this was more a hardware problem if it weren't for the fact that it's reading CDs without a problem.
<br />
<br />
P.S. I broke out the CD/DVD lens cleaner and it had no effect.<br />

            Optical drives use different lasers for CDs and DVDs.&nbsp; It sure sounds as if your DVD laser has burned out, but it could simply be dirty.<br />
<br />
<pre>DVDs uses lasers with a wavelength of 640 (or perhaps 650) nanometers.  CD lasers use 780 nanometers.<br /></pre>

<p>As LemP says the drives use different lasers for the different discs.&nbsp; I have come across this problem a few times and replacing the drive is your only option.</p>

            <p>Hello Moira,</p>
<p>Had you recently done something or made any changes to your computer just before this started? Were you online just prior to it happening? In either case two different things to try. First, go to Control Panel, Backup and Restore and click on the restore
 function. Look for a restore point that is at least a week ago and preferably at least a day or two before your icons disappeared. Does doing the restore point fix the issue for you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, or for future reference you should download, install and then run these two antimalware applications:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malwarebytes' Antimalware:&nbsp;<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html</a> ;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SuperAntiSpyware:&nbsp; <a href="http://download.cnet.com/SuperAntiSpyware-Free-Edition/3000-8022_4-10523889.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/SuperAntiSpyware-Free-Edition/3000-8022_4-10523889.html</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then run your antivirus application Don't have one? I use and recommend Avast:&nbsp;
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Avast-Free-Antivirus/3000-2239_4-10019223.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
We managed to receive the system info logs you provided, I reviewed this file and verified that it is corrupted. Please perform the
<strong>Collecting System Information </strong>step again&nbsp;on the link Litton provided in the private message.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> In addition, it would also help us to further investigate if you can provide the
<strong>Event&nbsp;logs</strong> &amp;<strong> DxDiag logs</strong> on the step <strong>2</strong> &amp;
<strong>3</strong> from the link of Litton.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Gerard G.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to ask some questions so we can better understand the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the version of your Photo Gallery? </li><li>What is the operating system currently installed on your computer? </li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps you have done so far? Have you tried visiting the post given by ing. Jan Chaloupek?
</li></ul>
<p>If not, you can try visiting it first for initial troubleshooting. If you already did that and you still encounter the issue, I suggest that you collect logs for Photo Gallery by following the steps on the link given by Gerard_G last December 7. After collecting
 the log files, kindly upload it on the private message area I enabled for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> emikili  say:</h3>
<h2>            SWF default file association won&#39;t change to Flash Player projector content debugger</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded Flash Player project content debugger (flashplayer_31_sa_debug.exe) from Adobe for debugging purposes but I can't change the default file association.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened on two Windows machines. At this point I think it's Windows refusing to recognise Flash, probably for possible exploit reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- running the file directly and checking 'Always use this app to open .swf files' (many times)</p>
<p>- selecting the flash player via the 'Choose default apps by file type' menu (other apps can be set here fine)</p>
<p>- running `assoc` and `ftype` commands to force the association</p>
<p>- using a previous version of the flash debugger exe</p>
<p>- checking and ensuring windows hasn't marked it as a dangerous file downloaded from the internet</p>
<p>- signing in and out of my Microsoft account</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Home Version 1803 (Build 17134.345).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate any insight into this. Cheers.</p>

            Hi emikili, for now there is nothing you can do . . .
<br />
<br />Setting File Associations in Windows 10 is now impossible, a lot of users are reporting this at the moment, this seems to be a bug in Windows 10 since the last update.
<br />
<br />Microsoft are working hard to patch the bugs in the last couple of updates, hopefully this is one of the bugs they are working on
<br />
<br />Please provide feedback to the Windows Developers on this bug, press Windows Key + F to open the Feedback Hub, the more users that report this, the quicker it will be resolved . . .

<p>Figured it out. Just add account and switch age. While the account is different you don't have to mess with parent accounts and it only takes a minute.

<p>Que eu saiba a live não se liga a nenhum jogo no PC mesmo os windows live por serem redes diferentes...</p>
<p>Mesmo na concorrência que eu saiba acho que só Portal 2(no PS3) tem todas as redes ligadas, isso é muito raro ligar as redes de console com PC, mesmo nos COD e BF as redes são diferentes para console e PC</p>

    <title>HP Envy 5530 Printer driver won&#39;t install- says unsigned in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edwardeberle  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Envy 5530 Printer driver won&#39;t install- says unsigned in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>We just purchased an HP Envy 5530 printer. &nbsp;It's USB connected with Desktop. &nbsp;Networked to our Laptop. Both computers are running Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the printer is fine on the Desktop, it shows as UnKnown Device on the Laptop and has a few printing errors (printing extra pages etc). &nbsp; We need it to be installed correctly and recognized in order for the printing issues to clear up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To correct this, we tried updating the driver on the laptop. &nbsp;It shows a list of drivers and when we highlight the needed, it says Signed (on the bottom right of the screen box). &nbsp;But, when we try to install it, it says there is an error and that it's unsigned.
 &nbsp; We tried the driver from the disc and then the driver directly from HP's website. &nbsp;Still won't install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tried the advanced mode pressing F7 to disable driver signature enforcement a few times and still it won't install the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We finally gave up (installed and uninstalled over and over trying different things) and turned on the WiFi to the printer which works perfect on both computers and stopped the extra blank page printing on the network laptop but it's not how we wanted it
 to be set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you suggest? &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 sign in Odd Behaviour</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been running windows10 for about 4 months now and in the last 2 weeks every time I start my laptop the login screen show up like normal but no matter what button I press before entering my password it immediately tells me my login info is incorrect
 and prompts me to enter it again. I then enter it and I am able to log in like normal. I have run antivirus but nothing was detected. This behavior makes me suspicious. Any Ideas how to correct this</p>

            <p>I have the same erro (511-CPU Fan not detected). This after I installed Windows 10. It comes out sporadically not constantly. Which brings me to the question, could it be a problem with Windows 10?</p>

            I've been getting the same error message but the fan still works.&nbsp; It comes on and goes off like it always has I suppose.&nbsp; The computer wasn't really used that much for a good while. I cleaned the dust out of it. I even unplugged it and plugged it back
 in to make sure it wasn't loose.&nbsp; Any other suggestions?

            AS I mentioned on Sept, 2, 2015 I have been and still receive the same error message. I had an IT person look at it and the fan is working. Looking a little more into it, this error messages comes up when the computer is re started. However when it is
 shut down and later powered on the message does not come up. Any ideas?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Since its a new notebook you should contact the System maker and seller to have then fix or<br />
replace the unit. The more you try to fix it on your own the more they will claim it is something<br />
you did. Added that most makers/sellers have a limited period during which they will replace<br />
a unit.<br />
<br />
============================================================<br />
<br />
If you really want to try troubleshooting :<br />
<br />
Check to see if this Hotfix applies to your system. <br />
<br />
You receive various Stop error messages in Windows 7 or in Windows Server 2008 R2 when you try<br />
to resume a computer that has a large SATA hard disk.<br />

<strong>The 2nd parameter - 0xC000009D - indicates defective or loose cabling or a drive<br />
controller error/problem.<br />
<br />
</strong>The primary causes of this error are virus/malware, drivers, memory, and disk corruption. And there<br />
can even be combinations of those so a thorough check of all is required. Added possible causes are<br />
hardware errors such as damaged motherboard or other hardware.</p>
<p><strong>BCCode: 7A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000007A<br />
<br />
Cause</strong></p>
<p>Frequently, you can determine the cause of the KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR bug check from the error status (Parameter 2). Some common status codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0xC000009A, or STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES, indicates a lack of nonpaged pool resources.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC000009C, or STATUS_DEVICE_DATA_ERROR, typically indicates bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC000009D, or STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED, indicates defective or loose cabling, termination, or that the controller does not see the hard disk.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC000016A, or STATUS_DISK_OPERATION_FAILED, indicates bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC0000185, or STATUS_IO_DEVICE_ERROR, indicates improper termination or defective cabling on SCSI devices or that two devices are trying to use the same IRQ.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These status codes are the most common ones that have specific causes. For more information about other possible status codes that can be returned, see the<em>Ntstatus.h</em> file in the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
<p>Another common cause of this error message is defective hardware or failing RAM.</p>
<p>A virus infection can also cause this bug check.</p>
Resolution
<p><em>Resolving a bad block problem:</em> An I/O status code of 0xC000009C or 0xC000016A typically indicates that the data could not be read from the disk because of a bad block (sector). If you can restart the computer after the error, Autochk runs automatically
 and attempts to map the bad sector to prevent it from being used anymore.</p>
<p>If Autochk does not scan the hard disk for errors, you can manually start the disk scanner. Run<strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong> on the system partition. You must restart the computer before the disk scan begins. If you cannot start the computer because of the
 error, use the Recovery Console and run<strong>Chkdsk /r</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; If your system partition is formatted with the FAT file system, the long file names that the Windows operating system uses might be damaged if you use Scandisk or another MS-DOS-based hard disk tool to verify the integrity of your
 hard disk from MS-DOS. Always use the version of Chkdsk that matches your version of Windows.</p>
<p><em><strong>Resolving a defective hardware problem</strong>:</em> If the I/O status is C0000185 and the paging file is on an SCSI disk, check the disk cabling and SCSI termination for problems.</p>
<p><em><strong>Resolving a failing RAM problem:</strong></em> Run the hardware diagnostics that the system manufacturer supplies, especially the memory scanner. For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Check that all the adapter cards in the computer are properly seated.</strong> Use an ink eraser or an electrical contact treatment, available at electronics supply stores, to ensure adapter card contacts are clean.</p>
<p><strong>Check the System Log in Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the device that is causing the error. You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS to try to resolve this error.</p>
<p>Make sure that the latest Windows Service Pack is installed.</p>
<p><strong>If the preceding steps do not resolve the error</strong>, take the system motherboard to a repair facility for diagnostic testing. A crack, a scratched trace, or a defective component on the motherboard can cause this error.</p>
<p><em><strong>Resolving a virus infection:</strong></em> Check your computer for viruses by using any up-to-date, commercial virus scanning software that examines the Master Boot Record of the hard disk. All Windows file systems can be infected by viruses.</p>

=============================<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.<br />

<strong>Could be a driver related issue though less likely than memory.</strong> Update your drivers<br />
manually by looking at System maker and Device maker's sites.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm also faced this issue in my Windows 10 laptop. I tried all suggestions. But, nothing work. Finally, I restore my system into earlier good condition. It worked for me. I suggest you, Try system restore to get back normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For system restore,</p>
<ol>
<li>Press and hold&nbsp;shift key and then click Start menu-&gt;Restart.</li><li>Press F5 while BIOS windows appearing. This will lead to troubleshooting option.</li><li>Finally, click on system restore, choose the previous date (cortna working at that time), click next and then finish.</li><li>Restart your system.</li></ol>
<p>i hope the system will back to working condition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<h2>            Surface Go out of the box - Display with a stuck pixel</h2>
                    <p>Hello ,</p>
<p>I'm writing this just to get an advice from people what should I do with the device. It's been 3 days I've got the new Surface Go in my hands and since the start I noticed on the black screen a very small green dot on display on the bootloading time and
 also in the black hummingbird wallpaper. On other color of the display it is barely spotted almost unnoticeable. I really like the device it is the 128 GB/8GB RAM version and after I found out to get it from S mode it really impressed me the performance. I
 would probably don't bother of that but my concern is what if after awhile the display gets worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I return it ?&nbsp; Thank you for your advice!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Cristina223,<br />It sounds like you're having a stuck pixel.<br /><br />Microsoft selects the panels that go into its Surface computers and individually calibrates them, so this is not common.<br /><br />That said, it is totally grounds for getting it swapped out. This is most easily done at a Microsoft store, where you can also inspect the device. Where did you get your Go from?

            When you go to the Microsoft Store for an exchange, consider setting up your new computer while at the Store. They usually have an area in the back where you can do that. They also have a very high speed WiFi so setup can be much faster than at home. I've
 purchased and set up my last several machines at the Microsoft Store here in Atlanta and an advantage of doing that is that if there is any kind of hardware or software problem you will have immediate help. Good luck Cristina and let us know how everything
 turns out!

            Very good to know this but unfortunately I rushed out to exchange at the store and then come back home 54 km... They did a refund on to my credit and then sold again a new device. I'm getting it in front to&nbsp; make all the settings, updates, upgrades, out
 of S mode, and so on.....but I'm glad that at least tomorrow I won't wake up feeling wrong I spend money in defect device....Thank you once more for the guidance.&nbsp;

    <title>Intermittent Windows 10 deactivation after cloning hard drive and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ankit garg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intermittent Windows 10 deactivation after cloning hard drive and upgrading hardware</h2>
                    <p>I recently built a new computer and cloned my old hard drive to a new hard drive. I have intermittently been seeing a "Activate Windows" prompt which sometimes disappears after restarting. When I try to reactivate Windows 10, it fails, and then I select
 the option stating that I recently changed my hardware. I find my computer to activate, and when I click activate, it gives me an error again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to call Microsoft Support, but they asked for product key which I do not have anymore. I upgraded from Windows 7 5 years ago, and I had bought Windows 7 from my university at the time. I do not have proof of purchase since the receipt was sent to
 an old e-mail account that no longer exists. My Microsoft account is linked with my software, but the tech support folks said they do not have access to my account. They gave me two separate phone numbers for technicians with that level of access, but it always
 landed me back with the customer service agents that did not have access. I have been able to extract my CD key using online software, but I'm not sure what to do with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop this activation error from coming up so frequently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

                    <p>when typing the cursor moves my typing to places and turns things on when it is not suppose to.</p>
<p>it is very very aggravating to say the least'</p>
<p>always something...</p>
<p>microsoft keeps messing things up. why dont they keep one operating system and just improve on it instead of all these total overhauls?&nbsp; and how about asking us what we like and dont like..sheeesh.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear apple people dont have these issues.</p>

            <p>The cursor moving isn't Microsoft's fault, it's because your laptop touchpad is too sensitive so it thinks you're trying to move the pointer even if your write is just near the touchpad and you aren't actually trying to move it after all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft didn't build the touchpad nor the software that operates it -- so you need to contact the company that built it and ask how to turn down the sensitivity on their model of computer (if they even provide such an option).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they don't have that option, you can go the low-tech way: put a business card on top of it to dull the sensitivity.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS. They do ask people what they like.&nbsp; They asked you too, have you participated in the Windows Insider program so you can vote on what goes into the next version of Windows?</p>

                    <p>Desktop pc has no wireless tab option for setting up a wireless connection in windows 10 64 bit. I have searched for solutions and have only found discussions for deleting/updating specific VPN software. Unfortunately, I don't nor have I ever had vpn software
 on this workstation and running the specified commands state there is no vpn software installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed an ASUS PCE-AC56 dual band wireless NIC and associated drivers as well as updated driver and still no wireless capability. Some posts suggest uninstalling then reinstalling the drivers and in my case nothing changes.</p>

            <p>Thanks fo looking into this issue. I tried your suggestion but this is not an application issue but a driver &nbsp;and Windows 10 issue. Windows simply will not detect any wireless networks within rangeand on this Windows 10 workstation there is no way to setup
 a wireless network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a windows 10 laptop and it functions flawlessly. I looked at the settings in the laptop and it has the wireless and airplane options. Why is it that I cannot enable the wireless option on my desktop?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your response. Unfortunately, I had already tried the Asus drivers for windows 8 and that didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see from my previous post, the image shows no wireless nic installed on the system although it is installed. Is sure seems like windows 10 cannot detect the installed nic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done some research and it seems like PCI bios settings need to be changed from auto to 1x for Asus motherboards in order for pci1x cards to be detected. Although I don't have an Asus mobo I will investigate the bios issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bad news is I returned the card since my 30 days for a return is almost up. I am also researching other possible pci wifi nic's that have the capability to switch the bios to 1x.</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />For troubleshooting instructions, please scroll down further.
<br />
<br />Starting the Upgrade
<br />
<br />Computers running either Windows 8.0, Windows 8.1 or Windows 8.1 Update 1 can upgrade to the Windows 10. Systems running Windows 8.0 or Windows 8.1 will need to use the ISO to perform an off line upgrade, since the Media Creation Tool is not compatible with those releases. If you are running Windows 8.0, you will need to reinstall all your universal applications from the Store.
<br />
<br />Before we begin, launch the Desktop app.
<br />
<br />
<br />At the desktop, insert your Windows 10 Creators Update install media or if you downloaded the ISO file, double click it or right click the ISO, click Open with then click File Explorer. If setup does not start automatically, click File Explorer on the Taskbar, This PC, double click the setup icon for your install media containing the Windows 10 Creators Update install files.
<br />
<br />
<br />Wait while setup begins.
<br />
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues. 
<br />
<br />If your Windows 8 installation is not activated, you will need to enter a valid Windows 10 key; a Windows 8 key will not work. If you don't have a valid Windows 10 key, then you will have to boot from the Windows 10 install media (DVD or USB), then perform a clean install, skip when prompted to enter a product key, then activate using your Windows 8 product key after reaching the desktop. If you have your Windows 8 product key, try activating your installation first, then restart setup.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Creators Update on a system with limited space:
<br />

<br />
<br />Note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.

<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.

Cortana is not required, but it makes Windows 10 a unique experience.
<br />

These apps can do many things like manage your images (Photos); buy, listen and stream music (Groove); buy, watch, TV and movies (Movies &amp; TV); browse the web safely, ask questions, write on web pages and enhance with extensions (Edge). You can change the defaults here and anytime in Windows 10. Click Next to continue.
