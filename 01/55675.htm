    <title>File duplicating issue with File History, Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ngollan  say:</h3>
<h2>            File duplicating issue with File History, Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've now experienced on multiple occasions that Windows 10 File History will, always on major updates but also randomly in-between, forget backed up folders (say for example, "D:\Lightroom\Photos").</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's of course completely inacceptable in itself because that means the location will silently stop being versioned and backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of that, re-adding the location now makes File History slap a complete (several hundreds gigabytes!) set of new version of unchanged (I checked) files into the backup location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything to keep FH from forgetting locations and tell it not to be dumb around unchanged files when re-adding them?</p>
<p>

    <title>Activation issues with Windows 10 after performing Clean installation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Activation issues with Windows 10 after performing Clean installation</h2>
                    <p>I have noticed the Windows 10 icon in the taskbar after a recent bout of Windows updates on my (formerly) Windows 7 OEM Dell e5240.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was all gung-ho, proceeded to create a boot drive&nbsp;and did a&nbsp;clean installation - it was successful and I am using Windows 10 at the moment, except that I am not able to Activate my Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I DID NOT reserve / check my upgrade status / check my PC via the Get Windows 10 app all these&nbsp;while it was sitting at the task bar :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I did&nbsp;run a&nbsp;belarc audit and also ran ShowKeyPlus to obtain Office product key and the embedded Windows 7 OEM marker present in firmware, alas, the products keys did not work. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly, I have recently&nbsp;performed a similar&nbsp;process on my own-built desktop PC, without reserving / check upgrade status, but the Windows&nbsp;10 activated just&nbsp;fine.</p>
<p>

            <p>Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, it was mentioned earlier on but I noticed from your next post that you had missed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, I should not be wasting your time.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
I&nbsp;appreciate that you are now busy making a system image.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If your office has several computers then you could usefully consider third-party imaging utilities as they tend to be easier to manage [if you just stick to the Windows imaging tool then managing multiple images from multiple computers can&nbsp;become a nightmare].&nbsp;
</li><li>One highly-regarded tool is Acronis TI [<a href="http://www.acronis.com/en-gb/personal/computer-backup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Acronis True Image 2016</a>]
<del>and it can also work with Windows-made system images as well as images it makes itself</del> - so your current task of making a system image is not wasted.&nbsp; Acronis support is excellent.&nbsp;
</li><li>There are other imaging products, including some free ones, but I have no experience of them.&nbsp;
</li><li><em>I have never noticed Andre saying which imaging tools he uses so you might find an additional post from him later, after you have finished making your current image, giving you an interesting alternative opinion.</em></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Edited 29 Nov 2016 - I have tested Acronis TI 2017 and it can only restore its own .tib images&nbsp;&amp; .vhd images [Windows 7 system images].&nbsp; It cannot restore .vhdx images [Windows 10 &amp;, I believe, Windows 8].&nbsp; Several threads in the Acronis forums and an Acronis
 Knowledge Base article also stated that this limitation existed.&nbsp; I then contacted Acronis support who confirmed the fact.&nbsp; There is no reason to believe that Acronis will add this capability in the future.</p>

    <title>Installed app, deleted, re-installed, but still not visible&#47;able - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacobsfamilycrew  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installed app, deleted, re-installed, but still not visible&#47;able to use</h2>
                    <p>I have several apps that my children use that they accidentally deleted. I tried to reinstall them by going to the Windows App store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When in the store, it says that I own the app and can install it on my computer. I click the green install button, to receive a message from the store saying it was installed successfully.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I cannot find this app anywhere when I go to the list of apps or conduct a search on my Surface RT. I have gone back to the Windows store, looked up the app there once a gain to see that it says the app is already installed on my computer. When
 I click on "my account", then "my apps", it shows that I have purchased them, but says they are not installed. I try installing again, to receive a message of installation success, yet I can find no evidence of the app anywhere on my Surface.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried restarting the computer, looking for updates, etc... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea of why it says I have installed these apps, but I cannot find them anywhere in my Surface?</p>
<p>By the way, I have been able to install new apps, it seems to only be these apps that were deleted that will not reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help you can offer!</p>

            <p>Thank you for the suggestions. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, after trying to refresh the store and running the apps troubleshooter, nothing has changed.</p>
<p>The store lets me locate the apps, lets me install them, says they are installed, but I cannot find them anywhere in the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The article "why can't I find or install an app from the windows store?" doesn't address the exact problem that I have, but even after following its advice, there is still no luck in getting these apps reinstalled on my Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The apps are:</p>
<p>Elmo Loves ABCs (my toddler's absolute favorite!)</p>
<p>PBS Kids</p>
<p>Fun Kid Racing</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps this is related: The App trouble shooter said I had low disc space. </p>
<p>I have cleared out many photos, other apps, temp internet files and the recycle bin, but there is very little change in my disc space. I have run the performance check
</p>
<p>I cannot seem to find what is taking up my disc space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to my Drive Tools and click on drive Windows C, I do not see any folder with any sizable amount disc space being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are very few files on my Surface. We really use it for my kids to play on, watch Netflix, take pictures and my husband to stream Sports on ESPN GO. There are no music or movie files saved to it. I have been using it just fine for a very long time with
 more apps than it currently has and now I keep seeing the info about low disc space and won't let me reinstall apps we accidentally deleted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for any further advice!</p>

            <p>you can follow these instructions to (perhaps) clear some space taken by updates and other temporary content:</p>

<p>
</p><p>regarding the apps that do not appear as installed, I believe this is due to some corruption in your install - similar issues affect Windows Phones. Personally:&nbsp;I'd reinstall the tablet to fix it.</p>

            <p>Hello Chakrapani,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We realize the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Did you make any changes to your computer? Like installing Software or Windows Updates?</li><li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li><li>Did you try updating drivers through Device Manager?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I guess the problem might be with the display drivers or might with the incorrect display cable connection. If you're on desktop computer, suggest you to check and ensure that the display cable connection on both ends are appropriate. If not, try to make
 these&nbsp;changes accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case problem still persist, execute below troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Try updating the Graphics card drivers through device manager, if you haven't did this before.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a) Open run command by pressing <strong><span>Windows key + R</span></strong> and type “<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong>” (without quotes) and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b) Spot and expand the “<strong><span>Display adapters</span></strong>”.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c). Right click on the Graphics card driver and select “<strong><span>Update Driver Software</span></strong>”. When it prompts to choose an option
<strong><span>How do you want to search driver, </span></strong>then go with <strong>
<span>Search automatically for updated driver software. </span></strong>If you have a driver available on your PC, then select
<strong><span>Browse my computer for driver software, </span></strong>then select the appropriate location, where the driver located on your PC for updating it. (<strong><span>Ensure that PC is connected to Internet while performing this step</span></strong>)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d). Once this is done, restart the computer to check the problem fixed. If it doesn't fix the issue, then Right click on the same driver and select “<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>” then restart the system and let the
 system install the driver automatically on Start. Check and see if it resolve the issue. (<strong><span>Recommended step</span></strong>)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>

<h2>            Windows will not boot form grub menu</h2>
                    I run a dual boot between windows 7 and Linux on my desktop.<br />
I today I removed Ubuntu 11.04 as I don't like the new unity interface. <br />
I then used my windows 7 CD to fix the master boot record. I decided to try out a new Linux distro called Moon OS so installed it in the partition which previously had Ubuntu no it. Moon OS installed fine. Later on I decided to boot into windows I got to the
 grub menu selected windows 7 the screen went black as if it where about to boot but then just came back to the grub menu page. I went back onto Linux and windows is still on my hard drive. I booted the pc back up using my super grub CD to see if that would
 work but the same thing happened. I have no idea why Windows will not boot as I have installed many different Linux distributions alongside windows 7 on this pc and have had no problem with it what so ever. Does anyone know what the problem is

<h2>            Skype number calls to phone on unlimited calls to the USA</h2>
                    I have a Skype number which I pay and then I bought unlimited calls to the USA because I frequently contact my daughter. She does not have a computer and therefore my number which is a NY number is ideal because I can contact her all the time. This afternoon
 when I dialled her number the voice said - there is high volumes of calls from this number and proceeded to prompt me to enter two numbers, and again two numbers and then hung up.&nbsp; What kind of service is this - I paid for unlimited calls but now Skype decides
 I cannot have the high volumes???? New trick this, I am furious because it is important for me to make contact with my daughter.

<p>It sounds like the restriction is imposed by her phone carrier, possibly as an anti-spam measure. If that is the case, she would need to contact her carrier to see if this restriction can be lifted against your number.</p>

<h3> dirtrider  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7 Backup and Restore</h2>
                    
<p>I do a weekly backup of my system and I may need to do a restore soon due to hardware changes. Now I need to know what is actually backed up. Will my application settings be backed up. I am looking at stuff like Outlook profiles address books and email accounts.
 If they are once I do a fresh install of Win7 should I do my restore before or after I install my applications such as Office. Also I see a shadow is created what is this? Why I need to know is if my hardware changes and drivers change and the shadow is the
 same as an image will it be better not to restore the shadow portion. Just thinking if it is like an image it would then restore all my old drivers for the hardware and I would be back to where I was before the hardware change.</p>
<p>I will be changing out MB and CPU so I am sure being different to what I have now I will have some type of issues.</p>

<p>There are two types of backup functionality in Windows 7:</p>
<p>Backup and Restore - this backups your personal files, Libraries and settings. This does not backup programs or the Windows operating system.</p>
<p>System Image - this backups everything, basically, it creates and image of the computer.</p>
<p>If you did a backup and restore, it does really matter whether you restore before or after you have reinstalled the applications since its really just the user data.</p>
<p>If you do a System Image, it restores the exact image of your system, the only thing you might reinstall is possibly applications or drivers for devices since your last system image was created.</p>
<p>What do you mean by Shadow? I know that Windows 7 has a feature called Previous Versions based on a technology called Shadow Copy Service. Previous version keeps multiple versions of edited files. So if you edit a picture and you decided you don't want to
 keep that change, you can restore it to an earlier version.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have looked everywhere but cannot find an answer to this problem. I checked device manager and all the USB controllers and drivers are functioning properly.</p>

<p>I had the same problem and found an unlikely solution somewhere on the web (wish I could remember where).&nbsp; The solution was to uninstall iTunes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem, which involved a printer and an internal CD/DVD drive that the computer would not recognize.&nbsp; I deinstalled and reinstalled all the relevant drivers and nothing was helping. While it did not occur to me at the time, the problem started immediately
 after I had upgraded the version if iTunes on my Windows 7 PC.&nbsp; Someone cited iTunes as being an unlikely culprit in a similar problem.&nbsp; Being desperate, I tried it and it worked! My PC, printer and CD/DVD drives are once again fully functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>iTunes has gotten to be such a messy beast, I really won't miss it.</p>

<h2>            Adware problem due to files in HKLM and other such folders</h2>
                    <p>I have been facing a problem of adware for the last week or so. All the ads shown are powered by VIDsquare, i installed some anti-malware software to delete these files but the free versions ( and windows defender) are not picking up anything whereas the
 paid ones only detect the malwares but i cannot remove them as we need to buy them but when i check for their locations, most of them were located in folders like HKLM, HKU, etc. when i opened registry editor I saw a couple of suspicious files like BCD000000000
 which is required or windows vista ( I am running windows 10) , a folder named AD and many other folderwith random names such as {0hfgfjhkewhfkugwjfkhfkhu}, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also i cannot clear th browing data and reset my microsoft ege browser or reset the windows from settings ( it always shows some errors) How do i solve this problem?</p>
<p>Can i get to know the names of the folders in registry editor which i can remove without fear of ruining my system?</p>
<p>Please Help</p>

<p>Those random folder names you say {0hfgfjhkewhfkugwjfkhfkhu} are GUIDs...</p>
<p>3FBBE8F7-5FF7-4EF0-8D1A-58E3F963698F ... for example... They are random and unique... Thats why they are called Global Unique Identifiers... They are essential for Windows to identify stuff... Hands away from them.</p>

<h2>            Fable III free... but only for French people&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I downloaded this free Fable III GoD today... Only to find out it only has support in French.</p>
<p>What about an English version of this game to put on the marketplace? That would be so much better!</p>
<p>Sorry but this way i'll NEVER buy a game on demand from the marketplace, I live Belgium and we have 2 languages here. But guess what? Majority actually speaks FLEMISH, wich is the Belgian equivalent of DUTCH!</p>
<p>So what if a game doesn't support Dutch? Wouldn't it be much more logical to put it in English? Right now, you guys are going to release 2 free games EVERY MONTH up until Xbox One release day, and I can't play any of them because:</p>
<p>- My main language is FLEMISH<br />
- My second language is ENGLISH<br />
- I HATE French!<br />
- I CAN'T READ, SPEAK or UNDERSTAND French.</p>
<p>So, what do I do? In need of serious help! Changing locale and language isn't quite helping. Fable III also has NO other language option but French...<br />
What if I actually bought the game? I would be RIPPED OFF and discriminated along with so many others? That's the reason I'll never spend money to GoD's on your marketplace... They're all in FRENCH...</p>
<p>A new generation is coming? and even after 10 years this whole language issue can't be fixed or MS is busy with much more important things then to keep its fans happy? hmmm...</p>

            <p>Hey there Neo!<br /><br />I'm sorry to hear about the language issues you're having with Fable III.<br /><br />Each region has the version of the game with the language that fits that region. If your account region and console locale are both set to your physical location, then it will download the version of the game that is assigned to that region.<br /><br />Have you checked to make sure that your Account Region (account.live.com) and Console Locale (Settings, System, Console Settings, Language and Locale) are both set to your physical location?<br /><br />Have you checked the settings to see if there is an option for subtitles in different languages?</p>

<p>i stupidely put a password on my hdd (someone very wack told me that virus can get there )and the password change without reason so i cannot use my laptop</p>
<p>and i bought a ssd and my computer no longer recognize it as a hard disk but i installed it before&nbsp; and put back the original hdd (more gb) .thank you for your help im lost and the companie all sleep is it a new way to rip off people???????</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Is that&nbsp;three different issues?</p>
<p>Treating them as they are for now...</p>
<p>What do you mean you, "put a password on [your] hdd"?&nbsp; Did you encrypt it?&nbsp; Do you mean you setup a BIOS password you have to enter before it will even attempt to boot?&nbsp; Something else?</p>
<p>It is unlikely either of the first two scenarios I gave (encryption of the drive or BIOS boot password) would have ever gotten into a situation where a, "password change[d] without reason" &lt;-- as the only reason would have been someone changing it.&nbsp; So what
 do you mean there?&nbsp; What happened?</p>
<p>Now you said you bought a new solid state drive - - I guess to replace the one you cannot get into? - - and, "[your] computer no longer recognize[s] it as a hard&nbsp;[drive]"?&nbsp; You added "no longer", so it was originally recognized in the BIOS?&nbsp; Now it is not
 seen in the BIOS?</p>
<p>Now you have&nbsp;the, "original hdd" back in the machine and it is seen in the BIOS?&nbsp; And working?&nbsp; And it is the one that has a "password" maybe?</p>
<p>I didn't even comprehend, "... and the companie all sleep is it a new way to rip off people?" &lt;-- you may want to re-word that if it is part of the question.</p>

<h2>            Xbox condones using botting programs in games</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1); text-align: left">I have sent cheating reports to Xbox enforcement team over 200 times to at least 4 dozen Xbox live accounts blatantly using botting programs in The Elder Scrolls Online. This is now week 3 and I still see these same accounts bot farming crafting nodes to sell for real world currency. So I have come to the conclusion that Xbox allows this kind of behavior.</span></p>

            <p>Marcus,</p><p>I Highly Agree With Your Point.</p><p>Xbox Needs To Pay More Attention To Bots, Since It Makes Games Less Fun.</p><p>Bots Are Quickly Growing Due To Newer, More Popular Games Such As Fortnite.</p><p>Come To Think Of It, It Would Be Good If Xbox Ambassadors Had An Option To Become A Bot Hunter, Trying To Find Bots In Specified Games, Therefore Getting Xp For Each Bot They Find.</p><p>Anyway, I Highly Support Your Opinion.</p><p><br /></p><p>- Kai</p>

            <p>I think Xbox needs to show Zero tolerance for this kind of behavior i.e. out right disable their consoles with zero warnings given. My low ball estimate of how much this individual player or players working together is about $500 a day in selling in game items for real world currency. Temporary suspension of account/banning of account will do nothing to stop them only immediate disabling of their devices will slow them down or stop them.</p>

            <p>This is an issue that the game Devs would have to address to patch their games. The enforcement team will investigate any users reported to them but it comes down to the game devs to upkeep their games to keep these players from having the ability to do these things.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>It can take awhile for any action to be taken on a reported account. The enforcement team gets thousands of reports daily that need to be investigated. </p>

However, you can find the Windows Firewall in the Control Panel.<br />
<br />
More likely, however, you need to turn on "File and Printer sharing"<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 &#34;There was a problem on our end&#34; How to fix.</h2>
                    <p>OK so i have been trying to get some apps on the windows 10 store. And after a couple of attempts and looking up on how to fix this problem i came up with nothing that can fix it. I am trying to get my new free demo of the Minecraft windows 10 version but
 every time i try to get it a box comes up and says "Something went wrong on our end" And this is happening with everything i try to download. If anyone knows how to fix this please leave a response explaining how.</p>

<p>Is there a way to automatically start/stop a service when I open/close a program? Don't need some services to run all time. Some example programs are Acronis TrueImage Home, Cisco VPN Client, iTunes and many others.</p>

            You could do it by running the application from a batch file rather than the application directly. In the batch file you could use the command to start/stop services.<br />
<br />
I have to ask....why are you trying to mess with the services? Is there something that is interfering?<br />
<br />
You could also set whatever services to manual and start and stop them as required.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

            I was thinking of a batch file, too, but what would the code look like? Maybe the task scheduler would also be a way to try.<br />
<br />
The batch file needs to do the following things:<br />
<ol>
<li>Start a service</li><li>Start the application</li><li>Wait silently in the background (and show no command prompt window!) till the user closes the program<br />
</li><li>When the program is closed, stop the service</li><li>Batch file closes/terminates itself</li></ol>
There are some programs I use only once or twice a month but they have services running all the time, I just don't want that. For example the Cisco VPN Client has a service always running but I need that tool only once a month or less so there's no need for
 the service to be running all the time. Same goes for many other programs I have. I don't want those services to use system ressources all the time.<br />

            My computer is NOT short of memory, I have never said that.<br />
<br />
I want to do this because<br />
a) I just don't want to have unnecessary services etc. running all the time (even if they don't slow down my PC noticably) and<br />
b) I like to try out things and play around with stuff.<br />
<br />
But thanks for that very helpful answer, anyway. I should have made a disclaimer: Please don't post useless stuff like "I don't have a solution for this very specific problem but maybe this completely different almost off-topic comment might help."<br />

            Maybe my reaction was a little too harsh.<br />
<br />
So I think we should try to get back to the core problem. It's not a lack of memory but I am a sort of user who likes to have only programs/services running that are absolutely necessary. Also, I'm interested if this is possible at all, I see this as kind of
 an educational thing for myself (and others might profit from that, too).<br />
<br />
I use, for example, the Cisco VPN Client once every six weeks or so but the service starts up every time I start my computer and I think that's a waste of system ressources, even though this might not be noticable. Now other programs I use with the same (ir)regularity
 start their services, too, and so it adds up. Still there might be no noticable performance decrease, but the fact THAT the services are running keeps bugging me.<br />
Bugs me even more with iTunes: It has three services (Bonjour, AppleUpdate, iPhoneHelper) that are monitoring my network and my usb devices only to start up iTunes for the rare case that I might plug in my iPhone. Sometimes I connect my iPhone to my computer
 only to charge it and keeping it near me but iTunes always pops up and starts it's syncing etc. I only want the program to do that when I start it manually. In this case I would like to start the three iTunes services only when I start iTunes and stop them
 on closing the program.<br />
<br />
Since those services are related to the specific programs only, It has no negative effect on the overall system. I am not talking about Windows core system services here, just that one or two services needed to run a very specific (third party) program. Since
 services start/stop very quickly, I wouldn't mind if that slows down the start of the program by half a second or so because that's tolerable once in weeks.<br />
And it wouldn't cause a loss of user experience / convenience, because the programs will still work fine (I tested that by manually starting/stopping services) and the services would start/stop automatically without the user noticing it.<br />
<br />
Maybe that's just me but I am annoyed with that background stuff when it's not needed. I am a person who likes to keep it minimal but
<u>without</u> sacrificing functionality.<br />
<br />
A good example is Firefox: It has an update service that is inactive and only starts up every 4-5 weeks to update the brwoser, then it stops again.<br />

            <p>The FF update does not function every 4/5 weeks it operates constantly and will trigger an update as soon as that update is released. (once FF is opened)</p>
<p>By default the Mozilla Maintenance service is set to manual, stopped</p>
<p>There are some programs which have an autoupdate notification service or startup&nbsp;that only checks every xx weeks.</p>
<p>Whilst you could create a batch file to start a service, then pause befor starting a program, you would then need to create a seperate script/batch to stop a service after you closed the program.</p>
<p>And simply stopping a service may have no effect on resources, and for some specific services it may require a reboot</p>

            Yes, the service is stopped and set to manual, therefore it uses no ressources and is functional when needed.<br />
<br />
But let's don't discuss Firefox any further. So how can I do that thing with the services? Maybe using the Task scheduler instead of a batch?<br />

            <p>Hello Marcos R,</p>
<p><br />
You can use a batch file to stop and start services. However, before you do so you can use Msconfig and selective startup to see how stopping these services will affect your system.
<br />
<br />
There is a 3rd party site that will walk you thru these steps and shows a batch file that you may want to follow..
<br />
<a href="http://www.watchingthenet.com/how-to-print-to-a-file-instead-to-a-printer-in-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.watchingthenet.com/how-to-print-to-a-file-instead-to-a-printer-in-windows.html</a></p>
<p>Use at your own risk as the steps in the site have not been tested by Microsoft.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps with your issue. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />
<br />
<br />
Marilyn </p>

            Hello Marilyn,<br />
<br />
thanks for that information. Unfortunately those batch files don't stop services <i>
automatically</i> when I close the program, I still have to click that batch file. The same goes for starting programs: In this case, too, I have to click the batch file first but I want to click only on
<i>one</i> thing and do it all at the same time. <br />
<br />
<u>I have figured out a way on my own how to start services automatically together with a program; in this example for the Cisco VPN Client (but it works well with all the other programs, too):</u><br />
I went to the Windows Task Sheduler and created an event that first starts the CiscoVPNService and then the Cisco VPN Client itself. I set up a shortcut to that event on my desktop so that whenever I doubleclick on the shortcut, the Task Scheduler starts the
 service and then the program. This way I don't have to doubleclick a batch file first and then the program, because all happens with
<i>one</i> doubleclick.<br />
<br />
That means that the first half of my problem is solved: starting services together with a program. The second half of my problem is still unsolved though. How do I automatically stop those services when I close the program?<br />
(Right now I keep the services, once manually started, running because after the next reboot those services are stopped until I click that custom shortcut again. So, I can live with that, but I'd really really like to know how to stop them on closing a program.)<br />

    <title>Windows 8.1 retail license can be upgraded to Windows 10 retail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ak1189  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 retail license can be upgraded to Windows 10 retail license or not</h2>
                    <p>I had purchased Windows 8.1 Pro <strong>License Full Version Retail </strong>from Microsoft online 2 years back. and this license can be installed on any PC and transferred to any PC. I want to know that if I upgrade to Windows 10 Pro , then Windows 10 Pro
 Upgrade license will be same as before. </p>
<p>Is Windows 10 Pro Upgrade license will be <strong>License Full Version Retail ?</strong></p>
<p><em>Since I read on WWW that Windows 10 license will be tied to that System on which the Upgrade offer was used, and in that case my
</em><strong>License Full Version Retail will not remain </strong><strong>License Full Version Retail.
</strong></p>
<p>and in that case my <strong>L</strong><strong>icense Full Version Retail will be downgraded and that will put brakes on my journey to upgrade to Windows 10.
</strong></p>
<p>I hope that I have put across my query effectively. Thanks.</p>

            <p>I think the general belief is that it will carry the same licensing conditions as the qualifying product, however we wont know for certain until we can see the Windows 10 EULA (not quotes from previous versions).</p>
<p>
</p><p>if it doesn't then there is little difference between OEM and retail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told by Microsoft that the Windows 10 EULA will be available at launch, not before, that is you will see it when you come to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure this question will be answered properly on the 29th</p>

<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing

</p><p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM licenses </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail

            Hi ,
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am a Microsoft Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with possible resolution to the issue you are reporting.
<br />
<br />Can you elaborate on what you mean what using Windows 10?  Where they on your pc and got deleted or did you upgrade and they are no longer there?
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

            Hi Dianna, 
<br />
<br />I'm sorry to hear about your pictures and docs. When did this happen? Did you upgrade to Win 10 and then they disappeared? If you could give me a little more info we can try to troubleshoot this! 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

            Your files should be in C:\Windows.Old folder. This folder will be hidden, so you need to make it visible by opening File Explorer &gt; View tab &gt; Check Hidden Items &gt; Restart your File Explorer.
<br />Now, you should traverse the folders appropriately to find your files.

            Hi Dianna,
<br />
<br />There are 2 possible locations where you files may be found:
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Check to see if C:\Windows.Old exists
<br />
<br />If so, open that folder and explorer the Users folder inside . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />If not:
<br />
<br />You may be logged into a temporary account . . . 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see another username that looks like yours
<br />Open that folder and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.)       
        </p>

            To recover your personal files, click Start &gt; File Explorer
<br />
<br />Click This PC
<br />
<br />Open the system drive where Windows 10 is installed represented by the Windows logo.
<br />
<br />Open the folder Windows.old
<br />
<br />Open the Users foldeR
<br />
<br />Open your old account folder which should contain your files. In my case, its Andre.
<br />
<br />Open each personal folder which will contain your files.
<br />
<br />Press Control + A or click Select All then click Copy or Cut
<br />
<br />Launch a new File Explorer window (press Windows key + E or click Start &gt; File Explorer) then navigate to the respective personal folder (Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos) then paste the files there.
<br />
<br />Repeat the same steps for other folders containing files such as Music, Pictures, Videos and Downloads.
