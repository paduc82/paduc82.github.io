    <title>Forza 6 NASCAR add-on almost delivers...... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fatt47  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forza 6 NASCAR add-on almost delivers......</h2>
                    
<p>The NASCAR add-on came out within the Forza 6 game and it basically hit the mark when it comes to the visuals, the sounds, the feel of the NASCAR's physics wise, the racing wheel support so nice job, but!</p>
<p>With this really good attempt at NASCAR they then fail to add basic needed tools for users to enjoy.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>The MP league feature is limited in regard to actual tracks that NASCAR races on and once you get the feel of what is offered events are full of master tuners who seem to be able to push their tunes past what these vehicles can actually do. Along with that
 downside the pit feature that is forced in the League events seems to be broken with some sort of a glitch so those who have figured out how to manipulate it can do so and capitalize on it.</p>
<p>The Private match side of the race lobby does have a Private Match feature to create races with a ton of setting for a host to create a pretty darn good Spec Car racing scenario but, there's No ability that I can see anyway to create a good Spec Race layout
 in a Private Match &nbsp;then open it to the public. Give us tools to create a good race atmosphere then be able to boot those who seem to have no interest in fairness or clean racing.I created a really fun Spec Race layout that is as realistic and challenging
 as I think the game will allow me to create and I don't have enough friends on my list to make it worth resetting each session.</p>
<p>Another fail, No ability to save a layout in the Private Match mode once you put it all together, once you create it there's no way to do a simple save layout, another lame omission. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the add-on was a really good attempt but fell short of being outstanding with replay value due to the ones in charge not taking the logical and simple approach to providing a good product.</p>

<p>For the life of me I cant understand why Forza spends all the money and time to laser scan tracks,and then ruin them by setting the default FOV setting so high that it stretches the tracks and straightens the turns. Its like trying to race or drive a car
 while looking thur a peep whole on a door. Why they didn't stop raising it when everything started to look as if it was growing out of a circle in the middle of the screen is beyond me. I did get a laugh out of the way it seems that every seat, the back rest
 of every seat, is laid all the way back like I'm cruising. </p>

<p>Personally I use the Hood cam and a rear view mirror feature for racing games and I don't buy one if it doesn't have those two features. I can live without the rear view mirror but the Hood view is a must and the only one that suites my needs.
</p>
<p>One would think that the inside the car is the most realistic view I guess but it makes me feel to closed in, I don't get that feeling in my real car so why would I do a racing game feeling like I'm in a box.
</p>
<p>The Rear view in racing games always looks to arcadish for my tastes and exaggerates irregular movements.</p>
<p>I only race with a racing wheel and have for 15 years or so, racing with a controller seems so again arcadish to me.</p>
<p>Blipping the sticks to keep a car straight is so annoying, racing wheels turn the game into a proportional steering scenario and the results deliver the most realism in that respect.</p>
<p>So my original theme here with this thread was in regard to the need for more NASCAR official tracks and the Private Match feature with some of its issues like the lack of a Save feature when setting up a Private Match?</p>
<p>Do you have any input on those issues?</p>

<p>From what?&nbsp; What hardware?&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds like you need to use the BIOS settings to change the boot device order so an alternate device is chosen before your hard drive.</p>

Good luck<br />

            ok are you trying to upgrade xp to windows 8? or are you formatting your hard drive and clean install of windows 8?
<br />
<br />
thinking about it xp wont upgrade to 8 as xp is fats and 8 is ntfs and the 2 are not compatable
<br />
<br />
to copy the detail on to a usb simply put your disc in and the usb stick make sure your usb is big enough to hold windows needs to be about 4 gig+ go t ofole properties and click show hidden files this will show all files on disc ones every thing is showing
 do ctrl+a to select all then ctrl c to copy open the usb drive and paste it to it using ctrl v if you are not sure of any of this let me know as it will fail if you do not have all the files.<br />
<br />
then i am afraid it is back to bios and get your pc to boot from usb <br />
<br />
and see how you go if you&nbsp; have any problems give me a shout and i will help you <br />
<br />

<h2>            How can I access files on my external hard drive with windows 7 OS, when I attach it to a computer with windows vista&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>When I try to change permissions, I get an error message: Error Applying Security. An error occurred while applying security infromation to root:\boot, root:\bootmgr, root:\System Volume Information&nbsp; Access is denied.</p>
<p>When I open windows explorer it only shows the boot folders and not the user folders. Any suggestions will be helpful. Thankyou</p>

<ol>
<li><span><span>Where are you trying to change the permissions?</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest that you first take ownership of the drive once you connect to the computer and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>To take ownership of a folder</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 the folder that you want to take ownership of, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the&nbsp;<strong>Security</strong> tab, click&nbsp; <strong>Advanced</strong>, and then click the &nbsp;<strong>Owner</strong> tab.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 &nbsp;<strong>Edit</strong>.&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the name of the person you want to give ownership to.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 you want that person to be the owner of files and subfolders in this folder, select the &nbsp;<strong>Replace owner on subcontainers and objects</strong> check box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Troubleshoot "access denied" when opening files or folders</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above step fails then check if you access the files and folders when you connect the drive to any other computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            Adobe Photoshop uninstall error in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a problem uninstalling Photoshop Elements 10.&nbsp; When I try to uninstall it I get and error that says: "Error 1316. the specified account already exists" and the uninstall cancels.&nbsp; I checked the Adobe forums and there was a link to a Microsoft
 Fix It utility that someone says worked but when I click the link it only goes to the Microsoft support home page, not fix it utility anywhere.&nbsp; What I need to know is what does this error mean and what do I do to fix it so I can uninstall it using the uninstall

            <p>Yes, sometimes reinstalling will fix things enough so that a subsequent uninstall will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work and if IOBit Uninstaller couldn't uninstall it, perhaps Revo Uninstaller can.&nbsp; I usually suggest trying the free version first, but in your case, you probably should go straight to the free trial of the Pro version.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi ZigZag, thank you for responding.</p>
<p>Yes, the USB is bootable, at least it was prior to me installing the new SSHD. When I put back my old hard drive, it takes forever or it shuts down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other laptop I have has Vista installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of my financial hardship, I can't afford to upgrade to Windows 7 or to buy a new laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the USB that had the Windows on it broke &nbsp;:(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm really stuck &nbsp;:(</p>

            Hi KyleChristian1
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option.
<br />
<br />1. Troubleshoot Power
<br />Type troubleshoot in Cortana Search &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &gt; Click Power &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow on-screen direction.
<br />
<br />2. Restore Default for Power Settings
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; sleep &gt; Click Additional power settings to open Power options &gt; Click Change Plan Settings &gt; Click Restore default settings for this plan
<br />
<br />3. Disable Fast Startup
<br />Reach to Power options as in previous step &gt; Click Choose what the power buttons do &gt; Click Change settings that are currently unavailable &gt; Scroll down to Shutdown settings and uncheck Turn on fast startup &gt; Click Save changes
<br />
<br />4. Uninstall / Install Battery Driver (Only for laptops)
<br />Shut down your computer &gt; Detach power chord &gt; Remove battery (if fixed no need to remove) &gt; Attach power chord &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; Expand Batteries &gt; Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System &gt; Uninstall &gt; Shutdown the computer &gt; Remove the power chord &gt; Attach your battery &gt; Attach your power chord &gt; Reboot the computer to automatically install the driver
<br />
<br />5. As a last resort, you should perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not an install of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            Hi Kyle.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br /> 
<br />Most Sleep problems are caused by the Display driver, so try updating yours from the PC or Device maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service tag.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then in Device Manager on Display device Driver tab choose Roll back, Uninstall (then restart to reinstall) or try another one previously installed at Device Manager&gt;Display adapter&gt;Driver&gt;Update Driver&gt;Browse&gt;Let me pick.  
<br />
<br />In addition there are steps here to specifically troubleshoot Sleep mode problems:  <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sleep-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sle...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Keyboard Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br /> What also might work is to go into Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Keyboard device, on Driver tab try Updating the driver automatically.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the same location try rolling back or Uninstalling the Keyboard driver, which works in a surprising number of cases where keyboard is messed up by Updates.  Restart PC to reinstall driver. 
<br />
<br />See if the keyboard will work without the problem in Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If not try the On-screen Keyboard  at Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Keyboard &gt; Turn On the On Screen Keyboard.  
<br /> 
<br />Try resetting the keyboard:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-settings-default-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-se...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also remap keyboard keys using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap-fix-keyboard-layout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap...</a>
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if an Update reinstalls and causes the same problem uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>

<br />If none of these works then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>So, I thought I had. I know that I had started the process in downloading the repair install, but I must not have finished the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I would revisit it, as when I view my USB, I couldn't find what I was looking for in regards to the install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finished it earlier this week, and so far things have been fine, although I will mention this caveat: I have not had much time to work in Excel on my personal computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am cautiously optimistic that the problem is resolved, for now, but I will be keeping an eye on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies for the incomplete process in my second response, I really thought I had done the repair/reinstall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all for your help, and Vijay, thank you for following up (unintentionally) encouraging me to rethink whether I had finished the process.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Accidentally Deleted Important folders.</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone. I'm Harsha.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From past few days I've been trying to delete a folder but when I press Del or Shift+Del, nothing happened, I checked properties, in General tab -&gt; attributes, there's a square box marked Read only.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/946528a5-d138-41d8-bce6-d764b02d4cad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/946528a5-d138-41d8-bce6-d764b02d4cad" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After unchecking Read-only and pressing apply</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b07d84f0-388b-442b-bbf2-3203d6bda06b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b07d84f0-388b-442b-bbf2-3203d6bda06b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I press Ok, this happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f03e1846-c62e-405b-b1d7-7169795b34c8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f03e1846-c62e-405b-b1d7-7169795b34c8" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>So I typed command " cd/ " to root drive D.</p>
<p>then again typed command " dir /x " (reference youtube video)</p>
<p>and typed " D:\&gt;rmdir /q /s lrtimelapse "</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then 5-6 lines of something came, I went back to local drive D and found that the folder still exists and
</p>
<p>I lost my MOST IMPORTANT folders next to that folder.</p>
<p>I don't know what wrong that I did, I did terrible mistake and I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I lost biggest collection family photos and memories. There's nothing to restore from Recycle bin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE : Above command screens are done later, and not the actual at that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way, any possible thing I can do to get them back, they so much important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Help me.</p>

            Hi UhbTipton, 
<br />
<br />I‚Äôd entertain uninstalling Chrome, and reinstalling. 
<br />
<br />Settings - Apps - find google chrome, click on it, and uninstall.
<br />
<br />I would then delete the google app data folder - C:\Users\YourUserAccount\AppData\Local\Google 
<br />
<br />Right click on google, and delete. That will remove any files that may have been messing this up. *** Do you have extensions and bookmarks that you need to save? If you are logged into the chrome browser, they‚Äôll come back on their own, but if you aren‚Äôt, and we delete this folder we may remove them *** - let me know before proceeding, I don‚Äôt want you to lose any items in chrome if you need them. 
<br />
<br />Once the folder is deleted, reboot. 
<br />
<br />Go to www.google.com/chrome 
<br />
<br />And download/install chrome. try to access fbook, insta, etc. and see if we have better luck.

            <p>Hi Abigail,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer few questions to narrow down the issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What happens&nbsp;when you play these files on Windows Media Player? </p>
<p>2. Do you get any error messages? </p>
<p>3. Have you checked the issue using a different media player? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like you may have to install third party codecs on the computer to play the files mentioned.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Media Player includes some of the most popular codecs, such as MP3, Windows Media Audio and Windows Media Video, but it doesn't include the codecs required for Blu‚Äëray Discs, FLAC files or FLV files. If something isn't working with Windows Media
 Player, you might not have the right codec on your PC. The easiest way to solve the problem is to go online and search for the codec you need.</p>

                    <p>I am running Windows 8.1 and today I went to open the Windows Store and I got the message: &nbsp;"This version of Windows is no longer supported by Windows Store. &nbsp;Get the newest version of Windows."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened overnight because I was using the store yesterday. &nbsp;This seems so unfair to users because I don't want to go to Windows 10. If I did, I would have converted to it a long time ago. &nbsp;What can we do?</p>

    <title>Despite setting my Communications settings to &#34;Do Nothing&#34;, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rhettorical  say:</h3>
<h2>            Despite setting my Communications settings to &#34;Do Nothing&#34;, the Music app still lowers its volume when I switch to a different app.</h2>
                    I had this problem a few months ago, and setting my communication preferences worked for a short time. Then, for no good reason, the volume began to lower again whenever I would get a Skype call. I figured I would just live with it, until today, when it
 now lowers every time the app loses focus. Unless I pin it to the side of my monitor, it's ridiculously quiet and I can't fix it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I suppose this is more a plea for Microsoft to do something to fix this ongoing issue than it is an actual question, but if anyone has a suggestion, I'd be more than happy to have it.</div>

            The issue is only with this app. I've updated it, reinstalled it, force-closed it, restarted my computer, signed out and back in to XBox Music, tried every troubleshooting method in the book, and it just doesn't work.

            Since the last time I updated this post, I've clean installed Windows 8 twice now, and every single install has the same issue. Every time I get a Skype call, the volume lowers even though I set it to not, and doesn't re-raise until I restart my computer.

            <p>Obviously I did that. Not that I have a choice, it automatically forces updates anyhow. I updated default sound drivers, disabled them, re-enabled them, reinstalled my headphone drivers a number of times, tried third-party drivers, and nothing works.</p>

            If you have an x in front of the icon, it is muted mandatorily. If you are using a sound card, the card may have been unplugged, so shut off the power to the computer and turn the computer off, then try and plug in the card again. If you are plugged into
 ports on the front of the case, try restarting the computer. Then check if you have the right drivers for the onboard sound. Also try plugging the headphones into every headphones-marked port on the entire case-maybe one will work and then you can troubleshoot
 the broken component.

<p>OK...as a test I connected to this free PPTP VPN service to make sure my iPod Touch VPN functionality would work.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bestfreevpn.com/iphone-ipad-free-vpn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bestfreevpn.com/iphone-ipad-free-vpn/</a></p>
<p>After configuring the server settings I was able to successfully connect, verify my iPod Touch IP had changed to the IP assigned by their PPTP VPN server and that I could surf the internet, check email, etc...etc.</p>
<p><a href="http://cid-25ab668da65c8fbe.photos.live.com/self.aspx/Windows%20images/iPodVPN-Status-1.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cid-25ab668da65c8fbe.photos.live.com/self.aspx/Windows%20images/iPodVPN-Status-1.PNG</a></p>
<p><a href="http://cid-25ab668da65c8fbe.photos.live.com/self.aspx/Windows%20images/iPodVPN-Status-2.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cid-25ab668da65c8fbe.photos.live.com/self.aspx/Windows%20images/iPodVPN-Status-2.PNG</a></p>
<p>This screen, from the <a href="http://www.whatismyip.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.whatismyip.com</a> site, verified to me that all traffic from my iPod Touch was being routed through the VPN tunnel to their server and back again. The public IP reported is different than
 what I see from my Win 7 laptop at the same time even though both the laptop and the iPod Touch are currrently on the same local LAN here.</p>
<p><a href="http://cid-25ab668da65c8fbe.photos.live.com/self.aspx/Windows%20images/iPodVPN-WhatIsMyIP.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cid-25ab668da65c8fbe.photos.live.com/self.aspx/Windows%20images/iPodVPN-WhatIsMyIP.PNG</a></p>
<p><a href="http://theillustratednetwork.mvps.org/LAN/CurrentHomeLAN.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://theillustratednetwork.mvps.org/LAN/CurrentHomeLAN.png</a></p>
<p>So getting back to your original problem I really don't know what is going on with Win 7, at least on my machine, and its built-in PPTP VPN server function. I'm not home now so I have no way of testing that functionality with a Windows VPN client.</p>
<p>The bottom line though is that the PPTP VPN functionality in my iPod Touch works as I expect it to on your iPhone. It comes down to a server issue.</p>
<p>I suggest you test your iPhone against this free VPN server to verify in your own mind that its working then figure out what you want to do next. What exactly do you want to do with the VPN if you can get it working on the Win 7 server PC, ie. file access,
 remote and secure web surfing, etc?</p>
<p><strong>Please NOTE:</strong> The free VPN service changes their access <strong>
PASSWORD</strong> every 12-24 hours and idle sessions more than 4 hours old are automatically disconnected. See the notes at the bottom of their main page.</p>
