<h2>            Remote desktop connection error&#58; The system administrator has restricted the types of logon &#40;network or interactive&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to remote log on to a computer on active directive domain (called computer A) from another computer not on any domain (called computer B). Computer A has windows 8.1 Enterprise. B was upgraded from Win 7 to win 8.1 pro. I have to use putty SSH
 tunnel on computer B for remote desktop connection (RDC). &nbsp;When I have window 7, RDC works wel. Recently I installed Window 8.1 on computer B. I always get the error message "The system administrator has restricted the types of logon (network or interactive)
 that you may use. For assistance, contact your system administrator or technical support".&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I l have logged on windows 8.1 with microsoft account (administrator), &nbsp;local account without email address&nbsp;(administrator), and standard user. All those user are added as "remote desktop users" under system and security/system/remote settings/remote/.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">No
 matter what account, administrator or standard, I use for computer B, I always got above error message. When I type in the wrong user name or password, I will be reminded that the credential is wrong.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>At this time, I can still RDC to computer B from another computer with windows 7. I only have trouble when I RDC from the computer B with window 8.1, so I guess that the problem is in computer B with window 8.1./</p>

<h2>            Lame games with gold</h2>
                    
<p>I am an xbox on user and I have noticed, I am being let down by Microsoft. I have had an xbox one since they started giving out games with gold to xbox one and I have seen that xbox 360 frequently gets better quality games then xbox one. Not only thet, they
 get twice as many. So what I am wondering is why that, with an advanced console and the same paid service that I get less for my money?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most common answer. 360 is ten years old and has a much larger library of games.</p>

<p>So then, as xbox one gets olderand the game library expands will they give us better games And match the frequency?</p>

<p>I dont know about frequency but games should get better. Keep in mind that ones opinion of better games varies from person to person. I may be wrong but I belive it was announced from the start on the One that GwG was going to be once a month. Thats probably
 going to be what they stick with. Also your gold subscription works on both the 360 and the One so in my case I'm getting three games a month with GwG.</p>

<p>I've only downloaded [tag:Idarb] &amp; Strike Suit Zero since GwG started up. &nbsp;None of the other games have really interested me, or I had already bought them.</p>
<p>I've been more happy/impressed with all of the Deals with Gold. &nbsp;I've managed to get some really good games for the One marked down by 50% (or more).</p>

<p>Good mention Eggnogga. Most people forget about deals with gold altogether. I got Titanfall back when it was 50% off. &nbsp;If I had only known that it was going to be 75% off I would have waited. What a slap in the face. Kidding.
</p>
<p>Reminds me of the old american express commercials. Membership has its privileges. But yes they've had some very good deals. And they have them often enough that many people have buyers remorse when someone buys something that goes on sale 2 days later</p>

<p>More and more games will gradually come out for the Xbox One. Remember, the Xbox One has only been out for a little over a year, so the library is going to be small and there isn't the amount of developers working on it yet (probably). It'll take time, but
 we'll see more games come out and the Xbox 360 will start to slow down quite a bit.

<p>The Xbox 360 are outdated. People are not going to be buying those games with cash anymore so might as well give them away for free. Xbox One most games are still very relevant making sells so developers are not going to be giving them away for free while
 those games are still making them money.</p>

<p>Yeah, pretty much what everyone said here. Once the library grows, we'll see more games. As far as whether or not the released games have been good is highly subjective. There haven't been many I've liked. I thought Max: Curse of the Botherhood was fun.
 Guacamelee was megafun IMO. Crimson Dragon was pretty neat. I didn't like IDARB at all, and I haven't played D4 yet either.</p>

<p>Is there any way to rename buttons on the taskbar for open programs?&nbsp; Shortening the name would allow for more buttons to fit and make it much easier to see the name of the open files without having to hover over them.&nbsp; Files could be located among the others
 and opened more quickly.</p>

<p>Ok, here goes.</p>
<p>I'm a 46 year old father of 3 who up until this past March has been blissfully ignorant of the world of online gaming. Since my sons birthday we have grown quite fond of the Halo and Assassin's Creed franchises. Now that we have become somewhat adept at
 those games, I have been considering some online gameplay options. One of the issues that has perplexed me the most is how you develop "Friends". I find that either I'm not looking in the right places or MicroSoft has some enormous glaring holes in the facilitation
 process for neophyte gamers like myself into the WWW of Online game-play.</p>
<p>One of my sincerest desires is to create a list of localized gamers from my childrens school so that they might play online with kids they know. To that end I have drafted a very coarse proposal letter to my sons teacher to be passed up the administrative
 chain of command. I have no idea in today's common senseless school system if this proposal will be greeted with horror or enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please read the proposal and make recommendations/suggestions. Without "YOUR" help in developing this idea into a more polished product, I fear it may die a quick death and I really don't want my ignorance to stand in the way of what I feel is a much needed
 product in the Xbox Live experience.</p>

<p>Its a very well structured letter and based on a solid and safe plan in which you can keep your child social with his friends outside of school and within your local community, which helps when making your first forays into online gaming.</p>
<p>I wish you all the luck in the world with this because it is a very forward thinking proposal you have put forward to your son's school and the other parents, it would also encourage parents to become more aware of what their children could possibly be subjected
 to online. I might also suggest that if you need to show them the kind of stuff their children could be subjected to if allowed to access XBL if left unchecked, you show them Rage footage of people playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2. I would do this is
 in a group meeting at the school if possible </p>

            Hi ColinChallen,
<div><br />
<div>What version of Windows Vista are you running?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>The blobs.bin file is used as a caching mechanism for servicing operations that are set to happen against the system.&nbsp; The file will naturally grow and shrink in size as various servicing actions take place against the machine and are satisfied.&nbsp;
 Typically, if you reboot your system on a machine with a large file, you'll notice that update(s) may have been pended and rebooting satisfies the finalization of the operation and reduces the size of the file.&nbsp; But, all in all, the file is there for caching.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>You can delete the&nbsp;</span><span>blobs.bin file and reboot the system.&nbsp;</span><span>If deleting the file does not resolve the growth issue, set the permission of the file to deny everyone from writing to it. The stack will
 see a failure&nbsp;</span><span>to write to this as a signal that it doesn‚Äôt need caching and it will move on servicing files.</span></div>

<p>Tv on Xbox is protected content and therefor can't be streamed to another device. Also when streaming you grab your screen from the Xbox One which is then projected through the Xbox App. You can still watch TV but not through the Xbox One, you would have
 to get a splitter or manually change the cable</p>

<p>A work around that I have found is to download your cable/inter providers app from the Xbox Store to watch Live TV although the amount of channels you will be able to watch will be limited.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Slow sometimes freezes after updates April 2014</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the updates from April, I have 2 computers (windows 8.1)&nbsp;that sometimes freezes.</p>
<p>They have simular problems, need to wait very long or several reboot before getting a workable situation.</p>
<p>Control-Alt-Delete doesn't work, Applications won't start or taking very long time before showing up.</p>
<p>If I had the change to open eventwiewer and Taskmanager, I didn't saw any application taken lot's of resources.</p>
<p>Before reinstalling the PC's, I decided to remove the updates from april.</p>
<p>On my laptop I removed all Updates from April including the big one -KB2919355</p>
<p>On my Desktop I removed all updates from April <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
except </span>the big one KB2919355</p>
<p>On my Desktop I experied after the reboot a positive speed gain, and again the plesure to work with this computer.</p>
<p>My Laptop is still removing the updates during this writing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next steps are to work a couple of days with this situation to confirm is better.</p>
<p>And then install the missing updates in order to figure out when it's going wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So advice for every one experience freezing issues with windows 8.1, start removing updates from april.</p>
<p>And set windows updates to manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll update this discussion with my findings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards</p>
<p>kurt</p>

            <p>Hi Divya</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran sfc twice. The first time it corrected some Errors, the second time it ran without any Errors.</p>
<p>Then I ran DISM /Scanhealth. It didn't find any damages (I have a german windows version).</p>
<p>Then I ran DISM /Restorehealth which said that all was fine.</p>
<p>But: the Problem as Ayrton describes still persists. fifaconfig.exe starts fifa.exe, then the splash Screen appears and the fifa.exe terminates itself. Under Windows 7 I didn't have any Problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help</p>

            <p>Hi Ayrton</p>
<p>
</p><p>I solved the Problem on my Computer! It was a authorization issue which I found thanks to sysinternals (procexp &amp; procmon).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I suspended the fifa14.exe process in procexp, a window showed with a license error. So I tracked it down with procmon. This is what happened on my Computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fifa14 writes a log in C:\ProgramData\Origin\Logs. The newest file had the Name 1014879-1020471-1002514-1015228_OnlineActivation_Log.html.</li><li>The last line said "Failure opening file to save license. Path: C:\ProgramData\Electronic Arts\EA Services\License\1002514.dlf"</li><li>I gave the current user full Access to the file and restarted the game: and it ran successfully</li></ul>
<p>I hope that you can solve your Problem in a similar way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Uli</p>

Path: C:\ProgramData\Electronic Arts\EA Services\License\1002514.dlf" in the column Log Message.</li><li>Locate this file in your Windows Explorer.</li><li>Right click, select Properties -&gt; Security, you'll see Users and Groups and their right. Select the Change-Button (I have a german Version of Windows, so I don't know the exact english Label).</li><li>Select your user account or a Group to which your account belongs, e. g.

</p><p>I found the file however, there is no error message listed. The problem still persists. I have contacted the EA advisors but they said that they are working on the issue. I don't know how long the problem is going to keep ongoing because it has already been

<p>If win recovery thats possibly because its a PC with a preinstalled version of win7, and a recovery drive, which you would need to access in order to make the recovery disk set. How you do this is a process from your PC maker</p>

<h2>            The User Profile Service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded</h2>
                    
<p>Hey there - I tried all of the fixes from earlier posts with this title and no luck.</p>
<p>My specific situation is this:</p>
<p>First, my main admin account is working fine, just cannot add a new user - new admin or standard.</p>
<p>Also, I must admit I think I must have&nbsp;deleted a user account "incorrectly" on my system in the past. That being said it was too long ago to try a system restore.</p>
<p>I have the same things going on as the&nbsp;user who posted this in response to the common solution posted:</p>
<p><span><em>9. Once the registry editor opens up, look for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList</em></span></p>

<div>
<span><em>10. In the left pane, find the one that starts with S-1-5..... and ends with .BAK; if you don't find one, skip to step
<span><em>10. In the left pane, find the one that starts with S-1-5..... and ends with .BAK; if you don't find one, skip to step
 15</em></span></div>
<p><em><strong>Step 10 doesn't end in .BAK, and Step 15 doesn't have a AppData directory</strong>.</em></p>
<p><span><em>15. If you didn't find a .BAK then try this: Open Windows Explorer to C:\Users\Default\AppData\Local\Application Data</em></span></p>
<p><span><em><strong>Basically these steps didn't work for my computer</strong>.</em></span></p>
<p>I've turned off User Account Controls temporarily and still no good.</p>
<p>I think the answer might be to paste a "clean" Default file over my existing one but not sure and don't know where I would get one of these anyway.</p>

<p>Same issue as this person</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span>
<p>I have attempted to create a new user account, but I receive the following error when I try to log on with it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;the user profile service service failed the logon</strong></p>
<p>Before I go any further let me add that I have activated the hidden administrator account and that is the account I am using to create the new standard user account.</p>
<p><strong><span>Most of the fixes for this issue are due to the fact that manually deleting a user account does not delete the registry key associated with it, and you are required to go to the following section of the registry:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\WINDOWS NT\CURRENTVERSION\PROFILELIST</strong></p>
<p>and delete the key associated with the user account you wish to remove.</p>
<p>This fix DOES NOT help, because whenever I attempt to create a new user, Windows does not bother creating a registry key for the new user. &nbsp;The new user account only shows up in the accounts management window. &nbsp;If I right-click<strong>My Computer</strong>&nbsp;and
 select <strong>Properties , </strong>then <strong>Change Settings </strong>, select the<strong>Advanced</strong>&nbsp;tab, and click<strong>&nbsp;Settings</strong>under<strong>USER PROFILES ,
</strong>the new account does not show up here either.</p>
<p>This is a huge problem. &nbsp;I have other people that use this laptop and I don't want them using my login, or the guest account. &nbsp;I shouldn't have to edit the registry just to make a new account =/</p>
<p>Please tell me there is a fix for this that works. &nbsp;Windows 7 wasn't free, and this sort of trouble is very frustrating for premium software.</p>

<p><span>Hi Marmaduke440,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to first run a System File Checker</span><span> (<span>SFC
 scan). The System File Checker tool to determine whether the issue that you are experiencing is caused by one or more system files that are used by Windows, The System File Checker tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files
 by using the correct versions. </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a.<span>&nbsp;</span>Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>b.<span>&nbsp;</span>Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>c.<span>&nbsp;</span>At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER: sfc /scannow<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When the scan is complete, verify if you can create a new user account and if it works fine. Access the link below to know more information
 about System File Checker tool</span></p>

<p>Hello Srinivas,</p>
<p>Thank you for providing a different answer then I've previously tried.</p>
<p>I ran the System File Checker and it found nothing wrong. I tried a new account after in any case and still the same "the user profile..."error.</p>
<p>Certainly open to any other suggestions.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup. The ADMIN account in Safe<br />
Mode has no password by default (so unless someone changed the password it should be available).<br />
<br />
Some programs like the Google Updater (if you added the Google Toolbar, Chrome&nbsp;or Google Earth)<br />
has been known to cause this issue.</p>

<br />
Use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to user APPLY / OK then raise it back to ADMIN.<br />
This helps clear corruption. Do same for other accounts if needed after following the above message.<br />
<br />
You can use the Hidden Admin Account - Make another account as ADMIN with your same password<br />
(or two with same password) use one to test or fix the other.<br />
<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />

<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion. Since it is very involved and currently my Admin account is signing on just fine - I'm going to back up my system first, then try your method when my schedule lightens up a bit. I should have a chance to try this out in a&nbsp;few days
 from now.</p>
<p>I'll let you know how it goes. Thanks again.</p>

    <title>With the new Skype, how do I choose the type of connections for each - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cougarbrenneman1  say:</h3>
<h2>            With the new Skype, how do I choose the type of connections for each person in the group</h2>
                    <p>I have been hosting groups on Skype for many years, and some of them use a phone and some of them use Skype, and most of them have more than one option. Group members will say, "I'm going to have to use my phone number today," when they have a Skype profile,
 but they won't be near a hotspot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to connect to those people by their preferred method of contact. The old Skype for desktop, which has been deprecated because of security hole, allowed me to do that. The new Skype forces me to use whatever method they choose, which in
 some cases, forces my group members to respond to Skype using their data connections, which is expensive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This restriction on my control of the phone call makes participation in my group impossible for some people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can figure out to work around it may not work, but it will take a lot of time to set up. That is to create new local contact for each person with only one connection type. So I'll title them. "Phone, first name, last name," and "Skype, first
 name, last name."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very annoying. It is unnecessary if Skype engineers had not deprecated features that I use every day. I think that the software architect on the project isn't thinking very clearly.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the New Skype app, there's no option to directly change the preference of the user in which method they want to be called (Skype or mobile/landline).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may advise your contacts to input their preferred contact number on their profile information so that in the event that are not available or online on Skype it will connect to their registered number. If your contacts does not prefer to place their numbers
 on their profile for privacy reasons, you will be needing to add and save their preferred number on your contact list separately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once added you can simply remove the specific Skype contact from the group and replace it with the added contact number that you saved or vice versa depending on the preference of your contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any further questions or clarifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

                    <p>After a surprise anniversary update 2 days ago, my computer plays the connect and disconnect sounds over and over at about half the volume of the normal system sounds after start up.&nbsp; It does this for about 15-20min and then seems to stop regardless of what
 i do.&nbsp; then occasionally it spasses out seemingly randomly.&nbsp; I have a lenovothinkpad yoga s1.&nbsp; the sound plays whether or not i have any external devices plugged in. it does this regardless of what i'm doing. when i go to the device manager, it appears to
 be reloading over and over again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>i have tried the USB power options trick that is most readily available online, and it doesn't work.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you resolve the concern of disconnect and connect sounds playing over and over again, please follow steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Search for <strong>Display Settings</strong> and then click it. </p>
<p>2. Click<strong> Power &amp; sleep.</strong> </p>
<p>3. Click <strong>Additional power settings.</strong> </p>
<p>4. Click <strong>Change plan settings.</strong></p>
<p>5. Click <strong>Change advanced power settings.</strong></p>
<p>6. Click the plus sign (+) beside <strong>USB settings. </strong></p>
<p>7. Click the plus sign (+) beside <strong>USB selective suspend setting</strong></p>
<p>8. Set it to <strong>Disabled.</strong></p>
<p>9. Click <strong>Apply</strong>, then click <strong>OK</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is still there you may try the next troubleshooting steps: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right click the sound icon on the bottom right of the desktop screen ( near the date and time ).</p>
<p>2. Choose <strong>sounds</strong>, when the sound box opens scroll down to you see
<strong>device disconnect</strong>, click and highlight it.</p>
<p>3. Now the bottom left you will see a box with the sound name <strong>Windows Hardware Remove</strong>, click the arrow on this box. Scroll to the top where you see
<strong>NONE&nbsp;</strong> at the top of the list. Click on <strong>apply</strong>, and notice the speaker icon symbol is now missing for the
<span><strong>device disconnect</strong> </span>meaning no sound is chosen.</p>
</p>
</p><p>Let us know what is the outcome. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. </p>
        </p>

            <p>No.&nbsp; This does not work.&nbsp; Why was this marked "Answered"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i had already disabled the usb power settings before writing this, and that step did nothing. but this means that when i'm unplugged, i'm not saving power when i'm not accessing a device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had to turn off the sound, but that means that the computer is connecting and disconnecting to something over and over.&nbsp; that is not a solution or a fix.&nbsp; and now i don't have a connection sound when i legitimately connect or disconnect a device.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Aside from the USB plugins and other external connections, we can also consider internal hardware/devices may cause the issue. Windows tries to recognize the device. This idea was based on the Device Manager that keeps on reloading when you check it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be silly, but in order to isolate the issue, we need to boot the PC <strong>
with all the External hardware removed </strong>from it. Including the mouse, keyboard, printers, modem and external storage. Leave only the Monitor. You can also leave the mouse plugged if you find it hard to access Device Manager without it. Once booted without
 any external plugins, please observe if the issue is still there:<br />
<br />
- If the issue <strong>did not</strong> show, a possible reason of this must be <em>
wear and tear</em> of one of your external hardware <em><strong>or </strong></em>a hardware driver needs to be updated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If it does, then the issue must be coming from the inside. Check if there are inside-wiring that needs to be re-connected. If you are using a laptop computer, ask some help from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also need to consider USB Slots Failure. I remember my own device that had the same issue a year ago. Re-soldering the USB Slot to the board solved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the best possible causes of the issue, but there must be more. The solution might depend in which one do we have now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated and best regards,</p>
        </p>

<p>The chime means that Windows recognized that something was plugged into a port.&nbsp; The fact that it does not show in disk management would indicate to me a failure of the thumb drive.&nbsp; They are really not all that hardy and not very expensive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes you can plug the same thumb drive into a different computer (or even different port) and get a different result.&nbsp; If that does work for you, best bet is to reformat it.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />To block ads in Yahoo mail. 
<br />1. You can add more filters to uBlockOrigin.
<br />2. In AdGuard Base Filters, you can manage filters in preferences section.
<br />3. Also update your filter list on dashboard.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Skype for Business on Mac via Proxy Server CLOSED&#47;CLOSE_WAIT Pile Up</h2>
                    <p>Skype for Business on Mac has seemed to have issues handling connections outgoing when firewalls and proxy servers are involved. I noticed many connections end up in CLOSED or CLOSE_WAIT and continue to pile up over time. Skype eventually tries to use these
 connections in CLOSED/CLOSE_WAIT state which causes degredation in the application. I have proof of this with TCPDumps on the Mac showing the Client attempting to use the connection that has been put into a CLOSE_WAIT or CLOSED state.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are unable to do a dual boot after an update. To narrow down the cause we will require
 a few more information from you. Please reply to the following details:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Which operating system was installed first?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do you see any error message when you try to boot to Linux?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Are you able to see the Linux OS files in the partition?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p><span>You can check for the boot timeout option whether the time to boot to the default OS is changed to 0 seconds.
 To check that, please follow the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press and hold Windows + R key on the keyboard.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type msconfig and click on OK.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on Boot tab.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Under timeout if you see time as 0 seconds then, change the time to at least 10 seconds.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Alternatively, you can check if Linux is listed or not.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p><span>Also, I suggest you to post a screenshot of Disk management with all the partitions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>Note: Make sure you don‚Äôt capture any personal information while taking screenshot.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please reply with the status of the issue, we will be glad to help you further.</span></p>

<h2>            How to run DxDiag on 32bit and a regedit thing</h2>
                    <p>Hello !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try to run a game, The Witcher, but i get the error "don't meet minimum system requirement, etc". After some search, i've found this =&gt;<br />
<br />
http://www.gog.com/forum/the_witcher/fix_minimum_requirements_not_met_on_win7_x64</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is a tweak : we need to look for DirectDraw and some stuff but when i try to run dxdiag, he run in 64 bit, not in 32 bit and i can't find a way to switch to DxDiag 32 bit....
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also need to regedit something but i can't find the path quoted (i've found the "directdraw" but no "emulationonly" inside)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heeeeelp ! Please^^</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks !</p>

            Hello Yann,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please help me with the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Which version of The Witcher game are you having issues with?</div>
<div>2. Have you made any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>
<p>3.&nbsp;What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;What is the complete error message that&nbsp;you receive when&nbsp;you try to run the game?</p>
<div>5. What do&nbsp;you mean when&nbsp;you say "How to run DxDiag on 32bit and a regedit thing"?</div>
<div>&nbsp;
<p>I would like to inform you&nbsp;DirectX 11.2 is included in Windows 8.1&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I would suggest you to check if the version of the Witcher game is compatible with your Windows 8.1 system.</div>

            <p>Thanks for the answers ! (sorry if i make some language/syntaxe mistake, i'm french)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The first The witcher, with latest patch (1.5). This is well-known problem, but no patch from the dev team. There's a solution (adding &nbsp;-dontforceminreqs to the shortcut of the game) but you're forced to play with very, very low textures.</p>
<p>2. Everything changed since it's not the same computer than the last i've runned the game.</p>
<p>3. A laptop, MSI GE60 2PE, it run with a nvidia gtx860m but i also have an Intel chipset (HD graphic 4600). Normally the two don't collapse and the nvidia is automatically used when i play but maybe...? Previous was also a MSI, GX 701.</p>
<p>4. The windows title is just "error" and the message : "Warning Minimum System Requirement Not Met"</p>
<p>5. In the link i've provided, there's another "solution" to the problem (with this solution you're suppose to run the game normally, without low textures), but i need to run DxDiag in 32 bit and my computer seem to run it in 64 bit automatically, so i can't
 check if everything in directdraw 32 bit is enabled. It also say to find a specific line in the regedit and i can't find it. ("EmulationOnly" in Microsoft\DirectDraw)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently reading the links you've provided</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again !</p>

            <p>In Windows 8.1, DirectX is required by many games and multimedia apps. DirectX is built in to Windows and can't be uninstalled. You can find few information in DirectX in this link

            <p>Hello. I have the same problem.</p>
<p>Already tried ruinning the game in compatibility mode (I'm not completely new to Windows...), doesn't change a thing.</p>
<p>The problem we are running in is, that the fix described here:</p>
<p>http://www.gog.com/forum/the_witcher/fix_minimum_requirements_not_met_on_win7_x64/page1</p>
<p>is made for Windows 7, where apparently also in the 64-Bit version of Win7 dxdiag is started in 32-Bit dy default, which does not apply to Win8.1. But we want to see the settings for the 32-Bit DirectX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So could you please just provide an answer to the question, if it is possible to run the 32-Bit dxdiag in the 64-Bit version of Windows 8.1, and whan that is in fact possible, how to do it?</p>
