<h2>            windows explorer &#34;file search&#34; in windows 7 can&#39;t find my files</h2>
                    <p>I have just got a new computer with Windows 7.&nbsp; The last one had XP.&nbsp; The file/search function on Windows Explorer works rather differently on Windows 7, it won't automatically search file names for parts of a file name and some files it won't find at all.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>For example I have files such as NSP~SYC10502CTX&nbsp; </p>
<p>The search function will find all of the files that start with&nbsp;NSP~ but if you type NSP~S then file/search will NOT find the file!&nbsp; And if you type the full file name you cannot find the file!&nbsp; The best that I have managed to find so far it to type "* as
 wild cards in front of the last part of the file e.g. "*CTX.&nbsp; I can then find the file.&nbsp; All of which seems to be a retrograde step in comparison with the file/search functions on XP Windows Explorer.&nbsp; Does anyone have solutions to my problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Funimation App isn&#8217;t working</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I’m wondering if anyone knows how to trouble shoot the Funimation Now app for Xbox 360, the app was working fine earlier today, but it won’t play any videos&nbsp;now, and I just paid for the monthly subscription. It stopped playing videos on my Xbox after I started adding things to my queue off of the online website, and it’s a awful long wait for support. So if anyone sees this, any advice or help you could give me would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance, littlemoonpie 😄</p>

<h2>             External Hard Drive not being read anymore</h2>
                    
<p>Something happened on the last update and it's weird. My External Drive isn't being read anymore. Yeah, I've unplugged everything, plugged it back in, unplugged the power, waited 30 sec blah blah blah. It's not working dudes.</p>
<p>But here's the thing, if it's a game that I have a pin on my home page, I can still play it. I know I have Destiny and Far Cry 4 saved on my external drive and not the internal drive. Neither show on "My Games" list. But I can play both from the homepage
 pin. If the Xbox One was only reading the internal drive (IE my external drive failed), this should not be possible. But it only works on the couple digital games I have downloaded. If I need to insert the disc, I can't play it and it tries to reinstall the
 game. </p>
<p>Today, I tried to do a fresh install of Rainbox Six Seige from the disc thinking it would go to the internal drive because that's the only one Xbox One seems to "see" from My Games at the moment. It installed, told me it was fully installed, but it won't
 launch. </p>
<p>My friend told me he has the same issue. Just bought his external drive about a month ago. Said he only has 2 games on his "My Games" list.
</p>
<p>Something was corrupted on the last update so please roll back. I'm just waiting until there's another update (I guess) which is hopefully soon because I can only play a couple games at the moment. I'm trying to avoid a factory reset.....Tell me you know
 about this issue and will resolve it on the next update (and yes, I have the latest....)</p>

<p>Have you tried unplugging the external hard drive and with it not connected carry out a hard reset on the console by holding the power button on the front of the console for 5-10 seconds and unplug the console for 5 minutes. When the console has powered
 back up try plugging the hard drive back in and see what happens.</p>

<p>Well, I just did what you suggested. No change. I've got like 7 games in the "My Games" menu (I don't even think some of these were saved to the Internal drive). But I can play Destiny and Far Cry from the pin on the home screen but they don't appear on
 the "My Games" list. It's like the Xbox One knows there is an external drive but it's not displaying all the contents. When I look at "Storage" it just lists the Internal Drive. But I think Rainbow Six was installed to the external and I know I'm playing Destiny
 and Far Cry off the external. Something must be corrupted.</p>
<p>If an Xbox team member actually looks at this, I am theorizing that something happened with a Call of Duty 3 update over the weekend. My friend and I both have this same problem and we both updated Call of Duty over the weekend. My brother doesn't have the
 game and his external reads fine. </p>
<p>I'm thinking a factory reset is my only option but I'm going to wait a couple days to see if a console update drops unless anyone has another suggestion. Hard reboot and pulling the plug on both the external and the console for at least 5 min makes no change.

<p>Same here. I've also tried unplugging everything, performing hard reboot, using other USB ports etc.
</p>
<p>Now my external drive just crashes the system, after unplugging it, however, everything starts up just fine.</p>
<p>And just like hchavok19 I've also been updating and playing Black Ops 3 multiplayer (installed on Ext HDD) just before the problems started. &nbsp;</p>

 my computer it gets recognised so the hdd is not broken.</p>
<p>Somebody found a fix for this problem? Thanks!</p>

 Can anyone please suggest what would be wrong??</p>

            <p>Have you tried <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/316-compatibility-mode.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
compatibility mode</a> and trying to run in compat mode for XP-SP3?, and if that still fails, right-click and 'run as admin' as well? &nbsp;These can help with some problematic games.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If there are any officially released patches, obtain them from a known/trusted site and install them.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, <a href="http://www.syberia-series.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=2011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this post</a> seems to suggest its a screen resolution problem, so may be worth a read to see if its the same problem as you have. (<em>see the last post on the page by 'andyboswell')
</em>i.e. try setting your desktop to 800x600 and then see if you can run the game.</p>

<h2>            Grey box top left of background with two arrows rotating in a circle</h2>
                    Hello. I just got this random box at the top left screen. When I noticed it I tried to left click and right click it. It does not allow me to do anything with it. I tried to look through task manager to see if I had any unrecognized programs running. Everything
 seems normal. I do not keep much on this PC but a few games for the most part. I tried restarting multiple times and it still appears. When I restarted the first time it said update and shut down PC. Is this some sort of the most recent update or is someone
 messing with my PC? Thanks to anyone who can help and thank you to anyone willing to try to help figure it out. This is bugging the hell out of me not knowing what it is.

<p>I have a Custom generic Bluetooth dongle, i want to test this in windows 7 using inbuilt Microsoft generic Bluetooth driver.</p>
<p>I have placed the my usb dongle in windows 7 pc.</p>
<p>After that go to Device manger manger and updated the driver software with generic Bluetooth adapter.</p>
<p>I am able to see the Generic Bluetooth adapter in Device manager but not Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator in the Bluetooth node tree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please suggest me what may be the reason?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you verify if the device is listed under&nbsp;<strong>Other Devices</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot find the&nbsp;Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator&nbsp;driver listed along with the other Bluetooth drivers then it may be listed under
<strong>Other devices</strong>. Check for drivers named as <strong>Unknown device</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. <span>Open Device Manager by clicking the <strong><span>Start</span> button</strong>, clicking
<span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span>, clicking <span><strong>System and Security</strong></span>, and then, under
<strong><span>System</span>,</strong> clicking <strong><span>Device Manager</span>.</strong></span><strong>‌</strong><span>&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
</span></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Expand <strong>Other Devices </strong>and look for your driver it may even be listed as
<strong>Unknown devices</strong>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Right-click</strong> on it and select <strong>Update Driver Software</strong>.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi!<br />
<br />
I wanted to update you guys that I've found a solution for the scrolling problem.<br />
<br />
All I had to do is download an update from Lenovo website. They have a lot of updates for windows 10 users.<br />
<br />
<strong>If you're not Lenovo users</strong> you can still find an updates on your specific manufacturer website. The update I downloaded is "mouse and touchpad update"<br />
<br />
That's the main solution which helped me, but there's another one<br />
<br />
<br />
Right click on your mouse icon in the taskbar --&gt; properties --&gt; settings --&gt; multifinger --&gt; two fingers --&gt; mark all the boxes (if they're already marked --&gt; uncheck all of them --&gt; now mark them again)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it would help some of you guys.</p>

<p><span>Hi jackthebear63,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·</span></span><span>Why are you trying to uninstall Sonic MY
 DVD?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·</span></span><span>What is the error message you are receiving
 when trying to uninstall?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·</span></span><span>What do you mean when you mention “Windows
 installer keeps trying to install”?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·</span></span><span>What is the service pack installed on the
 computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This might be a issue if you have sonic application installed on the computer. Try uninstalling the program from the computer
 and check the results. You may refer the below link: How to change or remove a program in Windows XP:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307895</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note that, if you want to install the program back you need to have the CD of the application.</span></p>

            Hello jackthebear63,<br />
<br />
You can check in the registry to see if there is a pending installation for Sonic MyDVD.
<br />
<br />
Go to Start button. In the Start search box, type in Regedit. <br />
This will bring up the registry editor. <br />
<p><span>Clean any pending installations:<br />
</span><span>Check the following registry key and clean any entries in the key that you find:</span><span><br />
<br />
If you get the User Account Control dialog box that states, Do you want to<br />
allow the following program to make changes to the is computer?, Click yes. </span>

            Hey Gatman.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />If you wait a few days the Spring Creators Update will be released so you can have the latest version:  <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi GATMAN_999, I am Rob, an independent and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as independents we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. If you will work with me I will be here to help until the issue is resolved.
<br /> 
<br />1. Change your computer's WiFi channel to see if that helps the Bluetooth.
<br />If on 1 try 11 or others channels.
<br />
<br />2. Do you have Airplane Mode enabled? Check this complete article - check all the settings even if you don't have Airplane Mode enabled.
<br />
<br />3. How to Enable Bluetooth in Airplane Mode on Windows 10 
<br /><a href="https://www.howto-connect.com/enable-bluetooth-in-airplane-mode-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howto-connect.com/enable-bluetooth-...</a>
<br />
<br />4. Do you have any 3rd party antivirus or have you had one on that computer?
<br />
<br />5. Have you run SFC and DISM?
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />How to Run SFC Command to Repair System Files in Windows 10 &lt; -- see Option 5
<br /><a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2895-sfc-command-run-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2895-sfc-com...</a> 
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - continue regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - continue regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance. Feedback definitely helps us help all.

<h2>            After upgrading to 1703 Creators Update, PTC Creo 3.0 users getting Blue Screen</h2>
                    <p>I'm coming across users of PTC Creo 3.0 having issues after upgrading to Windows Creators Update (1703). These users are getting
</p>
<p><span>Stop code :"UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP" error blue screen resulting in system exit. This issue is noticed when starting Creo 3.0 or trying to open a file in Creo.</span></p>
<p><span>I think PTC has reported this issue to Microsoft. Can anyone in Microsoft tell when the issue can be resolved or a patch is going to be released? For the time being it seems rolling back from Creators Update or in some cases updating
 Graphics driver resolves the issue. </span></p>

<h3> terry everett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dynamic RSS Feed &#34;Download error - Blocked file type&#34;</h2>
                    I have had to reinstall Windows 7 64bit Home Premium. Dynamic themes now refuse to work.
<br />
<br />
All of them! When I click on the RSS feed in Internet Explorer Favorites, every file (they all seem to be .jpg) is marked "(Download error - Blocked file type)".
<br />
<br />
I have tried the following: <br />
<br />
disabled my anti-virus (a branded version of F-Secure supplied by my ISP) <br />
disabled Windows Firewall disabled my anti-spyware application (SuperAntiSpyware Pro)
<br />
removed AVG Secure Search (and what a pain in the **** that was - I don't even know how it became installed in the first place!)
<br />
deleted all the Theme RSS feeds in Favorites and deleted all the dynamic themes in the Personalization cpl applet
<br />
applied the Bing Dynamic Feed registry patch <br />
tried using Internet Explorer (my default browser is Firefox 23.0.1)<br />
verified the existence of the download directories: C:\Users\Terry\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Enclosure\{A2E61EAB-6895-4C39-822A-880A24A5DF98} (for example)<br />
followed the steps in http://windows.microsoft.com/en-PH/windows/rss-theme-faq <br />
searched the registry for the string "Download error - Blocked file type" and portions thereof (no hits)<br />
scoured the list of running processes for anything I didn't recognize (which is how I found some residual bits of AVG Secure Search)
<br />
stared blankly at the monitor hoping for inspiration <br />
<br />
All to no avail. <br />
<br />
Prior to the reinstallation (clean install, repartitioned and reformatted the drive) dynamic themes worked as advertized with the same security software (accept for the wretched AVG crud) installed and enabled. My ISP gives me ≈ 3.5MB/s down and ≈1.5MB/s up
 (and I mean MB, not Mb). <br />
<br />
I give up. It isn't that I haven't tried, it's that I'm out of ideas. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance <br />
<br />
Terry<br />

            Thank you for the prompt response.<br />
<br />
No, I do not have CCleaner installed (I don't even know what it is - but I'll rectify that later). I didn't know the AVG stuff was installed either, so I went to the Programs and Features cpl applet to make sure.<br />
<br />
I performed a reset of Internet Explorer using the downloadable MicrosoftFixit50195 tool.&nbsp; I selected all the options and reset everything to out-of-the-box.&nbsp; I chose the default security settings hen I restarted it following the re-boot.<br />
<br />
I even made Internet Explorer my default browser.&nbsp; So far, nothing has helped.<br />
<br />
It is interesting (as in the Chinese curse: "May you live in interesting times") that if I double-click on any of the files listed in the RSS feed (and marked (Download error - Blocked file type), Internet Explorer immediately downloads and displays it, which
 leads me to believe that whatever this is, it is specific to RSS feeds.<br />
<br />
What's next, Coach?<br />

            We seem to be getting closer.<br />
<br />
Immediately after setting up a new Administrator account I opened the Personalization cpl applet and chose "Get more themes online".<br />
<br />
I selected a dynamic them "Fauna" I think, chose "Run" and "Download content".&nbsp; I opened Favorites in IE, selected Feeds and clicked on the RSS link.&nbsp; This time the files were all marked "(Pending)" and considering the black desktop background, that seemed
 reasonable.&nbsp; Within a few seconds a file downloaded and appeared on my desktop.&nbsp; I right-clicked on the desktop and selected "Next desktop background" and got a different image.<br />
<br />
I logged out, logged in again with my old account and followed the steps in <span>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile
</font></a><br />
<br />
I logged out and logged in again with the new account and the original problem was back.&nbsp;&nbsp; I seem to have transferred the cause of the problem when I copied the User\Terry directory tree.<br />
<br />
None of my data files are stored on the system drive.&nbsp; The Libraries all point to directory trees on other disks.&nbsp; I use a non-Microsoft browser and e-Mail client.&nbsp; My mail is stored in \appdata\Roaming and is backed-up every night (I was burned badly once),
 so could I set up another "clean" Administrator account and transfer only the appdata tree?<br />

            The Program Install and Uninstall Troubleshooter requires the user to enter the 28-character hexadecimal identity code of the program to be checked if it's not listed. AVG Secure Search is not listed, and I have no idea what the ID code is or was, because
 I manually removed all residual registry values containing the string "AVG" after finding that the Programs and Features cpl applet had not removed all of the software.&nbsp; (I also ran several versions of AVG-supplied uninstall routines before the manual removal.&nbsp;
 I'm confident it's all gone.)<br />
<br />
I ran Microsoft Safety Scanner and it found nothing.&nbsp; I have subsequently run a complete scan on all drives with my own anti-virus (F-Secure) and anti-spyware (SuperAntiSpyware). F-Secure found nothing, SAS found only a few tracking cookies.<br />
<br />
Let me repeat my earlier question:<br />

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Some scanners have the option to convert image to text, check your scanner manual for exact steps. You can also use your favorite search engine to look for a tool to convert.</div>

<p>
</p><p>I have recently noticed that my shutdown, restart and sleep buttons have disappeared from my start menu, and has been replaced by an empty grey box (as show in the picture). I have also tried to shut down my computer using the Ctrl+alt+delete buttons but
 this also doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this problem?</p>

            This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We understand that, you face issue with Windows 10 activation and I'd certainly help you.</div>
<div><br />
You might see this error if no valid Windows license was found for your device when upgrading to Windows 10 or if you performed a clean installation of Windows 10, which requires a new license to activate your copy of Windows.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please refer to the section “Windows is not activated as your previous version of Windows on this device was not activated prior to upgrade to Windows 10. (Error code: 0x803F7001)” in the Microsoft article below and check, if it helps.</div>

            Hi <strong>Annbrewer</strong>,
<p>1. What is the file type of the picture files that you are trying to copy?</p>
<p>As mentioned the error is “The file name, directory name or volume label syntax is incorrect” and there is more than one reason that can bring up this error message such as;</p>
<p>a. There might be a file inside the documents folder that needs to be renamed.&nbsp;<br />
b. This issue may also come up if the external hard drive is formatted in FAT32.</p>
<p>I suggest you to convert the flash drive partition to NTFS and check if the issue gets fixed.</p>
<p><strong>Refer:</strong></p>
