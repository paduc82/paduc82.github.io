<h2>            Call of Duty Black Ops</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I was playing my 360. I was playing Call of Duty Black Ops on Multiplayer mode. Was finished with a round when my Xbox wouldnt let me play the game anymore. This is what happens.</p>
<p>1. I choose Mulitplayer</p>
<p>2. I choose Core</p>
<p>3. I choose Team Deathmatch</p>
<p>4. It gathers the players and splits us up into teams</p>
<p>5. It changes to the load in screen where it shows you what map you are about to play, you get the call of duty tips on the bottom with the circular loading icon.</p>
<p>6. continues to show the circular load icon spinning and never actually goes into the match.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And advice or help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Jason</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail calendar not sending reminders by email</h2>
                    I've configured Live Mail to send calendar reminders by email, but I'm not receiving them.&nbsp; I am receiving a pop-up message through the "Mail" app (Windows 8), but nothing in my Live Mail inbox.<br />

            I'm suddenly having the same problem. &nbsp;That was working fine before. &nbsp;There is no "<a href="http://calendar.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://calendar.live.com/</a>" it merely opens Outlook, which I do not use. &nbsp;I use Windows Live Essentials.
 I add an event with a reminder and nothing is sent to my email like before. &nbsp;There is no option for "turn notifications on or off" in Windows Live. &nbsp;Outlook has this option, but on my Outlook version the box IS checked. &nbsp;So why am I not getting email calendar
 reminders? &nbsp;I seem to be able to get a reminder from Outlook on a test, but not Live Mail. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Please advise.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for participating here. As I understand, you are not receiving a reminder only in Windows Live Mail. If so, let's try if the issue was caused by misconfiguration. Try to reconfigure your account by following the steps
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>here</strong></a> on how to remove and re-add the account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update us any results.</p>

            The line you gave is not to "live mail" but to Outlook mail on the web. &nbsp;I don't use Outlook mail. &nbsp;I sue Windows Live Mail. . Live Essentials. &nbsp;This notification use to work, now it's not. &nbsp;I thought it was because I created other calendars, but I use
 on one calendar and it's the "primary calendar."
<div><br />
<div>I'm not ready to remove and re-add the account. &nbsp;That sounds scary, and I have many emails archived that I need. &nbsp;I have removed and reloaded Live Essentials.</div>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and we apologize for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear that you're having issues receiving the calendar notification on Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just like what Richard mentioned, you would need to reconfigure your account on Windows Live Mail, it is because that sometimes misconfiguration causes Live Mail to malfunction.</p>

            <p>Well a new problem has occurred. &nbsp;My Windows Live Mail on my Windows 7 desktop wouldn't update. &nbsp;Said something about a sent mail being stuck. &nbsp;I was advised by MSN to remove and reload the account. &nbsp;I did, but it just sits there saying "wait for account
 to load" and this has been hours, even days, and no progress. &nbsp;I believe now I will uninstall Windows Live Essentials and re-install it as a fix. &nbsp;Sound OK?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note it was suggested Windows Live Mail doesn't operate on Win7. &nbsp;Not true, I've been using it for nearly 2 years now. &nbsp;My Windows Live Mail is working perfectly on Vista. &nbsp;So what is Windows Live Essentials, i.e., Mail, supposed to serve? &nbsp;I refuse
 to use Outlook, it's just a shell of a email client with little functionality. &nbsp;</p>

            The answers have not been satisfactory. &nbsp;My error indicates it cannot connect becuase of Firewall issues. &nbsp;That is incorrect as regular e-mail comes into the client and all other internet traffic is allowed. &nbsp; Firewall is not blocking any Window apps.
 &nbsp;Was working 2 days ago and stopped. &nbsp;

    <title>Windows Media Center failing to record on time if at all - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abuse.this2z  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Center failing to record on time if at all</h2>
                    Recently, Media Center has gotten into the habit of starting recordings late, sometimes about 5 min or so, other times 15 min to a half hour. This evening I had an hour long show scheduled to record and it didn't start recording until 10 min before the
 end of the show. At least one tuner was free - I am using a Silicon Dust HDHomeRunPrime with 3 tuners. Sometimes it doesn't record at all. Media Center is configured to start recording 3 min before scheduled start and end 3 min afterwards. Prior to a week
 or two ago, this issue did not exist. And yes, I verified the system clock is correct and updated the time anyway from public.ntp.org<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any information as to how to fix this?<br />
Alternatively, how can I back up my scheduled recordings so that I can reinstall Media Center to try and fix and then not have to try to remember all the things I want to record? FWIW, And how do I then completely reset WMC? (I tried running mcupdate.exe, but
 the program would not launch. No error message displayed, just zero response and it didn't show in the process list in task manager.)<br />
<br />
Thank you,
                </div>

            Here is an event log for one of the incidents which started recording late. The program started at 1 AM. With the settings I have, it should have started recording at 12:57, but it didn't start recording until 1:05. No reason for the delayed start is given.
 There is nothing helpful on the details tab.<br />
<br />
Program Name started recording on 5/4/2013 1:05:06 AM and stopped on 5/4/2013 2:04:00 AM as scheduled.<br />
<br />
Here are the log entrys I get when it doesn't record at all. Note, despite what the message says, the computer was on and awake and there were no power issues. I was using it at the time. The machine is on a UPS and it has a 650 watt, Bronze rated power supply
 made by Corsair which is only a few months old.<br />
<br />
Program Name was not recorded due to a temporary failure caused by either a system malfunction or a power loss.<br />
<br />
Another non-recorded entry log is:<br />
Program Name was not recorded. There was no TV signal when the show was scheduled to record.<br />
<br />
However, there was at least 1 tuner available on the&nbsp; HDHomeRunPrime unit.<br />
<br />
These are three entries in a row for the same show:<br />
Program Name began as scheduled on 5/3/2013 11:04:05 PM while the program was already in progress.<br />
Program Name the computer lost power or experienced a temporary failure.&nbsp; (11:35:36)<br />
Program Name was not recorded because the tuner was in use by another component at the time of the recording. (11:44:56, again at 11:44:58, and at 11:45:01)<br />
<br />
There were no other programs recording or scheduled to record at this time so all three tuners were available.<br />

            <p>I too have suffered from the problems of partial recordings or no recordings at all, which seemed to have no obvious solution.&nbsp; As Windows Media Center was preinstalled I had no way of re-installing it properly after uninstalling it.</p>
<p>(I tried to uninstall and had to do a complete recovery of my C: drive to get it back!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, before trying any of the above complex solutions, I would strongly urge you to try the simplest fix first...
<a href="http://www.thegreenbutton.tv/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=6075" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thegreenbutton.tv/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=6075</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that the problem started when I was faced with a completely unresponsive machine,&nbsp;showing just&nbsp;a blank screen.&nbsp; I 'hard-booted' and all appeared OK, but then I found that WMC scheduling wouldn't work properly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This was most likely because I had bounced the box while WMC had the "StartRecording" file in "C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\Media Center" open, thus corrupting it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Deleting this file (with WMC closed) seems to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this seems too good to be true, especially if, like me,&nbsp;you've been trying to find a fix for several days, but hey, what've you got to lose?</p>

<br />
<br />Ok, you can use that key to install Windows 10 Home.
<br />
<br />I can send you the links to download Windows 10 and how to create a USB stick to reinstall your system.
<br />
<br />I just need to know if you need the American English version or the International English version.
<br />
<br />You will need a USB stick with 8GB or bigger.
<br />
<br />Regards
<br />
<br />Angelo

<p>Did you install Windows 10 recently or upgrade to Windows 10 during the free period from Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had Windows 7 Home Premium and upgraded during the free period (2015 to 2016) and Windows 10 Home was activated, and you haven't changed hardware then Windows 10 Home should activated with a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you never had Windows 10 Home activated on the device then you need to clean install Windows 7 that came with the device and you will need the Windows 7 licence key. If you have a Windows 7 disc then the licence key should be with the disc or attached
 to the device on a COA label.</p>

<p>Did you have Windows 7 Home Premium or Windows 7 Pro. To upgrade for free to Windows 10 Pro you would need Windows 7 Pro. If you used the upgrade path prompted by Windows 7 during the free period and Windows 10 auto activated then you will have a Windows
 10 licence for the device.</p>
<p>Or did you just install Windows 10 Pro and then crack it.</p>
<p>If Windows 10 (either Home or Pro) was never activated legally then you will need to buy a Windows 10 licence for the edition you want to use.</p>
<p>If you want to return to Windows 7 then you need your licence key as I mentioned earlier. (clean install only)</p>

                    <p>I have what may be an unusual problem.&nbsp; I upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 and was prompted to and did open up a Windows Account to log in.&nbsp; This worked fine for a day or so but my computer processed a further&nbsp;update and then rebooted.&nbsp; Since then&nbsp;I&nbsp;have
 not able to log into my computer as I do not have any of the Windows Account password or any of the account security information other than the email address.&nbsp; All of the security information for my Windows account - date of birth and answers to security questions
 is stored on the computer in a Keypass file&nbsp;which was not backed up to an external hard disk at the time the system must have rebooted.&nbsp; I use discrete information for each online account I sign up for as security&nbsp; - that way if the account is hacked then
 the information is of no use to the hacker as it won't work for any other account.&nbsp; I had an online chat with a Microsoft support team member who suggested that I needed to pose the question on this forum.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please can you advise how I can access my computer.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>I have what may be an unusual problem.&nbsp; I upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 and was prompted to and did open up a Windows Account to log in.&nbsp; This worked fine for a day or so but my computer processed a further&nbsp;update and then rebooted.&nbsp; Since then&nbsp;I&nbsp;have
 not able to log into my computer as I do not have any of the Windows Account password or any of the account security information other than the email address.&nbsp; All of the security information for my Windows account - date of birth and answers to security questions
 is stored on the computer in a Keypass file&nbsp;which was not backed up to an external hard disk at the time the system must have rebooted.&nbsp; I use discrete information for each online account I sign up for as security&nbsp; - that way if the account is hacked then
 the information is of no use to the hacker as it won't work for any other account.&nbsp; I had an online chat with a Microsoft support team member who suggested that I needed to pose the question on this forum.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please can you advise how I can access my computer.</p>

<p>Many thanks.</p>

8.1 is still a mess. I am now required to use the Microsoft account password to log into my own computers. I would guess that this should be my option. I can decide how much security I want etc, and not Microsoft.&nbsp; To make matters worse, today Windows would
 not accept my password and asked me to re-set it. After many attempts due to the garbled characters, I was able to reset my password. It gave me an option to save my password should I ever be locked out of my computer by making a password&nbsp; backup disk, either
 a floppy (which I don't have such a drive) or a flash drive, which I do. Directions from Windows is to go Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;User Accounts Family Safety&gt;User Accounts. The next instruction is to use the left pane to CREATE a PASSWORD RESET disk, the problem
 is that there is no such Option. One would think Microsoft would check their &nbsp;work before posting, but then&nbsp; again I am sorta getting used to such inconsistancies.</p>

<div>I am in a very similar situation--unable to use my laptop because I am locked out-- and everything I have tried to do to fix my problem has led me in circles. I have begged for help and no one will answer my questions. This is so obnoxious!!!!!&nbsp;<br />

Does ANYBODY who works with/for you people know how to fix this? Anybody? Because I am starting to think you guys are as lost as I am.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have this problem now for 5 days, since the installation of Windows 8.1 I am unable to logon.&nbsp; I have never thought that I will have to provide a password after the installation of the upgrade. And I did not realise that you can upgrade without adding
 a MS account. So I have created a dummy MS account, with dummy name, phone, pw, alternative address. I have never entered the account, I dont remember the password and I cannot reset it.</p>
<p>Is anyone able to help? MS support is obviously not willing to support for this problem, which I find quite scandalous. I have lost hours and hours trying to find a solution on the internet and MS to logon back to my computer, without any luck.
</p>
<p>thanks Claude</p>

<h2>            New Skype Version Terrible</h2>
                    The new Skype is terrible.&nbsp; Not being able to have separate chat windows, limited setting options, and I find it much slower to send messages.&nbsp; This version is NOT user friendly and I find it very frustrating to use and am truly disappointed. Please bring
 back the old version.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Couldn't agree more. I just restarted my computer and upon restart Skype updated itself to the "new and improved" version that's just as awful as my Android Skype (which I hardly use anymore because of how awful it is). Once it started up, I seriously
 started looking for a Skype alternative. THANK GOD I found this article which allows me to download the OLD Skype. Once you force me into the new Skype, I will no longer use Skype and cancel all my Skype paid services! It's awful! Just scrap New Skype and
 start over! Truly awful!

<p>Hi there Julie, thanks for providing a download of the old version of Skype.</p>
<p>However may I just help you by telling you all that is wrong with the new version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, let's start with the customizability, the old version had an indepth options menu, the new one hasn't even scratched the surface of user friendly, it's hard to find the extended options menu, as it is put under profile. However still the extended options
 menu is so limited that most of the things in my config file for skype means nothing. There are no hotkeys, nor any sound variables, nor a lot of other things, from what I remember from v.7.40.xx the old version was that it had 6 options menues and most of
 them had advanced configs, you could for instance change sounds and so on, sure, it wasn't as streamlined as the new skype is, which is the only downside, after all it still looked like an old win95 program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm happy as long as the advanced options menu comes back, hopefully somewhat improved, and more general customizability would be great, after all, the old skype is lacking a lot, I like after all the more streamlined version that you pushed out, even if
 it's hardly a finished product, but I know you needed to do it, to get feedback, after all, you wanted people to test the new version, and so I would like to thank you for your hospitality by giving a link to the old version. I'll check back in a few months
 time to see how far the new version has progressed, and hopefully you've been able to push some more end user customization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things that I really liked about the new version was the theme, dark theme is a lot less straining on the eyes, and is a welcome improvement.</p>
<p>The removal of dropdown bars, after all, it's not win95... however I still wish that all the things that were in the dropdown menues were implemented into the new one, however in a more streamlined format, dropdowns are after all a bit clunky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my honest opinion, I believe the newer version to become a lot better than 7.40.xx but seeing as how long implementations and bugtracking and so on takes, I don't believe that you'd be done before 2019, but I wish you all the best of luck.</p>

<p>I think we have to face the fact that when MS "IMPROVE" something what they are doing is either fixing an error of theirs or changing a feature for their own benefit. Skype is a perfect example of a program that for years has not only worked well but provided
 the USERS with what they wanted. MS will only ever provide what suits them and not the user. We all found that showing local time against a contact was useful and necessary - MS removed it! This proves my case.</p>
<p>Worse they lie and tell you there is a problem with your login credentials when what they really mean is that we are preventing you from using this very useful older version. Why not simply be honest? Anyway I'll now be looking for an alternative.</p>

<p>I agree with Cheryl. The new version lacks the user-control of the earlier versions, and it goes along with the Microsoft trend of dumbing-down apps so that computer illiterate people and computer wizards get the same experience - and the only means of escape
 is finding a forum like this where a link is posted to the old version. Thank the heavens for that link!</p>

            It would be impossible for me to say how disappointed I am with the 'new' Skype - it's truly awful!&nbsp; Nothing I do can do will get this thing to work.&nbsp; Compared to the old version it is virtually unusable.&nbsp; I doubt Microsoft will take any notice.&nbsp; It's
 very a case of we are big, you are small, take it or leave it.&nbsp; Does this mean I have to write off Skype forever.&nbsp; Is there any way of retrieving my money?&nbsp; Or even the old version of Skye?

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes it is terrible, and much worse than you describe.&nbsp; Much harder to use our contact lists, look up people on it, edit their profiles, and many other things.&nbsp; This is not because skype designers are stupid, it is intentional.&nbsp; And apparently skype
 has no support so we're stuck with it.&nbsp; I have an extensive contact list and need to be able to use it and add to it like in previous versions.&nbsp; The new one can be uninstalled and replaced but it's set up to reinstall the bad version whether you want it or
 not.&nbsp; Has anyone found a good alternative to skype where we don't lose the contact list that may have taken years to build up?<br />

<p>Spent over an hour on chat to no avail. Eventually after the agent had been away for 5 minutes, they came back to tell me that "This is a known bug with GFWL and they are fixing it." When I asked for a link to track the bug I was given a bogus phone number
 to call and a link to a random support page. So "bump" I guess.</p>

<p>Hey there Komus,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you've had a frustrating experience with chat support. <br />
<br />
It looks like the number they gave you was for a particular region which may be why it didn't work for you. You can use this list of our
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/12/p/184869/964344.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
International Phone Support Numbers</a> to find the right one for you. That error code is very particular towards account weirdness and not something we can provide support for over the forums so contacting Phone Support for follow up would definitely be the
 way to go.<br />
<br />
Do you mind posting the link that they gave you so that we can double check that?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Sharon, </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the model number of Sony Vaio laptop? </p>
<p>2. Do you have Zone Alarm software installed on the computer? </p>
<p>3. Which tool have you tried to run to check the driver errors? </p>
<p>4. Are you aware of making any changes to the computer prior to the issue? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The most common resolution is to update the drivers that are associated with the failing device. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In the device's Properties dialog box, click the
<strong>Driver</strong> tab. </p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click <strong>Update Driver</strong> to start the
<strong>Hardware Update Wizard</strong>. </p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Follow the instructions to update the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You may be prompted to provide the path of the driver. Windows may have the driver built-in, or the driver files may still be installed from the last time that you set up the device. If you are asked for the driver and you do not have
 it, you can try to download the latest driver from the Manufacturer website. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above step does not help, I would suggest you to update drivers for your Network Adapter as to support Teredo tunneling protocol in Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Reply with the status so that we could help you further.

<h2>            My Xbox One is not connecting to the Internet. Or so it says it is.</h2>
                    <p>For the past week, my xbox has been not connecting to the Internet. It keeps saying "check your connection and try again". Every time I try diconnecting my xbox, or turning the Internet off for 30 seconds, nothing happens and it just stays the same. Also, if I test my network connection it says I'm connected but if I test my multiplayer connection, it says it can't be completed. What do I do?</p><p><br /></p>

<p>new machine about 30 days old no other malware detection running also no software added yet to machine</p>
<p>checking basics of machine and ran windows update to make sure it is up to date, same windows update keeps failing, it is update KB 2871389, it fails with one of 3 error codes 8007371b, 80246007, or 8007371b. It asks if you want more details I select that
 option and then suggests running update troubleshooter. That always seems to find things to fix. Then I try it again only to fail again. Also downloaded the file and run it then still fails. running the trouble shooter seems to clear out the update history
 each time. But the codes are the three I have seen. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have thought about hiding the update but have heard about the improvements in 8.1 and I agree with you this looks like this kb2871389 is needed in order to go to 8.1 which I am anxious to go to<br />

            <p>Fact: Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious</em> for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I uninstalled the Norton product but did not run the removal tool. I just downloaded it and ran it. Rebooted the machine but it did not help. I guess my choice is to hide the update. This is not my computer I am trying to help someone out. They wanted me
 to check it and make sure all looked ok. Also they wanted to get rid of Norton and install Microsoft Defender. While I had it I was running updates also updated drivers for various components on the computer.

            <p>Chances are the Norton "leftovers" are causing your problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Assuming Win8 64-bit =&gt; </em>Roll up your sleeves, cross your fingers &amp; try the following multi-step fix I've cooked up just for your friend's&nbsp;computer...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACTIONS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[You will want to print these instructions for offline reference. IMPORTANT =&gt; DON'T SKIP ANY STEP &amp; perform all Steps in one, uninterrupted session! If a Step says to reboot,<em>reboot!</em>]
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:
<font color="#0072c6">ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/removal_tools/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Right-click on the file you saved in #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Download/run the appropriate scripts from the following Trusted Source (my colleague IE MVP Kai Schätzl):
<a href="http://iefaq.info/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=42&amp;id=133&amp;artlang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://iefaq.info/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=42&amp;id=133&amp;artlang=en</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note =&gt; The scripts are good for IE11 (and IE10), too!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tip: The file named <strong>ie8-rereg.all.zip</strong> contains both of the scripts below (plus a third that you will NOT use).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5a. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then double-click on the file named
<strong>ie8-rereg.32on64.cmd</strong> to run the script.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5b. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then double-click on the file named
<strong>ie8-rereg.64on64.cmd</strong> to run that script <em>then reboot.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Reset Internet Explorer manually (do NOT use the Fix It!) per the "Let me reset Internet Explorer settings myself" section on this page:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note =&gt; For optimal results, check the <strong>Delete personal settings </strong>
option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Run the Windows Update troubleshooter from start to finish per the instructions on this page =&gt;
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates</font></a> [1]</p>

<h2>            Cannot install Adobe Air 3.4</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I currently have <strong>Adobe Air 2.7.1</strong> and would like to install <strong>
version 3.4.</strong> </p>
<p>My specs: WIN 7, IE9, Adm., single&nbsp;home computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Message: After download, upon clicking install, message reads "sorry, unable to install&nbsp;...try again."
</p>
<p>Administrator authorization allowed; download/upload fine; Program Files reads new date, but same old version.</p>
<p>* This has happened before so I was never able to upgrade and I just let it go. Time to update! *</p>
<p><strong>Adobe support was unable to assist</strong>.</p>
<p>Cannot uninstall previous version.</p>
<p>I need your collective genius.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Andre</p>

And as a thought. Have you tried right-clicking the adobe air install file and 'run as administrator'?<br />

            <p>Hello again,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the CMD - it analyzed for over 30 minutes and found some corrupt files and repaired them. &nbsp;This is the file location:
</p>
<p>C:/Windows/Logs/CBS/CBS.log (windir)</p>
<p>As for right-clicking for "run as ADM", I am always prompted if I wish to run as administrator. I have no choice but to say yes. However, I went to my zipped downloaded folders and tried right-clicking on the .exe installer. No luck.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a tough one. I did uninstall that other program and then used system restore to go back earlier in the day to re-install Air, the old outdated version.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Andre&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi brisdaz,</p>
<p>The playlist file is <span>
requesting a web path that isn’t valid. Hence you need to contact the company that provided it for better assistance on this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>You may use Software Development Kit (SDK) only if you are creating a playlist file.</span></p>

Is that the correct format? I believe it works with VLC media player.

            It doesn't look like WMP supports M3U playlists that contain URLs to Internet streams. A possible workaround would be to copy an URL from the playlist file, and open that URL in WMP directly.

            Win10 Store apps  / Metro / Modern / UWA / UWP
<br />In Windows 8.1, Microsoft introduced Universal Windows Apps (UWA), colloquially known as “Metro apps” or “Modern apps.” In Windows 10, Microsoft took the idea even further and ended up with the Universal Windows Platform (UWP).
<br />
<br />Based on my own experience, and the reports of many others it appears that the store and it’s associated “environment” is rather fragile, causing various problems with the store itself and store applications. 
<br />
<br />HOW TO FIX WIN10 STORE APP / METRO / UNIVERSAL APPLICATIONS – WINDOWS STORE RESET

<br />2016 07 19- 5 TIPS TO FIX WINDOWS STORE AND APP ISSUES IN WINDOWS 10
<br /><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-tips-fix-windows-store-app-issues-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-tips-fix-window...</a> 
<br />
<br />Restart the computer
<br />Win Store Trouble Shooter
<br />Clear store Cache (WSReset.exe)
<br />Reset Windows update (use the tool in the following link)
<br />Reg hack for Connection errors
<br />Re-Register the Store
<br />
<br />Here are some additional instructions for the 5 tips defined in the article above 
<br />
<br />Remember to test the problem applet between each of the steps.
<br />
<br />#0 RESTART THE COMPUTER
<br />Simply restarting the computer is one of the simplest trouble fixes we have. But it is all too often forgotten or skipped.  Too often programs get “confused”. While restarting the program may clear the confusion, sometimes they have an unseen compenent constantly running in the background.  The easiest way to reset them is to restart the computer. 
<br />
<br />#1 MS DOWNLOADABLE WIN10 STORE APP TROUBLE SHOOTER
<br /><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_apps10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_apps10</a>

<br />
<br />Note: both of these links above should take you to download the same diagnosis “CAB” file. 
<br />
<br />Use the built in Trouble shooter
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot 
<br />Scroll down to the bottom 
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />#2 WSRESET.EXE – CLEAR AND RESET STORE CACHE
<br /><a href="http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-clear-reset-windows-store-cache-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-clear-reset-w...</a> 
<br />
<br />Run as Admin.
<br />
<br />Be sure to run the WSReset (Windows Store Reset) program AT LEAST 5 times. It appears to fix one problem per run, SLOWLY working thorough multiple problems in subsequent runs. Unfortunately the tool is poorly written so it gives the user no indication of what it is doing or if it was successful or not. All you can do is run it several times in the hope that you run it often enough for it to clear all of the problems.
<br />
<br />#3 MANUAL RESET WINDOWS UPDATE SUBSYSTEM
<br />the problems remain, you have to revert to a manual process to reset Windows Update
<br />Check that System Restore is turned on and configured 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2955023/windows/how-to-turn-on-system-restore-in-windows-10-to-protect-against-bad-updates.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2955023/windows...</a>

<br />
<br />Create a System restore point. (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402753...</a> )
<br />
<br />Use the following process to effectively delete the folders used by Windows Update:
<br />
<br />Follow the instructions in this page: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058...</a> - How do I reset Windows Update components? (Win7-Win10)
<br />
<br />The first paragraph in the above process includes a link to the Windows update troubleshooter. Make sure to run through it also.

<br />This is a Video of manual process very similar process to the one described in the link to KB971058 (above)
<br />
<br />
<br />After doing the process in the above link, including restarting the computer Check for outstanding updates:
<br />. – in start menu search for Windows Update
<br />. - click on “Check for Updates”
<br />. – updates are often sequention, they require an earlier one to be present before being installed. So you should repeat checking for updates until you get no more updates

<br />
<br />RE-INSTALL ALL STORE APPS USING POWERSHELL
<br />
<br />…*  In the Start Menu, search for PowerShell 
<br />…*  right click and select "Run as Administrator" option.
<br />…*  Enter the following commands one by one in the PowerShell window:
<br />
<br />………  reg delete “HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\TileDataModel\Migration\TileStore” /va /f
<br />
<br />………  get-appxpackage -packageType bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + "\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml")}
<br />
<br />………  $bundlefamilies = (get-appxpackage -packagetype Bundle).packagefamilyname
<br />
<br />………  get-appxpackage -packagetype main |? {-not ($bundlefamilies -contains $_.packagefamilyname)} |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + "\appxmanifest.xml")}
<br />
<br />RESET ALL STORE APPS / REREGISTER / APPS MISSING FROM WIN START MENU
<br />Re-register all store apps, so they appear again in start menu.  For that, open a PowerShell window as Administrator. Copy and paste the following line into the PowerShell window and press Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose } 
<br />
<br />Note:	if you re-register all applications, all your apps are back, however all your pinned apps will be reset (the right panel will be empty) so you need to re-pin everything that you want. Personnaly I did a screen capture before, to remember what I pinned and where (use the “snipping tool” in startmenu/windows accessories, with a delay to be able to open the start menu before the capture)

            Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />Reinstall the Store:
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (Admin) 
<br />At the command prompt, type the following then hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.
<br />
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.

    <title>Search for filename parts on local storage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abrimaal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search for filename parts on local storage</h2>
                    <p>This is an example filename that is stored on the hard disk:</p>
<p>
</p><p>20161118-photo-of-something-20-edit-a.jpg</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to find all "edit-a" versions of .jpg files on a disk or in a folder.</p>
<p>Windows Vista was finding it immediately, Win 10 displays "no results"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I type in the search box any of these:</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit</p>
<p>edit-a</p>
<p>-edit-a</p>
<p>edit a</p>
<p>-edit</p>
<p>edit jpg</p>
<p>edit-a.jpg</p>
<p>
</p><p>nothing is found. I guess that "-" (minus) is interpreted as exclusion that's why the files are not found, but it does not find "edit a" without "-" too.
<br />
I cannot rename thousands of filenames from "-" to "_". Many files are parts of larger projects and the project files store the original filenames.</p>

<p>I believe like most online games your stats are stored/recorded on the servers so it won't matter what you delete from your console, once you go back online again your stats will remain the same as they were before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could be wrong though but this is usually how it works I believe.</p>

<p>Stats are indeed stored online, just like your gamertag when connected to LIVE which is how you can recover it again. If you go deleting game files from your HD it could lead to other complications. no one really looks at K/D stats unless they are looking
 to somehow boost their own ego with the belief that the numbers mean jack to the real world lol...like Gamerscore</p>
