            <p>Have&nbsp; your checked&nbsp; your&nbsp; mouse in other system?</p>
<p>here is the detail&nbsp; steps for solving problems</p>
Common Mouse Setup Issues
When I move the mouse, nothing happens. 
<p>Try the following: </p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The USB connection may be loose. Try unplugging the mouse and plugging it back in.
</li><li>Plug the mouse into a different USB port. </li><li>If your mouse is plugged into a USB hub or USB switch box, try removing it and plugging it directly into the computer.
</li><li>Unplug other USB devices that are not in use. </li><li>If you are using a wireless mouse: For tips about troubleshooting problems with the wireless connection, see
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-in/help/support/troubleshooting/mouse/wireless-bluetooth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshooting wireless and Bluetooth® issues</a>. </li><li>Try the mouse on another computer to verify it is not defective.
</li></ul>
I logged in as a guest during Setup and received an installation error. 
<p>During Setup, you may have to restart the computer one or more times. Logging on as a member of the Guests group during the Setup process may result in an installation error. Setup requires that you are logged on as a member of the Administrators group.
</p>
When I install IntelliPoint software, Setup will not continue until I remove a different mouse program.
<p>If you already have mouse software installed on your computer, you may not be able to install IntelliPoint until you remove the existing mouse software. Some computer manufacturers pre-install mouse software that is appropriate for the mouse that came with
 the computer. </p>
To remove the existing mouse software 
<div>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Start</b>, click <b>Control Panel</b> (make sure that you are in Classic View), and then double-click
<b>Add or Remove Programs</b>. </li><li>Under <b>Currently installed programs</b>, select the mouse software you want to remove, and then click
<b>Change</b> (or <b>Remove</b>, if available). </li><li>Follow the instructions on the screen for removing the existing mouse software. If you cannot locate the mouse software you want to remove, see the documentation that was included with your computer or contact the computer manufacturer.
</li></ol>
I want to enable/disable automatic software updates for IntelliPoint. 
To enable or disable automatic software updates from the Windows Start menu 
<div>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Start</b>, click <b>All Programs</b>, click <b>Microsoft Mouse</b>, and then click
<b>Quality Settings</b>. </li><li>Click <b>Yes</b> to enable automatic updates or click <b>
No</b> to disable automatic updates. </li></ol>
I installed a new version of IntelliPoint over an earlier version of IntelliPoint software and lost some customisation.
<p>If you are using a previous version of IntelliPoint software and you install a new version of IntelliPoint, you may lose some customisations, such as button reassignments. To fix this problem, you may have to update your mouse customisations after you install
 IntelliPoint. </p>
Some of the IntelliPoint software tabs are missing. 
<p>The IntelliPoint software tabs displayed depend on the mouse you used to open IntelliPoint. For example, if you have a wired mouse and a wireless mouse connected, the
<b>Wireless</b> tab is displayed only if you open IntelliPoint by using the wireless mouse.
</p>
<p>If an IntelliPoint software tab that is appropriate for your mouse is not displayed, close IntelliPoint and then reopen it using the mouse that you want to configure.
</p>
The Buttons tab displays a mouse model that differs from my mouse. 
<p>The mouse displayed on the <b>Buttons</b> tab determines the buttons that are listed. The number of buttons and how they are situated may vary depending on the mouse model.
</p>
<p>Typically, the mouse connected to the computer is detected and identified during IntelliPoint Setup. If you have more than one mouse connected to your computer, or if you change to a new Microsoft mouse, open the IntelliPoint software by using the Microsoft
 mouse you want to configure. This action will make sure that the correct mouse is displayed in the list under
<b>Connected devices</b>. The product name is listed on the bottom of your mouse.
</p>
Some IntelliPoint features do not work in my programs. 
<p>Some IntelliPoint software features may not work with some programs. The programs must be designed to use standard Windows functionality for all of the IntelliPoint features to work.
</p>
<p>Also, in Windows 7 and Windows Vista, if you open a program using the <b>Run as administrator</b> command, you may not be able to use some IntelliPoint software features.
</p>
Mouse usage 
I used to rotate objects in a CAD program by pressing the wheel button, but this no longer works.
<p>In earlier versions of IntelliPoint software, the wheel button was assigned to AutoScroll, which let you rotate objects in computer-aided drawing programs. In later versions, the wheel button is assigned to
<b>Flip 3D</b>. You can reassign button (or another button) to <b>AutoScroll</b> (or to
<b>Middle Click</b>) if you want to use it for this purpose now. </p>
After I reassign a mouse button, the SHIFT key stays on even though I am not pressing it.
<p>If you reassign a mouse button to a different command, you may experience SHIFT key activation when you press the reassigned button while pressing certain keys on the keyboard. This is the result of the hardware information that is sent by the keyboard interfering
 with the software codes sent by the customised mouse button. To fix this problem, press the SHIFT key to disable the SHIFT key activation, and then do not press a mouse button while pressing a key on the keyboard.
</p>
The pointer does not move smoothly on the screen. 
<p>The mouse may be dirty which can impair performance. Try cleaning the mouse. </p>
<p>If you are using a mouse that has an optical sensor, make sure that you are using it on a surface that does not impair performance. The sensor performs best on surfaces with detail to track. It will not function on surfaces without visible detail (such as
 glass) or surfaces on which it has a reflection (such as mirrors or glossy surfaces). The sensor may also have difficulty tracking on highly repetitive patterns (such as printed magazine or newspaper photographs).
</p>
Sometimes I cannot find the pointer on the screen (it seems to be hidden). 
<div>
<ul>
<li>If the pointer has moved to the far edge of the screen and is no longer visible, try moving the pointer in different directions until you can see the pointer on your screen.
</li><li>Some programs intentionally cause the pointer to disappear when you move it over a certain area. Try moving the pointer into a different area to see if the pointer will reappear.
</li></ul>
The mouse does not work correctly with my switch box. 
<p>IntelliPoint software is not supported on switch boxes. If you are using a switch box, some of the IntelliPoint features, such as scrolling and reassigning buttons, may not work.
</p>
<p>Try the following: </p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you install IntelliPoint software on each computer.
</li><li>Do not move the mouse when you switch between computers.
</li><li>If the wheel and wheel button stop working, restart the computer.
</li><li>If you experience other problems with the switch box, contact your switch-box supplier.
</li></ul>
Moving the magnetic charging cable near my portable computer triggers standby mode.
<p>Some portable computers use a magnetic field to detect if the lid is closed. If your mouse has a magnetic charging cable, moving this cable too close to your computer may cause your computer to go into standby mode. To avoid this problem, keep your magnetic
 charging cable away from the portable computer keyboard. </p>
My rechargeable mouse does not charge in hot conditions/direct sunlight. 
<p>If a rechargeable mouse becomes too hot while charging, the battery indicator light may still flash green, but may not charge. Refer to the Product Guide included with your device to determine normal operating temperatures.
</p>
Mouse buttons 
One or more of the buttons do not work when I press them. 
<p>The Microsoft mouse buttons have default assignments when you first use them. Some of these button commands may not work in the program that you are using. For example, the default button assignment for the right button is
<b>Right-click</b>, but some programs may not support this command. Try pressing the button while you are using programs that you are sure support the button's command. You can also reassign the button to a different command.
</p>
<p>The button may also be assigned to a command that you are not familiar with. You can find out the commands that are assigned to each button by using IntelliPoint software.
</p>
To determine the mouse button assignments 
<div>
<ol>
<li>Using the mouse that you want to configure, start IntelliPoint.
<br />
(Click <b>Start</b>, point to <b>All Programs</b>, click <b>Microsoft Mouse</b>, and then click
<b>Microsoft Mouse</b>.) </li><li>Move the pointer over the box for each button. IntelliPoint will highlight that button's location on the adjacent image.
</li><li>The command assigned to each button is listed under the button name.
</li></ol>
I am having difficulty double-clicking. 
<div>
<ul>
<li>Modify the double-click speed setting on the <b>Activities</b> tab in IntelliPoint software.
</li></ul>
Middle click does not work as expected in my application or game. 
<div>
<ul>
<li>Reassign the middle button to <b>Middle-Click</b>. </li></ul>
I reassigned a button, and it does not work as expected in my application or game.
<div>
<ul>
<li>Some games and programs, such as Windows Terminal Services and Remote Desktop, do not support customized button assignments.
</li><li>Customised button assignments do not work in Windows Safe Mode or when you open a program using the Run as administrator command.
</li><li>Try uninstalling and reinstalling IntelliPoint software.
</li></ul>
Mouse wheel 
When I rotate the wheel, nothing happens. 
<p>If the wheel does not work in any program that has a scrollable document open (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer), make sure that IntelliPoint wheel support is enabled:
</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Using the mouse that you want to configure, start IntelliPoint.<br />
(Click <b>Start</b>, point to <b>All Programs</b>, click <b>Microsoft Mouse</b>, and then click
<b>Microsoft Mouse</b>.) </li><li>On the IntelliPoint <b>Wheel</b> tab, make sure that the <b>
Enable vertical scrolling</b> check box is selected.<br />
<br />
If that does not resolve this problem, try reinstalling IntelliPoint, making sure to select the correct mouse during Setup.
</li></ol>
<p><b>Note </b></p>
<p>If scrolling works in some programs (such as Microsoft Word or Internet Explorer) but not in others, even though they have scroll bars, those other programs might not support the scroll wheel.
</p>
When I rotate the wheel, my window sometimes disappears. 
<p>You can use mouse wheel to scroll, and you can also use it as a button. Clicking the wheel switches to other open programs on your desktop. Sometimes while scrolling, you might accidentally press the wheel and unintentionally switch to another open program.
 This is why the active window seems to disappear, but it is actually still open on your desktop. If you want to return to the previous window, click the wheel until that window appears again, or use the Windows taskbar to switch to the window that you want.
</p>
<p>To resolve the problem, avoid pressing down on the wheel while scrolling. </p>
<p>You can also disable the wheel button, if you prefer to use the wheel only for scrolling.
</p>
To disable the wheel button 
<div>
<ol>
<li>Using the mouse that you want to configure, start IntelliPoint.
<br />
(Click <b>Start</b>, point to <b>All Programs</b>, click <b>Microsoft Mouse</b>, and then click
<b>Microsoft Mouse</b>.) </li><li>In the <b>Wheel</b> button list, click <b>Disabled</b>. </li></ol>
Magnifier 
I want to change the size of the Magnifier, but I do not know how. 
To adjust the size of the Magnifier 
<div>
<ol>
<li>Click the appropriate mouse button to display the Magnifier.
</li><li>Press and hold the same button, and then move your mouse to change the size of the Magnifier. Move the mouse down and to the right to increase the size of the window; up and to the left to decrease it.
</li></ol>
I am having trouble turning off Magnifier. 
<div>
<ul>
<li>Quickly click the button assigned to Magnifier once, without moving the mouse.
</li></ul>
Sometimes the Magnifier turns off automatically. 
<p>If a mouse button is assigned to <b>Magnify </b>globally, but you have a different action assigned to that button in a specific program (or vice versa), IntelliPoint might turn off the Magnifier automatically if you switch from a program where the Magnifier
 is recognized to one where it is not. </p>
The Magnifier does not make the content of all of my windows larger. 
<p>The Magnifier may not correctly display images or video in some applications or games.
</p>
Macros 
I am unable to record/run macros while playing an online game. 
<div>
<ul>
<li>While playing online games, you may not be able to record or run macros. This is because the security programs you are running, for example, intrusion detection software, may prevent you from using in-game recording and playback.
</li><li>Unplug other USB devices that are not in use. </li><li>Try the mouse on another computer to verify it is working correctly.
</li><li>If you are using a wireless mouse: For tips about troubleshooting problems with the wireless connection, see

Troubleshooting wireless and Bluetooth issues</a>. </li></ul>
Quick Turn 
Quick Turn does not work. 
<div>
<ul>
<li>Try calibrating Quick Turn again. </li><li>In Windows 7 and Windows Vista, if you start a game using elevated administrator credentials, many IntelliPoint features, including Quick Turn, will not work.
</li><li>If you are using Program-Specific Settings, try using ALT+TAB to switch out of the game, and then switch back into the game.
</li></ul>
Quick Turn does not calibrate correctly. 
<p>If Quick Turn does not calibrate correctly: </p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Try calibrating Quick Turn again. While calibrating,
<div>
<ul>
<li>Wait until the Quick Turn icon appears in the mouse display before turning.
</li><li>Turn your character in a full 360-degree circle. </li></ul>
</li><li>Disable in-game acceleration and smoothing.<br />
<br />
Some games include in-game acceleration. This can be disabled. Search for game options such as mouse acceleration, mouse smoothing or mouse averaging. Try disabling these features, and try calibrating Quick Turn again.
<div>
<ol>
<li>Using the mouse that you want to configure, start Intellipoint.<br />
(Click <b>Start</b>, point to <b>All Programs</b>, click <b>Microsoft Mouse</b>, and then click
<b>Microsoft Mouse</b>.) </li><li>On the <b>Pointer Options</b> tab, under <b>Motion</b>, clear the
<b>Enhance Pointer Precision</b> check box to turn off mouse acceleration. </li></ol>
</li><li>When in-game acceleration cannot be disabled: <br />
<br />
Some games, such as Halo and Halo 2, have in-game acceleration speeds that cannot be disabled. These games may use different mouse acceleration when your character is standing still and when the character is moving. The following tips may help minimize the
 effects of in-game acceleration: <b>Tips </b>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Try calibrating Quick Turn quickly. When recording, start the turn by quickly zipping the mouse to the left or right. Next, slowly finish the circle and release the button to finish the recording. and release the button to finish the
 recording. </li><li>Try calibrating Quick Turn while your character is walking.
</li><li>Try calibrating Quick Turn while your character is standing still.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Quick Turn may be affected by changes in mouse speed, acceleration, or sensitivity settings. If you change any of these settings, you may have to recalibrate Quick Turn.
</p>
<p><b>Tip </b></p>
<p>Use Program-Specific Settings to save a different Quick Turn for each game you play.

</li><li>Metallic surfaces in contact with the device </li><li>Other wireless pointing devices and transceivers </li></ul>
Setting up a Bluetooth device 
<p>You can use the following information to help you troubleshoot a problem with your Bluetooth wireless device (keyboard or mouse).
</p>
Check the connection between your computer and the Bluetooth transceiver 
<div>
<ul>
<li>Make sure Bluetooth is on. <br />
If you are connecting your device by using an internal Bluetooth connection, make sure wireless connections are active. Many portable computers have a switch, a key, or a keyboard shortcut that activates the wireless connections.
</li><li>Turn on Bluetooth on your computer if your mouse does not have its own transceiver.<br />
If your mouse does not include its own transceiver, your desktop, notebook, or portable computer must have a transceiver built into the computer or you must use a non-Microsoft external transceiver. How the mouse will connect to the computer by Bluetooth, and
 how to turn on Bluetooth, varies depending on how it is implemented on the computer. You may have to contact the computer manufacturer or the manufacturer of the Bluetooth transceiver to find out how to turn on Bluetooth on the computer and how to add a device
 to it. </li></ul>
Refresh the wireless connection to your Bluetooth device 
<div>
<ul>
<li>Pair your Bluetooth device to your computer. </li><li>Re-establish a wireless link if your computer does not detect a Bluetooth-enabled Microsoft device
<br />
<br />
If you try to use a Bluetooth-enabled Microsoft wireless keyboard or mouse and the input device does not work, it may be because your computer does not detect the device. To resolve this issue on a Windows computer, re-establish the wireless link with the computer.

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/811798</a></li></ul>
Resolve a connection failure when the setup software cannot connect to a Bluetooth-enabled Microsoft device
<p>During the installation process, if the setup software fails to connect to the device through a Bluetooth connection, you must change the transceiver to use a hardware-managed Bluetooth mode.
</p>
<p>For more information, see Microsoft Support article 953694 at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953694" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953694</a></p>
Establish a Bluetooth connection when a device is unresponsive 
<p>If the Bluetooth connection cannot be established, you may have to remove the unresponsive device from the system and then add it back.
</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>Start</b>, click <b>Control Panel</b>, and then double-click
<b>Bluetooth Devices</b>. </li><li>If the unresponsive Bluetooth device is listed, select it and then click
<b>Remove</b>. </li><li>Click <b>Start</b>, click <b>All Programs</b>, click <b>Microsoft Mouse</b>, and then click
<b>Connect Mouse for Bluetooth</b>. </li><li>Follow the instructions in the wizard to connect your device.
</li></ol>
Why there is a delay before a Bluetooth mouse responds after it has been inactive
<p>To extend battery life, Bluetooth devices go into hibernation after 8-10 minutes of inactivity. It can take several seconds for the Bluetooth mouse to reconnect when you resume using it after this period of hibernation. As a result, you may notice a delay
 between the time that you use the mouse and the response on the screen. </p>
Use other Bluetooth devices with the Microsoft Wireless Transceiver for Bluetooth
<p>Bluetooth wireless technology lets you connect multiple compliant devices to your computer. You may be able to use other Bluetooth devices with the Microsoft Wireless Transceiver for Bluetooth, but this connectivity is not always supported by Microsoft.
</p>
<p>For information about how to use other Bluetooth devices with the Microsoft Wireless Transceiver for Bluetooth, see the documentation that was included with the device.
</p>
<p>For newer devices, download the latest version of the software from the Hardware Download Software Web page.
</p>
Connecting the Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 
<p>The Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 does not include its own transceiver. Instead, the mouse relies on the desktop, notebook, or portable computer to have a transceiver built into the computer. How the mouse will connect to the computer by Bluetooth
 varies depending on how Bluetooth is implemented on the computer. You may have to contact the computer manufacturer to find out how to turn on Bluetooth on the computer and how to add a device to it.
</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Press and hold the <b>Connect</b> button on the bottom of the mouse. The battery indication light will blink and alternate between red and green to indicate that the device is discoverable.
</li><li>On the computer, open the Bluetooth software. The Bluetooth software is typically located in Control Panel.
</li><li>Click the <b>Devices</b> tab, and then click <b>Add</b>. </li><li>Follow the instructions. </li><li>If you are prompted for a passkey, select <b>No passkey</b>. Microsoft Bluetooth mouse devices do not require a passkey to connect to the computer.
</li></ol>
<p><b>Note </b></p>
<p>The Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 does not let you reassign the functions of its buttons. It is designed to work with Bluetooth transceivers and Bluetooth stacks from other manufacturers. It therefore does not include a Microsoft transceiver and
 the Microsoft IntelliPoint software that provides button reassigning features. </p>
A Bluetooth mouse or keyboard fails to reconnect after being left idle 
<p>After not using your Bluetooth mouse or keyboard for some time, you may not be able to use the device again without rebooting the system or turning your Bluetooth radio off and back on.

<p>Oria Xu,</p>
<p>&nbsp;At the present time, there is not a preference, setting, etc. that would allow you to disable the controller light while actively using the controller. If this is something you would like to see added, I'd recommend heading over to the&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_feedback/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox
 LIVE Wishlist/Feedback</a>&nbsp;forums and creating a thread with that recommendation.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a little annoying to me as well. I purchased an Xbox One controller to use with my PC, and the light is super annoying when plugged in. &nbsp;When I unplugged it from the USB cable, it flashed for a bit, but then stopped. &nbsp;I wonder if there's any
 way to turn off the controller when it's unplugged from USB and on battery? &nbsp;Or does it automatically sleep when not connected to an Xbox system or PC?</p>

<h2>            Problem with Mass Effect 2 DLC purchased through Sales &#38;amp&#59; Specials app</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Xbox team... a couple weeks ago, I purchased a Mass Effect 2 DLC (Lair of the Shadow Broker) through the Sales and specials app. It cost me 560 MP (It costs 800 MP normally i think), and yesterday when i played the game i noticed the dlc appeared as
 not bought in the game DLC menu.</p>
<p>I checked the xbox marketplace and it also appears as not bought. However the DLC appears in my download history and also in the transaction history at the Microsoft account billing site.</p>
<p>I tried deleting the item from the hard drive and downloading again, but the problem remains.</p>
<p>What can I do?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Has anyone from Microsoft solved this issue yet? &nbsp;I have talked with support on the phone and sent numerous emails about this. &nbsp; I bought the Mass Effect 2 at the same time through the sales/special app on the dashboard. &nbsp; It downloaded fine, its on my download
 history and the guy from support says the license for this is on my console. &nbsp;But yet it shows up as unpurchased on the Mass Effect 2 game and also on the marketplace. &nbsp; The final word from support is contact &nbsp;EA about this. &nbsp;

<p>Hey there White! As Smwutches posted above, this is merely a display issue. You should still be able to download and play the DLC without any issue. If you ever need to download it again, simply do so from your Download History on either the console or the
 website. I hope this helps, thanks! </p>

<p>sorry to bump and old tread - but I have the same issue. &nbsp;I originally bought The lair of the shadow broker from the Sales and Special App. &nbsp;ME2 DLC appears in my download history and it is also on my hard drive. &nbsp;When I play ME2 on the menu options, and
 click on the extras, it shows its available for Microsoft points and after I click on it, it goes to transaction pop up to deduct the money from my account. &nbsp;Also on the XB marketplace it shows that it has not been purchased. I have tried deleting the DLC
 and reinstalling 3x also used the recover gamertag with no luck. &nbsp; What do you mean Mister Gwyther that its a display issue? &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Podłączenie profilu  do istniejącego konta XBOX Live</h2>
                    
<p>Do tej pory używałem konsoli off line. Ostatnio zdecydowałem się na dołączenie do usugi XBOX Live, przy czym chciałem wykorzystać istniające konto. Przeszukałem już to forum kilka razy i z opisów wynika, iż taka operacja jest wykonalna i w miarę prosta.
 U mnie za każdym razem kończy się niepowodzeniem :( Generalnie robię to tak:</p>
<p>loguję się na mój profil, wybieram dołącz do XBOX Live&nbsp; - pojawia się informacja o&nbsp;potrzebie założenia nowego konta&nbsp;(a&nbsp;ja chciałbym użyć istniejącego)&nbsp;i idę zgodnie ze wskazówkami: podaję tag, istniejący indentyfikator Windows ID oraz&nbsp;hasło - po chwili otrzymuję
 komunikat, iż wybrany identyfikator Windows Live jest już zajęty i wracam do punktu wyjście. Dodam, iż import profilu działa bez zarzutu, ale wtedy trace wszystkie osiągnięcia.</p>
<p>Ponieważ z tego co widzę, nie tlko ja mam z tym probem to może ktoś z bardziej zaawansowanych użytkowników byłby w stanie napisac krok po kroku jak podłączyć profil do istniejącego konta XBOX Live?</p>

<h2>            What software do I need to get WMP to play the extra audio-video content from a Sony CD-Extra CD&#63; And, where do I get it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>What software (plugin or codec or whatever) do I need to get Windows-7&nbsp;Media Player (and WinAmp, etc.)&nbsp;to play the extra audio-video content from a 1996 Sony CD-Extra CD?&nbsp; And, where&nbsp;do I get it from?&nbsp; The CD music tracks play normally, but the extra content
 does not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe the playlist (*.dir)&nbsp;files that tie all the pieces (audio-video files)&nbsp;together are Macromedia Director files, because the CD's Sampler.exe program is a ''Macromedia Director 5.0&nbsp;- Projector Skeleton - Application.''&nbsp; I need a plugin that will
 allow WMP (etc.) to read and interpret and play these Dir files.&nbsp; Or, I need a program to convert them into WMP (etc.) Playlists.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two programs on the CD (AutoRun.exe and PlayCD.exe)&nbsp;are ''Sony Music AutoStart Applications.''&nbsp; The only other program on the CD (D:\QTW_203\QTINSTAL.EXE)&nbsp;installs Apple QuickTime 2.03 for Windows 95.&nbsp; All the programs are Windows-95 (16-bit) applications,
 so the CD is too old&nbsp;to install and run&nbsp;from Windows-7 (64-bit).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me to solve this problem?</p>

            <p>Hi Waseemulla Shariff,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for all the links.&nbsp; They were very informative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a recap for those who are following this thread:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was MacroMedia Director is now Adobe Director.&nbsp; I downloaded a 3-mo. trial version of A.D. 11.5, which tries to update the Sony CD-Extra *.Dir files, but can't because they are protected!&nbsp; That being so, there probably is no way to [legally] convert
 these playlist files via third party software.&nbsp; I will have to try and contact Sony again, but I probably won't be able to actually get hold of anyone there, as their website and phone answering service just gives one the run-arround.&nbsp; My only other alternative
 is to watch the stuff on my old computer and figure out the playback sequence of the files that are part of each video, then create my own playlists for WMP or WinAmp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JPD</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Controller Volcano Shadow</h2>
                    <p>So this is the 3rd controller I got from Gamestop brand new that is messed up and I just got it today!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issues:</p>
<p>1st controller:</p>
<p>The adpter didn't register 90% of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd controller:</p>
<p>The RT was squeaky really loud and was hard to press the 2nd day I used it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3rd controller:</p>
<p>Same issue as the 2nd one but it's just starting to squeak so it'll be there soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I want Microsoft to make their controllers worth the $70 that people pay for it so fix them it's annoying or make the price $25-30 for the
<strong>[mod removed-profanity]</strong>quality it's made of!</p>

            I wanted to get a controller from there but I have a 1 replacement at gamestop and this is the 3rd volcano shadow controller I got from 2 different stores. I can fix the issue with some oil but I shouldn't have to do work arounds or returns for it to be
 fixed.

            Consider the elite controller. It's much more expensive but much more durable. I broke so many regular controllers and finally gave in and it's worth the money. Never going back to the regular controllers.&nbsp;

            I personally think of controllers like cars.... They are so quickly massed produced that you really never know what kind of problems you are getting when purchasing. Just like a car... Some are awesome and some are lemons.... Ya just never know. Maybe
 Microsoft should do a little more random quailty testing. But i agree... At the prices we pay we should not have to do anything but open box and enjoy with no problems...&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I would but even some of my friends said their LT and 1 of them the RT sticks so it's not just normal ones sadly from what they've said. The problems I see are the LT RT sticking and the D-pad clicking and loose after a while and the sticks getting loose
 if this wasn't an issue I'd get the elite.

            Hi Vytrần, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />The first troubleshooting step I'd recommend is the System File Checker. It may be able to repair any corrupt system files:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type cmd.
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />- Type sfc /scannow
<br />- Press Enter.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, try the Windows Update Troubleshooter:

<p>Hello Noreen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here on the Xbox forums. Is this an error that pops up on the startup of the Xbox? You may want to try out a soft factory reset.
<em>Note - This will not remove your games or apps to from the console. You will however, have to re sign into your accounts with email and password.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn off your console and unplug it for 30 seconds. Plug in your console and turn it on by
<strong>Holding down the Controller Sync button AND the Power button only</strong>. This should power on your console on the Troubleshooting screen. From here you can select Reset console, and then Reset and keep my games and apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Hey there Noreen!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to get your Xbox to start.
</p>
<p>In this instance, because it doesn't <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/startup-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
bring up the home screen, then I would suggest trying the steps outlined in </a>Troubleshoot Xbox One startup errors. It was written for exactly this kind of thing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When and if you get a chance, try that out and let us know how that helped in resolution of the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

This appears to be a typical software driver bug and is not likely to be caused by a hardware problem.

A third party driver was identified as the probable root cause of this system error. It is suggested you look for an update for the following driver: atikmdag.sys (ATI Radeon Kernel Mode Driver, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.).

Both Bug_Check were caused by the ATI video drivers even though the versions installed at the time<br />
was different for each.<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Check with ATI Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums to about<br />
any known issues (see links in the previous reply).<br />
<br />
<strong>2. </strong>Check with ASUStek Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about<br />
any known issues. Update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate
<br />
device drivers (see driver update methods previously posted).<br />

            If the computer was activated there is no longer a need for a key.<br />
When asked for a key just go to the bottom of the page and click on Skip, Do this later, or I do not have one.<br />

    <title>Replace Games for Windows Live In Game Client with Xbox for Windows In - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Replace Games for Windows Live In Game Client with Xbox for Windows In Game Client</h2>
                    
<p>Everytime I play "Flatout Ultimate Carnage" I cringe a little when I see "Games for Windows Live" pop up. Its not that I hate it, it's that nothing is being done with it especially with the new Xbox for Windows 10 come out. The Xbox App on Windows 10 actually
 recognizes my Flatout Ultimate Carnage, and keeps track of my achievements. Even my friends I added on Games for Windows Live, are shown on the Xbox App. If that can happen, we should get an update for Games for Windows Live, called Xbox for Windows. This
 would replace the Games for Windows Live, and make everyone stop complaining about GFWL. Just look at reviews with games with GFWL. They absolute hate it, and don't recommend buying it just because of GFWL. This update would wipe the bad name, and make the
 older games more enjoyable to play. GFWL once reset my save game. Lucky, I had a backup, but for a gamer like me, something needs to be done about the ill-faded Games for Windows Live...</p>

<h2>            Boot screen shows up twice</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo Yoga 500 which is running version 1511. Whenever I boot up my laptop, it boots and shows the loading screen, but then the screen goes blank for a couple of seconds and then the second loading screen appears, however this time, the loading
 circle seems to be spinning slower compared to the first screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the loading screen is finished, it then takes a couple of mins for me to actually be able to log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way fix to this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>"The only way to safely reduce the size of the WinSxS folder is to reduce the set of possible actions that the system can take –
<strong>the easiest way to do that is to remove the packages that installed the components in the first place.</strong> This can be done by uninstalling superseded versions of packages that are on your system. Service Pack 1 contains a binary called VSP1CLN.EXE,
 a tool that will make the Service Pack package permanent (not removable) on your system, and remove the RTM versions of all superseded components. This can only be done because by making the Service Pack permanent we can guarantee that we won’t ever need the
 RTM versions. "</p>
<p>And I suggest that you use a third -party tool to move space from another drive to the C drive...</p>
<p>Have you used the Disk Cleanup tool?</p>

<h2>            can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t connect to my wifi</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I bought an xbox 360E today and I can't manage to connect through Wifi. The ethernet cable works fine and I even tried using my phone as a hotspot to let the xbox tether to it and that worked fine too. I have a modem/router which isn't too far from
 the console, some 10-15 feet maybe, and I tried port forwarding already, and even set a DMZ, all to no avail I live in Italy, my modem/router's brand is Sitecom WL-363, I'm trying to connect to WiFi through the console's internal adapter of course, UPnP is
 enabled, as is port forwarding. My ISP is Infostrada. I'll copy the codes I get in the prompt: w: 0000 - 0000 x: 8000 - 0011 y: 0000 - 0000 z: 0000 - 0000 id 0000 - 0006 L: 8015 - 1000 q: 8007 - 0435 t: wireless network a: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 g: 0.0.0.0 d: 0.0.0.0,

<p>Unplug any wireless adapters or network cables if you want to use the built-in Wi-Fi to connect. Go to the XBox menu and select "My XBox." Select "System Settings" and look at the number of bars your connection provides. Try configuring your settings by
 selecting "Configure Network." Select "Wireless Mode" under the "Basic Settings" tab. Scan for networks and enter your wireless password. Select "Done" and test your XBox Live by pressing the "B" button. Reset your wireless settings in the "Configure Network"
 tab. Select "Additional Settings" and then "Restore to Factory Defaults." Confirm by selecting "Yes" and turn off the console after it finishes. Power up your console and try to connect again.</p>
<p>Secure the wireless adapter's USB cord to the console if you want to use a wireless network adapter to connect. Make sure the antennae are flipped up for optimal signal. Unplug the USB connector and plug it back in if the Wireless Networking Adapter's light
 is not on. Try every other USB port on the console if you are still experiencing issues. Contact support if the adapter's lights are flashing red. Use the same method for the Wireless G Networking Adapter model.</p>
<p>Move objects or interfering signals from the path of the wireless router or gateway that may keep it from working. Move the source of your wireless Internet signal and the console closer together for a better connection. Try turning off other wireless devices
 to see if the cause of the issue is interfering signals. Test your XBox Live connection in the "Network" tab after making any of these changes.</p>
<p>Add your XBox console's MAC address if your router or gateway is using MAC filtering. Find your console's MAC address by going to "My XBox" on the console's main screen. Select "System Settings" and then "Network Settings." Select "Configure Network" and
 then "Advanced Settings" on the "Additional Settings" tab.</p>
<p>Try plugging your console in for a wired connection by inserting one end of a network cable into your console and the other end into your router or gateway. Test your XBox Live connection in the "Network" tab.</p>
<p>Change your router or gateway to "Mixed Mode" if you have an N or 802.11n type router. Consult your specific router's guide to complete this task.</p>
<p>If this doesn't fix the problem. Log onto Xbox.com click support and chat with Ambassador or MS rep.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We are sorry to know that system asks for password.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to refer to the steps if he wants to disable the login password and check if that helps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Type “netplwiz” from the Start Screen and then press “Enter” key on the keyboard.<br />
&nbsp;b) On the “User Accounts” page, check if you have selected the option “Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer” for the Guest Account to set auto-login. If this option is selected, then uncheck this option for the Guest account and then
 click on “Ok”.<br />
c) Restart the computer and check the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Note: If your local account is an administrator type of account, then it is strongly recommended to keep your account password protected for security purposes. Otherwise anyone will be able to use your account, and just be able to select your account
 and press Enter in a UAC prompt to run as administrator.</span></p>
