<div>Did you just purchase a new Seagate hard drive? It sounds like you did and you want to clone your PC's old hard drive to this new one and then place this new one in your PC. Am I correct? If so, please identify both hard drives. (If there are other hard

            You may have waited too long to clone the drive.&nbsp; You may want to skip all of the below and take the drive to an independent repair shop with experience in data recovery.&nbsp; You'll have to do some research to find such a shop in your area.&nbsp; I would not suggest
 going to a BigBoxStoreUSA or GeekSquad type of place.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, you may have to run chkdsk /r several times to repair all errors.&nbsp; However, if the drive is physically failing, running and re-running chkdsk /r will not help and likely will make things worse.<br />
<br />
You can try running a diagnostic program appropriate for the failing drive:<br />
<br />
If it's a Seagate, Maxtor, or other non-Western Digital drive, use <a href="http://knowledge.seagate.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/201271en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SeaTools for DOS</a>.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If it's a Western Digital drive, use <a href="http://support.wdc.com/product/download.asp?groupid=502&amp;sid=30&amp;lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WD Data Lifeguard for DOS (CD)</a>.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you have an IBM/Lenovo computer, use the <a href="http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/diagnose-and-fix/detail.page?LegacyDocID=MIGR-4YQLGR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
drive diagnostic built into the BIOS (if available for your model) or the downloadable bootable diagnostics</a>.<br />

<div>=========================================================</div>
<div><br />
<div>BTW, what is the difference in running chkdsk /r in the Repair Console, and running it during booting from C? It seems that they gave different results.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>2. &nbsp;My source drive is Seagate (SATA) and the destination disk is WD (SATA).</div>
<div><br />
<div>3.<span> </span>No specific errors mentioned. The PC just hanged.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4.<span> </span>When I used another software EaseUS to clone, also reported errors.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5.<span> </span>I am cloning the WD disk to use as a back up, in case the Seagate failed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>6.<span> </span>No other hard drives in my PC.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks.</div>

            Hello! LemP
<div><br />
<div>I like your remarks:</div>
<div><br />
<div><span><b>Sometimes, you may have to run chkdsk /r several times to repair all errors.&nbsp;</b></span>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Indeed, I run it many times (time consuming!!) and every time I get a different results in terms of the free space I have.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will try the Sea Tools for DOS later. I surmise that the problem is with the source disk (Seagate SATA).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks.</div>

            There are a number of threads here, and it is difficult to keep track of all the issues!
<div><br />
<div>First of all, your most recent chkdsk report looks fine to me. (Perhaps someone else might have more info.) However, I noticed this in it:</div>
<div><br />
<div><span><b><i>A disk check has been scheduled.</i></b></span> </div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>Unless I am misinterpreting this, it sounds like you did NOT run this while in the Recovery Console! Please verify.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am not the chkdsk expert here. I believe that running it while in the Recovery Console is considered the better option (but I do not know the reason). Maybe one of the experts (I know that ElderL and Tech-Geek are very knowledgeable) will chime in. I
 DO know that often it is crucial to run it with the /r switch. I also know that sometimes it's impossible to schedule chkdsk to run (off the hard drive) and therefore using a bootable CD with Windows XP Recovery Console is the only workable option.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there reason to believe there is something physically wrong with your source drive? If so, I would hold off doing
<b><u>anything</u></b> at all with it until you know it has a clean bill of health. So definitely run SeaTools for DOS on it!</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the event it is in good shape, you should run Recovery Console and run chkdsk /r several times. Again, I don't know WHY, but I do know that it IS sometimes necessary to do it this way.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Malware can cause problems. Up until now, what I can mostly recall with your posts is you needed to figure out how to boot off a bootable CD properly!</div>
<div><br />
<div>But what is the malware status of your PC? And which tools have you used to determine this?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Finally, why are you cloning this drive? What is your ultimate goal? (Also, it might be necessary to use OTHER cloning software to get the job done.)</div>

            1.<span> </span>It takes me so long to get into the Repair Console, there is no reason I don't run
<b>chkdsk /r</b> there. Yes. I run on both, RC and off the Hard Drive. But somehow, the HD environment gives more informative results, such as "Cleaning up ...."
<div><br />
<div>2.<span> </span>Also, when run in RC, the progress percentage stopped at 50% very long, and then slowly climbed to 75%, and back to 50% again and then to 75%. Don't know why it has to be repeated at 50%
 twice?</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. &nbsp;The Malware may not be an issue, as I check the system regularly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4.<span> </span>Yes. I believe something is wrong with the source drive, as I have been&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;cloned the source drive
<b>many times </b>before with Seagate Tool.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. &nbsp; Why I need to clone? From the last mail point 5: <b>&nbsp;</b><span><b>I am cloning the WD disk to use as a back up, in case the Seagate failed.</b> I tried other software, but it failed too.</span></div>

            You are very smart to have a backup strategy like that. I don't have experience using the programs you have used. I do know that you should be able to create a bootable "rescue" CD, boot off that CD and use it to clone OR image the hard drive (I prefer
 imaging the drive). Acronis True Image Home provides the ability to do this.
<div><br />
<div>Would you consider altering your backup strategy to imaging rather than cloning?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Or are you able to boot off a bootable CD to create your clone (if this is what you prefer)?</div>
<div><br />
<div>The reason I ask is there may be something wrong with your Windows environment. If you boot off a bootable CD, you conveniently bypass that problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then again, if there IS something wrong with your Windows environment, that needs to be fixed! That is why I had asked:</div>
<div><br />
<div><b><i>&gt;&nbsp;<span>But what is the malware status of your PC? And which tools have you used to determine this?</span></i></b></div>
<div><br />
<div>You didn't not fully answer that question!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regarding the chkdsk percentage done going up and down phenomenon, that is annoying but normal.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do you intend to check the health of the source drive? I thought you were going to use Sea Tools for DOS...</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm not sure I can contribute much more to this thread. Hopefully others will have helpful ideas for you.</div>

            Hello! Daavee:
<div><br />
<div>1. &nbsp;I don't think I am smart. All I know is the purpose of cloning is to backup the existing hard drive.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />

            Cloning is ideal if you suspect your hard drive is on its way out and you want to replace it. Simply clone the old drive to the new one, remove the old drive and replace it with the new one, and you're good to go.
<div><br />
<div>Imaging is essentially distilling the essence of the hard drive into one gigantic file (or it can be a series of files, depending on the software and hardware used). This "archive" file may be stored anywhere and it can be used whenever disaster strikes.
 Simply use the associated restore function of the imaging software and the hard drive will revert to the EXACT state the moment it was imaged. For best results, create regular incremental images for more flexibility. This can all be done automatically in the
 background.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sometimes folks think they can use Windows Explorer to copy every single file on a hard drive to another hard drive and that this will work in the event of disaster recovery. Actually it won't. The new hard drive will still lack important data in VERY
 specific places. Although this method is okay for backing up files such as documents, photos, mp3s, etc., it is useless when it comes to the operating system.</div>

<h2>            Send To -&#62; Compressed Zipped Folder doesn&#39;t show</h2>
                    <p>I lost my Send To -&gt; Compressed Zipped Folder context menu action. &nbsp;I've searched the web and tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Remove the zero byte "Bluetooth".</p>
<p>- &nbsp;I did not have a zero byte "Bluetooth", I had a 2.5 KB "Bluetooth" and I removed it anyway since I don't use bluetooth on this machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;Copy "Compressed Zipped Folder" from the Default profile.</p>
<p>- &nbsp;No change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;Copy whole directory from the Default profile.</p>
<p>- &nbsp;No change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. &nbsp;Run "sfc /scannow"</p>
<p>- &nbsp;Windows did not find any integrity issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to find any other solutions online, so can anyone help?</p>

<h2>            How can I reclaim unallocated space which is on another line in Disk Management&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all. Just about to wipe my Laptop and fresh install of windows on my new SSD. However, I have realised next to the System Reserved (no idea) which is on another line, there is 29.72GB of Unallocated space. I only (pretty sure about this!) have
 a HDD which is my main and was only drive and SSD which is brand new with nothing on it.</p>
<p>I have done a clean install in the past.</p>
<p>Is there any way to utilise this space? Surely it is a part of the HDD (Disk 0)?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc317f42-1385-4cd4-b8c4-a6b5bf661a77" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc317f42-1385-4cd4-b8c4-a6b5bf661a77" /></a></p>

<p>Można mniej brutalnie, żeby nie utracić save'ów i fotek. Wystarczy skasować z ww. miejsca sam update - tylko potem przy uruchamianiu trzeba pamiętać, żeby go każdorazowo anulować. No i brak zgody wylogowuje z live'a. Fajnie to MS wykombinował:D</p>

    <title>Unable to upgrade to win7 due to different system language - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lailai625  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to upgrade to win7 due to different system language</h2>
                    Windows 7 setup told me I cannot upgrade to win7 because I have a different language. My display language is English and I have bought it in Australia which speaks english. Originally my laptop was Chinese (I've changed my display language). I do not have
 a external HD with me at this time, don't want to spend a lot of time downloading huge programs like photoshop, flash, and my steam games which is around 5GB (total files I need to download ~12GB. I also have some data that I would want to preserve. Any option
 to change the system language so win7 can install?

<p>If you've only changed the display language then your laptop is still Chinese.</p>
<p>You would need a Multilingual User Interface (MUI) to change it to English - and to do that you must have Vista Ultimate. But then you could only in place upgrade to Windows 7 ultimate.</p>

<p><span><span><span>If you are running
<strong>Windows Vista</strong> , in some cases you can in place upgrade directly to Windows 7 and in other cases you will need to perform a custom installation. The following table shows which editions of Windows&nbsp;Vista can be upgraded to Windows&nbsp;7.</span>

            Go to ''Region and Language'' which is located in the Control Panel, then click the ''keyboards and languages'' tab and after that, take a look in the area under ''display languages''. There's an option to install additional languages as optional&nbsp;updates&nbsp;and
 another one to apply them.

<h2>            Microsoft 3000 corded Comfort Mouse Not working with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Can someone please help &nbsp;me? I've been through a rather rough experience upgrading to Windows 10. After taking my Lenovo Ideapad Y500 to my computer gurus, the upgrade finally worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, my mouse will not work. I've downloaded the Windows 10 64 bit drivers for the Microsoft Comfort Mouse 3000 from the Microsoft website, but nada. Not working. I can't remember the exact error, but it said drivers not supported or something to that
 effect. I hate my touch pad and it's practically useless without my mouse working.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>That is exactly what I was thinking I have to resort to. Just looking on Amazon though, I'm not finding specifics for Windows 10. I'll keep looking. Just crazy that Microsoft products aren't compatible with their own software update. Ugh!

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that <strong>“in windows 10 you have to right click on the taskbar and select as show desktop”</strong>, there have are two options, one from taskbar and other option is by moving the mouse right side bottom corner of the screen, where
 you mouse cursor will hide click over there and it will take you to desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also you can use the shortcut keys like <strong>“Windows+D”</strong> button or
<strong>“Windows+M” </strong>it will take you to desktop<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.

<h2>            Reading output from already running .exe</h2>
                    Short and simple
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Basic outline of what I'm doing:</b></div>
<div><b>actionscript</b> <b>--&gt;</b> <b>c#</b> (hey execute c++ and send me the info it gives to you)
<b>c# ---&gt; c++</b> (hey wake up! run your code with a set of parameters and I'll read your info into a text file for use later)
<b>C++ ---&gt; C#</b> (hey I'm done and the info you wanted is in a text file) <b>C# ---&gt; actionscript</b> (Hey here's the info from the c++ exe)<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I make a call to a server to run a c# script which then calls a c++ exe to run some number crunching. While c++ is sending information to the console my server places the information in a text file, and once the c++ code has done its job the c# code reads
 the text file. C# takes the information from the text file, formats it nicely, and sends it back to where it was called from. Hopefully this part so far makes sense...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's the issue, sometimes the c++ code can take around a minute to finish and during this time I believe my call to the server (actionscript --&gt; c#) times out. So to get around this time out I figured I could make some sort of routine in actionscript
 that calls the server repeatedly to pull periodic information which I could display back at the GUI (actionscript) so the user doesn't get bored.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To do this I have looked into system.IO.Process and using <b>OutputDataRecieved
</b>to do so, however the problem is my exe is already running and I can't "recall" the exe to use the process.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas how I can basically send periodic information from c++ to c# to be sent to actionscript?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sincerely</div>

<p>you supposedly can download a file that lets you ignore certain updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>its a joke that a user has to download a separate windows program to stop an update from being pushed..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft communist approach at pushing windows updates has pissed the masses off... &nbsp; no one wants it and they need to go back to the classic pick and choose update method..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally wont stick around if it is not fixed or I cant find a way to Hack windows to work as it should out of box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can always go into services and disable windows update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>you wont receive any updates once its disabled but at least it wont be able to push updates to you.</p>

<h2>            USB Sounds wont stop</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I just connected my speakers to my PC after 6 months, and the system will not stop making the sound of a USB device connecting, my wife tells me that it only makes thesound when the speakers are connected with headphones it never made the sound, I
 cannot see how that is possible I have a USB wireless adapter connected, a USB Bluetooth adapter, and the USB adapter for my wireless mouse which is also for my keyboard, so I am at a complete loss for this I have never had or heard of this problem before
 thank you all in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. The audio device that I am using is onboard with my ASUS M5a99X Evo Motherboard if that is of any consequence.</p>

<h2>            Driver Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver Failed</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just bought a Gaming Receiver so I can connect my Xbox 360 controllers to my laptop. It's running Windows 7 64bit.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I try to install the drivers, I manually point out the folder where they are, but I get an error message very time. It's in Dutch, but I'm going to try to translate it as well as I can:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A problem occured during the installation of the device's driver</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A driver has been found, but an error occured while trying to install the driver.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- PC Wireless Gaming Receiver</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The system can't find the designated file.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On my boyfriend's desktop pc, the driver installed without a problem. He's running Windows 7 as well.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I fix this? And can someone tell me where I can find the actual log files for these errors?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance,</div>
<div>Nikki</div>
                </div>

<p>I have understood that you are unable to install Gaming drivers of the computer.

    <title>Can&#39;t open PC settings on domain accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krabat0903  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t open PC settings on domain accounts</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
<br />
I upgraded two of our PCs to Windows 8. Now, when I login with a local user I can open the "PC settings" app, but with every domain user I login with, it won't open. It just shows the blue screen with the white gear in it, then it falls back to the start screen.
 The domain users are all local admins and it also won't work when I sign in with a domain admin. But it works for each and every local user. Is there some group policy that might crash the app? The problem is the same with both PCs, so I'm really thinking
 it's a group policy problem, but I'm kinda stumped.<br />
<br />
Any help would be great!<br />
<br />
(Oh yeah, the server is a Windows 2008 R2)<br />

<h3> torchtorchman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Error Code 80048821</h2>
                    
<p>I created this account for my little brother some time ago. I originally used my gmail and made a new password. I'm at home from college for the weekend, and my little brother is asking me to help him solve a problem: every time he tries to connect, he is
 prompted to enter an email and password. Now, we know the email address, and I've changed the password three times today. Every time we try to log in with the correct information, it shows an error message, code 80048821. I looked around on the forums, here&nbsp;http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/t/422107.aspx
 and here&nbsp;http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/p/448034/2249070.aspx, but so far, nothing has worked. The account has a silver membership, not gold, but it's a nuisance to not be able to log in on the xbox. I would appreciate it if we could get
 some help solving this problem</p>

<p>Found the answer; go under Settings&gt;System&gt;Hard Drive&gt;Profile and delete your profile. Then press the X and bring the Guide up, and select Download Profile. You'll have to put in the user/pass, then it will put your profile back. You'll have to do the user/pass
 on the Add Security page again, and when I did this it failed and gave me the 80048821 error again, BUT after I returned to the main Xbox screen via the Guide I found that I was logged into Live and things worked. Just needed to get out of the Sign In/Failure
 to Sign In loop. In fact, perhaps you don't even have to delete your profile (but I've already done this step and found success).</p>

<p>I was having the exact same problem as the rest of you, on my actual home console. When the Xbox Live terms of agreement were updated sometime in the past week or two or so, I was on a friend's console and accepted the updated terms there. I don't know if
 this is what caused the issue with this error code in the first place. My Xbox Live 12-month Gold subscription doesn't terminate until September 2013, so I don't think that has anything to do with it. At first it was still keeping me logged in when I signed
 in even after telling me my password was incorrect and displaying the error code, but today I discovered it was logging me back out. I could still sign in to Xbox.com no problem, and I had no issues signing in on my friend's system throughout the past week.
 I believe I have fixed the issue though. First I cleared the system cache, as Mister Ohnaka suggested, and then I did what AndrewNiekamp did, and deleted my Profile from my console (just the Profile), and then re-downloaded it. This appears to have fixed the
 problem. I no longer have issues signing in. It doesn't tell me my password is incorrect, and it has stored the password. It also doesn't display the error code anymore. I tried signing out and then signing back in, and I was able to do so without any problems.
 So perhaps this solution will work for you guys as well.</p>

<p>It keeps doing this to me.....I deleted the profile off my console, cleared cache, downloaded my profile again, then it signs me in once I enter the name and password, and after it asks if I want to remember the password, it goes back and asks for it all
 again, then gives me the error sign again....</p>

<p>We have been experiencing the same exact problem for about a month now and were told to do the same exact thing listed above by someone on the phone with Microsoft. This worked for about a week and now we are experiencing the same exact problem. We tried
 the steps again and it still won't work. Our profiles will work on the other consoles in our house but not the main one in our living room. Very frustrating!</p>

    <title>Video stutters after upgrade to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m. olsen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video stutters after upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>All video playback stutters every 3 seconds or so after I upgraded to Windows 10, while audio is unaffected. This is true for both locally stored videos played in VLC-media player, Windows media player, quicktime...etc, and in online streaming like youtube
 in Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated all graphics drivers, and have tried to install the newest ones directly from the AMD website with no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happened directly from the upgrade to 10, as Windows 8.1 had no such issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The troubleshooter finds nothing wrong.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I did the clean boot but there was still the same amount of stuttering in all video playback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While in the clean boot I also tried a repair of the AMD Catalyst graphics drivers, but it did not fix the problem. No change at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, in between uninstalling the old graphics drivers and installing the new ones from the AMD website, I tried to play video without any graphics drivers. The video played smoothly but obviously there was no audio and no connection to the external monitor
 without the drivers. So I'm thinking it's probably the drivers that are the issue somehow.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Sorry, I think that's a very poor choice of e-mail programs and I know very little about it. As far as I'm concerned, there are several better third-party choices, many of them free. You shouldn't use what comes with Windows simply because it comes with
 Windows. I recommend that you try several others and decide for yourself which you like best.</p>

<h2>            Mixing Xbox One and 360 Controllers on Windows 10</h2>
                    
<p>Is there a way to re-assing Controller numbers on Windows 10?</p>
<p>I'm using an Xbox One Controller and some 360 Controllers as well. They all work, with one problem:</p>
<p>The 360 controllers are always placed before the One Controller. So, if I connect the Xbox One Controller, it works as expected, but, if I connect additional 360 Controllers, they will occupy the controller slots before the Xbox One Controller, which is
 rather annoying, since a lot of game menus can only be controlled by Controller #1. Also the split screen assingments don't work as expected.</p>
<p>So, what I'm looking for is a way to have the Xbox One Controller always on #1 and the 360 controllers take up Slots #2-#4</p>

<h2>            Just a Few Questions</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I just bought BF: BC 2, well sort of. I'd rented it earlier, but I decided to buy the ultimate edition today. The bar on the top of the game case says that the game comes bundled with Battlefield: 1943, and Onslaught mode, but after I entered my VIP
 code, it says that Onslaught Mode is 400 MS points, and I also have no idea how to access 1943.
<br />
<br />
Is it possible that this is because I am still in the middle of that 1.64 GB update, am I looking in the wrong places, or did I just read the label wrong?<br />
<br />
Thanks anyone who helps. <br />

            From the sounds of it, Xbox and Mixer are making a bigger push in the ANZAC territory, so fingers crossed that means that Design Labs is on the way at some point too. As others have suggested, drop a suggestion at the Xbox User Voice site, or vote for
 the suggestion if somebody else has already made it. If this isn't on their radar yet, then hopefully you and others can get it on their radar by discussing it and getting it lots of votes on the Xbox User Voice site.

<h2>            Where is the scroll bar settings on Windows 7</h2>
                    I've look into the control panel under MOUSE but don't see any thing about the SCROLL BAR and have looked in PERSONALIZATION, still didn't see anything. SCROLL BAR SETTINGS please. Using Windows 7 and Mozilla Firefox browser. I want to be able to scroll
 up &amp; down without having to click onto the bar. I want to be able to scroll with my mouse wheel while my mouse is on the page.&nbsp; &nbsp;

    <title>Task Scheduler failed to start. Additional Data&#58; Error Value&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> old man river  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Scheduler failed to start. Additional Data&#58; Error Value&#58; 2147943726. What does this mean&#63;</h2>
                    A Scheduled task failed to start leaving this message: <span>Task Scheduler failed to start "\Fence Check Rota" task for user "Alan-Laptop\Alan". Additional Data: Error Value: 2147943726.<br />
<br />
The task ran on the previous 2 nights without a problem the Action is: "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\Excel.exe" /r "C:\Users\Alan\Documents\HSC\Fence Check\Fence Check Auto Run.xlsm" and there is nothing wrong with it all files are where they
 are meant to be.<br />
<br />
Following the "Event Log Online Help" takes me to a page that tells me to convert the above code to a decimal value and look it up&nbsp; on another page. This has Error codes in bands from 0 to 15999. The value I have at 214793726 is obviuosly not an Octal value
 as it contains the digit 9 and if a decimal is higher than 15999 and if Hex then considerably higher.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me what is failing?<br />
<br />

            <p>My answer comes late, but hopefully usefull for those searching for an answer.</p>
<p>As some replied above, the change of password has a role causing that error.\</p>
<p>quickist fix (instead of microsoft lengthy&nbsp;ms.config modification)&nbsp;is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in task scheduler, click on the scheduled job properties &gt;&gt;&gt; then settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the last listed option:</p>
<p>"if the task is already running, the following rule appplies:"</p>
<p>select "stop the existing instance" from the drop down list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>save and exist.</p>
<p>This should fix it.</p>
