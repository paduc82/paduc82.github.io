    <title>pctv stick not recognized by wmc anymore - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            pctv stick not recognized by wmc anymore</h2>
                    im using my pinnacle hybrid stick quatro (510e) quite often on my notebook, which still has the win7 ultimate&nbsp;rc 32bit installed (win7 ultimate 64bit&nbsp;is&nbsp;coming in a few weeks). now approx. since the expiry date of the rc (march 1st) my pctv stick isnt
 recognized by wmc anymore. when i connect the stick i hear the "plugged-in" sound and the device is being displayed correctly, but when trying to watch tv inside wmc it says "searching for tuners".<br />
<br />
this is certainly because of an update of the wmc, which i have set to automatic, so every update has been installed. i tried to uninstall and reinstall the official pinnacle drivers for the pctv stick and also reinstalled the wmc support software provided
 by pinnacle, as well as the beta drivers for win7, but none of it solved the issue.<br />
<br />
now i connected the stick to my desktop pc (win7 ultimate 64bit) and installed the pinnacle wmc support software, set all up inside wmc and it completed everything and i was able to watch tv.<br />
<br />
so there is definitely something wrong with an update of the wmc on my notebook, OR could it be due to the fact that its the win7 rc on my notebook, which has expired?<br />
<br />
if an update is the problem, is there a way to roll back or uninstall a specific wmc update? maybe someone else already experienced the same problem or knows which update could have caused these issues (where can i see a list of all installed wmc updates?).<br />
<br />
thanks

<strong>Sugestions:<br />
<br />
</strong>Possibilities are there that the latest updates did not work well with the tv tuner.<strong>
<br />
<br />
</strong>Check the update history using the link<br />

<br />
Backup your data and migrate your computer to a release version of Windows 7 as soon as possible because RC version can show varying behaviour after the expiration date.<br />

            thanks, but as i stated above, this applies to the windows media center, and looking at the windows update history, i cannot find any updates for the windows media center, as it has its own automatic update feature not related to the windows update.<br />
<br />
so, how can i see the update history for the windows media center, and then revert or uninstall a specific one? and if this issue is caused by a wmc update, which&nbsp;it obviously is, then even when i install the intended retail version of windows 7 ultimate in
 the next few days/weeks, i run the risk that the same update gets installed again and then i will experience the same issues!<br />
<br />
is there a list of wmc updates viewable somewhere on a microsoft page online? especially detailing the content of specific updates...

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If OneDrive application doesn't appear on your system tray after performing the steps given above, here's an additional resolution on how to get back your OneDrive icon. To do so, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp;Press the Windows key + R.</li><li>&nbsp;In the <strong>Run</strong> window, enter %localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset</li><li>&nbsp;Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Make sure that the OneDrive icon in the notification area of the taskbar disappears and then re-appears after a minute or two.</li><li>&nbsp;<strong>If the OneDrive icon doesn't re-appear after a few minutes, open the Run window again and enter: %localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Do update us with the result and if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Windows signs you in to a temporary profile when your regular user account becomes corrupted, which can happen from configuration mistakes (with which I have considerable personal experience) or malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The purpose of the temporary profile is to give you an opportunity to fix your corrupted user account or, more likely, to create a new user account, copy the files from the old to the new, and then get rid of the old user account. The temporary profile is
 not supposed to be your regular user account, so it doesn't work like a regular user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you find yourself signed in to a temporary profile:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a new user account;</li><li>copy your files and folders from the old user to the new user (tip from the field: don't forget anything); and</li><li>delete the corrupt old user account.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you find this happening frequently, you need to figure out what it is you're doing wrong that corrupts your profile. Self-knowledge goes a long way with a computer.</p>

            Do you have MalwareBytes version 3.0x installed? This is known to cause the corrupt user login, usually signing out &amp; logging back in fixes it temporarily but will return next time you restart the pc. The solution (until MB releases a fix) is to set 'delay
 protection at startup' to 60 seconds.

<p>
</p><p>From the Administrator account, double-click on the user profile of the corrupted account (usually found under C:\Users.) You'll see a message: "You don't currently have permission ... Click on Continue ..." This will allow you to open that user's profile
 and copy the Documents, Music, etc. folders to the Administrator account.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Outlook vs Hotmail ID - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> magsowner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Outlook vs Hotmail ID</h2>
                    I used to use Windows Live and had my Microsoft account set up with my pop mail address. &nbsp;Later I opened up a Hotmail account and I was getting my pop mail and my Hotmail through my Windows Live Mail client program. &nbsp;The Microsoft switched my Hotmail to
 Outlook.com, which in essence gave me two Microsoft (Outlook.com) accounts. &nbsp;One, is set up with my pop mail address ID and one with my &nbsp;Hotmail address ID. &nbsp;This was not a problem until I bought my new computer with Windows 8. &nbsp;I set it up using my pop mail
 address as my ID, only to find that I could not set up pop mail in Outlook.com., and I cannot get my Hotmail to come through in my mail app.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can I simply go into my user settings and change my user ID from the pop mail address to the Hotmail ID and then just delete the other Outlook.com account since there doesn't seem to be any other use for it or is my new computer registered with that ID
 somewhere?</div>

            You said exactly what it said on the Microsoft support site, but no matter how many times I read it, it still does not make any sense. &nbsp;It says you can use pop mail, then it says you cannot, then it says you can, then it says you cannot. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I tried to add my pop mail account to my Outlook.com and it would not let me add it. &nbsp;Said I could not use pop mail. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I actually had two Outlook.com accounts. &nbsp;One of them was a Hotmail account from years ago that Microsoft converted to an Outlook.com account and the second one was set up when I got my new Windows 8 computer and when I set up my new computer I put in
 my pop mail e mail address and password, which I now realize was a mistake but I have not figured out how to correct that problem either. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried logging onto their chat so I could get some clarification, but I just waited and waited and never got connected to a chat technician. &nbsp; Microsoft really needs to clean up their customer (non) service,</div>

            Hi,  KarolynSnowsill 
<br />
<br />My name is Phillip and I am an Independent Advisor. I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />Perform the procedure to repair the system files:
<br />Follow these instructions: press the Windows + X keys and select Command Prompt (Administrator) or Windows PowerShell (Administrator), in the window that will open, you must type the commands in their respective order:
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />• DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•  sfc /scannow 
<br />
<br />Each of these actions can take a few minutes, so it is important to execute one at a time. When finished, you must restart the PC.
<br />

            Hello KarolynSnowsill,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Please try these suggestions:
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows + R and type %localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows in Run, click OK.
<br />
<br />2. In Windows folder so open now, scroll down and look for UsrClass.dat file. Rename it to UsrClass.old.dat.
<br />
<br />3. Reboot your system and see if this resolves the issue.
<br />
<br />If issue still persists, refer FIX 2 mentioned here:

    <title>Windows Update Error with a Red Circle with White X in it - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Update Error with a Red Circle with White X in it</h2>
                    <p>When checking for Windows Update I received an error with a Red Circle with White X in it - I kept trying again to check for updates and it wouldn't. So I rebooted, when I went to Windows Update it listed:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most Recent Check for Updates: Never</p>
<p>Updates were installed: Never</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I tried checking for updates again and it checked and said; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows is up to date</p>
<p>There are no updates availabe for your computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most Recent Check for Updates: (Listed today's date and time)</p>
<p>Updates were installed: Never</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I noticed my complete Windows Update History is BLANK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had this happen about a year ago I think it was. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does "history" get so full that it has to reset itself or what? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the craziest thing I've ever seen. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p>Open Windows update troubleshooter and check if you are able install Windows update. Follow the steps in the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>If the above step fails, perform a system restore from winre mode to a time when everything was working fine. Follow the steps in the link:</p>

            <p>Once I rebooted it was fine. It checks for updates and I have the green banner with the check mark. It's just that now my history of any updates is gone! And it says; "updates were installed; NEVER"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said it happene once before maybe about a year ago - and it's been running fine and updating regularly since. It seems to be fine now. I just wondered if the history ever clears itself when the list gets real full???
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it seems to be working just fine now! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wondered if this is a normal thing, if anyone has had this happen to them in the past or am I unique?</p>

<p>Good to know that the issue has been resolved.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Let us know if you face any issues with Windows in future. History should not get cleared automatically. However, this may happen due to any of the reasons:</p>
<p>Infection</p>
<p>Dis-association of registry link.</p>
<span>Corruption in windows update log.</span>

<p>For those of you about to say OMG it looks like xxxxx on 360 they copied it, no they didn't Tribes is one of the long running FPS series from the PC market , now imagine how awesome it would be if this could make it onto 360, believe it or not Tribes 2 still
 has players on servers for it even now and as the console market seems to have decided COD is god among FPS games I think its time that notion was challanged on consoles.</p>

<p>What specific device do you have?<br />

Have you tried downloading an updated driver from the manufacturer?</p>
<p>When you get a "platform error", it makes me suspect that you might be running a 64-bit version of Windows 7, while you had a 32-bit version of Windows XP.&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp; If not, can you provide more details on the error message you're getting when you
 try to install the driver?</p>

                    <p>Shortly after changing Internet providers, I would get the "DPC Watchdog Violation" whenever I connect to my WiFi.&nbsp; It took me a while to realize it was the WiFi causing the error, since Ethernet browsing works just fine.&nbsp; I used to use WiFi all the time
 before but not anymore.&nbsp; WiFi did, however work with the new Internet provider for a brief time until the Watchdog error started showing up.&nbsp; Basically I can browse for about 30 seconds to 2 minutes before my computer crashes on while using WiFi.</p>

<br />If possible use a wired connection to the router while you do this. 
<br />
<br />First thing I would do is update or re-install the latest available WiFi driver. Check both the System/Motherboard Maker and the actual device makers' sites (such as Intel, Realtek, or Marvel).
<br />
<br />====
<br />
<br />if that does not help :
<br />
<br />Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS, chipset drivers, and major drivers. That error can also be caused by incompatible 3rd party antivirus and other startup programs and drivers. Of course, there are other possibilities.

<br />We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the OneDrive or other file sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps copy them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there.

<br />
<br />This is my generic how to for proper driver updates : 
<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and BIOS and chipset drivers).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab -  write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device  Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers  particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />
<br />____
<br />
<br />After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run 
<br />DriverVerifier.

<h2>            Shadow of Mordor achievement bug</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having trouble unlocking the "The White Wizard" achievement. It is a main story Secret Achievement, supposed to be unlocked as I finished one of the main quests and watched one of the cutscenes. However, I already played through the whole game twice
 and already got all other story achievements, even the ones that should come after this one I didn't get.</p>

<p>I've already gone through all the troubleshooting on the Xbox website and already searched a lot through the internet, I also already talked to Warner Support and Xbox Support and they sent me here. I'm hoping for an actual solution for this clearly technical
 issue because I didn't unlock an "unskippable" story achievement that I 'completed' twice already.</p>

<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>Thats no good, I love my achievements... as you might tell from my GS :P... so I can understand the frustration! I've not seen anything to say that this is a bugged achievement, as usually the achievement websites like TrueAchievements are full of these
 kind of reports, so it is strange.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if you've seen this thread already, but this has all the steps needed to try and sort this problem:

<h2>            &#91;Windows7&#93; Unable to change Switch from Public to Home network for Homegroup.</h2>
                    <p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3994b0d4-1015-4b11-ab48-ea6c68c46b4a" /></p>
<p>This is the setup I have. All three Windows 7 Desktops are connected by a switch. One of the Desktop has two lan cards. Other lan card connected to a wired router for internet connection as shown in the picture.</p>
<p>Now I am unable to connect all three PC through the switch via homegroup. A homegroup requires everyone to be on the Home Network. But here in Network Settings I am unable to change them to HOME network and they keep showing as Public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried disabling the network drivers from the Device Manager and assigning them as home network. It worked. But when after opening the PC's and switch again after shutting them , they are again back to public network. So I have to do the same exercise again
 and again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way that by default Local Area Connection for Switch comes as a Home network by default.</p>

            Hi Matthew.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It's safer to set it as Public like in a coffee shop or at school to keep anyone from intruding.  At home to share files, printers or other devices you can set it to Private.
<br />
<br />These settings are reached by clicking the Network icon in System tray, choose the connected network, then Properties.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            The last clip that I saved to my PC from windows live movie maker doesn&#39;t open immediately</h2>
                    <p>I used Windows live movie maker several times, even when saving clips from my android phone to my PC in the same format, MP 4.&nbsp; Whenever I wanted to play those clips I would just</p>
<p>click on it and a window would open up and it would automatically begin to play.&nbsp; This last clip that I saved to my PC from windows live movie maker doesn't open immediately, but instead goes into windows live movie maker and reloads the clip, which takes
 about 30 minutes, before it will start playing.&nbsp; Is there something I need to do to avoid this reloading?</p>

            <p>You've apparently associated the .mp4 extension with opening up Movie Maker for editing.&nbsp; It sounds like you'd rather have it just immediately playback your .mp4 file in a media program.&nbsp; All you need to do is right-click on an .mp4 file and choose 'Open
 With'.&nbsp; Choose Windows Media Player, VLC, or whatever media program is your choice and then make it the default for the .mp4 extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the preparation time in Movie Maker, you can go to File &gt; Options and there is a setting to tell Movie Maker to skip the preparing step.&nbsp; That's assuming you *do* want to edit the clip and not just play it back.&nbsp;

</p><p>I'm running Windows 10. Start a call... call drops at 16 secs. Echo test the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I've been trying to fix this and have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalled and reinstalled skype</p>
<p>Checked Bandwidth is fine - it all used to run</p>
<p>Checked firewall settings and antivirus settings</p>
<p>Looked at router privacy settings</p>
<p>Renamed / deleted skype appdata folder etc. etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I have basically done everything that anyone anywhere has suggested in response to this issue that clearly LOADS AND LOADS OF SKYPE users (I use the term users advisedly, as at the moment I can't use Skype).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any one have any idea when Microsoft are going to FIX this issue that is clearly affecting a lot of people!</p>

                    <p><strong>My playlists under "Your Music"on Spotify for xbox one will no longer play directly on xbox one although albums and suggested music from Spotify play just fine.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even more strange is that the playlists will play on xbox one if initiated through my pc.&nbsp; Click on a playlist on my PC and it immediately initiates the tunes on my xbox one TV&nbsp;screen.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have talked to both xbox support and Spotify but they were unable to resolve the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have uninstalled app on my xbox, reset the xbox and reinstalled the Spotify App.&nbsp; Same issue remains.&nbsp; Would sure appreciate it if anyone could help resolve this issue.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Thanks</p>

            I tried the hard reset, and it made no difference at all. It would be hard to expect that to matter, but I tried it anyway, as I'm having the same issue. It appears to be a problem with the app.

It's a great option for playing music while you game. This problem is new, but it's a pretty big one, and I'm sure it will be fixed. My other biggest issue with it was only finding one of my playlists when searching from a friend's logged in account. That was
 frustrating not seeing all your content in the search results. Still, a nice option for Xbox which I hope only gets better.

<h2>            Microsoft Jigsaw won&#39;t let me log in</h2>
                    <p>I used this game on my Surface 3 when it had Windows 8.1. It worked fine. I now have Windows10. The game worked fine for awhile (even though it didn't show the different puzzle groups I'd already earned). Now it won't let me log in. I get error 0x80080300.
 Help.</p>
