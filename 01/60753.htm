            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thanks for posting the question:</div>
<div><br />
<div>It looks like you get a message to install a dll file, try these steps and check:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also answer these questions which would help us to provide a better solution:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. By opening what applications do you get this error?</div>
<div>2. Were there any changes made to the computer prior the issue?</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Method 1:</b></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>The location of the file is under this path C:\Windows\System32\wow64cpu.dll check if the file exists:</span><br />
<div><br />
<span>Manually register the dependent .dll files for this error and see if this resolves the issue.</span><br />
<br />
<span>To do this,&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>a. Press the "Wn key + x" .</span></div>
<div><span>b. Select Command Prompt(Admin) from the list.</span></div>
<div><span>c.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;Type regsvr32 /s wow64cpu.dll in the command prompt and hit enter.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span><b>Method 2:</b></span></div>
<div>If that doesn’t work, I would suggest you to perform System File to fix the corrupted system file and then check if this fixes the issue.</div>
<div>
<p>Follow the steps:</p>
<p>a.<span>&nbsp;</span>Press “Windows Key + C” to open Charms Bar.</p>
<p><span>b.<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Type “cmd” without quotes in the search box.</span></p>
<p><span>c.<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>On the left pane, right click on the “cmd” option and select “Run as Administrator”.</span></p>
<p><span>d.<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Type ‘<b>sfc /scannow</b>’ without quotes and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><b>Note: </b>It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p>Start the computer in Safe mode with Networking and check how it works. Follow these steps to start the computer to safe mode.</p>
<p>a. Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</p>
<p><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c. </span>lick the ‘Boot’ tab.</p>
<p><span>d. U</span>nder ‘Boot Options’, select the ‘Safe Boot’ option.</p>
<p><span>e. </span>Choose “Network” option below the Safe boot check box:</p>
<p>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click OK and then restart your PC.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Method 4:</b></p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Follow these steps to place your computer in clean boot state.</p>
<p>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Press “Windows key + R” then type “msconfig” without quotes and press ENTER.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
</p>
<p>b.<span>&nbsp;</span>On the ‘General’ tab, click ‘Selective Startup’.</p>
<p>c.<span>&nbsp;</span>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the ‘Load Startup Items’ check box.</p>
<p>d.<span>&nbsp;</span>Click the ‘Services tab’, click to select the ‘Hide All Microsoft Services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable All’.</p>
<p>e.<span>&nbsp;</span>Click ‘Apply’ and ‘OK’.</p>
<p>f.<span>&nbsp;</span>When you are prompted, click ‘Restart’.</p>
<p>g.<span>&nbsp;</span>After the computer starts check how it works.</p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> You need to restart the computer to a normal mode once you have finished troubleshooting. To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<p>a.<span>&nbsp;</span>Press ‘Windows key + R’ and then type “msconfig” without quotes and press ENTER.</p>
<p>b.<span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
</p>
<p>c.<span>&nbsp;</span>Select ‘Normal Startup’.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;Click ‘Apply’ and ‘OK’.</p>
<p>e.<span>&nbsp;</span>When you are prompted, click ‘Restart’.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. If you have further questions feel free to reply and we will be glad to assist.</p>

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>Thanks for the hints. </p>
<p>None of the above helped. Though, #2 did not help as UI had no installation disk &gt; downloaded originally Win8 update to my OEM pre-installed Win7 from web wthout a installation disk.
</p>
<p>What helped: my friend sent me copy of the same file fom his win8-64bit version. I copied it to windows32 folder. Now all is back to normal.

            Greetings, Stardust2000,<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with Bindu R's answer, but I have some additional tips that may be of help to you.<br />
<br />
Are you wanting to put the photos in chronological order?&nbsp; If so, you might want to consider renaming each photo by the date and time it was taken in the format "YYMMDD_HHMM".&nbsp; e.g. In that format, a photo taken right now would be named 091219_1722 (here in
 the mountain time zone).&nbsp; Named that way, assuming your folder is set to "Auto Arrange" or "Sort by Name" (drop-down menu for "View"), your photos will be sorted chronologically, making it easier to find specific photos in your collection (hopefully, LOL!).&nbsp;
 You could do the same thing after they are moved to a different folder, if necessary.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, in the drop-down menu for "View", click "Choose Details...", then check "Date Created".&nbsp; Then, when viewing the files in "Detail" mode (rather than thumbnails), by clicking the "Date Created" at the top of that column they will be sorted by date
 and time created.<br />
<br />
If you are NOT attempting to arrange them chronologically, but would still like to have the ability to sort them "automatically" in a different folder, you could add a letter to the beginning of each filename, beginning with "a" for the first photo you want
 listed, "b" for the second, etc. (without the quotation marks, of course)<br />
<br />
Here's a hypothetical example of that:<br />
<br />
You have 50 photos , and they all have filenames such as beach1.jpg, beach2.jpg, beach3.jpg, ............beach10.jpg, beach11.jpg etc.&nbsp; Because of the way your computer "reads" filenames, if you organize them by name, they will be in this order:<br />
beach1, beach10, beach11............ beach2, beach21..........<br />
<br />
Now let's say you want them in THIS order:<br />
<br />
beach35, beach 50, beach22<br />
<br />
Put your letters before the "beach"..... For example:<br />
<br />
abeach35, bbeach50, cbeach22, then click View&gt;Sort by&gt;Name<br />
<br />
You can also leave a space between them (to make the filenames easier to read) if you like:<br />
<br />
a beach35, b beach50, c beach22<br />
<br />
Lastly, you have 50 photos, so you will obviously run out of letters after the first 26 photos, so when you get to the 26th photo, z beach39, add another letter:<br />
<br />
za beach, zb beach, zc beach, etc.<br />
<br />
There are other many other possible protocols, but hopefully you catch the gist, and I hope I have made that explanation comprehensible.<br />
<br />
Please post back and let us know if that helped!<br />
<br />
Bob

<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You will have to make the changes after you copy the pictures to another folder because the files get transferred in the same way it

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had the similar problem after upgrading 4 computers (which were already registered on a Homegroup) with Windows 7, 8 &amp; 8.1 to Windows 10;&nbsp;we all lost the access to the&nbsp;Homegroup that we were a member before upgrading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took&nbsp;me about 6 hours on the phone with Microsoft Support Team and with the help and advice from 3 different&nbsp;Technical Advisors, I managed to fix the problem with the suggestion I received from the 3rd one; so I thought of sharing this solution as it
 may work for the others as well:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Shut down all the computers that are connected to the router on your network.</li><li>Switch off the router and wait for 10 seconds</li><li>Switch on the router and make sure there are no computers switched on and connected to it</li><li>Switch on&nbsp;your&nbsp;first computer and let it come up and connect to the router</li><li>Go to your File Explorer, where you will see the Homegroup icon</li><li>Click on the Homegroup icon and in the page, you should see "Create a Homegroup"</li><li>Click on that and create a new Homegroup, where you will be given the new Password</li><li>Turn on the second computer and repeat step 4 &amp; 5&nbsp;and when you click on the Homegroup, it will show "Join a Homegroup". You should be able to add this computer to the new Homegroup with the password you've just got from the first computer.</li><li>Repeat this procedure for the&nbsp;other computers one-by-one</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck!!</p>

<p>Para saber si estas frente a una estafa obvio primero ver dos cosas:</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Que tu vendedor no sea usario nuevo y si lo es que no te venda algo caro (por si pierdes tu dinero hahaha).</p>
<p>Despues que lo que te venda sea logico, nada de algo de $8000 te lo este vendiendo en $7000 y hasta con envio y todo incluido hahahaah eso es una mamadaaaaa....</p>
<p>-</p>

<div><span>Hello,</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I have Windows 7.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>My PC has been infected by a Trojan Zbot. When clicking on a google search result link, an ad popped up in a new window. My antivirus then deleted a Trojan file named "verison.dll" (appdata\roaming\verison.dll). But, now my computer is slow
 and Internet Explorer doesn't work normally. Malwarebytes says it dorsn't detect anything but I' afraid verison.dll could have installed a lot of other trojans.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I found a suspicious file and wanted to delete it but it wouldn't allow to (said it was running), it is :</span></div>
<div><span>C:\\Users\AppData\Local\microsoft\Windows\Caches\&nbsp;AFBF9F1A-8EE8-AF34-C647E37CA0d9}. 1ver0x00000000000008a1.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Is that file a normal file of the Windows 7 system? Do all Windows 7 PCs have that file ?</span></div>
<div><span>(Because if it isn't then I would know it's a malware).</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Internet Explorer doesn't work now, it changed language and IE could be infected as well. But uninstalling is impossible : no uninstall exe icon in the folders). I thought it would be possible to uninstall Internet Explorer
 whenever you had a problem with it to install it again ?</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

    <title>How can I use my OEM Widows 8.1 &#34;System Image&#34; to format a new - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael&#35;tweet  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I use my OEM Widows 8.1 &#34;System Image&#34; to format a new blank hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I created a "System Image" by going thru &nbsp; Control Panel &gt; File History &gt; System Image Backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saved this Windows 8.1 Drive C: &nbsp;"System Image" to an external hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is if Drive C: does fail, how do I use this "System Image" to format or restore the system image to a new blank hard drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The existing internal hard drive has been giving hard drive failure notifications. The diagnostic tool "Crystal Disk Info 6.5.2" has shown a problem with Reallocated Sectors Count. The minimum count should be 36, my desktop HDD shows 2. &nbsp;I have ordered and
 a new internal HDD is on its way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh yeah, the external hard drive is a Toshiba - which included a built in program called "NTI Backup" which might reinstall everything on a new blank HDD based on online research. NTI Backup was run and everything on C: drive was copied to the Toshiba external
 drive. (The System Image was done separately).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the NTI Backup does not restore the OS to the new HDD, I think my best bet is to use the free clone program recommended by Seagate called "Clonezilla".</p>
<p>
</p><p>A recovery USB drive was created the first day the computer was used (not sure that will do anything on a bland new HDD).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>****EDIT**** &nbsp;A solution has been found to my problem, read on if you are interested. &nbsp;****EDIT****</strong></p>

            <p>Hi Isha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I should have posted that I tried ( CHKDSK C: /R ) in Command Prompt (Admin). It did not find any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also downloaded SEATOOLS for Windows, which is a diagnostic tool from Seagate and it also found no problems with my (Seagate) C: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I was continuing to get "drive failure notifications" I did some online research and found "Crystal Disk Info" diagnostic tool. IT IS THE ONLY TOOL TO FIND ANY PROBLEM.</p>
<p>I still do not understand why my Windows 8.1 system warned of a possible failure but CHKDSK could not find a problem (Don't answer this it's not a question).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Reading Sharief K's post it seems to be about RESTORE AND REFRESH not replacing a HDD. At no time does he even mention replacing the HDD.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here is where I start a few questions for you (or anyone). From your&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>&nbsp;Sharief K link - He refers to an "installation disk" or "system repair disk".
</strong>I do not have an "installation disk" as my Windows 8.1 was an OEM install. I am confused by the "system repair disk" did a Google search and it referred me to a WINDOWS 7 page.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://http//windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/create-a-system-repair-disc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/create-a-system-repair-disc</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Then I search for - system repair disk for Windows 8.1 which took me to these two pages.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://http//windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/system-recovery-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/system-recovery-overview</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://http//windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To me the description on the Windows 8.1 pages is of a USB RECOVERY DRIVE and that could be exactly what I need.<strong>&nbsp;Sharief K stated "system repair disk" not "usb recovery drive"</strong>. Maybe
 he is not up to date on Windows 8.1 descriptions? Anyway as<strong>&nbsp;I stated in my first post a&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>recovery USB drive was created the first day the computer was used.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Moving along here is the problem I see - When my new HDD arrives if I remove Drive C: then insert a new blank HDD - IT HAS NO OPERATING SYSTEM.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;If I insert a USB RECOVERY DRIVE or a SYSTEM REPAIR
 DISK there is no program or operating system to even recognize SOMETHING HAS BEEN INSERTED.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I already have a SYSTEM IMAGE on the EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE. My thought is that I might need to set my system to boot from the EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE then transfer my SYSTEM IMAGE and back up files to DRIVE
 C.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another possibility is my computer might be pre-wired for an expansion HDD, then I could leave DRIVE C as it is, and add the new HDD as internal DRIVE D.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Then I could take a new SYSTEM IMAGE insert it to DRIVE D and back up everything on DRIVE C to DRIVE D. After that I could remove DRIVE C and insert DRIVE D into the open slot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Hope I don't sound crazy.</strong>&nbsp;The computer with the hard drive problem belongs to my mother. When she has a problem she calls me. If my computer failed I have everything backed up on my external
 hard drive, I would just buy a new computer. (This one is getting old anyway).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Replacing a hard drive is something I have never had to do. I feel there should be some advantage to the fact&nbsp;</strong><strong>that the hard drive being replaced has not failed yet.</strong></span></p>

            Why do you think your HD is failing if all indications (that you've shared) are that it's OK?&nbsp; I've used Acronis True Image (not free) for seven or eight years and have used the cloning function as part of my regular backup routine.&nbsp; It's worked every
 time.

<p>
</p><p>You need Media to work from to restore your image onto a blank HD, as you have not done a complete PC backup using 3rd party tools where you create a boot disk to use to&nbsp;restore the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If necessary install the barebones 8.1 or use the Startup Repair options&nbsp;&gt; then restore your Image over it/using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>_____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cloning software works by cloning your existing Hard Drive &gt; saving that to external Media &gt; then you boot from the cloning program's disk you made &gt; restore image</p>
<p>But if the presently install OS is corrupted the image will be corrupted too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a list of Program's for you to look through.</p>

            <p>Hello Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I was not clear with the "Crystal Disk Info" BAD HEALTH &nbsp;results. I edited my post above to change that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my mothers computer and it has had several very slow &nbsp;performance issues. Browsers not wanting to start, usually I would run Ccleaner to remove cache and cookies, then the browsers started. This has not worked recently, only multiple restarts seem
 to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And here is a link to a result with very similar "Reallocated Sectors Count" to mom's. Her threshold is 36, with current and worst 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The link has a threshold of 36, with current and worst 1.</p>

Thanks for the reply and recommendation.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Acronis True Image is $49.95 for one computer, there is a trial version but Clone Disk is disabled.</span><br />

    <title>Windows 7 automatically installing wrong driver, even after changing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> helenvaskevitch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 automatically installing wrong driver, even after changing settings</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 home premium. &nbsp;For some reason, starting today, my computer automatically installed a different driver for my audio interface (recording gear), even though I already had the correct driver installed and everything was working just fine.
 &nbsp;Now, every time I plug in the interface, it installs this different driver, and it's not the correct driver. &nbsp;I can't get it to install the correct driver that was previously installed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2500967</p>
<p>doesn't work, even with the settings changed, windows STILL automatically installs the incorrect driver, over and over again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do??? I did a complete uninstall, changed the device settings, and did a clean install of the correct driver, and when I plugged in my interface windows STILL installed the incorrect driver over top of my correct driver. &nbsp;Please Help.</p>

            <p>Did you rollback the driver, reboot, run a manual check for updates and hide the unwanted driver update before Automatic Updates got around to installing it again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip: Obtain any driver updates your computer <em>really </em>needs from the device or computer manufacturer's download page only,
<em>NEVER </em>via Windows Update (i.e., hide any driver updates offered via Windows Update or configure your system so that driver updates are never offered or installed via Windows Update).</p>

<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I would also suggest you to run the System update readiness command. It detects incorrect manifests, cabinets or registry data, it may replace the incorrect data with corrected version
 available. Follow the steps.</span></span></span></p>

    <title>Cannot go past login screen after entering password - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot go past login screen after entering password</h2>
                    <p>Original title: I've had enough with Windows 8.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've honestly done. Half a year of troubleshooting an OS. Honestly, I've had black screens, computer not turning on, BSOD's, apps not working, Control Panel glitching, and to top it all off, today, it won't let me log in. I enter my password, the 'Welcome'
 circle spins twice, than it shows 'Logging Out' and I'm kicked back to the login screen. This repeats infinitely. Safe Mode works. But in safe mode, many of the basic troubleshooting stuff do not work because it's safe mode and I'm not a Windows Expert. I
 want to reset my PC. But I can't, because the upgrade to 8.1 got rid of the recovery partition! I thought that before you release an OS, you test again and again to make sure bugs don't happen! Obviously, they still happen, but they shouldn't happen to the
 point that I can't even log in! All the tips are everything that I've tried. So, Microsoft, you tell me, what do I do now? Buy a new Windows 8.1 Pro K? If you want more details so that you can help me as best as possible, I'll tell you my problems: every single
 problem reported by everyone who's ever used Windows 8.1. So look at all the different problems, combine them, and that's what I've got.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do you get any error message when you type the password and it fails to login?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue may happen due to some third party software conflicts. </p>

<p>Place the computer in clean boot from safe mode and then login to normal mode and check if it works.

            Yeah, I've went in to safe mode and changed the dll files and stuff, and now it works. But I still have a very annoying problem. So here's how it happens.
<div>1. I log in.</div>
<div>2. C:\Windows Activation Technologies changes the windows.ui.immersive.dll file in the system32 folder to the file that's ALREADY IN THE FOLDER. (Original file's date of creation: 2013/11/14; the file that the WAT folder changes it to is: 2013/11/14)&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. The computer tries to log out.&nbsp;</div>
<div>4. It says something like it cannot log off due to some applications.</div>
<div>5. I immediately press cancel.</div>
<div>6. NOTHING HAS HAPPENED!! (I mean that even after cancelling the log off, nothing has changed and everything is still okay)</div>
<div>So how can I prevent the WAT folder from changing the files in the system32 folder, causing Windows to log out??</div>

<p>To export the extended information as shown in folder view, you have these options:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Write a Vbscript that can query the extended information for all files in a folder. Here is a sample..it gets most/all extended properties available for a file. &nbsp;<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/7b76c4da-6ab3-4201-a466-7ef539982ee9/to-get-the-specific-extended-file-properties-of-an-exe-file-by-vbscript-?forum=ITCG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">To
 get the specific extended file properties of an .exe file by VBScript ?</a>&nbsp;With a little modification of the code, you can output to text file as .csv, or tab-delimited format and import into Excel if necessary. There are also similar examples in Microsoft's
 excellent Scripting Guy column that one may check out if interested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2,. Or use Nirsoft's SysExporter to "grab" the listings from a window. Use the examples here.</p>

</p><p>And I just tested, SysExporter works perfectly fine in Windows 10.</p>

            <p>had you said time instead of length it would have been clear.&nbsp; Nor did you say they were MP4 files hence the question.</p>

<h2>            Server 2012 R2 Updates Repeatedly Install and Corrupt Component Store</h2>
                    Hi, I have a server 2012 R2 in production that keeps "successfully" installing the same updates. I've reset Windows update databases, and still the same, when I run a DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth I get the following error: The restore operation
 failed. Either the repair source was not found or the component store cannot be repaired.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Can anyone help? My DISM log is below:<br />

            Hi Hitesh
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />

<br />
<br />For 100% disk usage - Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />A. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />

<br />
<br />B. Run SFC/DISM

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />FIX : Windows 10 100 Percent Disk Usage Problem
<br />
<br />1. Press  W8K + R and type devmgmt.msc in the Run, hit Enter key to open Device Manager snap-in.
<br />
<br />2. In the Device Manager window, expand IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers and right click on Standard SATA AHCI Controller, select Properties.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />3. In the property sheet, switch to Driver tab and click Driver Details.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />4. If the Driver File Details window shows storahci.sys driver listed there, it means you’re running inbox driver and hence it is possible to disable MSI mode. Click OK.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />5. Back on the property sheet, switch to Details tab. Against Property, select Device instance path from drop-down and note down the Value mentioned there.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Registry Disclaimer: The further steps will involve registry manipulation. Making mistakes while manipulating registry could affect your system adversely. So be careful while editing registry entries and create a System Restore point first.
<br />
<br />6. Press W8K + R and put regedit in Run dialog box to open Registry Editor (if you’re not familiar with Registry Editor, then click here). Click OK.
<br />
<br />7. In the Registry Editor window, navigate to following registry key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\PCI\&lt;AHCI Controller Value&gt;\Device Parameters\Interrupt Management\MessageSignaledInterruptProperties
<br />
<br />*Substitute &lt;AHCI Controller Value&gt; we got in step 5.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />8. In the right pane of MessageSignaledInterruptProperties key, look for the registry DWORD (REG_DWORD) named MSISupported which should be corresponding to Value 1 as its Data. Double click on the DWORD to modify its value:
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />9. Finally, set the Value data as 0 and click OK. Close Registry Editor and reboot. After restarting your machine, the 100% disk usage problem should disappear.

            Hello
<br />
<br />Retrieving your Windows product key depends on where you got your copy of Windows.
<br />
<br />Choose the correct solution that pertains to your situation below:
<br />
<br />1. From an authorized retailer. The product key is on a label or card inside the box that Windows came in. For more info, contact your hardware manufacturer. 
<br />
<br />2. A new PC running Windows. The product key is pre-installed on your PC, included with the packaging the PC came in or included on the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) attached to the PC. For more info, contact your hardware manufacturer.
<br /> 
<br />3. A digital copy from a Microsoft website. The product key is in the confirmation email you received after buying your digital copy of Windows. If you bought Windows 10, you'll receive a digital license instead of a product key. You can use the digital license for activation. For more info, see Activation in Windows 10 (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12440</a>) or contact Microsoft Support here <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/</a>. 
<br />
<br />4. Free upgrade to Windows 10. If you upgraded to Windows 10 for free from Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, you should have a digital license instead of a product key. For more info about digital licenses in Windows 10, see Activation in Windows 10 (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12440</a>) or contact Microsoft Support here <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/</a>.

            Hi Palak.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If Windows came preinstalled on a brand name PC then the Key is embedded in the UEFI chip on motherboard and should reactivate itself - just skip the key during install.  If you ever need to find it install ProducKey:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a> and look in the list for BIOS-OEM key.
<br />
<br />I you purchased it from a builder they need to have provided you with a retail COA sticker with Product Key in order to legally resell Windows.  
<br />
<br />In any case most keys convert to Digital LIcenses so confirm this first in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation at the top under Status and Edition.  Once you have a Digital License you don't need a key any longer as it phones home to Microsoft, which recognizes the hardware and reactivates.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            With Windows 10 you get a digital license where your activation information is stored on MS servers. As soon as you do a clean install, Windows would automatically activate when it connects to the Internet, for the first time-provided you install the same version as was installed before. If you are asked for a key, skip it.

            Hi Palak, have you thought about resetting Windows, that would have the same result as a clean install, but would allow you to keep your files . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from 8.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My 8.1 was activated and a genuine version. But , after upgrading to Windows 10 , I am facing a lot of problems. So I want to factory reset the laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is , will the process ask for a key or will it activate Windows 8.1 automatically?&nbsp;</p>
