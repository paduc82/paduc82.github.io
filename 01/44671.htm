<h2>            Windows 10 Activation not showing up after new motherboard change.</h2>
                    <p>My windows is tied to my e-mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have changed motherboards multiple times and have been told by reps that I don't need to extract keys from MOBO's before as it is tied to my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently changed platform to socket 1151.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During installation I usually wipe my SSD prior to installing the MOBO so it is completely fresh. This time I needed to transfer some files, so I booted the new driver (with the wrong chip set drivers) in my new mobo and then reset and formatted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I now go to troubleshoot activate windows and check "recently changed hardware" it only lists my previous motherboards, not my new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted support but he wasn't helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have the original key as it has rubbed off the case as it is years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I proceed? I'm not going to buy a new windows licence for the sake of removing a watermark.</p>

            Hi John
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new Motherboard or PC, if it is OEM it will not . .. 
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 a Retail licence?

<p>I bought the PC second hand, but have upgraded the Mobo numerous times so it&nbsp;<em>must</em> be retail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never had an issue until this MOBO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that because I usually format before it might sitll think this PC Is the old MOBO. Don't know how to fix that.</p>

            Hi, <br />
Digital license is valid only for unchanged hardware and need to be renewed by ordinary activation with product key after motherboard replacement.
<br />
So sorry but you need either to recall the product key or to buy new license. <br />
BTW if you key was written on sicker on computer case this was OEM version and you have no rights to use it after motherboard replacement unfortunately regardless was activation successful or not.

<p>But I already told you I have changed motherboard numerous times, without having to type a key or otherwise which suggests it was retail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it obviously isn't OEM.</p>

            Retail version has a sticker with product key in box not at case. And it should not be attached to computer case.
<br />Product key sticker on case says this is either OEM license or some type of corporate license not available for home user.
<br />Successful activation means nothing, sorry. Now Microsoft directly says this in EULA: Successful activation does not confirm that the software is genuine or properly licensed.

            hello,
<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />If your licence was linked to Microsoft account,
<br />you just have to perform a clean install and connect with this account and your W10  will be activated via path exception

            No, numerous re-activation does not confirm this is retail version unfortunately.
<br />To give you reasonable advice I have to know how did you obtained this license, sorry. Genuine copy does not necessarily mean this copy properly licensed. 
<br />P.S. Windows license cannot be tied to e-mail or Microsoft account. It is digital license tied, and digital license is not a license at all and is just an activation method.

            In addition, Microsoft provides an exception path for transferring a Windows License after a hardware change. You’ll need to be signed in to the same Microsoft account before making the hardware change and to use the exception path.  
<br />To access this exception path, select the Start  button &gt; Settings  &gt; Update &amp; Security  &gt; Activation , and then select Troubleshoot. If the troubleshooter can’t resolve the issue, you’ll see a link to reactivate after a hardware change. Select it to follow this path. For more info, see Reactivating Windows 10 after a hardware change.

<h2>            Reset Xbox One Network settings location</h2>
                    
<p>Is there a way to push one button to reset the network settings to default? Changing the IP/DNS settings from Manual to Automatic is not a solution. Especially when I catch the DNS settings option messing up and not offering the automatic/manual selection.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no option for that. Only solution to have them resetted totally is a factory reset, but this will also require a new installation of all your games.
</p>
<p>Usually changing the network settings back to automatic should work. </p>
<p>So what exactly is the problem you are experiencing? </p>

<p>I have a sprint device called the Sprint Airwave+ Model: HubBub C1-600-RT. This device is for broadcasting a Sprint signal using my Internet. The device recommends being in between the modem and router. Well this creates problems for the Xbox one not surprisingly.</p>
<p>I did various things to resolve the issue and open up the NAT. Opening up ports, creating DHCP reservations and then assigning static IP's and DNS addresses. Seemed to work with some success.</p>
<p>For my situation I did find a better solution though. Instead of having the Sprint device go in between the modem and router, which basically creates a double NAT situation and screws with the xbox's. I went ahead and connected the Sprint device through
 the Linksys router, then in the Linksys settings, I put the Sprint device into a DMZ so that it got a free pass to the Internet.</p>
<p>This is where my problems with resetting the Xbox one network settings started, prompting me to make this post.</p>
<p>After I did that, I had to change the Xbox one network settings back to default, but it was not behaving properly. DNS didn't have options to switch to either Automatic or Manual, IP settings were just not sticking when I switched to Auto. After power cycling
 the Xbox one twice (pulling power cable out and everything), the network settings finally reverted back to what they should have been, and DNS finally gave me the option to switch to automatic.</p>
<p>Resetting the entire Xbox one back to defaults just to troubleshoot a network issue is complete over kill and a waste of time, you can't even pull the HDD out for cying out loud so your data doesn't get wiped out... and I hope the Xbox team brings over the
 option to reset a network to defaults. Switching from Manual to Automatic is not doing the trick for some reason, I get that it should, but it doesn't work 100% of the time.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply though, all is good for me, just wish I had the reset network settings to default function available.</p>

<h2>            Unable to start, reset, or restore</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated from windows 7 to windows 10 and was doing all the new windows updates that go along with the new operating system. While doing that my computer completely froze and was unable to do anything. I tried to restart it but it refuses to boot.
 So i did a clean boot and pressed f8 until i got to the repair menu. It lists a system restore point i can use but when trying to do that it gives me:</p>
<p>"System Restore failed while mounting the registry from the restore point. An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. (0x80070020)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since i was going updates i tried to use the uninstall updates menu. After trying both quality and features, both failed and recommended I reset. I tried both keep my files, and remove everything; both failed. It wont even let me boot into safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what to do now, my computer seems to be bricked.</p>

            Hi John.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I understand you can't start, System Restore, roll back Updates or Reset Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Unless a PC's hardware has died, software cannot affect it.  You can always reinstall software and usually have a much better install.  What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />If you have files that aren't backed up you can use the same bootable media to try to rescue your files using this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Samsung SF310 Freezes after Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alfromchicago  say:</h3>
<h2>            Samsung SF310 Freezes after Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Somehow my previous thread went "cold" for a few weeks so let's try it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded my Samsung SF310 laptop (pretty much factory configuration with Intel Core I5 480M with 4 GB RAM &amp;&nbsp;320 GB hard drive) to Windows 10 (the upgrade, it said, was successful)&nbsp;after which it&nbsp;never recovers&nbsp;after going into hibernation - really,
 I was never able to even shut it down properly after upgrade - the only way to get to work would be to just&nbsp;hard restart (to add the insult to the injury, I adjusted the settings so the computer never goes into hibernation when on AC power but then it looks
 like the Windows update came in and somehow the power&nbsp;settings got reset back to hibernate so, of course, next day I needed to get something done quick but it was frozen again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade took place December 10, 2015.&nbsp; &nbsp;Before the upgrade this&nbsp;laptop was running Windows 7 Home Premium (and never had any major issues).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have posted the System Summary, the System Log and the Applications Log at&nbsp;http://1drv.ms/1RZvMZd.&nbsp; All logs were taken in normal mode a couple of hours after computer was booted up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This laptop was a "test upgrade" before I upgrade a couple of my other computers but since it didn't seem to go smoothly... I hope&nbsp;that the issue is minor enough so I can understand and fix it relatively easy but, until I know that, I am holding on upgrading
 my other computers.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thank for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't specifically check the drivers but I did run Windows Update and it updated whatever it updated... didn't tell me that any of the updates failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, there are no major problems with performance (in that everything&nbsp;seems to work)&nbsp;right after boot-up and until it goes into hibernation - really, the problem is that it fails to come out of hibernation, not sure that it would be the problem with
 any&nbsp;drivers.</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 Installs but Fails Every Reboot - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Installs but Fails Every Reboot</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently completed a new system build and have tried multiple times to clean install Windows 10. I created a bootable USB from the Media Creation Tool provided by Microsoft - it installs cleanly and runs fine until it requires being shut down, at which
 point I get a variety of boot failure blue screens. System specs are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>AMD Ryzen 5 1500x</p>
<p>GIGABYTE AB350 Gaming 3 motherboard (BIOS F6 as required)</p>
<p>ADATA 8GB 2133 DDR4</p>
<p>MSI GeForce GTX 1060 6GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, the error indicates that the boot files have been corrupted and the files need to be repaired. After booting from the USB again, none of the system repair tools work, nor does doing a system recovery - all fail. I have attempted using the command
 prompt to fix the issue:</p>
<p>bootrec /fixmbr</p>
<p>bootrec /fixboot</p>
<p>bootrec /scanos</p>
<p>bootrec /rebuildbcd</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of which complete, but fail to fix the problem. I have also attempted fixing the problem upon first boot by running an elevated command prompt and:</p>
<p>SFC /scannow</p>
<p>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /scanhealth</p>
<p>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /checkhealth</p>
<p>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /restorehealth</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of which complete. Rerunning SFC /scannow returns no more errors, but when I rebooted and ran the scannow again, more corrupt files were found and the system crashed after the next reboot. Running a chkdsk /f and rebooting only find corrupt system files;
 it repairs them but does not prevent the reboot issues.</p>

            It appears there was an issue with a sector of my hard drive that would corrupt various Windows files and make it unlikely to boot. I returned the SSD after exhausting other possible options and Windows 10 installed and ran fine after the first attempt
 with the new SSD.

<h3> leahm88  say:</h3>
<h2>            External Broadcasting Microphone not working &#40;Win 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've recently bought a 'KitClan Sound Condenser Studio Recording Microphone' for singing but it isn't working with my HP laptop. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It does work when I do not fully plug it in the audio jack but it obviously falls out unless I hold it there (which I cannot do whilst recording!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas of how to fix it? &nbsp;Let me know if you need more info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Hi Leah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your PC?</p>
<p>Does it work with computer with a different operating system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what you can do to fix the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all ensure that it works with Windows 10. Refer the manual or contact your seller</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Install the drivers if it came along otherwise, visit the manufacturer site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the drivers in compatible mode and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on ‘<strong>properties</strong>’.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on the ‘<strong>compatibility</strong>’ tab and check the box ‘<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>’ and select Windows 7/8 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Get back to us for further queries. We are happy to help!</p>

            <p>Hi Joy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is a HP, model r127na. &nbsp;The microphone works with my iphone so I think it is a pc issue not a problem with the mic itself.</p>
<p>I purchased the microphone on Amazon and other people have reviewed it saying they used it with their windows 10 pc's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the PC doesn't recognise it at all, I cannot check the drivers. &nbsp;The microphone is connected via the audio jack and not a USB microphone. &nbsp;I am unsure as to the manufacturer all I know is it is a 'KitClan BM-800' mic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Leah</p>

<h2>            Windows XP Home can &#34;see&#34; only 1 CPU&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I bought a few days ago Windows XP Home SP3 and I was shocked to find out that that they use only 1 CPY from my Dual Core desktop.</p>
<p>Why so? Even after Service Pack 3 Microsoft couldn't make an update for thi issue?</p>

AMD Dual-Core Optimizer</a> was AMD's answer to Microsoft's Multi-Core fix... originally, to get the hotfix, one would have to email Microsoft to get it... screw that. Therefore, AMD released their Optimizer to give the public (with AMD CPUs) a way to utilize
 both cores. If you install the AMD Optimizer and it works without problems, then you would NOT have to install the the WinXP hotfix.</p>

<div>Your subject line says "only 1 CPU," the sentence above says "Dual</div>
<div>Core desktop." Which is correct? Do you have a dual core CPU or two</div>
<div>CPUs? Windows XP Home will use the former, but not the latter.</div>

            1 CPU is not the same as 1 Core. It should use <strong>all of your cores</strong> , as long you only use<strong>1 CPU</strong> .

                    <p>Original Title: &nbsp;Windows Aero and AutoCAD 2012 conflict</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I've got a little Windows Aero/ AutoCAD crash when running it on my laptot (HP pavilion dv7 with Intel Core i7 2670QM, 64 bit Windows 7 and graphic card RADEON HD 6770M) . It is almost impossible to work in a CAD when using Aero theme - some tools are really
 hard to manage.. Is there any fix for Aero provided or do I have to cope with the basic Windows theme?
</p>
<p>Regards, Agata.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span>If Aero is conflicting with Autocad, we have two choices: one is to d</span><span>isable Aero feature and the other one is to&nbsp;c</span><span>ontact Autocad to see if they have any recommendations.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To <strong>disable Aero feature</strong>, follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Right click on the <strong>Desktop</strong> and click <strong>Personalize</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Select the theme " <strong>Windows 7 basic theme</strong>."</span></p>
<p><span>c. Check if issue persists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To contact Autocad, refer to the following link:</span></p>

<h2>            Purble Place messing up my computer&#33;</h2>
                    I have discovered that the problems I am having with my virus scan and backing up my computer have something to do with the game Purble Place.&nbsp; Anytime I try to run my McAfee virus scan or back up my computer on an external drive, the computer freezes
 when it gets to the game called Purble Place.&nbsp; Anyone have any suggestions on how to resolve this?

<p>Is it Windows 7 original game isn't it? I mean you're not working Purble Place on WinXP computer.</p>

<h2>            Skype DISGUSTING update policy</h2>
                    <p>May anyone in Skype development team answer me for 1 question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does Skype stop working after MINOR update?</p>
<p>For example, several days ago I updated Skype to version 8.27 at several computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today Skype stops running at those computers because version 8.28 was releasing.
</p>
<p>So I must login as admin at each of those computers for updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hey, devs, are you real dunderheads or <span>
<span>or just pretending?</span></span></p>

            Hi ВиталийЛукиянчук,
<br />
<br />The new Skype app it is being updated constantly to bring it up to the functionality of Skype 7 . . . 
<br />
<br />In order to improve Skype, please provide feedback to Microsoft regarding any shortcomings or bugs you have found in the new Skype app on this thread
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-128c-40eb-a99b-f3985c925176">https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-1...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are unhappy with the new Skype app, Microsoft have decided to extend the period for which Skype Classic (version 7) will be available, the September deadline, no longer exists
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic:

<p>
</p><p>Can you please confirm what skype version is that?<br />
Will it ask users to update or is the update functionality removed from it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a bit of ridiculous - I am an admin in SME and every day I am getting requests to update Skype for employees who can not launch it because admin access is required - it is a huge waste of time...<br />
<br />
I'm&nbsp;starting to think about switching to google hangouts (our development team already did).</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMHO skype functionality (and UI) is getting worse with each version...</p>

<p>You can roll back to 7.41.0.101, which is the latest classic desktop, and then to stop the update to Version 8 and its annoying update message to the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked after a restart that usually triggers the download of SkypeSetup.exe and the annoying prompt to update.&nbsp; I will report back if the download and popup returns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Find where SkypeSetup.exe downloads to&nbsp;(C:\ Windows\Temp), note the path, and delete SkypeSetup.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Right click on Win 10 Start Menu icon, click on Command Prompt (Admin) or PowerShell (admin), and paste in this command at the prompt. If Win 7 or 8 run Command Prompt as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. At the prompt type - netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=SkypeSetup dir=in action=block program=[Path to where SkypeSetup.exe downloads to like C:\ Windows\Temp] enable=yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example my command was:</p>
<p>netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=SkypeSetup dir=in action=block program=D:\Temporary_System_and_User_Files enable=yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hello <strong>white bull78,</strong></p>
Troubleshoot speed wheel problems
<div><b>The wheel won’t turn on</b>
<p>Make sure the batteries are new AA alkaline or fully charged Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries. See Setup for more information.</p>
<b>Four lights keep flashing on the wheel</b>
<p>When four lights around the Guide button flash followed by alternating flashing, this means the wheel is not connected to the console.</p>
<p>If this is your first time connecting the wheel to your console, refer to the Setup information above.</p>
<p>If you previously connected the wheel to your console, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press and hold the Start or Guide button on the wheel until lights flash. </li><li>The wheel should stop flashing and be assigned a section on the ring of light.
</li></ol>
<p>If the lights flash longer than 15 seconds, try the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the speed wheel closer to the console. </li><li>Make sure the console and speed wheel are at least three feet away from large metal objects, such as file cabinets and refrigerators.
</li><li>Metallic decorations or stickers on the console or speed wheel can interfere with performance. Remove decorations and try connecting again.
</li><li>Make sure the front of the console is positioned in the direction of the racing wheel, and not toward a nearby wall.
</li><li>Cordless phones (2.4 GHz), wireless LANs, wireless video transmitters, microwave ovens, and some cell phones can interfere with the operation of the speed wheel. Try turning these wireless devices off or unplugging them, to see if the wheel will then successfully
 connect to your console. </li></ul>

<br />NOTE: We’re letting you know that support for Skype version 7 will end on Nov?emb?er 1, 2?01?8 on desktop devices and Nov?emb?er 15 on mobile and tablet devices. When support ends, we’ll begin requiring updates to version 8. Although you may be able to use older versions for a little while longer.
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.
