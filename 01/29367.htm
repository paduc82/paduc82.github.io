<h2>            How to find Win7 drivers for Sony Vaio VGC-LT15E</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Sony Vaio VGC-LT15E, which is an all-in-one computer with monitor, webcam, microphone, speakers, and TV tuner all built in.<strong>It came with Vista,</strong> Windows Media Center, and a lot of Sony drivers and software on it.<br />
<br />
I checked windows 7 compatibility and found it was 64-bit compatible. I then installed a new larger/faster hard disk and<strong> installed Windows 7 (64-bit)</strong> clean on the new HDD. The computer runs, but I have three serious problems.<br />
<br />
1. After installing Windows 7, I went to Sony's web site and found this long list of drivers for this model:<br />
<a href="http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-list.pl?mdl=VGCLT15E&amp;LOC=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sony eSupport - VGC-LT15E - Software Updates &amp; Drivers</a><br />
Unfortunately all the drivers are only for Windows vista. No drivers are provided for Win7.</p>
<p>I tried installing these drivers as is - installation did not work.</p>
<p>I tried installing them using Vista compatibility mode - still would not install.</p>
<p>now I'm stuck in this situation, with many "in need of attention" icons in the Device Manager:</p>
<p>1. mass storage controller - yellow triangle with exclamation point in device manager<br />
2. multimedia controller - yellow triangle with exclamation point in device manager<br />
3. the built-in TI flash card reader is not working (perhaps that is one of the above two)<br />
4. the NVIDIA display driver is not installed (video adapter shows as "standard VGA graphics adapter" instead of the correct NVIDIA one)<br />
5. monitor driver is not installed (shows as "Generic Non-PnP Monitor")<br />
6. Computer does not recognize built-in TV tuner (a problem, since this was our only TV! we now have none :(&nbsp; )<br />
7. could not install the BIOS update (not sure if that matters)</p>
<p>In Device Manager, the two yellow triangles under "Other devices" are<br />
- Mass Storage Controller<br />
- Multimedia Controller<br />
In both cases when I choose "Update driver software" and automatically search for drivers, it says "Windows could not find driver software for your device."<br />
<br />
Any leads on where I can get the necessary drivers or what to try next?</p>
<p>2. The high-definition monitor in this computer is showing up simply as "generic non-PnP Monitor" and the graphics card as "Standard VGA Graphics Adapter." In Control Panel-&gt;Performance Information and Tools, it gives a<strong>windows experience index of
 1.0</strong> for Graphics and for Gaming graphics. I know the score was much higher in Vista...&nbsp; there must be a driver that I need to install. But when I try "Update Driver Software" in Device Manager it says "The best driver software for your device is already
 installed."</p>
<p>3. When I start Windows Media center to watch TV, I get the error "TV and video may not work as expected because the video card does not meet the minimum memory requirement of 64 MB of video RAM." I know the video card has enough ram though, since I was
 able to watch over-the-air HDTV using the included TV tuner when I was using Vista.&nbsp; I guess this is related to the problem above (can't install the proper driver for the video adapter or monitor) but it's a problem because this computer-tv combo is our ONLY
 tv! How can I get it to work?</p>

<p>Any drivers would be obtained from Sony, and if they do not provide win7 specific drivers, the next option would be the Vista drivers, as they usually work. However if they do not install your only real option is to use the Sony recovery disks to reinstate
 Vista on your system.</p>
<p>The win7 upgrade advisor is just that, it does not, in my experience, give a definative answer to compatibility</p>
<p>Your problems relate to, at least, the chipset driver, graphics driver and your TV tuner card driver</p>

<div>It is my guess that those Vista drivers are all for 32-bit, and that maybe if you had installed the 32-bit Windows 7, you would have had more things working.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There is a video driver on the nVidia website that should work.. </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>.. but it won't help you with card readers or TV tuners.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If Sony had considered it a good candidate, they would have supplied drivers. Instead, their Windows 7 info states that one will get at least basic working, and that the Vista drivers may or should work.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Contact Sony support directly for help. If none is forthcoming, use the recovery partition to get Vista back onto the machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

            Hi Nicole, I am Rob, an independent and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as independents we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. If you will work with me I will be here to help until the issue is resolved.
<br />
<br />Does it show purple in the images on the computer?
<br />
<br />About all you can do in Windows is check with HP's site for your computer and be sure the BIOS, chipset drivers, and camera drivers are all the latest.
<br /> 
<br />That sounds like a problem with the camera's hardware or its drivers. And since it is still under warranty please contact HP support. As OEM they are responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is theirs to resolve. And the unit is under full warranty and may be in need of repairs or replacement. Added that even if you are able to resolve the issue you would want it fully documented just in case there are related problems down the road. Remember the more you do the more they will say it is something you have done.

            The webcam video quality can be adjusted using the settings within the YouCam program. If YouCam software is not installed, please refer to the Installing the YouCam Applicationsection of the Testing a Webcam Using YouCam support document for information on how to obtain it.
<br />Follow the steps below to adjust your webcam settings.
<br />
<br />    To launch YouCam, click Start, type YouCam into the search field, and then select YouCam from the list.
<br />    On starting the YouCam program, the webcam feed should be immediately visible in the main viewing window on the PC.
<br />    Click the Configure icon on the main control bar.
<br />    Under Video, select the desired capture quality setting: Good, Better, or Best. This setting does not affect the size of the displayed image.
<br />    Under Video, select the desired Video size setting. Select 640 x 480 for the largest video feed window. The larger the video, the more grainy the video is likely to be. A smaller video feed will probably have better quality, but may be too small to show all of the detail that you wish to capture. Find the video size setting that is best for your needs.
<br />    In very bright or very dim lighting conditions, select the Display tab.
<br />        The Brightness control slider changes the overall brightness or dimness of the image.
<br />        The Contrast control slider changes the difference between the brightest and dimmest areas of the image.
<br />    If you need more control over the settings, click the Advanced Settings on the Display tab. In the Capture Filter Properties window, adjust the slider bars for the following effects:
<br />        Brightness - compensate for the amount of lighting on the overall image
<br />        Contrast - compensate for difference between brightest and dimmest areas
<br />        Hue - adjust the color tint of image ranging through red - yellow - blue spectrums
<br />        Saturation - adjust the amount of color in the image
<br />        Sharpness - adjust the clarity of image
<br />        Backlight - compensate for differences for bright lighting behind the image
<br />        Default - restore the controls to the original values
<br />    Adjust these advanced controls until the video feed looks best for your needs.
<br />
<br />The webcam should now be properly configured for your current video needs. If you change environments for your next video, you may need to change these settings.

    <title>viewing pdf in Microsoft Edge - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            viewing pdf in Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    <p>Ok here's my query.&nbsp; If you open a pdf link,it opens in the MS Edge browser. Fine. But what program does it use. For instance, once open in Edge I have little control over viewing options. I can right-click and it allows me 'save as', but that's it. I cannot
 increase/decrease view, I cannot see how many pages are in the document - rather limited really so I'm thinking that there must be a setting for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a setting?</p>

            <p>Hey,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've looked into this quite a bit. I love the edge browser, but I use a lot of PDF's for my classes. I haven't come up with any way to make edge a pdf-friendly browser. Your best bet is to use Chrome. It is a hassle, but it is all I've figured out. Sorry

            <p>Here is a link to a webpage that contains&nbsp;several &nbsp;pdf links (green URLs ending in .pdf):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.clemson.edu/extension/search_results.html?cx=011281331500425067411%3Anszw2i9oany&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;q=camelia&amp;x=11&amp;y=6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.clemson.edu/extension/search_results.html?cx=011281331500425067411%3Anszw2i9oany&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;q=camelia&amp;x=11&amp;y=6</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In this post, I will use the first pdf link - Camelia (the link is the word Camelia)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/plants/pdf/hgic1062.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/plants/pdf/hgic1062.pdf</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If one in Windows 10 and with Edge as the Browser clicks on this link, one gets:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c9617638-9872-4f3a-a04a-75be2c1576f5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c9617638-9872-4f3a-a04a-75be2c1576f5" /></a></p>
<p>The top Tool Bar to print and zoom comes and goes (click on the page to bring up the Tool Bar).&nbsp; You can also now got to a specific page by typing in the page number in the page field at the left of the Tool Bar. I did not see this Tool Bar before in the
 Edge Document viewer, and so if it is an addition, it is a good one, but still not full Adobe (Acrobat or Reader).
</p>
<p>Again, Microsoft needs to provide a Setting in Edge to associate apps to the file types, so that web page links with those file extensions open in those apps. I have kept my platforms all Microsoft, but am about to switch to Google Chrome for my browser
 because of numerous shortcomings in Edge (this being one of them). Microsoft's failure to advance their products without bugs, and with full feature sets is opening the door for someone to provide solutions that do this. This Is not tomorrow, but it is how
 big companies fail. They grow arrogant, dismissive of feedback, and with all the hubris incapable of innovation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If one right clicks on the Camelia Link on the Clemson webpage, one gets:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fbe6de67-2d24-4658-8f49-6c9f824df9ed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fbe6de67-2d24-4658-8f49-6c9f824df9ed" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If one clicks on Save Target As, one gets:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0932fcd-a5b2-46a6-9b2f-9938fc8a3115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0932fcd-a5b2-46a6-9b2f-9938fc8a3115" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is being saved by Default to your Downloads location. Click on Save and one then gets:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af895b61-ab1e-4cba-9c59-11a5763a556c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af895b61-ab1e-4cba-9c59-11a5763a556c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If one then clicks on Open at the bottom of the screen, then finally (assuming that you have associated the pdf file extension with Adobe for your local PC files (see
<a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-set-default-programs-and-file-types-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-set-default-programs-and-file-types-in-windows-10/</a>&nbsp; (if yo need to do this. If you choose the Right Click on a file in File Explorer method, do not choose the "Open With" first selection offered app , but the
 bottom selection (Choose another app), and then select the program and be sure to check the box at the bottom: Always use this app to open ,(extension) files.)), one finally get the document opened in Adobe.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b2b0798-b7bf-4f96-8357-9b31ef1536ae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b2b0798-b7bf-4f96-8357-9b31ef1536ae" /></a></p>
<p>This is a LONG way to go to get to the file you used to be able to just click on in IE to open in the app that you wanted. Finally note that if one uses the Save icon on the Edge document reader page, that the file is simply directly saved to your Downloads
 location, and you are not offered the option at the bottom of the screen to Open it, so use the right click method to prevent having to find the file with File Explorer in the Downloads folder.</p>

            Since the first post here, in one of he Microsoft Updates, the Tool Bar as shown in my long post above has been added to the Edge document viewer. However, pdf links still do not open in Adobe (Acrobat/Reader). This is the core issue here, and has still
 not been resolved.

<p>I am using Windows 10 Build 16299 right now. Most problems seem fixed if you use "one page layout, continuous scrolling enabled" mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>* The zoom setting is not sticky, so you need to zoom again on a new page. Workaround: use "one page layout, continuous scrolling".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>* There is now a way to see what page you are on and how many are in total at the top. In the "one page layout, continuous scrolling" you also have a slider on the left edge.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows update installation failure code 8E5E03FB</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am on Windows 7 (64 bit) and I have 22 Important or Recommended updates that won't install. I have tried suggest things on the help box (I have scanned for any viruses and have space for the updates).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My hard drive was recently replaced by a friend who then copied all my documents and software over to the new hard drive. I kept getting pop up boxes saying my Windows wasn't validated which I thought must be the problem. My friend has now validated my Windows
 and the problem still persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The majority of the updates have the installation failure code of 8E5E03FB. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help! I am worried about not being able to update 'important' updates!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            <p>Thanks,</p>
<p>I have tried Methods 1 and 2 but I don't have much experience in fixing computers- it seems there could be a problem with the Windows Installer as some things I have tried downloading to help the problem haven't worked, how would I go about finding out what
 is wrong with it and rectifying this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi GeraldSlack 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Hi 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. You should look for your old files in following folders 
<br />
<br />1. Go to C\Users and see if you are some other User who matches your user name. Get into this folder and see whether your files are there. 
<br />2. Go to C:\Windows.Old folder and look for your files here. 
<br />
<br />These folders will be hidden, so you need to make it visible by opening File Explorer &gt; View tab &gt; Check Hidden Items &gt; Restart your File Explorer.
<br />Now, you should traverse the folders appropriately to find your files.
<br />
<br />B. Login to your Onedrive and see if your files are there.
<br /><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/</a>
<br />
<br />C. If a file is deleted in Windows 10, it goes into Recycle bin.
<br />
<br />Can you look into Recycle bin and see whether the files are there or not? If yes, restore from there.
<br />
<br />If this is not in Recycle bin, you can try free version of Recuva to recover the files (note - it is not always successful, hence you require some luck also)
<br />
<br />https://www.****/recuva
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            HiGerald
<br />
<br />How long ago did you update to Windows 10 - is that less than 28 days?
<br />
<br />If so, Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />On your C Drive, do you see a folder named Windows.Old
<br />
<br />If so, you should immediately go into that folder and the contined Users folder to find all your files
<br />
<br />You need to very quickly copy  your files out of there into the normal folders, because Windows will delete that folder after a few days . . 
<br />
<br />If you do not find your files in there are all your files gone and are your 3rd party applications still available to you?
<br />
<br />You say your system was automatically changed from Windows 7 to Windows 10 - can you please explain a bit more on what happened to cause that . . .

<h2>            Unable to Switch Profiles on Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys,</p>

<p>My girlfriend has a separate profile on my console. We've never had any issues switching profiles before. But today, when trying to sign into her profile, the screen flashes white for a second and returns to my profile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Has anyone ever encountered this? How did you fix it?</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Try this. &nbsp;Log out of both profiles and then perform a hard reset EXACTLY lie this. &nbsp;Hold the power button on the console for 10 seconds or until the power shuts down completely. &nbsp;Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes. &nbsp;Plug the
 power cord back in and restart the console. &nbsp; Once it is back up and operational test the results. &nbsp;Let us know. &nbsp;Good Luck!!</p>

<p>Hey @Genesis1953,</p>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. Unfortunately, that didn't help. On top of being unable to switch to her profile, I also can't do any profile management or add/manage profiles. It's weird, I can sign in and out of my profile, but I can't switch to hers and
 I cannot add or change anything to the profiles. Any other suggestions?</p>

<h3> wahyu d. p.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will Vista got one more chance to be upgraded&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello and good day</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all I am a Vista (Home Premium) user since 2008 and still using it until now, i bought it when i'm starting as college student.</p>
<p>Its the newest windows OS available at that time, it installed on my laptop. Im quite happy and satisfied using it till now, i update it regulary and work well. Even once i got my HDD broken, and need to be replaced, mean fresh install on new HDD i got my
 activation code again using phone support. That make me really happy for using genuine Windows. (i could say 7 of 10 my friend OS is pirated at that time)<br />
</p>
<p>When Win 7 launched and widely used around me (most of them pirated of course, except that come up with build in), alot of my friend bashing me and called me stupid for using Vista. I know microsoft once offering free upgrade in mid 2009 till new year of
 2010 if im not mistaken. I'm not that tech savvy and updated with news at that time, so i missed the offer and continue using it till now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently i hear the news that microsoft will give free upgrade offer* (i know there are term condition to get that). Unfortunately based on (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-id/windows-10/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 About</a>)</p>
<p>that special offer only apply to new or existing Win 7, Win 8.1, and Win Phone 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was a good but sad news for me. If only i upgrade my OS at that time i might have chance to upgrade may OS again.</p>
<p>even this news made me more sad and bit angry&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/18/us-microsoft-china-idUSKBN0ME06A20150318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reuters News</a>, being said even non-genuine OS can get free? upgrade.</p>
<p>I know that even if pirated OS got upgrade it wont get valid license, but as Genuine Windows User that cant? participate in this offer i feel so dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Now i really feel like being stupid for using Vista, not because of its performance (as most people complaint about) but something trivial as this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody please enlighten if i read this news wrong, or it is just a sad truth. Hopefully Microsoft give us last chance before they ended Vista service in 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Upgrading (buy) Win 7/8.1 to get this offer is NOT an option, calculating hardware depreciation and technology wise, i'd better spend money of new OS on a new machine (which is i had in mind for next year)</p>

</p><div>
<p>Great news! <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>We will offer a free upgrade to Windows 10 for qualified new or existing Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 devices that
</strong></span>upgrade in the first year!&nbsp; And even better: once a qualified Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it up to date for the supported lifetime of the device, keeping it more secure, and introducing new features and
 functionality over time – for no additional charge.&nbsp;Sign up with your email today, and we will send you more information about Windows 10 and the upgrade offer in the coming months.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And in all probability you are better off buying a new machine for later Operating Systems as the Hardware requirements to run later Operating Systems are more demanding that Vista System requirements were.</p>

            <p>We haven't got news for Windows Vista users yet, hopefully Microsoft will make a promotional deal to make Windows 10 cheap. There are a few suggestions on the Windows Uservoice page to make it a cheap upgrade for Vista users and you should add your votes
 to it:</p>
<p><a href="https://windows.uservoice.com/forums/265757-windows-feature-suggestions/suggestions/6584813-make-windows-10-a-free-upgrade-for-vista-users" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windows.uservoice.com/forums/265757-windows-feature-suggestions/suggestions/6584813-make-windows-10-a-free-upgrade-for-vista-users</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned 2008 hardware especially that of&nbsp;laptops is depreciating. Microsoft might simply not want users to install Windows 10 on hardware that old as much old hardware won't perform well and if users attempt to install Windows 10 on bad hardware and
 it doesn't run well then Microsoft will get negative press. My personal experience is that any system sold by OEMs with Windows Vista ran Windows 7, 8.1 and 10 well. I'd rather they made it a free upgrade for Vista users also but&nbsp;elevated the minimum system
 requirements to at least a dual core processor, SATA HDD, &gt;DDR2 RAM. i.e. cut out all systems with IDE HDDs, DDR RAM and really poor processors.</p>

            <p>Well, I think that news regarding Windows 10 upgrade for non-genuine editions is a bit lacking on details. The current situation from the news seems to be that you can upgrade from a pirated version of Windows 7 to a pirated version of Windows 10. I am sure,
 one could do this already, by getting a trial copy of Windows 10, upgrading their pirated Windows 7 install, then cracking the upgraded Windows 10 install. So you get a pirated copy of Windows 10. It is not really clear on what's different after that news.
 Before that announcement also, you would have got a pirated Windows 10 install either way using an ISO.</p>

<p>
</p><p>They therefore need to make it free for Technical Preview users...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite all warnings there will be a large number of insiders that have wiped out a Windows 7 OEM install complete with a wipeout of the recovery partitions. Microsoft&nbsp;are very unlikely to damage their relations with enthusiasts who made a mistake during
 installation and at the same time reward Chinese pirates.</p>

            <p>Its still not so clear what the limitation is going to be whether they will be upgraded for free and have an annoyance nag&nbsp;factor prompting users to buy a license. In such a case the purchase of a license to get genuine has to be cheap&nbsp;and even still&nbsp;the
 Chinese will simply just re-pirate. It could just be a concept that the license is "non-genuine" as a principle</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>In plain speak this means that if you were running a pirated copy of Windows, you’ll still be running a pirated copy even after upgrading to Windows 10.

</p><p>Its also not going to be easy for Windows 7 OEM Windows 10 Insiders who clean installed Windows 10 TP and wiped their recovery partition to prove that they have a qualifying&nbsp;genuine license to upgrade from and have a faded COA without the ability to reinstall
 the eligible Windows 7 base license... Moreover it goes Windows 7 OEM → Windows 10 Retail, therefore Microsoft will have to completely support the licensing and activation... →&nbsp;No doing&nbsp;their usual sending customers to the OEM who send the customers back to
 Microsoft. I think OEMs will get stopped from shipping media for Windows 7/8/8.1 when Windows 10 is released. Recently they released a flawed update which flagged many genuine Windows 7 systems as non-genuine suggesting they were trying to do something to
 flag up the licenses before the Windows 10 update.... They had to immediately release a second update to fix the first update:</p>

<p>Microsoft Technical Support will be absolutely swamped if they try to differentiate between pirated/genuine Windows and if they force a double install for reinstallation then that's almost going to be the very large Windows 7 OEM userbase completely unsatisfied

</p><p>The other interesting issue is the fact that Microsoft are looking for ROMs to convert Android Phones to Windows Phones, perhaps they will try with Apple hardware next:</p>

<p>
</p><p>It seems Microsoft wants&nbsp;Windows 10 to dominate&nbsp;the PC and Mobile market by any means... They don't want to support older versions anymore&nbsp;and are still obsessed with taking Google down. They will still get revenue by forcing the users into use of Cortana
 and Bing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way regarding the "free upgrade for Windows Vista" installing the Technical Preview still gives you a high chance of getting a "free" Windows 10 license or at worst a "discounted" license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I have genuine licenses and back ups of all the installation media but I will be unhappy if Microsoft force a double install...</p>

<p>I fail to see how it is different from say,&nbsp;testers with Windows 7 OEM licenses who clean installed Windows 8 Consumer Preview and&nbsp;do not have any&nbsp;backup system image.&nbsp;They would still have had to prove that they had a genuine Windows 7 OEM license, when
 the preview would expire and they would either be forced to return to Windows 7, or be eligible for the discounted upgrade to Windows 8 (in both cases they would require their original product key).</p>

<p>Providing Windows 7 ISOs again would be a much, much better alternative&nbsp;for Microsoft, rather than giving away Windows 10 freely for everyone (anyone can get a pirated Windows 7 and upgrade), (that is assuming that Microsoft isn't really giving it away Windows
 10 intentionally)</p>

<p>They can't kill the desktop on Windows, and that's what matters to people. Desktop offers powerful&nbsp;customization, enough to get rid of Bing&nbsp;or Cortana if required. They will badly need Windows 8.1 sales, as a backup for if monetization of services like Google
 (which many people hate) fails. Even less reason to offer Windows 10 to pirated copies.</p>

            <p>Regarding piracy Microsoft definitely don't want people to pirate however they would rather people pirate then use a competing product (including a former version of their own product as they would need to waste development costs). It keeps Windows and Office
 dominant. If pirates are happily using Windows and Office at home (either genuine or pirated) they are more likely to keep the big&nbsp;corporations using Microsoft products...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I would rather they didn't support pirates but instead lowered the Windows License cost for non-commercial Home use. I agree with the issue&nbsp;regarding the&nbsp;Windows 7 .iso and would prefer they make a Digital Solution for Windows 7 during the first
 year of Windows 10 release. I'd also rather for them to issue keys to a Microsoft Account during the upgrade and have a proper Windows 10 Digital Distribution&nbsp;so a double installation isn't required for reinstallation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding Windows 7 Gabe Aul indicates that users will be able to update from the TP to RTM. Even users can't get their free upgrade and have to perform a double installation then there is no intent to facilitate that upgrade path.</p>

</p><p>Ideally&nbsp;Windows 10 will be able to read both Windows 8.0 and 8.1 UEFI BIOS SLP keys and determine the OEM license is eligible and be able to determine whether the BIOS has Windows 7 OEM SLP markers (no SLP key in the BIOS as Windows 7 uses generic SLP keys
 input from the media)&nbsp;are present to determine a system is eligible. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However&nbsp;the generic SLP keys&nbsp;as far as I understand is one of the reasons why Windows 7 is relatively easy to pirate and one of the main reasons Windows 8.0/8.1 had unique UEFI BIOS SLP keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked for some information on this a while ago... as it'd help significantly on the Dell Community Forums... Last time we had to pretty much figure out UEFI, Unique UEFI BIOS Embedded SLP keys ourselves with a bit of trial and error. Dell Technical Support
 was way behind with this activation mechanism instructing users to look for COAs. It seems again like no-one has the answer:</p>

<h2>            connection takes long time to connect</h2>
                    when i boot up my computer, it takes about a minute to connect even after everything else has finished loading, apart from my antivirus (i use Panda Cloud AV). i know it's not my antivirus because i've even gone so far as to uninstall it then restart my
 computer. it's not my Intel PRO/1000 PL network card driver because i've used Uniblue DriverScanner to update all my drivers. all other programs have been installed before and the connection worked fine after the installation.<br />
it's been like this ever since i formatted my computer so my guess would be something is wrong with some settings but i don't know what.<br />
<br />
EDIT: should clarify that i'm talking about network+internet. the little blue thing doesn't appear on the network icon at all and when it does, both the network and internet have been connected. and also, it is not a problem with the modem or router as the
 two other computers in the house connect fine.<br />

<p><span>---------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If the problem does not return while your computer is in clean boot mode, a background program is likely causing interference.
 You can try to determine which background program is causing the problem while the computer is in clean boot mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>---------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To find the process or program at cause follow the steps starting at enable half of the Services items, from the following article:</span></p>

<h2>            Missing msvcrt70.dll</h2>
                    I have already downloaded the file and placed it into the C:\Windows\System32 folder but i still am getting the error message that's its missing so then i tried using the CMD regsvr32 msvcrt70.dll but it said that it was not compatible with my system even
 thought the website said it was.&nbsp; I have windows 7 64 bit but it was an upgrade from vista 64 bit both are the ultimate editions.&nbsp; The web site i used was www.dll-files.com

            Which application do you want to run? Have you tried to copy the file to the program folder?

            Yes i just tired the same program on another computer that also doesn't have msvcr70.dll file but it worked.&nbsp; The other computer was running Vista 32 bit.&nbsp; But the emulator works with windows 7 and the plug-in should too so could it be a problem with my
 registry?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Check the link I posted above. Please do not get any Registry Program as that is not the issue<br />
and all of those type programs that claim they can fix a lot of error are all snake-oil and will<br />
most often cause more problems. None of the few legitimate registry cleaners make those<br />
wild claims and even they can cause problems for anyone will less that expert knowledge.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>In your question you are stating msvcr<strong>T</strong>70.dll - notice the " <strong>
T</strong> " and when I search Google almost<br />
all the links are for msvcr70.dll - no " T ". So you are you making a typo&nbsp;or is it really msvcrT70.dll.<br />
<br />
If it is indeed msvcrt70.dll then you need to&nbsp;seek the support of that program's developer.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<p><strong>Hello,</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>got this problem on a win2003 R2 X64 SP2 server, 2 times in 14 days, after applying&nbsp;KB979559. Checked win32k.sys, was changed by this patch. Server runs fine since 30 months, so this is a new one. Terminx.exe is a
 part of the german dentist software package Dampsoft. Have talked with this guys, not know problem. Seams to me a addressing problem in a win32k API call.</span></strong></p>
<p>Any comment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Thanks&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Valelow, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description, I understand that You're experiencing issue with powering on your Windows 8 Toshiba laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand that must be very frustrating when suddenly your computer does not power on. However,&nbsp;let's work together to get this issue resolved with our combined efforts. If it's anything related to Windows, we'll definitely get this fixed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you see any signal or any beep code when you press the power key?</li><li>Have you checked taking out the battery and starting computer while the computer directly&nbsp;connected to power?</li><li>Was the computer shutdown properly the last time?</li></ol>
<p>Mostly this kind of issues appears due to hardware part failure but sometimes this can also be caused due to static power lock. We can try to perform Flee Power or Power drain to release the static power and check if that helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is actually a very simple step that usually solves problems like&nbsp;<strong>No Power Issues</strong> and
<strong>Blank Screens</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the battery and then disconnect the AC adapter if connected.</li><li>Press and hold down the power button for 15 seconds then release it.</li><li>Reinsert the battery and then reconnect the AC adapter.</li><li>Turn on the computer.</li></ol>
<p>If the issue persists, I would suggest you to get a hardware diagnosis performed on the computer by computer manufacturer or a local tech shop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please let us know the results. Feel free to write us back for any further assistance with Windows, we'll&nbsp;be glad to assist you. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

If using Fast Startup please turn it off until this issue is resolved. And you may need to leave it off.
Start - type in --&gt; Control Panel  ....... find at top and click on it.
Control Panel - Power Options - Choose what the power buttons do - click "Change settings that are currently unavailable" - then uncheck Fast Startup - click Save Changes - Close - Restart the computer.
3 different Bug_Check usually points to a hardware issue. None of the 3 minidumps had specific cause so that also points to hardware.

Could be heat related - try using a small fan to blow into the air intakes to see if that helps. Does it just act like it loses power or does it shutdown in a normal manner? Heat related does not always mean too much heat as it is very possible that something is too sensitive to even normal levels of heat.
Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Remove the dust bunnies and clean the vents. Check that the fans work (before and after opening the case). If a laptop about all you can do is reseat the memory and clean the  vents (still can try adding a small fan as a test).
This sounds like hardware so if the above does not help then you probably need the help of a real computer shop (one that does its own in-shop service) or the System Maker's Support.
1. Check the processor seating, heat sink, and the compound between the processor and the heat sink which are common causes.
=====
2. Check with ASRock Support, their online docs and drivers, and ask in their forums about known issues. Update the BIOS, chipset drivers, and the major onboard and separate device drivers.

This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is  "possible" that it is driver related (rare). Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (on both ends) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Make sure the system has adequate ventilation - add a small fan blowing into intakes. Carefully inspect the motherboard and other cards for damage. Pay attention to the fatal hardware error implication. You may need a real computer shop (one that does its own in-shop service) or the System maker's Support.
Check the processor seating, heat sink, and the compound between the processor and the heat sink which are common causes.
There have been a few instances where Norton/Symantec and other antivirus/security programs have caused this error.

This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : 
Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and update BIOS and chipset drivers).
DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html
  
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in the system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.  &lt;-- best method

<p>The new media creation tool includes Windows 8.1 with Update 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft recently updated the images for Windows 8.1 with Update 1, but I am sure it still does not include all Windows Updates since this roll up was done.

<p>Certainly that won't be possible, that is why Windows includes Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update is the best way of having the most current release of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10 the possible theory is, you will have quarterly revisions of Windows. So you probably should consider moving to that release when it comes to market.</p>

<p>The days of "Service Packs" are gone. Service Packs would included all the latest updates as part of the service pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for revising Windows 8.1 download each month after an new batch of updates are released, it would be far too costly and time consuming as testing would be required to insure the download file and Windows functions properly before releasing it to the public
 for download.</p>

            <p>I had a Wi-Fi handshake problem, which seemed to occurred when I got a Windows10 upgrade about a week ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to get my Wi-Fi up after my laptop being shutdown or sleep etc was for me to reboot the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst my PC was sending packets but the router didn't reply/understand them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalling a previous Intel AC3165 driver s/w dated 23/08/2015 sorted the problem.</p>

            <p>Thanks for answering, i tried all of that to no avail. &nbsp;What's strange is last night I unchecked the box on method 3, and somehow, the box today was checked again. &nbsp; I've uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers, I've disabled them and enabled them, when
 I plug in Internet works and it detects my network it just says can't connect to this network. &nbsp;All other computers work fine. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>By the way, and I'm the same person as in the original post I just have 2 ID's, that was a mistake on my part. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing i noticed about the laptop is that this started happening when I started noticing an error message appear upon startup. &nbsp;That message says in a window on the bottom right of the screen "could not connect all network drives"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>maybe this is an unrelated issue I just thought I would point that out in case it isn't. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If you're using Skype for Web, there's no option to go beyond 30 days of your chat history as that's what's stored in the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you sign in to a new device using an application, only the last 30 days of your&nbsp;conversation history will be shown. If you weren't able to back your history up, I'm afraid there's no option for us to retrieve them.</p>

<h2>            What is a VPN connection&#63;</h2>
                    <p>What is meant by VPN? </p>
<p>What is meant by a VPN connection?&nbsp; I have spent over 30 minutes attempting&nbsp;to find out what this is and why I am given it as a setup option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The language that is used in Windows is apparently for a person who is highly experienced with the product, whereas Cortina's offered help depends upon the questioner knowing the meanings of the terms and concepts that are in question.&nbsp; This is more than
 frustrating.&nbsp; I am beginning to look into the lauded ease of use of Apple computers&nbsp;even though they are much more financially costly.&nbsp; Is the Apple world as challenging?&nbsp; My time has a significant value.&nbsp;</p>

<p>VPN stands for Virtual Private Network, and it isn't a Microsoft technology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A VPN is an encrypted connection between your computer, tablet or phone and another computer. Because the connection is encrypted, no one will know what information you exchanged with the second computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A VPN is most commonly used by employees who need access to their employer's network when they are not physically attached to the network, e.g., when they are at home. Because the connection is encrypted, the employer knows that the company's confidential
 or proprietary information will not be seen by anyone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A good way to obtain a basic understanding of complicated computer technology is to use search terms like:</p>

<p>VPN tutorial</p>
<p>VPN primer</p>
<p>what is a VPN</p>

            Hi DRMU,
<br />
<br />A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is basically another layer of protection.
<br />
<br />It will hide your identity on the Web
<br />
<br />It will provide an abstract layer with everything coming into and out of your PC on a network or on the Internet
<br />
<br />Basically, you will be able to see everything and everyone, they will not be able to see you, unless you want them to . . .

            <p>Hi Patricia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would inform you that when a&nbsp;AC adapter is&nbsp;connected to a laptop, the battery gets charged till 100% and the connection between the AC adapter and battery is cut. After the battery is completely charged, laptop only uses AC supply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other&nbsp;option is to remove the battery and plug the AC Adapter. Now&nbsp;the laptop only uses AC supply.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">However, if you want to disable battery charging while the AC adapter is connected, you have a option in Battery Meter (in Control Panel or click on battery icon
 on taskbar). Once you enable that option battery will stop charging even if the AC adapter is connected.&nbsp;Once you reboot the system, battery will automatically start charging normally.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information is helpful. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.</p>
        </p>
