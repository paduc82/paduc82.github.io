            You have indeed been scammed.&nbsp; Because you allowed remote access to your computer, there's no telling what information might have been compromised.&nbsp; You should change all of your passwords, notify your bank and credit card companies and do a clean re-installation
 of the operating system. &nbsp; <br />

<h2>            Stop&#47;Turn off the Windows Memory Diagnostic In WINDOWS 10....WINDOWS 10 ONLY&#33;</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">SO I ran the&nbsp;diagnostic&nbsp;for Windows Memory and I can not keep it turned off.&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I turn it off period. &nbsp; This is Windows 10 only and my operating system is fully updated and the system is perfect.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">***It is not a problem or drain on resources. &nbsp;I am aware it is running in the&nbsp;background&nbsp;all the time. &nbsp; I turned it off and it will not stay off...it turns&nbsp;back on each time the system restarts. &nbsp;I turned it off....I want it off.....period!!!
 &nbsp;iI don't care if it is not a problem ....I want the dam thing off period! &nbsp; OFF!</p>
<p class="contentStandard">***Also it is not in the list of Startup Programs or list of Automatic Services allowed to startup on their own. &nbsp; What is up with the Memory Diagnostic. &nbsp; So I can't turn it off in the list of startup programs or other approaches
 similar to that....not in the list period.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">***Yet it always starts again after the computer restarts....runs in the&nbsp;background....responds only to the Task Manager and needs to be turned&nbsp;off Manual in the running programs in the Task Manager every single Dam time. &nbsp;I am
 Done with this. &nbsp;I don't want that program running in the&nbsp;background&nbsp;unless I start it. &nbsp;How do I kill it and keep it&nbsp;off from running in the&nbsp;background&nbsp;until&nbsp;I want to run the&nbsp;Memory Diagnostic? &nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">***The only way so far to turn it off....is Task Manager and to turn it off Manually every time the computer restarts. &nbsp;So MICROSOFT HOW DO I TURN IT OFF OR WHAT IS THE FIX???</p>
<p class="contentStandard">***I am so repetitive and heavy handed about this issue....since nobody can&nbsp;solve&nbsp;it that I know of and it is only WINDOWS 10 THAT I&nbsp;CARE ABOUT.....ANY ANSWERS SO FAR HAVE BEEN ABOUT VISTA...7.1...8.1 AND ALL SAY GO TO&nbsp;STARTUP&nbsp;AND
 KILL THE PROGRAM.&nbsp;&nbsp;HOWEVER THIS IS WINDOWS 10 AND IT NOT EVEN LISTED IN STARTUP AND NEEDS TO BE KILLED EVERY SINGLE TIME MANUALLY.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">***So please tell me how to fix this minor issue that has gotten under my skin MR MICROSOFT!!!</p>

 Finishes Fine....No&nbsp;Memory Errors Found. &nbsp; Memory Fine...System&nbsp;Fine....&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>However The Memory Diag keeps running in the&nbsp;Background. &nbsp;Whenever I restart the Computer&nbsp;the Memory Diag is always running in the Background and has locked
 it self in as re-occurring&nbsp;task somehow. &nbsp;After each computer restart...Memory&nbsp;Diag running in the Task Bar Icon &nbsp;Section and in the Background. &nbsp;You Must open Task Manager and Kill the&nbsp;Memory&nbsp;Diag&nbsp;Manually&nbsp; each and every time...It is just&nbsp;a&nbsp;troublesome&nbsp;thing
 at this point. &nbsp;The&nbsp;Memory&nbsp;Diag should run...No Errors....and be turned off and not reappear after the Re-start. &nbsp;However it does and must be killed in the Manual Fashion through Task Manager. &nbsp;Also the&nbsp;Memory&nbsp;Diag is&nbsp;not on the List of Startup Programs....so
 the error can't be corrected that way either. &nbsp;I hope you under stand better and get my issue. &nbsp;Also this is always getting&nbsp;refereed&nbsp;back to the old Versions of Windows like Vista and 8.1 and it&nbsp;is very&nbsp;frustrating&nbsp;trying to sort an answer out that applies
 only to Windows 10!!!!</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Lucky for you ...I have figured the "FIX" out and maybe you can post&nbsp;and pass&nbsp;this on to the&nbsp;rest of the Windows 10 Community....</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>There is a small&nbsp;minor&nbsp;"bug" in Windows 10"&nbsp;cornering&nbsp;the&nbsp;Memory&nbsp;Diagnostic and this is my understanding and "FIX" for it....</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>When you Run the Windows 10&nbsp;Memory&nbsp;Diagnostic....the program or operating system is&nbsp;locking it in to the "List Of Re-occurring&nbsp;Tasks" &nbsp;and&nbsp;every time&nbsp;the computer
 is&nbsp;restarted the Task will restart a</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>nd run in the background....at least that is my understanding and what I have seen so far.....I am also not requesting the program to be added to the list of
 Task and it is a simple looking program and you do not even have the option. &nbsp;So the "FIX" is you must "DELETE" the&nbsp;Memory&nbsp;Diag from the list of task or it will&nbsp;always&nbsp;restart and&nbsp;run&nbsp;ing the background with the computer restarting every single time. &nbsp; Task
 manager will kill the program...however it will restart when the PC is rebooted. &nbsp;It is not listed in the Startup programs. &nbsp; So I kill the Windows&nbsp;Memory&nbsp;Diag by Deleting it from&nbsp;the Scheduled/Re-occurring&nbsp;Task List of Programs and that works...and has not
 been a problem since......What do you think Sir????</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>We you me able to help with two other Problems I am having with Windows 10?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>First.....My computer is not waking correctly from sleep mode....When I wake the PC the Video screen is distorted...not there...and Windows 10 has not loaded.
 &nbsp;Appears to be an issue with the Nvidia Drivers...Windows Ten and Sleep State. &nbsp; So Far the only thing that works is re-starting the&nbsp;Computer....all is Perfect then and I no longer use the&nbsp;Sleep option until it is corrected.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Second....I can&nbsp;no longer&nbsp;use "Video Hardware Acceleration for Video Encoding" based on a&nbsp;set of Nvidia 660GTX Video Cards running in SLI Mode. &nbsp;So Windows
 10...Nvidia 66GTX....and NERO RECODE 2014....I no longer have the option to use Video Hardware Acceleration and I am not sure why...or who is at Fault?</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Also the Windows 10 is fully updated. &nbsp;The video card drivers and Nero Recode 2014 are fully updated. &nbsp;The System appears to be working Perfectly.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I also build my own system and it is custom. &nbsp;Intel Z77 Chipset and Motherboard...Intel 3770K CPU....16gb of GSkill Memory....and Solid State Samsung Drives
 for the Operating System.......</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>The Problems are somewhat unique to Windows 10.....Everything was Fine under Windows 7.1. &nbsp;No issue with Waking from Sleep State or Video Acceleration.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Just since I made the change to Windows 10. &nbsp; Any Suggestions????</span></span></span></p>

            I had the same problem.&nbsp; After running the memory diagnostic tool and expecting the results on reboot, I received nothing but the icon in the system tray.&nbsp; Clicking the icon did nothing.&nbsp; After several days of it just sitting there with no apparent function
 I decided to get rid of it.&nbsp; Easier said than done.&nbsp; I tried every method I could find by searching the forums with no luck. I gave up for a couple of weeks before I tried again.&nbsp; And again I had no luck.&nbsp; This morning, just for the hell of it, I ran the memory
 diagnostic tool again to see if it would give me the results this time and again it did not.&nbsp; But guess what...now the icon is gone.&nbsp; Things that make you go, hmmmmmmmmmmmm.<br />

<p>
</p><p>If the Acronis backup was made and frozen at the point before you ran the Memory Diagnostics your fine.....Other wise you need to run clean install and re-install all your programs. &nbsp;Plus Data lose depends on where your data was stored......</p>

                    <span>
<p><strong>Hello --- We got a new laptop and used the old Files and Settings Transfer from an XP computer. We are only concerned about the "Favorites" from Explorer. We do not have access to the XP computer any longer and is too late to use the "Easy Transfer"
 program that is newer. Is there any way to retrieve these on the new Windows 7 computer? Again, we only care about the Favorites (never transfered the files -- only settings) and do not have access to the old XP computer. Thanks.</strong></p>

            Try using the FASTConv Utility to extract the contents of the XP Transfer Wizard image described in the following article:<br />
http://windowsxp.mvps.org/fast.htm<br />
If the utility does not work in Windows 7, go to a Windows XP machine and do the extraction there and backup your personals manually.

            What edition of Windows 7 are you using?&nbsp; If you are using Professional or Ultimate then you can easily do what you want by using the XP Mode available to you by restoring the FAST file to XP Mode and using Windows 7 WET to transfer from XP Mode to 7.&nbsp;

                    <p>Dear All</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a situation where in i need to store in the server name and the credentials in the manage passwords.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done the following settings in order to store this server name and credentials</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Win+R&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;control userpasswords2&gt;</p>
<p>2) Select Advance tab from the user accounts tab. </p>
<p>3) Click Manage Passwords and add the server name and the credentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above settings work perfectly alright but after the system restarts , information gets deleted and I have to enter the above all over again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly suggest me a solution that retains the server name and credentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could occur due to some incorrect Windows update settings or due to some other program interfering with the updates. I would suggest you to try these steps and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 1: </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Windows update troubleshooter can automatically detect and fix any incorrect settings. Refer to these steps to run this troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key +F</em></strong> to bring up the <strong>
<em>search</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Charms bar.</span></li><li><span>Type <strong><em>Troubleshooter</em></strong> and press enter; click on the&nbsp;<strong><em>Settings
</em></strong>tab below the search box.</span></li><li><span>Click on the <strong><em>Find and Fix problems</em></strong> tile and then&nbsp;&nbsp;click on the
<strong><em>view all</em></strong> button the left pane.</span></li><li><span>Click on the <strong><em>Windows update</em></strong> troubleshooter and&nbsp;run it.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have setup a proxy connection, I would suggest you to disable the proxy and check. Refer these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Click the Gear box at the top right corner in internet&nbsp;explorer.</span></li><li><span>Click the Tools button, and then click Internet Options.</span></li><li><span>Click the Connections tab, and then click LAN settings.</span></li><li><span>Uncheck the option “Use a Proxy Server for your LAN”.</span></li><li><span>Click Apply and Ok to save changes.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Method 3:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, it is possible that some service or application is interfering or blocking the Windows update. Boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue occurs. Booting the computer in a clean boot state can reduce software
 conflicts and help identify the root cause of the issue. You can refer to this article for more information:</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After troubleshooting, reset the computer to start as usual. Refer to the step
<em>How to set the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting</em> under more information.
</span></p>

            <p>I'm going around to every article I've read with this problem and pasting my findings below because I had the same problem and it drove me up the wall. But first to make sure we are talking about the same issue here is what happened to me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System</strong>: Windows 8 (Not 8.1)</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: When clicking "check for updates" it would show updates (sometimes) and&nbsp;I'd select the updates I wanted and start the process and it would just sit there. It would say 0% forever. I'd get frustrated and try a solution like the first&nbsp;two
 listed below and nothing helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. First, I tried everything. I ran the Windows Update&nbsp;troubleshooting tool everyone keeps referencing.
<strong>This didn't work</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I tried all the command line options. Variation after variation after variation... none of them worked.
<strong>This didn't work</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>THE NEXT ONE WORKED!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I recognize other people might have different factors affecting them which means this might not work but in another thread some guy said he finally got up in frustration and walked away from his computer and then coming back hours later (with the screen
 still on) it was actually updating. It appears there is an issue (from what I can tell unique to Windows 8) where it won't show any progress on updates even though it is downloading them in the background. It then kinda pauses (for god knows how long) and
 then Windows says to itself "well great, I've sat around on my butt long enough and I've downloaded all these updates let's actually install them now and if I feel like it I'll make the progress bar show that I'm working".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided to&nbsp;do the same thing... besides at this point I was ready to&nbsp;open up my office window and throw the computer out so it was probably best I step away from it.&nbsp;Here are 3 important points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a)&nbsp;The first&nbsp;time it didn't show any progress update. It still showed zero after sitting there forever. I restarted it and then when I went back I noticed that the counter that shows Important and Optional updates had went down because it installed them&nbsp;although
 not a single thing in&nbsp;Windows (progress bar, restart screen where it says "Don't Turn Off Your Computer I'm Updating") showed me that it was working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>b)&nbsp;Next, I thought "okay, I'm going to pick the smallest update on the list." It was about 1.3MB. I installed that one and the progress bar moved half way and then stopped and seemed to freeze. I couldn't actually even click anything on the Windows Update
 box. Instead of restarting I took a post-it note and placed it on the exact line where the progress bar stopped. I checked it 5 minutes later and sure enough it move... by like 5 pixels but it actually moved! Something was happening! Then all the sudden it
 zipped to the end and wanted to restart. I did and everything was fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>c) During this rando Windows "I don't want to tell you I'm doing any kind of updates error" it also wasn't showing the screen where you shut down and restart that says "Don't Turn Off Your Computer&nbsp;Updates Are Being Configured". The screen was actually black.
 At that point I figured I'll give it a shot. Well it&nbsp;appears that it was actually doing that but just showing a black screen because when I got back to Windows they were successfully installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the lesson&nbsp;learned here... wait... just wait a really long time. Get up and pour yourself a glass of wine and do something else because staring at the screen will make you want to lose your mind. Come back after you've watched a movie and see if&nbsp;something
 happened. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps some other poor souls out there&nbsp;who spent hours trying other stuff that didn't work.</p>
<p>

<h2>            problems when selecting state&#47;province in billing</h2>
                    
<p>I live in Australia and I am trying to purchase a tv series on xbox videos on my pc (have also tried unsuccessfully on xbox music on pc). When I click on the one I want to buy a pop up appears asking me to&nbsp; add a credit card before I can process payment.
 I click Add new and it opens a page where I input all my details, all fine except appears to only generate American options. I have tried every trouble shooting I could find. I have my card linked to my email which is linked to the xbox account, I have all
 my personal info updated as Australian, I have my pc setup as Australian. I do not understand why nothing seems to fix this stupid issue. the xbox help page is of no help what so ever.</p>

<p>Hey there, I would suggest updating all your details by singing-in at the following link:
<a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">commerce.microsoft.com</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also double check in the top right hand corner that your currency is in AU and not US as this would be a quick tell if you're set to the correct region or not. If it's in US you may have to migrate the region of you r account.</p>

    <title>Spikes of 100&#37; disk usage, 0 read&#47;write speed on a new SSD and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hufsahh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spikes of 100&#37; disk usage, 0 read&#47;write speed on a new SSD and clean Windows 10 installation</h2>
                    <p>This problem is apparently very common, but <strong>no</strong> solution I've found over the past several days has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This past week I put together a new PC and installed Windows 10 on a Kingston A400 SSD. During normal use, I found that the disk usage reported in Task manager (seemingly) randomly increased to 100%, stayed there for 5-50 seconds, then dropped down to 0-1%
 again. This causes any process running to freeze completely, only to be continued when the disk usage goes down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The obvious next step: What process is using the disk? None. No process, neither in Task manager nor Resource monitor, is using the disk to anywhere near its full capacity during these spikes. Also, read/write speeds are reported as 0 MB/s during the spikes,
 see image below.</p>
<p>The next obivous step: Find a solution on google. Haven't had any luck here, and I've found&nbsp; a&nbsp;<strong>lot</strong> of solutions. Disabling Superfetch (which does not exist on my system?), prefetch, Windows search, file indexing on the drive,&nbsp;<span>Message
 Signaled Interrupt (MSI) mode</span> (supposedly not relevant since my disk doesn't use the StorAHCI.sys driver), etc. There are a lot of solutions on the internet. I've probably tried all of them at this point. Please hit me up with one I haven't tried yet,
 if you know of one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other relevant info: There are no events in the system event log that appear to be at all relevant. No disk controller reset events or anything. I've tried updating and rolling back drivers, uninstalling programs, re-installing Windows. The SSD has got no
 firmware update available.</p>
<p>Currently the system has a completely clean installation of Windows (through a bootable USB), with&nbsp;<strong>no</strong> third-party drivers installed. Not even the motherboard's LAN driver is installed, so I'm sure Windows hasn't sneakily installed any drivers
 from the internet. The problem still exists. There's probably more I should mention, but it's getting hard to keep track of everything I've tried.<br />
</p>
<p>System info:</p>
<p>ASUS Prime Z390-a mobo</p>
<p>i5 9600K (not OC'd)</p>
<p>ASUS Dual GTX 1070 (in case that would be at all relevant)</p>
<p>Kingston A400 480 GB SSD</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I just want it to be a hardware issue, so I can send it back and get a new one, that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be extremely grateful for any sort of guidance, thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>More relevant info: the disk is healthy according to Windows disk error checking and Kingston's own software. System memory is also healthy according to Window's Memory diagnostic.</p>

            Hi Hufsahh, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />I had exactly this issue with exactly that same Kingston 480GB SSD just one week ago. I tried absolutely everything, disabling services and reinstalling Windows three times, manually inserting SATA drivers into the Windows installation and a whole lot of other attempted fixes.
<br />
<br />Nothing worked, so I then installed Windows 10 onto the SSD in another PC, and still had the same disk usage issue. That told me it was a hardware problem, so I returned the SSD and got a Samsung. No issues anymore.
<br />
<br />I completely understand your pain - it's infuriating because the drive works and installs Windows and runs! But the freezing issue just wouldn't go away, and it was killing me for three days until I relented and returned the drive.
<br />
<br />The store assistant told me he's seen many Kingston SSDs returned for this very reason, so I think it would be safe to assume your issue is a faulty drive.
<br />
<br />Hopefully that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. Thanks!

            <p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I have tried most of what you suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rolled back the driver, worst performance.</p>
<p>Driver is current.</p>
<p>Looked at all setting.</p>
<p>Ran the network fix utility no problems</p>
<p>Reinstalled Driver</p>
<p>Ran Network troubleshooter no problems</p>
<p>Made tweaks here and there based upon Web surfing.&nbsp; It seems like many many people have issues with wifi performance windows 10 so there is nothing new here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it is the realtech adapter.&nbsp; Hardly any information on that device.&nbsp; Other suppliers that use it have many complaints.&nbsp; Granted this is a cheap tablet but it has reasonable specs and should run a wireless connection faster than listed on this thread.&nbsp;
 I have about 10 machines on the network and all get relatively good connection speeds, however, micorsoft is always last compared to apple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I will turn off firewalls, and run networking commands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should be embarrassing for Microsoft because this is a huge difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were buying comparing say a Micosoft Surface Pro to an iPad Pro no comparison Apple wins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The properties on the adapter states apprx 75 Mbps spec.</p>

            <p>So thinking about what Microsoft said about blaming the hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Tablet is dual boot-able between Android and Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I launched Android and ran the wireless connection speed test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Results were 100% better than Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ipv4&nbsp;&nbsp; 19.3 Mbps download 6.0 upload</p>
<p>ipv6&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.4 Mpbs download 7.3 upload</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly the Windows 10 architecture has performance wireless connection issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No one seems to have a fix or explanation for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree&nbsp; this cheap tablet has limitations but its specs show it has the capability to perform up to 72Mbps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to take a look at this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi - I hope somebody can help you with the IE issue - not my field, but as regards the location - Pictures is the name of the library so it would be less likely to cause future muddle if you named your folder 'images' (that's what I use) - but you are
 still not necessarily out of the woods because if you use 'photo gallery' to edit pictures it will put 'images' straight back in your library. I was trying to avoid using the library altogether and if you don't use photo gallery you might find you are OK (but
 still avoid using 'Pictures' as a name - the danger is you may think something has duplicated when it hasn't and delete it!) - Hope this helps and good luck with the LNK issue... Ric.

            <p>Thank you for the reply, Ric.&nbsp; I finally just called a repair place, and will take the whole thing in to them.&nbsp; The thing is, my husband passed away two years ago.&nbsp; He was the one who took care of the computer. So I just recently (after the IE nightmare)
 started digging around and realized there are some pictures in 14 different files! So, I'm trying to move all of them to one place and delete a lot of them from the 14X places they are now.&nbsp; But thanks for the "image" idea. I&nbsp;will &nbsp;try it once this thing is
 working again.</p>

            <p>Barb - Thanks for the update; hope the repair place sorts out the IE issue and then if you want a bit more direction for sorting the picture folders&nbsp;please come back to this thread... if it's a while you'll be able to find it most easily by going to your
 profile page, or by keeping the notification email and going in from there. I'll keep my email link to it so that I'll also be updated.</p>
<p>The main thing with the folder reorganization is ensuring nothing precious is lost accidentally along the way. We hear of too much of that here, and it can be so distressing for the loser...</p>
<p>All the best - Ric.</p>

<p>EDIT: Here's another link for a video interview with the AC:R creative director. AC3 will be coming after AC:R, and it almost sounds like they'll do another "character trilogy" like what they've been doing with Ezio:</p>

<p>I'm not too concerned with it. Altair was fake-stabbed by Al Mualim in AC1, Ezio was stabbed (twice) in AC2, and he was shot in AC:B. I expect Lucy to stay in the story until AC3, anyway.</p>

<p>By the way, has anyone read the June issue of Game Informer? There's a big story on AC:R, but I haven't received my issue yet.</p>

<p>Have you checked the specific Autoplay settings for CDs an DVDs including the program\file associations for the different kinds of media they can hold? Windows has to know what to do with different file types, e.g. MP3s, MP4s JPGs etc.</p>

<h2>            Critical Error Messages</h2>
                    <p>The Critical Error message occurs when I open Windows10 and press the Windows icon or the Edge Icon.&nbsp; Then the following is displayed: Your Start menu isn't working.&nbsp; We'll try to fix it the next time you sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I sign in again, no change and I get the exact error message.&nbsp; This has happened repeatedly.&nbsp; I have tried to repair using the control panel, but nothing changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a SurfacePro3.&nbsp; I need the PC now and can not send it in for repair.&nbsp; The MS Store limits appointments to 15 minutes and needs to send it in for diagnosis.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What options do I have and how can I personally reset the Windows10 system.</p>

</p><p>I'm having the same problem. When I run the first command you mention, I get the following error:</p>

            I had this problem today after upgrading "successfully" from 8.1 to 10 about a week ago. Tried a number of solutions suggested in various forums but none worked until I set the system restore to a date just a few days ago. Everything is working OK again
 but I guess it could be temporary.

<h2>            How can I change back to Windows 7 professional from Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Help!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Windows 7 Pro until a few weeks ago and through all the advertising on line I changed without charge to windows 10. I do not like 10. It is very disappointing to me and I have regular problems like start up and sound and the mouse seems to go on strike
 as well from time to time. Printing also causes problems.&nbsp; Can I reinstall Windows 7 Pro and that will override/get rid off 10?</p>
<p>I am NOT very good on computers and my son has more or less given up on me "pressing the wrong buttons" !!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Provide us with the below details for better clarity.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Is the laptop able to connect to other Wi-Fi networks?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>The Wi-Fi network might not be configured properly after the update. I suggest you to remove the old network created and try creating a new mobile hotspot network with new credentials. Further, remove the network
 from the Laptop connections by selecting Forget network. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now connect to the new network from the Laptop and check if it gets connected.

            Hi MaryanYurchylyak,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Did your computer perform any updates prior to the issue happening? You can try to check if you can<strong> update the driver</strong> for your device by following the steps on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. If the issue still persist, check with your<strong> hardware manufacturer</strong> if there are any updated
 drivers for your gamepad. <br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I've tried both - driver updates for my device and for the gamepad. (For both tried to update it via Control Panel/PC_Management)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course Windows 10 installed several updates from last time i used this gamepad, so i can't properly say which of them now making this problem. The gamepad itself isn't broken - it works well on the other laptop with Windows 7.</p>

<p>Thanks for the update. If the gamepad works on a different operating system, then the problem would most likely be the drivers. I suggest you get in touch with the hardware manufacturer since they might have a new driver that's compatible with your operating
 system.</p>

 disconnected all unnecessary peripherals leaving only the mouse and keyboard connected.

<p><strong>Started 2 days ago. &nbsp;Both Firefox and IE 7 would not consistently load http sites. &nbsp;After an hour or so they all loaded, and all was normal. &nbsp;Today (1-22-2001) repeated reboots of computer and restarts of browsers will not allow http sites to load;
 https sites load fast and perfect, so internet connection (Comcast cable) is OK. &nbsp;Internet on wife's Mac on same network (Linskys wired router) works perfect. &nbsp;Had made no settings changes in browser or internet account settings.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Hiiiiii everyone,</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I suggest trying Internet Explorer without add-ons to see if one may be causing the issue.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.
 This article describes how to troubleshoot problems in Windows Vista by performing a clean boot. This article also describes how to start the Windows Installer service and how to reset the computer so that it starts as usual.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original
 behavior.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer
 unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong><span>Start</span>&nbsp;</strong><span>Collapse this image</span>&nbsp;<span>Expand this image</span>&nbsp;, type&nbsp;<strong>msconfig.exe</strong>&nbsp;in
 the&nbsp;<strong><span>Start Search</span>&nbsp;</strong>box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Collapse this image</span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>Expand this image</span>&nbsp;</span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click&nbsp;<strong><span>Continue</span>&nbsp;</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On the&nbsp;<strong><span>General</span>&nbsp;</strong>tab, click&nbsp;<strong><span>Selective Startup</span>&nbsp;</strong>, and then
 click to clear the&nbsp;<strong><span>Load startup items</span></strong>check box. (The&nbsp;<strong><span>Use Original Boot.ini</span>&nbsp;</strong>check box is unavailable.)</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On the&nbsp;<strong><span>Services&nbsp;</span></strong>tab, click to select the&nbsp;<strong><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span>&nbsp;</strong>check
 box, and then click<strong><span>Disable all</span>&nbsp;</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore
 points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong><span>OK</span>&nbsp;</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong><span>Restart</span>&nbsp;</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click the&nbsp;<strong><span>Services</span>&nbsp;</strong>tab, and then click to select the&nbsp;<strong><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span>&nbsp;</strong>check
 box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click to select half of the check boxes in the&nbsp;<strong><span>Service</span>&nbsp;</strong>list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong><span>OK</span>&nbsp;</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong><span>Restart</span>&nbsp;</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the&nbsp;<strong><span>Service</span>&nbsp;</strong>list.<br />
<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the&nbsp;<strong><span>Service</span>&nbsp;</strong>list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check
 boxes.<br />
<br />
If only one service is selected in the&nbsp;<strong><span>Service</span>&nbsp;</strong>list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Perform a clean boot by repeating step 1.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click the&nbsp;<strong><span>Startup</span>&nbsp;</strong>tab, and then click to select half of the check boxes in the&nbsp;<strong><span>Startup
 Item</span>&nbsp;</strong>list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong><span>OK</span>&nbsp;</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong><span>Restart</span>&nbsp;</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the&nbsp;<strong><span>Startup Item</span>&nbsp;</strong>list.<br />
<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the&nbsp;<strong><span>Startup Item</span>&nbsp;</strong>list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check
 boxes.<br />
<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the&nbsp;<strong><span>Startup Item</span>&nbsp;</strong>list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the&nbsp;<strong><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span>&nbsp;</strong>check
 box in either step.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration Utility, and then click to clear the
 check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 7: Reset the computer to start as usual</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></p>
<p><span>Click&nbsp;<strong><span>Start</span>&nbsp;</strong><span>Collapse this image</span>&nbsp;<span>Expand this image</span>&nbsp;, type&nbsp;<strong>msconfig.exe</strong>&nbsp;in the<strong><span>&nbsp;Start
 Search</span>&nbsp;</strong>box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Collapse this image</span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>Expand this image</span>&nbsp;</span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click&nbsp;<strong><span>Continue</span>&nbsp;</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>On the&nbsp;<strong><span>General</span>&nbsp;</strong>tab, click the&nbsp;<strong><span>Normal Startup</span>&nbsp;</strong>option, and then click&nbsp;<strong><span>OK</span>&nbsp;</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click&nbsp;<strong><span>Restart</span>&nbsp;</strong>.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span><br />
