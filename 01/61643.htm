<p><span>Hi Bentley96,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Did you recently make any changes (software/hardware) on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Check power and volume</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you have external speakers connected to your laptop, make sure they're plugged in to a working power source and turned on.</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure that your speaker volume or headphone volume isn't muted or turned down too low. This is particularly important for laptops, which often
 have small speakers that can be hard to hear.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Windows&nbsp;7</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the Start button, click Control Panel, click Hardware and Sound, and then, under Sound, click Adjust system volume.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Move
 the slider up to increase the volume.</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure the Mute button isn't turned on.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, make sure your headphones aren't plugged into the line out (headphone) jack of your sound card or computer (unless you want to be listening
 with headphones rather than speakers). When you plug in headphones, most computers automatically cut the sound to the speakers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If these steps don't solve the problem, check the information that came with your computer or speakers, or go to the manufacturer's website.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Re-install sound drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start; in the start search type devmgmt.msc and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Expand
 Sound, video and game controllers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the Audio component and click on Uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once the audio drivers are completely uninstalled, download and install the latest drivers from your computer manufacturer website or
 sound card manufacturer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additional information:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>No sound in Windows</span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 is the buggiest, worst operating system ever. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 is the buggiest, worst operating system ever.</h2>
                    Windows 8.1 and 8 are garbage. People are paying hundreds of dollars to buy these pieces of junk since you've stopped selling Windows 7. The least they can expect is an operating system that works. Windows 8 and 8.1 don't. The lazy **** at Microsoft apparently
 don't look at these forums because year old problems STILL have not been resolved. They've failed to implement user suggestions. First of all, the Charms bar and Start button constantly stop responding. The mouse gestures stop working for the charms bar, and
 the Start button doesn't react to clicks. I have to restart Explorer from Task Manager. This is ANNOYING. As far as I know, this problem has been reported 2 years ago. I hasn't been fixed. Also, icons in dialog boxes are glitched. A simple problem which was
 reported 2 years ago, too. Deleting files (e.g. Text documents) will produce a broken icon in the delete confirmation dialog box. Transparent icons mostly glitch, too. WHY was a Windows 7 reminiscent start menu NEVER added?

    <title>Microsoft Surface Pro glitches when switching between tablet and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kf78  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Surface Pro glitches when switching between tablet and laptop modes</h2>
                    <p>I've had this problem ever since receiving my surface pro 4, which had been newly bought at the time.</p>
<p>I often have many windows open when I am working on my surface. Whenever I switch between tablet and laptop modes, however, the screen will continuously glitch, switching rapidly between the multiple windows I have open. The icons on the bottom home bar
 - the "people" icon in particular - will also glitch and flash erratically and repeatedly. Tapping the screen will stop the continuous switching of windows if I'm lucky, though it will take a few tries and the bottom icons will still continue to flash for
 a short while afterwards. Many times this does not work, however, and I will have to resort to clicking other icons, such as the task manager one on the home bar, until the glitching stops. When this doesn't work, I usually just switch the surface back and
 try again.</p>
<p>Restarting doesn't work, unfortunately. Judging from the way this has been happening since I received a new product, I believe this is some deeper-rooted problem? Could google chrome have something to do with this? Usually I have multiple chrome windows
 open at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help and advice!<br />

            Hi Kf78, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />I'd recommend updating your Surface Pro 4's drivers to the latest version, to see if it resolves the issue. Here's a download link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=49498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/detail...</a>
<br />
<br />You could also see if the System File Checker can repair any system files:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type cmd.
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />- Type sfc /scannow
<br />- Press Enter.
<br />
<br />I'd also see if the problem persists in Safe Mode:

<br />
<br />Let me know how you go! Thanks!

    <title>Windows live mail photo albums - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows live mail photo albums</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 7 with Windows live mail and hotmail.&nbsp; I do not want or like my photos being put on Skydrive.&nbsp; I do not want or like the "photo Albums",&nbsp; I know I can attach the photos the "old fashion way" but as I am trying to send about 8 photos at once,
 the attachment is taking forever to send.&nbsp; How can I resize all of these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have never had this problem before.&nbsp; I have always used an older programme "Microsoft Digial Image Suite - Library" to reduce the size of emailed photos, until now.&nbsp; It will still let me use that programme, however, even though I tell it to reduce the
 size this does not happen and still it puts it in an allbum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not want this, please help.&nbsp; Or am I going to have to send my photos singularly every time!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help a silversurfer who is not interested in having my photos floating about on the worldwide web!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Your doing just fine but the problem is,</p>
<p>You have windows live mail installed that was included in windows live essentials 2011 that is asking you to sign in,</p>
<p>But your using web-based live hotmail (which I do as well) and as you say adding regular attachments is a one at a time function in live hotmail,</p>
<p>You can't add photos the way you want to because of this conflict,</p>
<p>Does it still add these files to your albums even though you attach them one at a time in live hotmail ?</p>
<p>Just to check,</p>
<p>Open a new email,</p>
<p>Click on the paper clip attachment listing,</p>
<p>Navigate to the folder where your files are and you want to send,</p>
<p>Hold the ctrl key while you left click on the photo thumbnails, if you need to scroll down the page to find more photos, release the ctrl key while you do this, and repeat hold the ctrl key and left click additional files, then click on the open listing.</p>
<p>Once that is done the email page will open and should say add to album but it should also say no thanks next to it,
</p>
<p>And file size option is on the right end of it with large medium.</p>
<p>But regardless if you hold the ctrl key down you can add more files at the same time.</p>
<p>The recipients interface will differ between their email accounts, but they usually will offer separate file&nbsp;view or&nbsp;download options and a download all option,</p>
<p>If they use live mail (the version you and I do not use) this process will be different.</p>

<br />
I have an issue which I am not sure how to fix. <br />
For the past week I am getting the blue screen of death and today while playing WoW, my PC shut down on me and upon rebooting I saw this message<em>" Enabeling Unleashing mode failed "</em><br />
<br />
I have been reading on several sites and forums and this seems to be a overclocking issue? which I don't know what it is or how to go by to fix it.<br />
<br />
<br />
My PC stats are as following:<br />
CPU: AMD Athlon(tm) II X2 245 Processor (2900.23 MHz)<br />

I would appreciate if someone could help me to find a solution to this problem,<br />

Thank you</span><br />

<h2>            The parameters are incorrect</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to copy Turbo Tax 2008 from my desktop to my laptop. I transferred the information onto a USB flash drive and then installed the flash drive onto my laptop. I can see Turbo Tax but when I try to open, get the message "The parameters are incorrect".
 I then tried to transfer to my laptop on a CD and again directly from my exteral hard drive. Still get the same message. I have a Dell with Windows 7 installed. Any suggestions?</p>

            You can't copy a program from one computer to another and expect it to work.&nbsp; When a program installs, it puts files all over the place in the Windows folders and in the registry which you eon't know to copy (or be able to copy).&nbsp; It must be
 need to right click on the icon and then click on run as administrator).&nbsp; I don't know&nbsp;if the download allows itself to be installed more than once or if there is a serial number which must be registered to make the program work (this you will have to get
 from the TurboTax people from their technical support department which can be reached by going to the same place you got te download and looking for Contact or Support.&nbsp; If you have a disk, just&nbsp;use it to do the re-installation (again noting that it might
 not work a second time without assistance from TurboTax personnel).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, then please repost your question in the Windows7 Forums at:
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/windows7</a>&nbsp;where people who specialize in Windows7 issues will be more than happy to assist you with your problem.&nbsp; This
 is a Vista forum and they are the experts on Windows7 which is what you are using.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!

<h2>            Skype Improvement - DTMF - Skype does not allow putting in Pauses,, &#34;&#35;&#34; and addtional Numbers</h2>
                    <p>Skype is a great product, but I have a suggestion to make it even better.&nbsp; I work from home and have at least five regular meetings all with different hostcodes and security pins.&nbsp; On my cell phone I have my contacts where I can have my phone dial all the
 way in with codes.&nbsp; (Much safer while driving).&nbsp; When I work from home, I still have to look up the pins and passcodes for the various meetings.&nbsp; Since one of the 1-800 numbers is used for multiple meetings, I can't even setup a shortcut for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an undocumented way to do this?&nbsp; Is there&nbsp;a plugin or an add in?</p>
<p>If not please add this to your feature request.</p>

            You can download updates through the Microsoft Update Catalog then manually install them. Learn how in the following article:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manually-install-standalone-cumulative-updates-virus-definitions-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manually-insta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to manage how and when Windows Updates are installed in Windows 10, review:
<br />
<br />See options for managing how and when Windows Updates are installed.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Set your Internet connection as metered:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Use Active Hours and Restart options:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windows-update-behavior-using-active-hours-and-restart-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 3: 
<br />
<br />Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />Option 4:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to DIsabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Option 5:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the ‚ÄúENTER‚Äù key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Windows 10 periodically checks for updates so you don‚Äôt have to. When an update is available, it‚Äôs automatically downloaded and installed, keeping your device up to date with the latest features.Ôªø
<br />
<br />To check for updates now, select the Start  button, and then go to Settings  &gt; Update &amp; security  &gt; Windows Update, and select Check for updates. If Windows Update says your device is up to date, you have all the updates that are currently available.
<br />
<br />Please let me know, if that helps.

                    I'd swear that at one time I could see my own (adult) Xbox activity report on the family safety website, however now I can't find it anywhere.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to add monitoring for adults and not just children? Need to keep an eye on my own screen time habits as well!<br />
<br />
/David<br />
<br />
PS there appears to be no category that fits this question - heck there's not even one for Xbox!

                    The type is really small to read. I don't want to set the fonts etc bigger in the set-up .
<br />
The "percentages" of 100%, 125% 150% 200%, seem to have disappeared with the upagrade to IE8

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Can you still see the other Skype contacts and you previous conversations? If not, most likely you‚Äôre signed in to a different Skype account linked
 to your email address. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Skype contacts and conversations should show if you sign in to Skype app.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Enter your registered
<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">email address here</span></a> to check the correct Skype account that you‚Äôre using. You can also enter all you active email addresses.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If you created your Skype account with a unique or personalized Skype Name, always sign in to Skype using the Skype Name and not the email address.
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I look forward to your response.

            I'm having the same problem as the original poster. I went through the process of merging my email address account (my "Microsoft account") and my original Skype username (my "Skype account"); I assumed that by doing this, the contacts would be merged.
 The two people I was trying to Skype with today had to send me contact requests in order for me to be able to Skype with them, and, in addition to the Echo Test service, they are the only contacts in my contact list. How can I retrieve the rest of my previous
 contacts?<br />

            Same problem. Old Skype on old devices working properly, new computer, windows 10, new Skype, generating new empty address book with the same e-mail for the same account (Skype diagnostics says I only have 1 account associated with the e-mail). When logging
 in from my phone with the e-mail, i have full contacts. When logging in from new windows 10 pc - nothing is present. So,<br />
I fixed it for myself: <br />
<br />
1. Since my phone could still log in with the old Skype, where I had all my contacts, I just opened my profile and added in my phone number (you can use phone number as login credential, remember?).
<br />
2. This phone number got associated with the correct account.<br />
3. I then logged in with phone number to other devices and it worked, getting all my history and contacts back.
<br />
<br />
Hope this works for everyone else, as well. I've gone through dozens of forums and sites that refer to this issue, and all I could find was people struggling with no success, and of-course the useless Microsoft support responses with the same repetitive diagnostic
 questions, with the same advice and not a single thread was found helpful, not just to me, but it seems like - to everyone, basically. It has come to my attention that Microsoft pays little respect to its customers (unless the problem concerns a lot of money),
 as this problem has been around for awhile now and there seems to be no fix to it. Imagine how frustrating it can be, when you lose hundreds of contacts and are unable to work around like I did (e.g. you lost the device, where you had saved your original Skype
 account). If MS keeps doing flawed updates and "upgrades" I'm gonna be forced to overlook my trusty relationship with their OS and software, for good : )))) check yourselves MS :)<br />

<p>Thanks for Posting this, I haven't tried it yet but it's the only solution that I have seen... I have experienced this same problem and ended up not installing Windows 10 or Windows 8 or the update for Skype... I rolled it back to the previous version and
 now have all of my contacts and also all of the various Contact Lists that I have built up over the years that I have been using Skype... Banking Contacts , Engineering Contacts, and The Family and Friends contact List... Losing all those Lists was the Problem...
 Even though I still had "All" the Contacts... The "All" Contact List was the only one that I had ... and There did not seem to be a way of creating New Breakdowns of That list into the sub categories that I mentioned above... Yep!! I totally agree that MS
 has completely lost sight of it's customers wants and needs and is treating us all with contempt!...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somany people have left skype and are using other messaging facilities for texting... But I am not a Texter I prefer to Talk to People by phone or in person and only use Texting as a last resort to get a message through when The Internet and/or phone lines
 are not working properly... The message usually gets sent when everything is back up and running... and of course Computer to Phone is cheaper than Phone to Phone But The Skype Conference Calls were and are still great, and were the Item that drove other Commercial
 organisations to develop their Conference Call Software... Probably MS has Shares or Intentions to buy them up too... So people can't communicate properly unless they are in the ELITE and have Heaps of Spare Cash!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your Sollution as you say... NS had better watch out or they will lose the lot!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other Systems Now and The more people that shift to them the better they will get!...</p>

<p><span>Most likely you are signed in to a different Skype account. Probably the one linked to your registered email address.

</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>is due Windows Update client is not updated.<br />
<br />
you need start your PC totally disconnected from internet (to avoid Windows Update service connect to Microsoft Servers) and then install this updates manally....<br />

once both updates are installed, you can connect to internet again, and Windows Update should start to works normally again.</p>

            Hi George, this is a known error . . .
<br />
<br />The solution is to basically recreate that file and put an exit script into it 
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />On the View Ribbon, temporarily turn on 'Hidden Items'
<br />
<br />Navigate to: 
<br />
<br />C:\programdata\windows\profile 
<br />
<br />Right click in that folder and choose New - Text Document 
<br />
<br />Put this text in that file: 
<br />
<br />Wscript.Quit 
<br />
<br />Then click File - Save As 
<br />
<br />At the bottom of the save as dialog, set save as type to *.* 
<br />
<br />Save the files as 1.vbs 
<br />
<br />Note you must enter the vbs file extension yourself 
<br />
<br />Restart your PC

<h3> knot2old  say:</h3>
<h2>            Erratic Mouse Behavior Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>In November 2013 i Upgraded to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8 without realising the implications in that it also upgraded Internet Explorer as well. &nbsp;Up to this time i had played an online game &nbsp;"Jewel Quest Online Party" which is a spin off, of the Jewel Quest
 Series of Games. &nbsp;I played this game on the IWin website against other players overseas. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since i upgraded i have been unable to play due to Erratic Mouse Behavior, the mouse acts like it is drunk and it is very hard to control to even play the game. The erratic mouse behavior only occurs in this game. I think it has something to do with the
 1 Click process on the mouse that is in Windows now but that i am not sure of. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reported the matter to IWin technical Support in November and so far they have been unable to fix the issue so that i can play this game. &nbsp;I really love this game and i have made a number of friends overseas that i miss talking to and playing against.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried downloading a patch from Microsoft for Gaming Issues in November but that has made no difference at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas as to how i can fix this issue or whether it is fixable. &nbsp;I play with a Cable Mouse, but the issue is still there if i use a Wireless Mouse also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could occur because Windows 8.1 introduced changes to mouse input processing for low latency interaction scenarios. Therefore, games respond to mouse inputs differently in Windows 8.1 than in previous versions of Windows.</p>

            I'm getting a slightly different problem, but it troubles me deeply and I feel it's related.<br />
<br />
I just got a machine with Windows 8.1, seemed to have updated all I need too, but even BEOFRE AND AFTER I seem to get this issue where the mouse control is intermittent. It's not a bad mouse, and it will happen within the same smooth push of the mouse as well.
 It happened durring the very set up and start up of windows 8 on this brand new machine, and then it's happened again the second day when I came back from the monitor going dark from being away from the machine as planned, monitor comes up fine but then m
 y mouse control becomes off and on functioning like a weak computer would that was struggling with several applications.<br />
<br />
Some how I don't think this can be blamed on it being a weak computer with twin gtx 980x GPU's and one of the much more recent i7 processors packed with 16gigs of ram...<br />
<br />
I would really like to know what could even possibly be causing this, and then what should be done about it. I sure hope it won't be something ongoing, and if it is further, that people wouldn't be expected to make down right engineer grade changes by having
 to go into the registry to fix it... <br />

    <title>Development of Quechua Language Pack for Windows 7 and 8.1&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Development of Quechua Language Pack for Windows 7 and 8.1&#58; participating institutions</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am a graduate student of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and I currently work on my thesis about the lexical modernization of Southern Quechua (the Quechua variety spoken in Bolivia and Southern regions of Peru). According to what I know, Microsoft
 Local Language Program was assisted in the development of Quechua Language Pack by specialists from three Peruvian universities, but I haven't found any reference, where these universities and specialists would be exactly named. Please, if anyone knows more
 about this subject or knows where it is possible to draw more information, I would be very grateful for your help. In addition, if the list of participants, who worked on the Quechua Language Pack, changed depending on a version of Windows published (Vista,
 7, 8)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gregory</p>

                    Everything was OK when I first set up the two other accounts with the Win 8&nbsp;Mail. But now I can only see mail in my Inbox from two days ago. I know that there are new emails available to read as they show on my smartphone. &nbsp;I have checked&nbsp;to ensure that
 all the Syncs are set to 'on' the in &nbsp;'Change PC Settings' on the Charms menu. Is there anything else I should try ?&nbsp;

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;My laptop is trying to do a Windows update but is having issues doing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I troubleshooted Windows Update and fixed a couple of issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to run updates again and get this error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Intel - net - 3/12/2018 12:00:00 AM - 19.51.12.3 - Error 0x8007001f</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what this is or means? Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked 'Retry' and it now appears to be preparing to download a features update to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few other updates there that say 'waiting to install' but I don't see a way to just click 'install now'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what version of Windows 10 are you running?
<br />
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Windows Updates
<br />
<br />What update(s) are showing as pending on your system?

            Hi Black Dahlia, 1709 is no longer the latest version of Windows 10, 1803 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:

<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

    <title>Windows 8.1 Graphics Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dgwynn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Graphics Problem</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently upgraded to Windows 8.1 and have noticed a couple of problems I can't seem to rectify. My computer is an Acer Aspire R7-571. I have an Intel(R) HD graphics 4000 card which is not operational after the upgrade (device manager shows an error message
 with "code 43" under device status). Features such as changing resolution are not available so, as a result, I cannot use a VGA adapter for video projection. I have followed the suggestion from other posts (as this seems to be common with many after the upgrade)
 to replace the driver from 10.18.10.3304 to 10.18.10.3316 to no avail. I have also tried numerous times to uninstall and re-install the driver with no success. There is no mention of a fix on Acer's, Intel's or Microsoft's websites that seem to work, if available
 at all. I have also noticed that there is no sleep mode option available under power option and, instead, my computer can only be powered off or enter hibernation mode. Another post from someone with this similar problem suggested the possibility that the
 2 are related. Anyone have any suggestions? If more information is needed, let me know.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
                </div>

            <p>‚ÄãHi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all I would like to appreciate you for providing detailed information about the issue. And I understand how it feels when you are trying to experience the new features in Windows 8.1 and if it does not help you with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to be an issue with the Graphics card driver compatibility. I would suggest you to download the drivers from the Acer website and then try installing it compatibility mode and check if it works for you.</p>
<p>Download the Windows 8 drivers from Acer website:<br />
<a href="http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode. <span>
</span></p>
<p><span><font>Follow the steps to install in Compatibility mode:</font></span></p>
<p><span><span><font>a.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><font>Right click the driver installation file and select Properties then tap or click the Compatibility tab.</font></span></p>
<p><span><span><font>b.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><font>Place a check in the Run this program in compatibility mode for: box.
</font></span></p>
<p><span><span><font>c.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><font>Tap or click the drop down box and select a previous operating system, then tap or click OK.</font></span></p>
<p><span><span><font>d.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><font>Try installing the driver and check.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>P</span><span>lease reply with the status of the issue, so that we could help you better.</span></p>

            Hi Basith,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately, it was unsuccessful. I tried the compatibility mode for both the 3304 (as obtained from the Acer website) and the 3316 driver under both Windows 8 and Windows 7 without success. I also tried to re-install the original
 driver that was on it when I bought the PC (as obtained from a store model) but my computer states it now does not meet the minimum hardware requirements (I don't know what hardware would have changed from a software upgrade). That specific driver was Intel
 9.17.10.3062, if it matters. Any other suggestions?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Again, thanks for the help,</div>
<div>Don</div>

            I too have this exact same issue using the same laptop.&nbsp; I've tried all variations both from Acer and from Intel but I too receive the message that "it now does not meet the minimum hardware requirements."

            P.S. - In addition to the steps taken since my first reply to your message, I have also tried to update the BIOS from ver. 2.04 to 2.08 (the most recent version available for my model from Acer). Still no change.

            Hi JohnP,
<div>I just found a fix that you may be interested in that works, at least until an 8.1 patch comes out. Go to Acer's download site,&nbsp;enter your computer's model and download the Intel driver for Windows 8 (not Windows 8.1). After installing it, I have all my
 functionality back. If you don't have it, the link is below.</div>
