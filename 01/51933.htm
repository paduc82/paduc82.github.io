    <title>Cannot Boot Windows Except with &#34;Disable Driver Signature - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot Boot Windows Except with &#34;Disable Driver Signature Enforcement&#34; Option</h2>
                    
<p>I installed the lates ATI drivers on the computer in July and since then I have been unable to boot the computer except by using the option in the title. If i boot windows any other way, including the three Safe Mode options, all that happens is it crashes
 and then loads the Windows Startup Repair. However this sits there saying that it is attempting repairs for several hours and then asks to send information to MS - at which point the &amp;*%$ HP recovery software kicks in and prevents me from clicking the send
 button.</p>
<p>I tried running system restore back in July but I was unable to restore the system for reasons which I cant work out, I just get an error message saying "Restore could not be completed, the system has not been changed".</p>
<p>I have recently installed the latest ATI drivers (10.8) and that hasn't helped, nor has installing the drivers from the manufacturers website (HP Touchsmart TX2-1340ea).</p>
<p>In device manager there is no Yellow ! and Windows reports that the drivers have valid signatures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am wondering whether uninstalling the drivers back in July removed another driver that I hadn't noticed. Is there a program or tool available from Microsoft to scan for drivers that are corrupt or have improper signatures to help me locate the problem
 driver?</p>
<p>Hopefully someone will be able to help, as I am currently at a loss, and would very much prefer to not have to use the recovery partition to reset the laptop back to the way it was when I bought it.</p>

            Just to be clear, did you install Ati drivers provided by HP, version 8.632.0.0? and if so in Device Manager under Display Adapters do properties show this driver vesion?

            8.632.0.0 is the current driver version installed yes. I found the sigverif.exe tool and ran it, but the only unsigned signatures it found were the modem driver which has been reinstalled from win update&nbsp; but hasn't fixed the problem, and a file called
 wdfcoinstaller01009.dll, which doesn't seem to exist in the directory listed by the tool.

<p>Hi TCWORLD,</p>
<p>I suggest&nbsp;disabling&nbsp;your anti-virus temporarily and attempting to reinstall the drivers.</p>
<p>You need to uninstall the anti-virus temporarily to fully disable it, provided you have the means to reinstall the software afterwards.</p>

<p>I have managed to get it to boot in Safe Mode by using msconfig, and then selecting Disable Driver Signature... from the F8 menu. From that I managed to work out where the problem possibly lies. This is an extract from ntbootlg.txt from before getting Safe
 Mode to work but after the problem began:<br />
Loaded driver \SystemRoot\system32\DRIVERS\pciide.sys<br />
Loaded driver \SystemRoot\system32\DRIVERS\amdide64.sys</p>
<p>When booting Safe Mode the loaded drivers stream by and then it freezes at PCIIDE.sys . This is where it crashes when booting normally. After about 30 seconds after it freezes, with Disable Driver Signature Enforcement option selected, the next device is
 AMDIDE.sys , then AMDIDE64.sys</p>
<p>Could this be where I am having problems, and if so how would I go about fixing it? (According to sigverif.exe amdide.sys has a valid signature)</p>

<p>Hi TCWORLD,</p>
<p>I suspect this has something to do with the touchscreen aspect of your laptop.</p>
<p>You might try rolling back the driver on the video card to see if the former driver works.</p>
<p>If HP has a special driver to compensate for the&nbsp;touchscreen&nbsp;(which I do not know) it may&nbsp;adversely&nbsp;effect the functionality of the device.</p>
<p>Upon checking the HP support site for your model laptop, I see there are several drivers that may be specific to your laptop:</p>
<p><span><span style="font-weight: bold">N-Trig DuoSense Digitizer Software and Driver</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="font-weight: bold"><span><span style="font-weight: bold">AMD USB Filter Driver</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="font-weight: bold"><span><span style="font-weight: bold"><span><span style="font-weight: bold">Synaptics TouchPad
 Driver</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="font-weight: bold"><span><span style="font-weight: bold"><span><span style="font-weight: bold"><span><span style="font-weight: bold">Realtek
 RTL8168C/8111C Family PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet NIC Driver</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I would start by making sure those HP drivers were installed on your laptop, provided you have those options.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the same problem with my Sony Vaio running Windows 7 Home Premium (64 bit).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I couldn't find it in accessories and search also couldn't find it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the "Tablet PC Components" and it was already selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried running System File Checker, as suggested in another thread, but it made no difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried typing 'sticky' and 'stiky' in the search box and nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then went to <strong>C:\Windows\System32\StikyNot.exe</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;and found it there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even after running it and creating a desktop shortcut, I still didn't get any search results when I typed 'stiky'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I found that if I typed 'StikyNot' in the search box, it would find it, which is not very helpful given that I had to know, and type, the whole name,&nbsp;in order to get a result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also note from another thread that several other gadgets which are supposed to be standard&nbsp;in Accessories are also missing on my laptop but I'll save that for another day.</p>

<h2>            Bose QuietComfort 35 Wireless Headphones</h2>
                    Since the first day I bought my Headphones I had "problems" with the audio being BAD. Like blown out speakers my bose would quickly make me feel like I had been scammed. The only reason I did not return them was because 1 out of 100 times it would pair
 it with my bluetooth on my computer correctly and it would magically work. It would work 100% of the time on my phone . Finally today after 6 months of frustration I figured how to make the static and blown out noise go away. 1.) connect your Headphones to
 your PC's/Laptop's bluetooth. 2.) test with a song or anything *Note- if the connection message on the bluetooth page says "Setup Incomplete Because Of Metered COnnection" do not worry. 3.) If your headphones are STILL&nbsp;not working &nbsp;keep reading. 4.) Go to
 control panel 5.) select "Hardware &amp; Sound" 6.) select sound * a small window should pop up. You will notice that there are two options for your bose A.) Hands-Free B.) Stereo 7.) If the Hands-free option is selected then

            Hey there Lafume,<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to hear about the situation with the WD drive and the enclosure. I've been there and I know it's not pleasant at all. I'll try to help with whatever I can.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Could you please give me the model number of the drive (NOT the serial number - that shouldn't be published publicly) as well as the model number of the enclosure?<br />
Have you tried other drives with this enclosure? Other USB ports or possibly a whole other computer? Have you tested the drive internally or with another external enclosure or cable if it works at all? Can you feel it spinning up? Are there any strange noises?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I would recommend to try to rule out the drive as the potential cause of the problem first before heading to the enclosure. I would connect the drive to a working PC internally and see if it's recognized in the BIOS,
<a href="http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=ySSveO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Device Manager</a> and <a href="http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=Xw9K74" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Disk Management</a>. If it is I would try to back any data on the drive up and then proceed with some diagnostic tests. I would recommend using
<a href="http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=zn8Uqr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WD Data Lifeguard Diagnostic</a> tool for that and see if the drive passes both the quick and the extended tests.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Post back with some more info :)<br />
<br />
Cheers!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Captain_WD.

            <p>Hey Captain_WD,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off thanks for replying! Secondly the model # of the enclosure is EC-DFFN the model # of the drive is WD3200BPVT-55JJ5TO. Unfortunately I don't have other drives. I did try this on 2 computers and the result was the same. I think I can feel it spinning
 up. I didn't try it internally because I dont have a PC or another enclosure. There is a clicking noise when i turn on the power but then it stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks lots,</p>

            <p>Hello again :)<br />
<br />
I'd try getting a SATA to USB cable like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rEidVFW.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
one of these</a> and see if the drive gets recognized this way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.5" drive should have no problem getting enough power solely from the USB port so it should work. This should tell you if the problem is with the drive or with the enclosure. If you get to recognize the drive do run the tests. If they come back OK I'd contact
 the support of the dock station manufacturer and see what the guys there can say about this.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Every time I open the store app for Facebook, it closes after a few seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No other store app, including the Store app itself, exhibits this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 Version 1511 OS Build 10586.14.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I've tried so far (nothing works):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. uninstall Facebook and resintall</p>
<p>2. wsreset.exe (while running as Administrator)</p>
<p>3. wsreset.exe (not running as Administrator)</p>

</p><p>The Store app itself opens fine (otherwise, I wouldn't be able to reinstall Facebook).</p>

 call an "expert" at PowerShell, I am 100% certain of the fact that, at least in Windows 10, there is no such directory located at $env:SystemRoot\WinStore.<br />
</p>
<p>I suspect this is a bug in Windows 10 Version 1511, which appears to be problematic (and that's being generous on my part).</p>

            <p>Hello Fred,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>Appreciate the steps you have taken so far to fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to repair some files after performing SFC scan, I suggest you to refer “<em>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.</em></p>
<p><em>Details are included in the CBS.Log&nbsp;%WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log</em>”. Under the section “<em>Run the System
</em></p>
<p><em>File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</em>” to repair the corrupted files after performing SFC scan.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Disable Proxy Settings<br />
Windows Store apps won't work properly if you are using a proxy server. You may disable&nbsp;the proxy server and check. Follow the below steps.</p>
<p>a. Press Windows Key + R to open run command, type&nbsp;<strong>inetcpl.cpl</strong>.<br />
b.&nbsp;Under&nbsp;<strong>Internet Options,</strong>&nbsp;go to&nbsp;<strong>Connections&nbsp;</strong>tab.</p>
<p>c. Click on the&nbsp;<strong>LAN Settings&nbsp;</strong>button.<br />
d. Then uncheck the option&nbsp;<strong>Use a proxy server for your LAN</strong>.<br />
e.&nbsp;Click&nbsp;<strong>Apply</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If that does not help, if you are using a Microsoft Account,&nbsp;you may convert the account to a Local account and back to Microsoft account and check if you are then able to run the Windows Store app:</p>
<p>To convert the account, you can do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to your Microsoft account.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start&nbsp;</strong>and then&nbsp;<strong>PC settings</strong>.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Users and accounts&nbsp;</strong>and under&nbsp;<strong>Your Profile&nbsp;</strong>click&nbsp;<strong>Disconnect&nbsp;</strong>on the right of the screen.</li><li>Enter your Microsoft account's password, and click on&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Type in a Username, Password, and Password Hint that you want set for your Local account and click&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;<strong>Sign out and Finish</strong>&nbsp;button.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In order to switch back, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the newly converted Local account, click&nbsp;<strong>Start&nbsp;</strong>and then&nbsp;<strong>PC Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Users and accounts&nbsp;</strong>and under&nbsp;<strong>Your Profile&nbsp;</strong>click&nbsp;<strong>Connect to a Microsoft account</strong>.</li><li>Enter the&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft account ID&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Password</strong>&nbsp;and click&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Choose if you want OneDrive as your default file saving location, click&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Switch</strong>.</li></ol>

<p>

<span>Hi Delade,</span></p>
<p>

<p>
<span>Resetting your <strong>Wi-Fi router</strong> is one of the maintenance procedures that help refresh your network connectivity. In this way, it could eliminate latency and will return your network status like when you
 started using the Internet. To resolve your concern, we suggest that you reset your
<strong>TCP/IP</strong> or <strong>Internet Protocol</strong> to its default settings. To do this, follow the instructions below:</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3> reb308  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Notifications</h2>
                    I have Skype version 8.46.0.60 installed on my Dell laptop running Windows 7 and although I have all notifications turned on when someone sends my a message or calls I don't get notifications. No desktop alert, no audio alert, nothing. On my iphone - same
 thing. I go into Settings &gt; Skype and I have notifications turned on - sounds, badges, everything. When I run a test and send myself a chat off my phone it pops up on my laptop, but no alert, nothing. So when I have Skype minimized on my desktop and someone
 sends me a message or calls I have no idea anything is happening. Any ideas?

<p>Ayer se me acabó la membresía gold y como no tengo tarjeta de crédito, suelo comprar códigos en las tiendas. Sin embargo he visto que apareció otra opción de pago, donde se muestra el saldo de tu cuenta. ¿Se puede pagar la membresía anual de gold si compro
 un código de 100 mil pesos? ¿Es completamente seguro, es decir, no marcará error?</p>

I followed the steps you described and ran the update and got the error message "System must be eligible for MS DVD License"! So what do I do next?

    <title>How do I disable digital signature on windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leandropontes  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I disable digital signature on windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I see some related questions, but none have a solution for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that I need to install a certain driver for a monitor. Windows 10 sees the monitor as a generic monitor, and will not show the proper resolutions. I have the driver for windows 8, but on 10 it says it "does not contain digital signature information".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried disabling this through cmd with both "bdedit.exe /set nointegritychecks on" and "bcdedit.exe /set testsigning on". The first says &nbsp;it was successful. The other says the value is protected by Secure Boot policy and cannot be modified or deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried restarting the pc to get the Startup Settings, but the moment that is chosen and the pc restarts, it goes straight back to the windows booting, the screen where you can choose to disable the digital signature (which apparently is f7 from the list
 I saw somewhere) does not appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really at a loss here.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>* When you tell certain driver, which driver are you referring to?</span></p>
<p><span>If you are referring to display driver, then I suggest you to run “Hardware and Devices” troubleshooter to diagnose the exact issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press “<strong>Windows key + X”.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type <strong>“Troubleshooting”</strong> without quotes in the Search box and hit enter.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select <strong>“Hardware and Sound”</strong> from the Troubleshooter Window.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select <strong>“Hardware and Devices”</strong> under Devices option.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Follow the On Screen instructions.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers wouldn't update, since Windows doesn't let it, with it not being digitally signed. I somehow got it to show the Startup Settings. It wasn't showing when I used the monitor I was reffering to. Had to plug in the TV. Then the options showed (including
 the one to disable the Digital Signature checker).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since nothing happened, even after the driver was installed (i.e. I still couldn't choose resolutions), I tried the hardware troubleshooting. When I start it, the monitor restarts, as if the HDMI was unplugged. It shows the following screen after that:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/559e94a3-8fa2-4048-b0e7-53d991c8275f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/559e94a3-8fa2-4048-b0e7-53d991c8275f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I still cannot choose resolutions. And when I try the troubleshooter again, the same thing happens, the same "problem" is found, and "fixed". I heard that disabling the Digital Signature checking through the startup settings is just a temporary
 measure, and that everytime you restart you have to do that, so is that what is messing things up, and even though device manager now shows the proper name for the monitor (not just generic monitor), it's still seeing it as generic? I contacted the store that
 sold me the monitor, and I was told the only problem was the driver.</p>

            <p>Also, now I see that it was, in fact, temporary. After I thought the driver was properly installed, I went to Device Manager, and asked to update the monitor driver. The driver was "updated", and the monitor went from being recognized as the monitor it is
 (with the philips name and everything), back to "Generic non-pnp monitor". I really want to solve this permanently. Is there a way to permanently disable the Digital Signature checks?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, I had tried the cmd commands, but no luck. Secure Boot won't let me.</p>

            Wait nvm i figured it out. I just couldn't access boot manager by holding shift and restarting, but you can get to it if you search recovery options in windows settings and select restart now under advanced startup.&nbsp;

    <title>windows 10 OS running super slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scurry101  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 OS running super slow</h2>
                    <p>I have had windows 10 installed for about 2 months. This last few days Windows 10 started to run super slow making it unbearable to use. I at first figured it was drives. So I tried to update the AMD drive manager to allow for the latest drivers to update.
 It would start the installer and take 20 or so minutes and would just not respond and closed. From there, the OS would just struggle to pull of the start menu up, go to any options or load any screen at all. I tried to update windows and it would tell me to
 update the AMD drivers. I was unable to do that. So I tried to reset windows keeping personal files. That did not work. I tried to load the drivers in safe mode. That too would not work with a different error message in safe mode. I backed up the needed info
 that I wanted to keep and reinstalled windows clean. It is still running slow to open anything or not at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure if it hardware related, software, or what. But seeing as I reinstalled windows I would assume maybe a hardware issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated</p>

<h2>            DirectX not installing on Windows 10</h2>
                    I got a new computer recently and it was manufactured in September, 2018. It came installed with DirectX 12 but whenever I use the DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer, it gives me a internal system error and closes. I tried the June 2010 DirectX Installer
 but it gave me the same result. I tried Safe Mode, I tried checking the system with the command prompt, and I tried editing the Registry Editor but to no avail.

    <title>BSOD 0xc000021a on clean install, Never started &#91;SOLVED&#93; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> orangesrain  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD 0xc000021a on clean install, Never started &#91;SOLVED&#93;</h2>
                    <p>This error has been running me to the end. It happened on two separate motherboards. I recently bought a new motherboard/processor. As my old version of Windows was OEM, I couldn't transfer it. I decided to buy Windows 8.1 Pro due to the student discount
 rather than going for Windows 7. While I was waiting for my motherboard to come, I decided to install it on my spare hard-drive, so that I could get it out of the way. I tried upgrading the version and got 0xc000021a, but then I found out it's a common error
 for upgrades. Then, when my motherboard came today, I decided to do a clean install rather than upgrade. This returned, again, 0xc000021a on BOTH motherboards (The first one was a Dell Inspiron, my new motherboard is Gigabyte Z97). The hard-drives have changed,
 the motherboard has changed, and I'm on my last straw. I'm understandably upset because, even though I was upset that I had to buy a new version of windows, I accepted the OEM license. I am now stuck on an image of my old OEM hard-drive that is in activation
 grace (due to being switched to a new motherboard) and I am incredibly upset because I essentially paid $80 for software that doesn't work. I wouldn't be using the OEM version on the new motherboard, but I have no choice.<br />
<br />
Some important notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a CLEAN install that has NEVER seen the desktop. I literally finished the setup, it rebooted and failed.<br />
</li><li>2 different motherboards, two different hard-drives, Two different methods (Upgrade and clean, ruling out CD drive), two different DVD's. None worked.<br />
</li><li>I unplugged ALL hardware except for the monitor, for obvious reasons. When I say all, I mean not even something so simple as a keyboard. It still did not work.<br />
</li><li>I have tried start-up recovery, I have tried several clean installs.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to finally try completely redownloading the install files for windows eight. If this happens to not work, then I will officially be at a complete and total loss. All I have access to is the command prompt on the install CD and the files as a slaved,
 mounted drive.<br />
<br />
UPDATE:<br />
Here's the fix I found:<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Go to:&nbsp;C\Users\(YOUR USERNAME HERE)\AppData\Local\Microsoft</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. DELETE the folder titled WebSetup. This is where it stores the ISO information.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Re-run the tool again, either by re-downloading it or going to MS's website.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Let it download the ISO. However, BEFORE you choose what to do, unplug the ethernet/wireless.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp;4a. If you see "Checking for updates...." on the screen, close it out and restart again.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5. Choose your preferred method. It really doesn't matter. It will now work as an updat.</span></p>

            So I figured it out. I decided one last time to try and erase all the old files that Windows collected for the ISO and refresh them. When I did, I caught this:<br />
<br />
When connected to the internet, the Download tool will automatically aggregate updates and apply them to the image. Unplug ethernet when doing this!! If you've already installed the ISO, which is what might bring someone here, you need to do this:<br />
1. Go to:&nbsp;C\Users\(YOUR USERNAME HERE)\AppData\Local\Microsoft<br />
2. DELETE the folder titled WebSetup. This is where it stores the ISO information.<br />
3. Re-run the tool again, either by re-downloading it or going to MS's website.<br />
4. Let it download the ISO. However, BEFORE you choose what to do, unplug the ethernet/wireless.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;4a. If you see "Checking for updates...." on the screen, close it out and restart again.<br />
5. Choose your preferred method. It really doesn't matter. It will now work as an updat.<br />
<br />
Viola. Windows will flash black a couple of times as it aggregates the new settings, but it should boot fine. I am typing this under Windows 8.<br />
<br />
To ZigZag, I wanted to thank them for their time. I hope someone else in the future can use this.

Use this tutorial which is to restore file type associations so that the desktop icon/shortcut will open to correct program.</p>

<p>Scroll down to 
<b><u>exe</u></b> - Executable application files.<br />
click the <b><u>exe</u></b></p>
<p>follow the instructions from #1 to #6 at the top.</p>
<p>Scroll down to 
<b><u>lnk</u></b> - Shortcut link (LNK) files.<br />
click <b><u>lnk</u></b></p>
<p>follow the instructions from #1 to #6 at the top.</p>
<p><br />
If the desktop icons/shortcuts still look like Adobe, do an icon cache rebuild.</p>

    <title>My Microsoft Support experience - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derpstep  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Microsoft Support experience</h2>
                    <p>Hello, this is one of the worst experience's that I have ever had with any type of "high quality" support site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So not only did the guy not help me at all, he kept trying to sell me products to fix my PC, Not a big deal right?
</p>
<p>Well the price was a whopping 100$ for ONE ISSUE FIX and a 30 day warranty. I told him
</p>
<p>"Sorry, but I&nbsp;don't have that kind of cash right now after just buying an Xbox and a new tv."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So then he went on to try to sell me a more expensive product that was 140$! for a full year warranty and to fix my PC..&nbsp;</p>
<p>but the funny part is that I fixed the problem on my own for free.. something that a trained professional supposedly couldn't fix without my money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then from there I tried to give him some tips that I found off on YouTube and they&nbsp;worked for me before.</p>
<p>then he just got smart with me and said "We know the product." so I went on to apologies by saying&nbsp; "sorry I wasn't trying to be a Mr. know it all"&nbsp;</p>
<p>and then he simply said "that's fine" he may not have been trying to sound mean, but it sure seemed like it to&nbsp;me like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;For someone who is supposed to make you feel good about the company and feel good about the product.. he wasn't doing a very good job at either.</p>
<p>Another thing that he did is he went to close all windows that he had opened on my screen. when an error message popped up saying it couldn't close, he quickly ended the remote session leaving me with the mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing that he did which&nbsp;he wasn't supposed to was he closed his chat page so that I couldn't give him a&nbsp;bad review, I suspect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>here is where he gets smart with me in the chat log: (not the whole thing that would have been too long.) (my name and email edited out for safety.)
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4:33 PM Ricky: You have mentioned that it's for 100 bucks.<br />
4:33 PM Ricky: Have you heard about $149 for the entire year?<br />
4:34 PM me: yeah, it does protect me longer wich is nice.. it also cost more and i just dont have that kind of money after just buying an xbox one and a new tv<br />
4:35 PM Ricky: I see. Well, what I am concerned right now is that I'm afraid we can't resolve this for today.<br />
4:36 PM me: I completely understand.. one other guy from microsoft tries to help me and he used this free program almost the same as your guys's advanced tools its called 'tweaking.com' or something like that<br />
4:37 PM Ricky: Oh! we don't have that kind of tools.<br />
4:37 PM Ricky: I believe its not from Microsoft maybe<br />
4:37 PM me: no he went to a third party app on my pc<br />
4:37 PM Ricky: Okay.<br />
4:37 PM Ricky: Well, let me continue as I have seen that you do have a lot of updates right now.<br />
4:37 PM Ricky: On the right<br />
4:38 PM me: alright</p>
<p>4:45 PM Remote Control by Ricky stopped.<br />
4:45 PM Remote Control started by Ricky.</p>
<p>4:53 PM me: my phones dead hole on<br />
4:54 PM me: hold*<br />
4:54 PM Ricky: Do you have any other email account?<br />
4:55 PM me: **********************<br />
4:55 PM Ricky: That is the one we are using right now<br />
4:55 PM me: how about ************************<br />
4:57 PM me: this one isnt linked to ms<br />
4:57 PM Ricky: Okay.<br />
4:57 PM Ricky: Well, for now *misspelled my name*.<br />
4:57 PM me: my phone is on<br />
4:58 PM Ricky: *fixed my name*<br />
4:58 PM Ricky: I have created a new user account which is a test account and its still no longer working<br />
4:58 PM Ricky: You can just wait for it or stop the download.<br />
4:59 PM Ricky: Now, I would suggest installing the updates by 5 because your PC is not that fast to install the download<br />
5:00 PM me: is there a plan cheeper than 100? to help the corruptions? because i have no problem installing the updates... its just when i restart my pc to apply them it gets to 99% and says failure to configre windows updates reverting changes<br />
5:01 PM Ricky: Unfotunately, our prices here is fix Brandon.&nbsp; <br />
5:01 PM Ricky: Well, It says failure because the updates were not installed successfully.<br />
5:01 PM Ricky: As you may notice it has 108 updates that needed to be completely installed<br />
5:02 PM me: i seen something where it says it needs to have "background intelligance' on automatic and 'windows updates' on automatic.<br />
5:02 PM me: and i think workstation too<br />
5:04 PM Ricky: It is set to automatic<br />
5:04 PM Ricky: Now what is your concern?<br />
5:04 PM me: and the others..?<br />
5:05 PM Ricky: Now what?<br />
5:05 PM me: oh, i didnt know that was just something that i saw on youtube<br />
5:06 PM me: well i dont know then... i guess ill have to get back to you another time<br />
5:06 PM Ricky: We know the product, <br />
5:06 PM Ricky: Well, you can still contact us here.<br />
5:06 PM Ricky: Just check on your email.<br />
5:06 PM Ricky: I'll be sending you an outtake email with the case number.<br />
5:06 PM me: alright and i wasnt trying o act like a mr know it all lol<br />
5:07 PM me: to<br />
5:07 PM Ricky: That's fine.<br />
5:07 PM Ricky: So, I guess that would be all for now.<br />
5:07 PM me: yeah, ill talk to ya later.<br />
5:08 PM Ricky: So, can I get you back to the other account?<br />
5:08 PM me: if youd like</p>
<p>5:12 PM Ricky has ended the session.<br />
5:12 PM Remote Control by Ricky stopped.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you logged in as the Administrator?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you get any error code?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you have User Account control set up on your computer?</p>
<p>A socket error can be caused by
<b>antivirus or firewall software</b>. Basically, a needed socket connection is being denied. Socket error is a message which implies that a port is blocked and/or unreachable.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Let’s also disable antivirus software and Firewall together (as a test) on the computer temporarily and try connecting and check if things get any better.
</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Make sure you turn-on the antivirus software and Windows Firewall later.
</p>
<p>If disabling antivirus software works, then you'll need to configure the same so that it no longer interferes</p>
<p><b>Disable antivirus software</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Turn Windows Firewall on or off</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>You can only install application if you have sufficient rights assigned by the Administrator. You may also try installing the application using the option of
<b>Run as Administrator</b>. </p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right click on the setup.exe file of the application</p>

    <title>Desktop doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Desktop doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    I recently had Dell reinstall Windows for me, and they restored the backup I had. All seemed to work well. I've been re-installing my applications, some from the original CD's and a few from downloads. I also updated Windows to SP 3.<br />
<br />
Now the stuff on my desktop doesn't work.<br />
1. The Run command has disappeared from the start menu. I've gone into the properties for the start menu and checked it so that it should be shown, but it doesn't come up.<br />
2. Double-clicking any icon on my desktop doesn't work. To open an application I have to right-click and select "Open."<br />
3. Nothing starts from the start menu.<br />
4. The Quick Start icons don't come up unless I go into the properties for the start bar and set it, and then it doesn't come up when I restart the PC.<br />
5. Nothing in the Quick Start bar opens with one click.<br />
6. Search doesn't work when I right-click on Start and select search.<br />
<br />
Since the run command doesn't show I can't get to the Services table to see if the necessary services are set.<br />
<br />
I'd very much appreciate any help in getting back on track.<br />
