<h3> quick555  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update</h2>
                    I have been trying to do a major update on Windows 10 ever since 1709 on my Gateway desktop(10 years old), and everything works fine until restart, then just the Blue Windows logo, and no restart, no circling dots.&nbsp; I have tried every major udate since
 1803, 1809, and now 1903, all the same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Funny but there is no record of update to 1903, done yesterday June 5 2019, and there should also be one for trying to update to 1809 as well.&nbsp; I have tried everyway, update assistant, downloading iso file to usb and trying it from there, troubleshooting
 the updater.&nbsp; As you can see from the screenshot the error codes are all different.</p>

    <title>Movies are scrambled in WLM Maker on my Windows 7 64 bit PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> okiebirdnerd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Movies are scrambled in WLM Maker on my Windows 7 64 bit PC</h2>
                    <p>My camera makes HD MOV&nbsp;videos. When I take a video into Windows Live Movie Maker it plays fine. But once I edit and save it, (using every possible setting) When it is viewed it is scrambled. It is scrambled on anyones PC I send it to. The sound is the only
 thing not affected. I have reinstalled Windows essintials with no luck. If I edit a non HD video from another camera is views/plays just fine. It is only with HD video. My program doesn't crash it just plays a scrambled video.&nbsp;This is really disapointing.
 I have many many hours into trying to fix this and it has been wasted time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Also when I open my HD video in quicktime it is huge. I've gone into prefrences and told it to be 1/2 screen or fit to screen and it is still opens huge every time.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help. Wish I could add a screen capture to show what I'm talking about.</p>

            <p>If you import a HD movie (in .MOV format) onto your PC and try playing it using QuickTime
<strong><u>before</u></strong> you use WLMM, does it still appear scrambled then?</p>
<p>HD video is huge - it can be several GB/min depending on resolution, frame rate and compression.</p>

            <p>Quick time plays mov just fine but they are too big to see.. Quick time can't play WMV.&nbsp;I don't mean the file size is big, I mean it is two times larger than my monitor. Every time I click on a movie to play I have to drag to the&nbsp;top right so I can click
 on the button next to the close button to make the movie smaller or to close it. Quick time will not save my settings when I tell it to play half size or fit to screen..or any setting I make. Every time I have to do the same thing, the first time it plays
 I can only see a small corner of it until I drag and make it show smaller. I would think there should be a setting somewhere on my PC that I can tell it to&nbsp;always&nbsp;fit to screen when playing a video:(</p>
<p>thanks for your time.</p>

<h2>            Sorry, we couldn&#39;t connect to microsoft services right now. If this problem persists, search for &#34;network problems&#34; on the start screen</h2>
                    <p>so I had issues signing into my hp account, and I contact support.&nbsp; It was a google search that took me to a fake support that wanted access to my pc, and I let them, when they did the pop up and showed me all the things that had stopped working and all
 the bs they were doing, then told me they could fix my pc for a price, I told them that i have the recovery cd's i got from hp and if there were some serious issues I could just do a fresh install, and they hung up on me.&nbsp; I instantly powered down and began
 search for contacting by phone to hp and they told me they never do remote connections to do support.&nbsp; I ran the cd's and started over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>did entire boot and setup, then ran windows 10 media creation tool to update from 8.1 to 10 and when the screen came up asking if i wanted to turn this and that on, i tried to select to turn off cortana, but as i waited for these options, my cats were on
 the keyboard, and i had no mouse on screen when I shooed them off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i did the recovery cd's again and now when i first get started up after boot to do personalize and what not, when i get to microsoft login, i get failed to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ran the recovery cd's many times doing a fresh install, have tried with and without extra cd that has extra software (bloat junk) and extra drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently on windows 8.1 i installed using windows 8 media creation tool and still have no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have googled so much, it isn't funny.&nbsp; Seen some that posted they were getting it from registry issues, and found out that doing fresh installs writes the registry over again, so i can assume it isn't that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am logged in to microsoft posting this on the computer in question, and have been scouring the WWW looking for answers using this pc so these steps are not a solution for me as I have an internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-winapps/error-sorry-we-couldnt-connect-to-microsoft/77edefdc-be10-4230-9d9d-0077fe7a6ba5</p>

<p>this didn't work, just says account needed to proceed or to create one, and here I am, with an account</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm completely lost at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95a8b488-32cd-463f-ae00-ee09bded1842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95a8b488-32cd-463f-ae00-ee09bded1842" /></a></p>
<p>This is what I get when I first do fresh install and haven't even got to desktop yet, it makes me create a local account before proceeding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e829b3d1-ecff-42a2-8fc8-10b344a45a1f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e829b3d1-ecff-42a2-8fc8-10b344a45a1f" /></a></p>
<p>Of course I can't login to continue either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to run windows 10 media creation tool after posting this, but I don't expect any luck with that.</p>

            I was beginning to think it was a Microsoft issue. &nbsp;I have an old Dell I'm running Linux mint. &nbsp;I tried running Microsoft in virtual box but my bios is outdated and doesn't support virtual, all attempts to update bios without battery have failed, so I
 haven't been able to test it. &nbsp;Will be waiting for Microsoft fix.

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're also getting the same error when trying to login to your Microsoft Account, then we suggest&nbsp; that you use your local account in the meantime. Microsoft is aware of this problem in Windows 8.1 and is working on a solution. Until the fix is implemented,
 if you would want, you can upgrade to Windows 10 to resolve the problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, have you tried upgrading to Windows 10 before? If you have, did you receive any errors while trying the upgrade? If you haven't tried upgrading, may we know the reason as to why you haven't taken advantage with the upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Well this makes no sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You install fresh, to get exactly everything that the OEM provided for your machine, then can't log into windows account and have to make a local account, just to upgrade to 10 top fix the issue. &nbsp;Problem is, the local account one creates is the admin account,
 and once you have done that, your Microsoft account isn't admin. &nbsp;And this also leaves me with the question. &nbsp;If I do fresh install from OEM recovery McD's that is 8.1, when it goes to account screen and says it can't reach Microsoft, is it because Microsoft
 sees the intent coming from windows 8.1 and ignores it? &nbsp;Cause this issue is still happening from full wipe and completely fresh install. &nbsp;I haven't been able to use my pc connected to my Microsoft account since I had to wipe it 9/14/17.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue can't be what updates that was push to pc, if they are not installed on fresh pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used a camera and recorded the whole process (very long) showing the wipe, repartition of hard drive, final boot, and fail to connect to Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is on your end, at your server, or your intent to ignore my pc when it "calls".</p>

<span>La risposta di Codemasters all'iniziativa "Online Pass" di EA Sports si chiama VIP Pass, ed è contenuta anche all'interno del nuovo Dirt 3, in uscita in questi giorni dalle nostre parti. Si tratta
 di un codice presente all'interno delle confezioni nuove del gioco, che consente l'accesso al gioco multiplayer online oltre che la possibilità di scaricare 5 veicoli aggiuntivi. Rientra ovviamente nei mezzi adottati dai publisher per disincentivare il mercato
 dell'usato: se il codice è già stato utilizzato (come è probabile che sia, in una copia di seconda mano) non è possibile giocare online e diventa necessario ri-acquistarlo (a prezzo ancora ignoto). Insomma, una sorta di tassa sul mercato dell'usato, più volte
 additato dai publisher come causa di mancati guadagni sempre maggiori. Il codice contiene peraltro le auto McRae M4, Ford Sierra Cosworth RS500 e Hummer H3 tra le 5 aggiuntive.</span>

<p>If the person who compromised your account downloaded your profile to a console, they may have elected to not require a password to sign in. In this case, even after changing your password, they will still be able to sign in. To solve this, you will need
 to remove access to your profile from all consoles. To do this:</p>

<p>This will require that your profile be downloaded from Xbox LIVE, using your Microsoft account and password, before it can be used on any console. Your profile will be downloaded again from Xbox LIVE, using your Microsoft account and password. Any existing
 copies of your profile that maybe on someone else’s console will no longer work,</p>

<h2>            How can I have incoming emails automatically forwarded from one account to another email account&#63;</h2>
                    I have one email account through a university I am enrolled in, a work email account, and my personal account. I would prefer to have all emails go to my personal account at home for convenience. How can this be done?

            <p>All email goes to email servers.&nbsp; Some servers can be accessed with a browser.&nbsp; When accessing with a browser, you must be connected to the Internet to read and compose emails.</p>
<p>Most email servers can be accessed with an email client (program).&nbsp; When using an email client, emails are downloaded to your computer.&nbsp; You can read and compose emails without being connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>There are different methods for email clients to access email servers.&nbsp; Servers can be pop3, imap, http, or an exchange server.&nbsp; Some servers can use more than one method.</p>
<p>An exchange server usually requires Microsoft Outlook.<br />
Pop3 only downloads emails from the server.<br />
Http and imap access will sync messages and folders with the email server.</p>
<p>Some servers can send and receive emails from other email accounts making it unnecessary to have the emails forwarded.</p>
<p>Login to your university and work accounts.&nbsp; See what options are available.</p>

            Hey there, Nehu�nLlanos 
<br />Thanks for the reply
<br />
<br />This will be where the notification is referenced within Event Viewer. The code on the end of the message does look like a code that references that message on Event Viewer.
<br />
<br />Go to start and type Event Viewer and click on the Desktop App from results. Then this will display all notifications and error messages System has recorded. This doesn't look to be an error message so there is really nothing to worry about :) 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,

            Hey there, Nehu�nLlanos 
<br />
<br />Its fine, you can ask as many questions as you like. I am here to try and help :)
<br />
<br />An event viewer without errors is not possible, or is very rare. People think, when looking, I have loads of errors and this must be bad. In reality, this is not the case. 
<br />
<br />I as looking at our computers at school today and their event viewer had loads of errors and warnings and information. But when reading them, they were fine. 
<br />
<br />I noticed you had received a COM error. I had one too! It was because the computer did not give it Administrative rights. That's all. Not really an error in my opinion :)
<br />
<br />The bottom line is, really any program, App or the system can log things here and there are no rules as such. So sometimes an error that shows here is really something not to be worried about. However, when things don't work properly this is when we look at the event viewer so we can see what error or warning was logged. 
<br />
<br />If you are still worried, please translate them to English so I can take a littlie look. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps, 
<br />Regards,

<p>It's a pleasure to assist you with your concern. I will be asking some questions to help us isolate the concern. These will only occur when trying to send emails.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Are the smtp server settings correct?</div>
</li><li>
<div>.Is SSL required?</div>
</li><li>
<div>Is the required port being blocked by Windows Firewall, or a 3rd party firewall?</div>
</li><li>
<div>Is the port reserved by your ISP for their own mail service?</div>
</li></ol>
<p>You may alo try to remove and re-add your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will be looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Gill,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the information you provided. I noticed that you are using port number 25 for SMTP. What I can suggest is to change the value to 587. You can do it by reconfiguring your account by following the steps
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>here</strong></a> on how to remove and re-add again the account. In case the issue still persists, you can try the configuration settings discussed on this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/send-receive-from-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>article</strong></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly update us afterwards.</p>

I have got the same problems: can receive email but can't send.<br />
But I fixed it by test many option.<br />
You go into menu Tool, choose Setting Accounts, click on it and choose More Setting.<br />
-In Tab Outgoing Server, choose " My outgoing server (SMTP) requires authentication", click "Use the same settings as my incoming mail server"<br />
-In Tab Advanced, click on "This server requires an encrypted connection (SSL)" for Incomming server (POP3) 995. For Outgoing server (SMTP): 25, please choose "Use the following type of encrypted connection:" as "Auto"<br />

            <p>I suffered the same problem. After many hours of frustration and fruitless attempts to restore my Live Mail account to its previously functioning status, I discovered Steve's email and acted on his advice. The wording on my 'Server' and 'Advanced' information
 boxes was slightly different, but basically ticking authentication and SSL required for outgoing and incoming servers seems to have done the trick. Thank you, thank you, Steve.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But why suddenly was this change needed? And who activated whatever decided it was? And why, if the change issues from Microsoft, does nobody inform us? Almost every time there is a windows update, something that had been functioning well goes wrong. It
 is So frustrating!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>FoxtrotBeta4967,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry you're having issues with your game updates. Some game downloads, and game updates can be very large, so depending on your internet connection speed it could take a very long time like you said. Are you wireless or wired? If you're wireless I
 would try using a wired&nbsp;Ethernet&nbsp;cable to see if it goes any faster. Also, to give everyone a better idea of whats going on, can you run a detailed network test and post back the results (upload speed, download speed, latency, ect). To run this test, go to
 your home page, and press menu on your controller, then select settings. From the settings menu select Network. From the network menu select "Detailed Network Statistics".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Post back and let us know :)&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>How to see list of ALL open documents from taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lindsayatnip  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to see list of ALL open documents from taskbar</h2>
                    In Windows 7 when I clicked on the Word icon it would show a vertical list of all open documents. Now when I mouse over the Word icon in the taskbar it shows a horizontal row of thumbnails of the open documents, but if I have more than six or so open I
 can't see the rest and see no way to scroll to right or left (not that that would be an ideal solution anyway). Is there a way to go back to the list view??

            <p>This can be done, but needs a registry edit. Setting "NumThumbnails" to 1 will stack up the items (instead of showing thumbnail views when hovered) if more than one instance of the program is running. You can find more about it here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/increase-taskbar-thumbnail-preview-size-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/increase-taskbar-thumbnail-preview-size-windows/</a>

    <title>Features For NHL 13 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> savoie06  say:</h3>
<h2>            Features For NHL 13</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>While the rest of the hockey loving world has had its attention on the NHL <br />
Stanley Cup Playoffs, the team here at EA SPORTS Canada in Burnaby has been <br />
focusing on trying to bring more of the excitement of the game that we all love <br />
from the rink to your home (while sneaking in some moments to watch some great <br />
playoff hockey).&nbsp; We’re excited about <em>NHL 13</em>, but had to keep quiet <br />
until it was time to start bragging about what’s new and improved in this year’s <br />
game.</p>
<p>With today’s announcement of the <em>NHL 13</em> feature set we’re ready to <br />
start talking -</p>
<p>Bringing more realistic skating to this generation of video game hockey has <br />
long been a goal for the NHL development team.&nbsp; Since a lot of the team play or <br />
have played ice hockey at various levels throughout their lives, they knew that <br />
the skating experience in previous NHL titles did not fully capture the <br />
fidelity, excitement or creativity of real skating.&nbsp; Being able to cut to the <br />
outside and speed past a defenseman was something missing from the game, as was <br />
the trade-off between top-end speed and control.&nbsp; With the introduction of True <br />
Performance Skating, a physics-driven skating engine with over 1,000 new <br />
animations, we’ve captured the explosiveness, momentum and incredible top end <br />
speeds that today’s NHL stars have.&nbsp; True Performance Skating also brings a <br />
whole new level of creativity to <em>NHL 13</em> players, giving them as much <br />
control over how their player moves as the Skill Stick gave them over the hockey <br />
stick.&nbsp; It’s a new weapon in the arsenal, and one we are excited to have you get <br />
your hands on.</p>
<p>Be a GM is the most popular offline mode in <em>NHL 12</em>, allowing players <br />
to take control of their favorite team and build it into a dynasty from the <br />
boardroom to the ice.&nbsp; This year we’re letting you pit your GM skills against <br />
those of your friends, allowing you play in your own 30 team NHL against them.&nbsp; <br />
They’ll manage their team, you’ll manage yours as you control your team’s <br />
trades, draft picks, lineups, and on ice performance.&nbsp; It’s the ultimate <br />
armchair GM experience, offering unrivaled accessibility and depth as players <br />
manage, play or coach their team on the road to a dynasty.&nbsp; With five ways to <br />
play, this is a mode for every fan of NHL hockey, whether you’re a longtime EA <br />
SPORTS NHL player or just a passionate fan of the NHL who wants to moonlight as <br />
your favorite team’s GM.&nbsp; A companion mobile app will let players stay connected <br />
to their league even when away from their console.</p>
<p>Listening to the feedback from you, the players, we also wanted to make sure <br />
<em>NHL 13</em> took a big step forward in terms of the computer A.I. that <br />
controls the behaviors of the players, goalies and team systems in the game.&nbsp; In <br />
<em>NHL 12</em>, players were only aware of skaters in their immediate vicinity <br />
and goalies would only focus on the player in control of the puck.&nbsp; In real <br />
hockey players have to be able to read the whole ice, identifying scoring <br />
chances and threats as plays develop.&nbsp; With EA SPORTS Hockey I.Q. players and <br />
goalies are now fully aware of every other player on the ice.&nbsp; This results in <br />
quicker, smarter and more realistic A.I. decisions.&nbsp; Hockey I.Q. also gives <br />
players a much greater control over team strategy and positioning with the most <br />
detailed recreation of team systems ever to be included in a hockey game.</p>
<p>Other gameplay modes have also been improved and there will be deeper reveals <br />
to follow, but here is a small taste of what to expect.&nbsp; Hockey Ultimate Team <br />
received an impressive new interface as well as changes to playoffs and <br />
tournaments.&nbsp; In Be A Pro you now have greater control over your career, <br />
including the ability to request a trade away from your team or decide to <br />
hang-up your skates and retire when your virtual knees begin to grow stiff.&nbsp; <br />
EASHL, the EA SPORTS online hockey league has received a number of new <br />
improvements including the ability to choose club captains, a region based <br />
matchmaking system designed to reduce lag and the addition of procedures created <br />
to encourage users to play through a full EASHL game.</p>
<p>We’re very happy to announce <em>NHL 13</em> and share with you the details.&nbsp; <br />
Leading up to launch we’ll be diving deeper into the gameplay advancements that <br />
are coming in NHL 13, so keep your eye on this space for more details.</p>
<p>NHL 13 gameplay innovations and brand-new connected experiences include:</p>
<p><strong>True Performance Skating</strong>: A ground up overhaul of how <br />
skating is handled in the NHL series bringing unprecedented reality to video <br />
game skating</p>
<p><strong>EA SPORTS Hockey I.Q.</strong>:&nbsp; Smarter computer controlled players <br />
who read and react to the entire ice not just what’s right in front of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
You are also able to customize the behavior of your players and team</p>
<p><strong>GM Connected</strong>: The ultimate fantasy hockey league allowing <br />
you to play with friends across the world and deepens the experience of Be a GM <br />
NHL’s most popular offline game mode allowing players to manage, play or coach <br />
while building their team’s legacy.</p>
<p><strong>NHL Moments Live</strong>: Rewrite or relive history as you play <br />
through the most thrilling moments from the today’s NHL.</p>
<p><strong>Refined on-ice presentation</strong>: We bring the most authentic <br />
looking NHL hockey experience to-date</p>
<p><strong>Even more improvements to core offline and online modes</strong> <br />
including Hockey Ultimate Team, Be a Pro, EA SPORTS Hockey League and <br />
more.</p>

    <title>So my account got suspended for saying &#34;&#91;Mod Removed&#93;&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            So my account got suspended for saying &#34;&#91;Mod Removed&#93;&#34; to a user for 2 weeks. What gives&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I got reported for saying "<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>" to someone over Xbox Live and it got my account an instant 2 week suspension from sending messages.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What gives tho exactly? 1 word should be worth at least 1-2 days max but instead I got thrown a 2 week mute and right on the day where the Raid launches on Destiny 2 and now I'm pissed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I applied for a review over at enforcement.xbox.com but guess what I got in return? An extension to my suspension. I had 12 days left to serve but now it's been reset back to 14 days as the person that answered my review opened a whole new case on my account
 which now says I'll be able to send messages and stuff on 9/30/2017 now instead of 9/28/2017.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Come on guys? Is anyone even human over there? The word "<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>" is not really a reason to mute someone on Xbox Live for 2 weeks. I didn't say anything else afterwards. I said that to the person because he/she kicked me out of his
 fireteam on Destiny 2 when we reached the second checkpoint in the Raid and he then insults me afterwards right after getting me muted and nothing happened to him.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Unmute me this is not human of you guys and you guys know you're in the wrong here. I've served 2 days already and on any other website/forum/game by now I would of been unsuspended for saying the word "<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>" as it's not really
 harrasment. Anyone else in my shoes would of done the same thing when going through a raid on either destiny 1 or destiny 2 just to be kicked out for no reason due to being angry or annoyed.<br />

</p><p>Suspension length can vary depending on the severity of the situations as well as any previous enforcement actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My last suspension was over 2-3 months ago which I didn't bother doing anything about because I deserved it. This time all I said was [<strong>mod removed</strong>] and someone over on the enforcement team has reset my 2 week suspension and gave me a whole
 new suspension.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is unfair and I won't stop until this is removed due to wrong actions on the enforcement team's side. You guys are messing with me and I don't like it. Someone on the enforcement team got hurt over the word [<strong>mod removed</strong>] and threw me
 an instant mute.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If nothing can be done from contacting xbox support + reviewing over on enforcement.xbox.com + this forum. I will take other actions if needed. I won't stop until this is lifted and until you guys admit you're in the wrong. You guys can't mute someone for
 2 weeks for saying [<strong>mod removed</strong>]. 1 Word did not break any rules yet you guys are using my past history as a reason to keep this going.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Fine so be it. Other actions will come out of this.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also I've already spoken to 2 different support people. 1 named Kevin and another named Stella and they both agree you guys took this too far. They said I shouldn't of been muted. They said if they had the power to unmute me they would have after I explained
 everything yet I can't seem to get through to the enforcement team. You guys just like throwing your power everywhere onto everyone for the tiniest things and it's getting lame... real lame.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Stop using my past suspensions as a reason to keep me muted. I learned my lesson from those and I have stayed good up until you guys are back to giving me an issue. I can't believe I pay for such a service. I feel like the enforcement team is being run by
 children. You guys do nothing about the sex bots effecting xbox live players yet when someone says [<strong>mod removed</strong>] all hell breaks lose and when I try to get unmuted you guys instead extend my suspension with another 2 days... nah nah I ain't
 going to sit here and deal with it.<br />

<p>Don't you dare mess with my mind dude. I was told by a support person to come make a thread here since I explained the review on the enforcement website was out of line so I did the right thing posting a thread here.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I used an offensive word huh? So now [<strong>mod removed</strong>] is considered offensive? Even if I didn't complete the word? Yet people swear and all over on GTA 5 Online using their microphones to insult people because they know they will get away with
 it. Maybe you guys should start doing something about that huh? Since like you stated "Violates the ToU/CoC" But we all know you mods do nothing about people swearing like crazy on the microphones even when I once saw it's stated where people's microphones
 were being recorded at some point unless that was discontinued?.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if a previous suspensions were from 3 or 4 months ago huh? See even you knew my point there since you just repeated something I stated already. If they don't matter then this suspension should be lifted by now since I went through the questions
 and applied a review stating what I have said in this thread yet whoever reviewed it posted another suspension as you can see in this image below which you would agree is not right. 1 word out of everything else everyone says over on xbox live through messages
 or voice is a lot worse compared to me saying [<strong>mod removed</strong>].</p>

Now you tell me why my current suspension was extended from the 28th to the 30th. I'd like to see you explain it because if you were not an support person you would agree this is wrong. Extending my current suspension by 2 days because I tried to get my account
 reviewed. Get over my past suspensions you lot. I am over them and I expect the same from you guys.<br />
<br />
Of course there is nothing I can do which I still can't believe filing a case review with the enforcement team is the only option from everyone else on this forum. They had no right declining or extending my current suspension after a review. I can't believe
 how low you guys are.<br />
<br />
I was told by a support person (Stella) that the enforcement team does indeed use this forum and I remember seeing in the past that people have had their account suspensions sorted through this forum unless that was discontinued huh?<br />
<br />
I want this thread pushed towards the enforcement team then if they "don't use this forum" I'm sure you "ambassadors" can do that unless that's out of your reach also huh?.<br />

<p>Keep it clean? I have. I haven't spoken to anyone on Xbox live for over a month. The only thing I have done is play Destiny 2 when it came out and put 15 dollars towards my account for buying silver on Destiny 2. Besides that I have been good until I called
 someone a [<strong>mod removed</strong>]... That's it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What other reasons for them extending it besides that? Is it because I put 15 dollars into my account? Is that the second reason? For supporting xbox live? Because I swear I can't think of anything else right now for the second reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Like I stated I think they went through my last suspension which was from 2-3 months ago to do this to me. My reputation on the enforcement website is in the green as you can see below</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fvgy.me%2fPqqyI8.png" /><br />
<br />
So tell me the same thing again as it's not helping much in my case right now. I have been good. I have been keeping to myself.
<br />
<br />
Bad enough now I can't even play destiny 2 online because of this suspension which I found out today when I tried to play a strike! Why let me log in when I can't do anything? All this for saying [<strong>mod removed</strong>]... Now you all are just pissing
 me off.<br />

            <p>How can I download the firmware update if my computer is unable to connect to the device?&nbsp; In the App, the firmware tab is greyed out, and when I try to "connect" or "add a device" the wireless display adapter is not found.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b8cd7dd-cdc7-40b9-9973-885f8105e30b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b8cd7dd-cdc7-40b9-9973-885f8105e30b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the reboot to the adapter as well as re-installed the app multiple times to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any method to connect the adapter to my computer directly in order to update the firmware rather than relying on the connection via the TV?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>How can I download the firmware update if my computer is unable to connect to the device?&nbsp; In the App, the firmware tab is greyed out, and when I try to "connect" or "add a device" the wireless display adapter is not found.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have done the reboot to the adapter as well as re-installed the app multiple times to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any method to connect the adapter to my computer directly in order to update the firmware rather than relying on the connection via the TV?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>This is exactly what I encounter with the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter app - both the 'Firmware' and 'Adapter Settings' are greyed out when attempting to update a version 2 MWDA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the troubleshooting tips available to me - I'm using a laptop to connect to a TV (I don't have a MS phone or tablet so updating the driver according to 'Troubleshooting' is not possible as it doesn't appear to exist on the laptop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: "How can I get the 'Firmware' setting to appear un-greyed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely an up-to-date Microsoft operating system (Win 10) and a Microsoft accessory app (MWDA app) should be like hand-in-glove - They should just work by December 2017?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know the way forward? Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Is anyone else having trouble signing into xbox live&#63;</h2>
                    I was playing Borderlands 2, noticed that achievements where not unlocking, support forms said to remove account and sign back in to possibly fix it. Did that and the when i went to sign in it kept asking me for my password over and over again. So the
 forms said to do a factory rest, after that now i still cant sign in or do anything else on the xbox.

</p>
<p>On the xbox one there is a setting called "Lock it down" which means you will need to enter password to log in purchase ect.&nbsp;<br />

<p>What error is appearing when you try to log in on your xbox?. There could be a simple mistake of caps ect, We all done it at least once.

<p>
</p><p>So perhaps even changing the password can help you get logged in on your console.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/microsoft-account/change-microsoft-account-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/microsoft-account/change-microsoft-account-password</a><br />

<p>Are you on an xbox one? 360? Which console are your trying to play this on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did this just start happening? If so Did you change your password recently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it asks for your password does it say the password you are entering is incorrect? Or any other type of error message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are trying to play on the 360 this console does not like passwords longer then 16 characters so if it just started happening and you happened to change your password and it is more then 16 characters then this is your problem and you would need to
 go to account.microsoft.com and change your password to something that has less then 16 characters.</p>

            This doesn't seem to work with Win 10.&nbsp; I followed the instructions but could not deselect anything.&nbsp; I actually had to select Windows IE (probably could have also selected any other browser ) and make it the default for everything and edge still remained
 the default for PDFs so I then selected Adobe Reader and made it the default.

                    I have windows 7 on a new computer, icore 3, lots of ram,&nbsp;intel hd graphics card,&nbsp;and I cannot run autocad lt 2012 on the premium themes.&nbsp; The screen goes blank with every other command.&nbsp; Dell says the problem is the display or the drivers, autodeck says
 the problem is the graphics card.&nbsp;When I switch from the aero theme to the basic, autocad lt works fine.&nbsp; Aero plus autocad = a &nbsp;display driver or graphic card crash or a windows 7 bug.&nbsp; Does anyone know which is the problem and why?&nbsp; Any other solutions so
 I can stay with aero?&nbsp;

            You dont mention the Dell model, but from your problem description it sounds as though the graphics card/chip is not up to it

            That is what autodesk thought, too, thanks.&nbsp; A shame.&nbsp; I double checked the system compatibility with dell and autodesk, and in&nbsp;their literature, before buying and&nbsp;nothing flagged the need to be on the lookout for this issue.&nbsp;

            <p>I am experiencing the same problem and the laptop I am using has a Radeon video chipset with dedicated, not shared, video RAM. I am also running Windows 7 64bit&nbsp;on an i7 quad core processor and 8 GB of RAM. I did an update on the video drivers and there
 was some noticeable changes to the video processing but it did not fix the AutoCAD problem. I don't think it is the video chip, more likely an issue with AutoCAD's programming against the Windows video interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every once in a while AutoCAD comes out with a really buggy version that requires many patches and the problem is never truly fixed until the next version. 2012 could be one of those versions, but too early to tell. It sounds like you have a work around
 and I have tried it with seeming success. Hopefully, the next AutoCAD version will fix this issue.</p>
