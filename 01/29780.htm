    <title>password recovery from skype account that predates microsoft buying - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            password recovery from skype account that predates microsoft buying skype</h2>
                    <p>I have a skype account that predates Microsoft acquiring skype.</p>
<p>I am trying to do a password recovery on this account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I go through the process it gives me one option for the email to send it to.</p>
<p>this is the email associated when the account was created.</p>
<p>this email does not have a live.microsoft account associated with it.</p>
<p>I never get the code via this email to proceed.</p>
<p>I believe it is because when it searches, it finds no live.microsoft account associated with the email and never sends it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I do a support chat, with skype support, the associated email they have is the one associated with my live.microsoft account.</p>
<p>they send codes to confirm my identity to that one. and state that it is the one associated with my skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>about a year and a half ago I know I was able to recovery using the email originally associated with the account.</p>
<p>now I am stuck. It is obvious that I cannot recover using that original email.</p>
<p>I am not able to explain this to any chat support people.</p>
<p>this mismatch of email is also blocking me from the more information recovery process.</p>
<p>if only I could get support to send codes to both email to ensure I am in control of both and have them officially change the skype email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is one last attempt to sort this out before abandoning the account and being forced to start a new one.</p>
<p>I've been through 3 support chats with no resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>can this be resolved???</p>
<p>
</p><p>hopefully someone can help!!</p>
<p>

<h2>            windows 10 locking and freezing</h2>
                    <p>hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to win10 64bit from win7 64. The computer has been fine until about 2 weeks ago when I noticed the computer freezes when accessing photogallery. since then the computer has become increasingly unstable. first windows apps caused it to freeze now
 it is spreading to 3rd party apps. </p>
<p>It appears the computer is just running really slowly then catches up and works again until the next freeze. the effects are random and can last until the computer is switched off to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sometimes small aspects of windows GUI fail at the moment I have my open windows&nbsp; shown on the task bar I cant access them but I can type this! and now they have gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All hardware and software checks show up no problems as far as i can tell there is no malware or virus infestation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The symptoms seem to be similar to the anniversary update problems...</p>
<p>
</p><p>accessing windows apps is a sure way to get a lockup.</p>

            Same happens to me mate. Windows support has gone dark on my question, since even they have no idea how to unfuck this. Sometimes disk (SSD) uses 100% which is abnormal since my PC is fairly new.

</p><p>Thanks.. as I suspected.. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer worked well until.. one of those mandatory updates methinks...&nbsp; then FUBAR...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cant even roll back to an earlier install, it just wont do it!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of that I initially thought it was a virus but it isnt ...,&nbsp; it would appear to be the good ol boys at Microshaft...again</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would cut them some slack as the the amount of code about must be difficult to keep on top of..... but to release an update that gives your computer Alzheimers.......that sucks..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may try cloning my drive onto a HDD to see if that works.. and have a slower computer! &nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen some workarounds but just as bad with no guarantee of working.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We would suggest you to perform a clean boot to isolate the issues that you are encountering. To perform a clean boot in
<strong>Windows 10</strong>, refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>

            <p>hello Jorge</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clean booted and my computer is a little more stable, but the freezing has returned.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I try to access a Microsoft app the computer freezes. As an example I can type this via Firefox but after trying to access the command prompt I cannot select anything on the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several anti malware programs, bitdefender,&nbsp; avg anti virus and zonealarm firewall so i dont think its a virus attack.</p>

            And as you can see, we are both fighting the same problem and those feedback guys don't give crap about this bug... It's really really really annoying me, and still devs can't unfuck this mess they made... Tell me if you find anything usefull, since both
 threads I made were unsuccesfull, they just asked me for sys info and then gone dark...

</p><p>I have checked all again and note that Spybot anti-beacon was consistently using 25% of cpu resources.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled it and cured the problem... so far! </p>
<p>
</p><p>However this program worked without issue until the listed microsoft updates installed on 14th of September;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have emailed Spybot support&nbsp; for some guidance in the meantime I will reinstall anti-beacon to see what effect it has.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you</p>

<p>Describe to us how and what you used to manually assign a KMS host?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thats normally some third party hacked utility that pretends to be a KMS host. If you downloaded one off the Internet randomly, there is not much you can do the officially remove it without performing a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had system restore points created, you could try performing a system restore before you had set it up:</p>

Hi, there!<br />
<br />
my skype has stopped connecting! Instead of being green, the wheel next to my picture is blue with arrows, and keeps turning around. What happened? and what should I do to connect ? (my internet is working, as I can send you this message). Thanks in advance!
 Wish you a lovely weekend!<br />

<p>I've successfully downloaded Legendary Edition for Destiny. Then I'm launching it and adding all downloads.</p>
<p>My XBOX360 downloaded successfully the next content:</p>
<p>The Taken King</p>
<p>Destiny</p>
<p>Destiny Expansion Pass</p>
<p>Expansion II</p>
<p>And then XBOX360 tries to download&nbsp;Expansion I, shows 1%complete for some seconds, then 100% and then shows an error "Can't download Expansion I"</p>

<p>After this I can't play Destiny and any other Legendary Edition content.</p>

<p>How can I fix this problem?</p>

<p>Can you go all the way to the right to the settings hub, and go to the System tile in the upper left.
</p>
<p>There go to the storage options. </p>
<p>There go find the Destiny "folder" and look for the "Expansion I" DLC. </p>
<p>Check if the DLC is marked as corrupt. If so, delete it. </p>
<p>If not, delete it anyways, and re-download the DLC from your download history.

<li>Ask a friend to run the command <em>recoverydrive.exe</em> on his Windows 10 machine to create a bootable flash disk.</li><li>Boot the machine off this disk.</li><li>Check the various options until you find the Command Prompt.</li><li>Use commands such as&nbsp;<br />
dir c:\ {Enter}<br />
dir d:\ {Enter}<br />
dir e:\ {Enter}<br />
to find out if the hard disk is still accessible.</li></ol>

 and when I do, everything shows up normal until I print it. Please help. I want to fix this before my husband tries to do it! Thanks.

All web pages?<br />
Or just certain ones - the more complicated ones with menu systems and dynamic content on the sides/tops/bottoms?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Usually such web pages have an option for printing the actual story without all the extras - look for that.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Web browsers don't always just print what they see *as they see it* nor can they always do that (due to the web page resolution, etc.)<br />

<p>
</p><p>A simple way please, I am not especially computer-friendly.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Was Windows 10 Pro installed on that drive before you swapped over to the SSD?

<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />list disk
<br />
<br />Note down the disc number of that disc
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter (replace 3 with correct disc number):
<br />
<br />select disk 3
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />clean
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and check to see if you can then access that drive . . .

<p>My cover keyboard stopped working on 14 September 2018 after a Windows update. I turned the device on... keyboard working.... I watched it install firmware and a few patches.... the keyboard no longer works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is definitely NOT a hardware fault - unless Microsoft are saying that our devices are running older hardware which is no longer supported?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, playing devil's advocate here, is it a ruse to generate revenue by making devices appear to be defective?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will add, that there is no device driver listed in Device Manager.</p>

            I tried it with the PC on and off. Both times it lead me to the Surface UEFI. The restart/reset does help when the mouse/keyboard stops responding. Yet, when I put the computer to sleep, and then wake it back up, I have the same problems. I get the USB
 error I mentioned earlier, and the trackpad and keyboard stop working. At no point does my keyboard backlight start working. Should I try reverting to prior to the latest Windows update?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the common reasons why the game is not working on Windows 10 is due to compatibility issues. To check if the game will work on Windows 10, we recommend that you visit the link below.</p>

    <title>Problema al comprar paquete Familiar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xmakakox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problema al comprar paquete Familiar</h2>
                    
<p>Que tal, expongo mi problema tal cuál sucede.</p>

<p>Al la hora de que intento actualizar mi membresia a una familiar gold no me lo permite pues aparce un error. Tampoco puedo comprar MPs pero sí he podido actualizar mi membresia personal a Live Gold.</p>
<p>El método de pago es mediante una tarjeta de débito ligada a PayPal. La tarjeta de débito es de Bancomer y es Visa Electron.</p>
<p>¿Cómo es posible que haya podido comprar una membresia por un mes pero que no pueda comprar el paquete familiar o los MPs?</p>

<p>Muchas gracias.</p>

<p>Gracias por tu pronta respuesta, es lo que estoy leyendo en los foros. Sí pensé que mi caso sería similar pero preferí abrir una nueva pregunta para quitar mis dudas y no pensar que sea mi tipo de tarjeta.</p>
<p>Ahora bien. ¿Es posible que pueda comprar nada más una membresia y no un paquete familiar ni puntos MPs?</p>
<p>¿Se maneja todo igual?</p>

<p>Todo se maneja igual, sólo que veo que eres GOLD, mejor espera a que seas silver, ya que si compras siendo GOLD una membrecía de un año, te la darán a precio, que son como 600 pesos, y a los silver les sale como en 600 pesos [siempre hay promoción para pasar
 de silver a GOLD].</p>

<p>El paquete familiar te sale en 999.00 más unos 10 pesos de iva, creo puedes cancelar el servicio y te reembolsan lo restante [jamás he cancelado] y si sube de precio, aplicará hasta que compres nuevamente una membrecía.</p>

<p>hola </p>
<p>te voy a dar unos pasos que seguir que en particular son los que he hecho</p>
<p>en esta misma pag, hasta arriba, abajo de tu GT dice cuenta, entras ahi y donde dice actualizar forma de pago ahi puedes poner tu tarjeta de credito, y los datos de facturacion si la tarjeta es tuya pues con tus datos exacto, te recomiendo que no hagas tu
 compra en el sitio ya que te va a decir que no es posible hacer la compra eso si cuando pongas la tarjeta no te va a decir nada si la tajeta tiene algun error al momento de ponerla te informara de inmediato</p>
<p>Luego vas a la consola y desde ahi compras tu membresia o puntos, y no debes de tener problema alguno</p>
<p>Que si es seguro, pues si es 100% seguro el sistema de cobro de xbox, al hacer tu compra te recomiendo que despeus hables a soporte y quiten tu tarjeta del sistema, para que, porque se va a quedar como renovacion automatica y asi se va a seguir de por vida
 si tienes una bronca por cambio de tarjeta o que haya caducado esta queda inutil y puedes perder tu cuenta si no hay donde cobrar la membresia</p>
<p>muchas personas (hasta yo) lo hemos hecho mas por cualquier cosa que por que te vayan a cobrar algo indebido, es mas si compartes tu consola con alguien que vaya ha hacerte una compra que no quieres solo es seguridad</p>
<p>si tienes dudas avisanos y te ayudamos </p>
<p>sld</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Es más fácil introducir los datos de la tarjeta desde la consola, que desde la página, además que en la página sólo se puede con tarjeta de crédito, mientras que en la consola te acepta tambien la de débito, la cual debe ser visa o mastercard, con persmiso
 para comprar en internet.</p>
<p>Bueno, como dice el amigo SMX, le das comprar, agregar opción de pago y metes los datos de la tarjeta, agarra [importante] tu contrato y escribe tal y cual los datos como vienen ahí, no olvides poner la fecha de caducidad de la tarjeta [en caso de ser de
 débito] y listo.</p>
<p>Recuerda que si compras una membrecía GOLD con tarjeta, no la podrás quitar hasta que se termine tu membrecía, que igual como dijo SMX, al comprar una membrecía queda activada la renovación automática "para que no pierdas un dia sin membrecía GOLD" [eso
 dicen ellos, pero en realidad es para no soltarte], para quitar la renovación automática, checa en cuentas, como dijo SMX y ahí está la opción de quitar la renovación automática. Si no compraste alguna membrecía y sólo MP o algún juego bajo demanda, puedes
 quitar tu tarjeta sin problemas, pero si es tuya, podrías dejarla para no tenerla que introducir posteriormente cuando quieras comprar algo más, y por cargos fantasmas no temas, MS es muy serio y jamás te cobraría algo que no debe, sólo debes tener cuidado
 de no prestar tu perfil, y protegerlo bien para que no te lo roben.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 is extremely slow going to sleep and waking up. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> azurerhythm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 is extremely slow going to sleep and waking up.</h2>
                    I timed it the other day; it took almost five minutes for Windows to enter sleep mode. I tried to wake it, and it literally took another five minutes before the login screen displayed. It does this on a regular basis, and it's starting to get very irritating.
 I have tried updating my drivers, but the Device Manager claims that they are up to date. If it helps, I am running the 64-bit version on an HP laptop with 4 gigs of ram. The processor is an AMD Turion 64 X2 TL-60 at 2 GHz. I can provide more information if
 needed. If anyone has any advice at all, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

            You are seeing an incompatibility problem for 7 with your chiopset drivers (for ACPI). You can try to locate Win 7 drivers on the system maker's website, and on Windows Update.

    <title>Windows 7 Sync conflicts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottwal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Sync conflicts</h2>
                    <p>I have a client running SBS Server 2008 and Windows 7 on 2 laptops. We have network folders set to be available offline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever the client has been away, and using the laptop, he then syncs when back in the office and gets multiple sync conflicts, the majority of which are temp files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is, firstly, is there any way to stop the temp files syncing, and secondly, why are these temp files appearing as conflicts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know I can ignore&nbsp;these files as a resolution, but doing so just seems the wrong way to clear the conflicts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            I’ve been having the same problem. I was told by customer service at Microsoft that they have had a high influx of fraudulant purchases of the Xbox Live and Xbox digital gift cards through the website along with people’s card information being used by
 the people committing fraud for these purchases. Because of this, they are blocking everyones account until the fraud calls stop and they are able to ensure it is safe to reinstate the legitimate customer accounts. Until then, I found out (and the Microsoft
 rep confirmed) that you can buy the Xbox cards at your local store (Walmart, Game Stop, etc.) and add them to your account using the key code on the backs. Just make sure you’re getting the right card for what you’re wanting to use it for (i.e. Xbox Live/Xbox
 gift card).&nbsp;
