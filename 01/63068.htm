<h2>            Love Skyrim, Just Bought Oblivion, Have a Q..</h2>
                    
<p>I realize Oblivion has its own forum, but it's dead, so I figured this'd be a good place to ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, Skyrim is my first Elder Scrolls game (although I am a Fallout vet)&nbsp;and to say I'm addicted would be an understatement. With that said, I figured I'd pick up Oblivion GOTY &amp; see if I like it as much. I know what I'm doing in Skyrim (had a level 58
 character &amp;&nbsp;currently have a level 60 character), but I'm told choosing a race &amp; leveling up in Oblivion is quite different, so my question is as follows: What is the best race to choose for an all-around type of character? I play mainly as a sword/shield
 type character (Nord), but I use <strong>a lot</strong> of magic &amp; love sneaking around w/ a bow &amp; arrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any tips would be greatly appreciated. Cheers!</p>

<p>Oblivion is a lot different, a lot more complex then skyrim. &nbsp;You have main skills which increase your level, but the amount your increase your level each time (+1 to +5) depends on how many time you increase your other skills which are based on attributes
 (strength, agility, endurance etc which govern the skills). Sounds complicated eh? It took me 1 full playthrough of Oblivion just to understand the intricacies of the leveling system!
</p>
<p>As far as well rounded characters you can roll with a nord again, dark elf is pretty versatile, wood elfs are good sneaking characters. I would recommend Dark Elf first playthrough or imperial (the local to Cyrodiil)
</p>
<p>I also browse the Oblivion forum occasionally so you can ask questions there, but yea it is pretty dead!

<p>The leveling actually sounds a lot like Fallout. But yeah, w/ games like these (ES, FO, ME, etc), my 1st character always turns out to be a mess because I have no clue what I'm doing till I've already done it.</p>

<p>In Oblivion you can make a character that is a beast, more so then in fallout or skyrim especially when you get around to creating your own spells/enchantments. I put way more hours into Oblivion then I should have so you can always send me a message if
 you have any questions and I can answer most. This website is valuable too <a href="http://uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Oblivion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Personally I prefer the khajiit as a rouge/assassin due to racial bonuses.</p>
<p>Here's how I see them.</p>
<p>Caster races:</p>
<p>Altmer</p>
<p>Breton</p>
<p>Dunmer</p>
<p>Warrior races:</p>
<p>Nord</p>
<p>Redguard</p>
<p>Orc</p>
<p>Imperial</p>
<p>Rogue races:</p>
<p>Bosmer</p>
<p>Argonian</p>
<p>Khajiit</p>
<p>Keeping in mind you can play your own way, play-style determines character so you don't have to pick a class. &nbsp;What it boils down to in Skyrim for a character is how you distribute points when you level up (Magicka, Health, or Stamina) and choice of perks.
 &nbsp;If you're playing either a warrior or rogue all you have to do is have a balance of health and stamina when you level up. &nbsp;Playing as a mage means more points put into magicka and adopting a different combat style, unless you want to be a battlemage. &nbsp;One
 last piece of advice; never level up crafting ahead of combat skills because that will come around to bite you in the @@@ pretty quick. &nbsp;Just level up skills as evenly as possible unless you want a challenge.</p>

<p>In Oblivion, Dark Elf made the game very easy. Almost everything seemed to be fire based, and the Dark Elves got a pretty nice innate resistance.</p>
<p>As far as leveling, it's a pain. You need to pick major skills that you don't use often, but can if you want to. It's very counter intuitive, but if you pick majors that you use, like a weapon, armor, sneak, etc, you'll be hurting big time.</p>
<p>You level when you gain a set number of skill ups of major skills, and get 3 attributes to raise. Each raise will raise that stat by the number of skill increases in that area that occured (All skill increases, not just major)</p>
<p>So, you need to write down your skills when you level up, then make sure you have at least 5 in each attribute type, then go use armorer, or whatever major skills you choose. It seems hard, but once you understand what's going on, it's pretty easy, just
 requires a bit of bookkeeping. I think I used a lot of crafting skills as Major and only ever crafted when I was ready to level up.</p>

<p>I ended up with a Breton in Oblivion but still a stealth mage. The more open Ayleid ruins make marksman and sneak a more viable option than some of the clautrophobic dungeons in Skyrim (or Morrowind). I really recommend going to the UESP wiki for Oblivion.
 Because it is an old game it is a mature source of information and maps. It has great maps for every place. It also has a comprehensive explanation of the leveling system with all its quirks.</p>

<p>Complicated question.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>1) You'll choose seven Skills that contribute to your levelup bar and leave 14 as minor skills that don't increase your level.</p>
<p>2) You have to increase your Stats as well as your Skills. Stats were completely abandoned for Skyrim.</p>
<p>3) You need to raise any combination of Major Skills ten times to levelup. This is similar to Skyrim but it is any skill in Skyrim and the number of increases is flexible.</p>
<p>4) Leveling isn't a simple matter of do and get better. Your skills will 'do and get better' but you need to time their increases and supplement Major Skills with Minor Skills to get better Stat Bonuses.</p>
<p>5) Unimportant to what I'm about to say but you can only levelup by sleeping in a bed.</p>
<p>6) Also unimportant, you can use Trainers much more efficiently in this game... they help to control your leveling and are much cheaper.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Let's get started.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Let's say you've just finished the Tutorial and you're a Level 2 without any extra Skill increases. There are two ways you can level in Oblivion. You can put +5 points on two Stats and put one point (nothing increases the number of points you can put on
 Luck) on Luck OR you can put +5 points on each of three Stats leaving Luck untouched. The first method will let you max your character's Stats but the second will get you close to Maxed more quickly, though you'll have Luck only at 50.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Either way, you'll want 10 Major Skill increases to level up AND either 10 Minor Skill increases (if you want to increase Luck) or 20 Minor Skill Increases (if you want to do it without increasing Luck).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>When you level your character, you'll be brought to the Stat Screen. What you want to see is +5 for two different Stats if you're going to put one on Luck or +5 for three different Stats if you want to raise three 'real' stats. It takes ten Skill increases
 to get to that +5 for any Stat, but obviously they have to be related.... leveling your Armourer 10 times is going to increase Endurance, not Personality.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You want to hit the +5 for all your chosen Stats to increase but you don't want to be going over that because you're effectively wasting increases that could be increasing the + you get to your Stats the next levelup. For that reason, you want to choose
 the Skills you want to increase to raise your stats each level carefully. You don't something tedious and slow to increase, because you'll bore yourself, but you don't want something you can't control since you'll end up wasting levels. Athletics is a good
 example of this... you can't really avoid getting it up.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also, all Stats apply backwards except for Endurance. The Health benefit from raising Endurance does not apply backwards. Because of this, no matter what kind of character you're after, you should definitely have Armourer, Block or Heavy Armour, I believe,
 in your levelup rotation as soon as possible.</p>
<p>________</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You're a level 2, having just had a nap outside the tutorial in a bandit camp. You can easily perfect the first levelup too, but it would be nice to see the levelup process yourself and all sorts of skills will be raised in the tutorial.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>After your sleep you've had no Skills increase. That's cool, that's what you're after. Assuming you want to go +5, +5 and Luck, what you want now is to raise two separate attributes by +5, which means you need to raise a combination of the appropriate Skills
 by 10. Also assuming you want to do it +5, +5 Luck, you'll want to make 10 of those 20 Skills Major Skills, so you can actually level up, and 10 Minor Skills for the other +5.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Let's say your Heavy Armour is a Major Skill, and so is Blade. What you want to be doing is increasing your Heavy Armour by 9 points, leaving you just about to level up, then increasing a combination of Blunt and Hand to Hand by 10. That can be 10/0, 5/5
 or 9/1, it doesn't matter, so long as you increase those Skills by 10 before you increase a Major Skill by 10 total, or another 1 since you've already done 9. You can't use Blade, since you'll only hit +4 Endurance, which is OK.... and +1 (which is standard)
 Strength, along with +1 Luck, which is what you're after.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If you successfully do the Heavy Armour and Blunt/Hand to Hand, what you'll end up with is this:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Strength: +5.</p>
<p>Intelligence.</p>
<p>Willpower.</p>
<p>Speed.</p>
<p>Personality.</p>
<p>Endurance: +5.</p>
<p>Agility.</p>
<p>Luck.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You then want to select Strength, Endurance and Luck for the three selections you get to make, because getting +5 is the maximum while +1 is pointless, except for Luck which you can never raise beyond 1 at a time.</p>
<p>________</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Every Skill obviously dictates the increase of a different Attribute. For the purpose of ideal leveling, what you then want is a decent split between the Skills that raise different Attributes.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You do not want a premade Class at all, you want a Custom Class.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Secondly, you do not want a class that looks like this:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Heavy Armour.</p>
<p>Block.</p>
<p>Armourer.</p>
<p>Blade.</p>
<p>Hand to Hand.</p>
<p>Blunt.</p>
<p>Speech.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This is bad for several reasons. 1, you cannot raise Strength (Blade, Hand to Hand and Blunt) or Endurance (Heavy Armour, Block and Armourer) with any flexibility... if you want to raise this Attribute the Skill HAS to contribute to a levelup. There are
 a few problems with doing this though I can't adequately explain them at the moment.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You want a more varied class, something like this:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Blade (Strength).</p>
<p>Block (Endurance)</p>
<p>Light Armour (Speed)</p>
<p>Marksman (Agility)</p>
<p>Illusion (Personality)</p>
<p>Destruction (Willpower)</p>
<p>Alchemy (Intelligence).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This will give you the greatest flexibility in your leveling, barring personal preferences such as disliking Marksman and so on. With the above class, if you want to raise Endurance and Strength, for example, you can raise Block 5 times, for half a levelup,
 Blunt and Hand to Hand 10 times, for no levelup credit, and then finish with Block by another 5 points.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>That's ideal, since you'll have +0, +0, +0, +0, +0, +0, +5, +5 and a +0 (which just means +1... it doesn't say +1, it doesn't give a plus figure at all if you're only getting one point) for Luck, which is flawless.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also, having some Skills that govern each Attribute as both Major and Minor Skills means you can make up for your mistakes.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If you do +5 Block, for example, then somehow accidentally raise Illusion by 4 points, you can't use another Major Skill to raise Block because you'll end up with 6 increases before you levelup, giving you a +3, which is sub-par. You'll want to complete
 this levelup by going +5 Block, +4 Illusion, +5 Speech, +4 Heavy Armour and finally finishing it up with a +1 increase to Block.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>With that, you'll have +10 to Endurance Skills, giving you a +5 bonus at the levelup screen, and +10 to Personality Skills, giving you a +5 to Personality at the levelup screen, with a spare selection for Luck.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In this example you changed from Strength to Personality to avoid wasting Skill increases, which is fine. The only Attribute you don't want to be doing this to is Endurance, since you want your Endurance, and therefore your Health, as high as possible as
 soon as possible. The same example would apply if you had a few Minor Skill points in another Skill, for example. You patched the problem at hand but lost a few Skill increases... that's fine. You don't need all of them, you'll have some spare and can waste
 those. Also, remember that it isn't a matter of life or death and that going back to fix a mistake will take hours of playtime, unless you're doing it on a second playthrough with the most efficient leveling methods out there... but that's not what you want
 in a first playthrough.</p>
<p>________</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You'll also have to choose a Race and Birthsign.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>With regards to the Birthsigns, there are only a few that are worth choosing. Anything that increases Stats, such as the Warrior, is weak, with one exception. This is only furthered because of the leveling system above.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Most powers, such as the ones The Tower will give you, can only be used daily and this is annoying. Most powers can also be obtained as Spells, which are infinitely more useful, unless the power is a Lesser Power (less powerful but can be recasted).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This having been said, the ones that are most useful are The Mage, The Apprentice, The Thief and The Atronach.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The Mage gives you +50 Magicka with no penalty, which is nice because you'll be able to create spells to use all your Magicka, so more is always better, and no penalty is nice.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The Apprentice gives you +100, but doubles Magicka damage that you take.... not very good for high difficulties or if you can't strafe the incoming Magic but a great boost.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The Atronach gives you +150... which is insane, but you don't regenerate it. That's.... a big pity. You have 50% chance to absorb incoming spells, however, which is nice. You could further augment this absorb later on, which will keep your Magicka high and
 provide serious damage nullification, but I personally dislike this one.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The Thief increases your Luck by 10 points... least noticeable of these stones but it will decrease the levels you need to raise your luck to full by 10. It would take you until level 50 (your maximum natural level, roughly) but this means it'll only take
 40.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Of these my favourite is probably the Apprentice but like I say, that's up to you and another may prove your style. The Mage is a safer bet while the Atronach changes a Mage's style drastically, along with reducing the danger a Mage poses.</p>
<p>________</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Lastly, you'll need to build a Custom Class.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Like I already said, you'll want a combination of Skills to allow for efficient leveling (check the manual for the classification of each Skill, but bear in mind that the original Oblivion's manual, at least, mistakenly calls Block an Agility Skills where
 it's actually an Endurance Skill.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You'll also get to choose a +5 (I believe it says +10, but this is also incorrect in game) bonus to two Attributes. The obvious choices here are Luck and Endurance, but you may substitute one or the other for something like Intelligence, if you prefer being
 a Mage. Luck because it lowers the levels needed to max it and Endurance because you need it as early as possible.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Other than that, you'll need to choose a Specialisation to increase faster than the others. There are Skills that raise much slower than the others, such as Athletics and Marksman, but your choice is not overly important since you'll be after most Skills.
 I'd suggest going for the School that you will want to specialise in regardless of leveling: either Combat, Magic or Stealth.</p>
<p>________</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I'd say lastly, but I already did. I'll ignore that. You'll need, obviously, a Race.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>There are some races that are OK. Orcs, Nords and Regduards. The better, more powerful races are the Breton and the High Elf, with the Breton probably coming out on top. The Argonians deserve a mention too, with Disease and Poison immunity, I believe it
 is.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The Breton's 50% Magic Resistance destroys the Nord and Dark Elf's Frost and Fire resistance respectively, along with being great for any class, while the High Elf gets extra Magicka and that's always a good thing.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This one is up to you, don't be afraid to choose what you want regardless of its abilities.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Overall, take what I've laid out or not, doesn't bother me, just make sure you have a good time with it. It's a great game you could enjoy a lot, but you will have to remember that it isn't Skyrim and it is many years older, so some things won't be as good.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>There are enough good things about it, however, for it to have its own appeal, which is nice : )</p>

    <title>Wireless mouse wheel won&#39;t click - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stefanithatcher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless mouse wheel won&#39;t click</h2>
                    I have a Logitech M510 wireless mouse.&nbsp; After a recent update to a CAD program I use, the wheel click function stopped working.&nbsp; That is a critical function in my work with my CAD program.&nbsp; I can't seem to find a way to change any settings or update any
 drivers for it.&nbsp; I moved the wireless dongle to another port, but had no luck.

            Hello! Sorry you are having this issue. Hopefully we can fix it.
<br />
<br />Have you tried to restore point before updating CAD? Does the mouse wheel work outside of CAD? If so, then you should rollback the CAD update or find an old version/beta version of CAD to update to instead that works.

<p>
</p><p>Looks like we should be trying to find out if Logitech have anything similar to MS mousinfo (which comes with IntelliPoint or Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center--in case you also have a Microsoft mouse that is showing the same symptom). &nbsp; In fact, "wheel
 click" in MMKC is a goofy default--something like Task View (Win+Tab) instead of Middleclick.&nbsp; So, what are you expecting from your "wheel click" anyway?</p>

    <title>Connection curiousity. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruthless tenjin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connection curiousity.</h2>
                    
<p>I understand that earlier Live had some problems with connecting and allowing users to sign in. After a bit, it seemed that it was fixed so I took a break. Recently, I turned my 360 on and it took a while before it just signed into my profile and not Live.
 I manually connected and the moment I decided to start up Netflix, it instantly disconnected me. Curious, I check my modem and router, making sure the problem isn't on my end first. After realizing everything on my side is perfectly fine, I decide to restart
 my 360. It loads up, connects to Live automatically like it should have, and stays connected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, before anybody asks, my NAT is open for my 360 and I have no problem using any other device my modem or router. I know it's connected to Live now, and letting me view Netflix, but I was curious about something. Is this still a problem that's ongoing
 and not truly fixed just yet? Is it still being worked on? I know the status says Live is up and running, but the same issue happened to me that was happening earlier when it was a widespread problem. Are there still some kinks to work out?</p>

<p>I am part of the Xpert program and another user posted the same problem with his netflix. After restarting his system and trying again though he was able to get on netflix fine</p>
<p>I can't speak for the xbox life staff but I would think that it is up and running however some services may not be fully stable just yet? (such as netflix).

<p>Yes, but starting up my 360 for the first time about 15 or 20 minutes ago resulted in not automatically connecting at all. The thing I don't understand is why? I had to manually connect the first time, which then resulted in me getting disconnected immediately
 after trying to view Netflix. That leads me to believe it would have done so for starting up a game as well, though I don't know. I'm just curious if Live itself is still having problems, is all.</p>

<p>See Steve Winograd's reply to you, but also note the following:</p>
<p>If you have only 1GB of free space, you have used almost all the space<br />
on your drive. Yes, you can recover some of it, as Steve suggests, but<br />
the savings will only be temporary, and <strong>anything</strong> you do will only be<br />
a stopgap measure.</p>
<p>Your drive is clearly too small for you, and your only real solution<br />
is to buy a new larger drive. Fortunately drives are very inexpensive<br />
now.</p>

    <title>Xbox One&#58; Day One Edition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andreevkms  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One&#58; Day One Edition</h2>
                    
<p>В ноябре этого года Microsoft начнет новую эпоху игр и развлечений <br />
<br />
<br />
Корпорация Microsoft объявляет подробности выпуска, цены, программу предварительных заказов, специальный бандл, а также аксессуары для одного из самых ожидаемых релизов этого года.<br />
<br />
<br />
ЛОС-АНДЖЕЛЕС — 10 июня 2013 г. — Продолжая череду новостей об Xbox One, начатую 21 мая, корпорация Microsoft сегодня раскрыла детали запуска ожидаемой всеми системы игр и развлечений семейства Xbox. Консоль Xbox One, которая выйдет в ноябре 2013 г. в 21 стране
 мира, включая Россию, — это самая современная универсальная система развлечений, созданная для гостиной 21-го века. Это новый мир игр, музыки, телетрансляций, кино, спорта и приложений, персонализированный для каждого пользователя и управляемый с помощью голосовых
 команд.<br />
<br />
Каждая система Xbox One будет включать: новую консоль Xbox One с жестким диском на 500 Гб, 1 проигрывателем Blu-ray и встроенным Wi-Fi-модулем; обновленный сенсор Kinect; один беспроводной контроллер Xbox One Wireless Controller и бесплатную золотую подписку
 Xbox Live на 14 дней для новых пользователей. В Европе стартовый набор Xbox One будет доступен по рекомендованной розничной цене 499 евро. 2
<br />
<br />
В честь выпуска Xbox One корпорация Microsoft также представляет консоль в специальной комплектации для тех, кто оформит предварительный заказ на систему в крупных розничных магазинах. Набор доступен в ограниченном количестве по цене 499.99 долларов США, 499
 евро или 429 фунтов. 2 Размещение предварительного заказа на этот специальный набор гарантирует возможность покупки новой системы в день ее выпуска. Каждый комплект будет включать систему Xbox One в черной премиальной упаковке, беспроводной контроллер Xbox
 One Day One, а также уникальное достижение Day One Achievement.<br />
<br />
Игроки, предварительно заказавшие следующие эксклюзивные игры, запланированные к релизу вместе с Xbox One, получат бонусный контент, который позволит получить больше удовольствия от игры:<br />
<br />
· Ryse: Son of Rome: эксклюзивная карта для многопользовательской игры и меч с бонусными параметрами.<br />
<br />
· Forza Motorsport 5: мгновенный доступ к трем автомобилям, максимально тюнингованным для своего класса.<br />
<br />
· Kinect Sports Ribals: эксклюзивное спортивное оборудование, которое выделит вашего Чемпиона из числа других спортсменов.<br />
<br />
· Dead Rising 3: эксклюзивные наборы миссий Frank West and Chuck Greene Tribute Packs с бонусными параметрами.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Кроме того, в благодарность миллионам поклонников во всем мире за их страстную преданность Xbox, Microsoft объявила, что все подписчики Xbox Live Gold – как действующие, так и новые – получат возможность загружать по две бесплатных игры для Xbox 360 в месяц
 в период с 1 июля и до выпуска Xbox One, в том числе такие популярные игры, как Halo 3 и Assassin’s Creed II. А в честь выставки E3 в июне подписчики Xbox Live Gold смогут бесплатно загрузить игру Fable III.<br />
<br />
Заказать консоль Xbox One уже сегодня и просмотреть полный список цен и стран, где консоль появится в продаже, можно на сайте www.xbox.com/reserve, где приведен перечень магазинов-участников.<br />
<br />
Новые аксессуары для усиления эффекта от игр нового поколения<br />
<br />
Вместе с Xbox One в ноябре этого года выйдет новая линейка первоклассных аксессуаров, которые сделают игры нового поколения еще более атмосферными, управляемыми и доступными:
<br />
<br />
· Беспроводной контроллер Xbox One Wireless Controller. В контроллер Xbox внесено более 40 технических и конструктивных нововведений. Измененные крестовина, стики и форма контроллера обеспечивают более точное управление, а новые генераторы вибрационных импульсов
 оказывают точное воздействие на кончики пальцев, что гарантирует небывалую степень погружения в игру. Контроллер Xbox One Wireless Controller рассчитан на работу в паре с новым контроллером Kinect. Оба контроллера соединяются автоматически и обеспечивают непрерывную
 синхронизацию поступающих от игрока данных.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
· Комплект для зарядки Xbox One Play &amp; Charge Kit. В комплект входит набор литий-ионных аккумуляторов для контроллера Wireless Controller и кабель для зарядки, соединяющий контроллер с консолью. Теперь игрокам не придется покупать одноразовые батареи. Новый
 комплект Play &amp; Charge Kit заряжает аккумулятор вдвое быстрее, чем его аналог для Xbox 360; возможна зарядка во время игры и в режиме ожидания. Комплект можно приобрести отдельно или в наборе с беспроводным контроллером Wireless Controller with Play &amp; Charge
 Kit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
· Гарнитура для голосового чата Xbox One Chat Headset. Непременный атрибут поклонников игр через Интернет, новая гарнитура Xbox One Chat Headset, подключаемая к контроллеру, рассчитана на длительные сеансы игры и обеспечивает чистое звучание голоса. Легкая
 и удобная моногарнитура имеет широкий частотный диапазон и однонаправленный микрофон. Игроки наверняка оценят возможность отключать и включать микрофон, не убирая руки с контроллера.</p>

<p>Они же говорили, что в контроллере батарейка будет несъемная. :( Нуууууу. :( Хотя бы сделали подачу питания на USB-порты, чтобы можно было заряжать при выключенной консоли - и на том спасибо!</p>
<p>Голосовая гарнитура убила тоже. Надеялся, что теперь они в комплекте пусть дешевую, но стерео гарнитуру сделают. Не, опять одно ухо с микрофоном, ога. И опять провод к геймпаду, а не беспроводной. Не, ну окей, хрен с ним, все равно большинство хардкорных
 игроков будут покупать TurtlesBeach, Triton и т.д. Но зачем было убирать поддержку уже существующих сторонних гарнитур для Xbox 360? Да, контроллеры на 360 "висят" на СинеЗубе, а от One будут на Wi-Fi, но неужели нельзя было оставить совместимость?</p>
<p>Ах нет, постойте. Если оставить совместимость сторонних девайсов для 360 на One, то тогда нельзя будет содрать дополнительные бабки за сертификацию выпуска переферии на новой консольке.

<p>БАЯН в тему</p>
<p>Если бы Apple делали велосипеды…</p>
<p>- Руль крутить бесплатно, тормозить платно.</p>
<p>- Воздух для колеса 5 баксов, закачивать только специальным насосом, через специальный шланг.</p>
<p>Насосы и воздух от других велосипедов не подходят.</p>
<p>- Багажник есть, но прокатить ты на нем никого не можешь, так как это противоречит условиям лицензии.</p>
<p>- iVel или iCycle едет быстро, но педали крутятся очень тяжело и сил хватает максимум на полдня.</p>
<p>- Новый iVel стоит как три обычных велосипеда, но люди за значок откусанного яблока на крыле и стильную белую раму, готовы платить любые деньги.</p>
<p>- Apple будет судиться с остальными велопроизводителями за нарушение патентов, ведь у других велосипедов тоже круглые колёса!</p>

<p>Но на самом деле сонибои просто крутят счетчик. 1507 предзаказов PS4 (на 1158 больше чем Xbox One)</p>
<p>Да и на канобу как я понял уже давно это в большей степени PS4-фанбои + ПК-элита))</p>
<p>Я узнал что предзаказы должны были открыть 21 июня. Но до сиз пор никакого результата.</p>

    <title>No Signal Connecting XBox One S Digital with Samsung TV - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doilrules  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Signal Connecting XBox One S Digital with Samsung TV</h2>
                    <p>Hello -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a frustrating time setting up my XBox One S Digital Edition with Samsung 4K TV(s). In short, the Samsung TV says 'No Signal' on the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now tried to set-up the XBox on two separate (and different model) Samsungs, but same result. I've searched high and low for a solution, but cannot find anything that makes it work. Among others, I've tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Swapped out HDMI cables multiple times</p>
<p>2) Reset the XBox display setting by holding down power and bind buttons (<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/tv-or-monitor-screen-is-blank-while-connected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/tv-or-monitor-screen-is-blank-while-connected</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Tried two separate Samsung TVs - I don't have a different brand or I would try something else</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I'm forgetting other attempted solutions, but ultimately I've spent 4-5 hours without success. I've read on some other discussion forums about the 'Black Screen' with Samsung TVs - mine isn't blank per se, but clearly showing that the XBox is not
 connecting to the TV because of the 'No Signal' message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it's worth, I'm able to connect other consoles (DVD, Cable) to the TV via HDMI cables and there are no issues. It's only with the XBox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to remedy? I'll name by next dog after you or perhaps buy a star in your name if you come up with a winning solution...(desperate)!&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!&nbsp;<br />
</p>

<p>Hi Doil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. You pretty much have tried all our troubleshooting. I did find an article on Samsung forum that may help.</p>

<p>Ok, I'm sorry to say this really silly suggestion, But it has happened before. You are connecting with the HDMI output and not the HDMI input, xbox one has two HDMI ports as most DVD and tv boxes have only one.</p>

            Thanks Brad. I appreciate you sending the link to the Samsung forum, but that is not relevant to the issue. I don't see a Blank Screen at all, but the screen says 'No Signal' when I try to connect an XBox to it.&nbsp;

<h2>            Family Safety blocking everything, even approved sites</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
Other Windows Live Family Safety issues

<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Family Safety are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2011 (15.4.3538.513)</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
</p>
<p>I've been using Windows Live Family Saftey for the last few years, and it has been working great.&nbsp; Recently, it started blocking everything on my son's user account on one PC.&nbsp; I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Family Safety, but it hasn't helped.&nbsp;
 Even when prompted, I click "Ask in Person", enter my Windows Live password, then "Try Again", still blocked.&nbsp; What else can I do to repair it?&nbsp; I've captured a log and can upload if it will help.</p>

            Hello - <br />
<br />
I am having this same problem with the same operating systems - win 7 and the same version of family safety.&nbsp; I went through your instructions and I am still getting the same problems.<br />
<br />
I also tried changing the filter to allow 'children friendly sites'.&nbsp; When I try to use the links that family safety shows- they are blocked too!&nbsp; Even though the filter says these are allowed.<br />
<br />
the problem started maybe 2-3 weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I use one child account for two machines to filter and I have removed all machines from family safety.&nbsp; When I go to set up one I get the same problem.&nbsp; I have tried allow list only and Child-friendly - to no avail.<br />
<br />
What else can I do?<br />
<br />
thanks!

            Hi Eugene R.,<br />
<br />
Question 1:<br />
Some of them are below - I have a whole list and none work - even when I allowed a&nbsp;web server on my own network:<br />
http://auntlee.com/<br />
http://kids.britannica.com/<br />
http://web.livemathbowl.com/<br />
http://disney.go.com/<br />
http://picnik.com/<br />
<br />
These all worked 3-4 weeks ago.&nbsp; I also changed the filter to allow "Child-Friendly" sites - the second level down.&nbsp; When the page comes up saying that the kids don't have access the page has a listing of 'approved' child-friendly web-sites - none of those
 work either.<br />
<br />
Question 2:<br />
I started getting this on sites they kids have been going to for months with no problems.&nbsp; I try to do the 'in-person' add and it seems to work, but when you go to "try again" - you get the same error.&nbsp; When I go to the filter to add it manual - it tells me
 the site is already in the list.<br />
<br />
Question 3:<br />
Yes - I used the refresh button and it said that the client is already up to date.&nbsp; I took it a step further and un-installed the client and re-installed - no change.&nbsp; I also did the steps above and removed ALL client computers and then re-set up the client
 with the kids username.&nbsp; I then logged out and logged back in and it still gave me the problem.&nbsp; I tried to re-add it again - no luck,...<br />
<br />
On your workaround - I tried this before and it told me the site was alreayd in the list.&nbsp; I tried to change the URL so it had just the main server name ie disney.com and no extra /****/**** and it still said it was in the list.<br />
<br />
What else can I do?<br />
<br />
Thanks!

<p><span>Hi
<span>Idaho_Pirate</span>,<br />
<br />
</span><span>This might be due to corrupted files. To resolve this issue, please refer to the following steps:
<br />
<br />
1. Perform Windows update:</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></span><a href="http://www.update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/vistadefault.aspx?ln=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Use
 your Start menu to check for updates</span></strong></a><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><b><span><br />
<br />
</span></b><span>2.&nbsp;Clear Windows Live Essentials by following the instructions from this link:&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></span><a href="http://windowslivehelp.com/solution.aspx?solutionid=64db5c80-85e4-49fe-bf07-cb08ffc5dd53" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>How
 to uninstall Windows Live Essentials</span></strong></a><span><br />
<br />
3. Browse your computer to C:\Program Files then <b>delete</b> the <b>Windows Live</b> folder if available.</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span><span>4. Temporarily disable other firewall.</span><span>
<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Note: </span></strong>Disabling the firewall may make your computer or your network vulnerable to attack by malicious users or by malicious software such as viruses. Please make sure that you do not have
 any other Internet Explorer window open or any other programs running while trying to install Windows Live products. Once, you are able to install our services, please turn your firewall back on.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span><span>5. Reset browser to factory settings:</span><span>
<br />
<br />
<strong><span>For Internet Explorer: </span>
</strong><b><br />
<br />
</b>a.<strong> </strong>Open <b>Internet Explorer</b>. <br />
</span><span>b. Click
<b>Tools</b>, and then click <b>Internet Options</b>. <br />
c. Click the <b>Advanced</b> tab. <br />
d. Under <b>Reset Internet Explorer Settings</b>, click <b>Reset</b>.</span><span>
<br />
<br />
</span><span>If you are using another browser, please look for steps on how to reset your browser to factory settings via&nbsp;</span><a href="http://bing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://bing.com</span></b></a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>6. Download and install
<b>Windows Live Essentials</b> from&nbsp;</span><a href="http://explore.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://explore.live.com</span></b></a><span><b>
<br />
<br />
</b></span><span>Afterwards, setup again the child account.
<span>You may follow the&nbsp;steps below to add a child account in Windows Live Family Safety.
<br />
<br />
1. On the Windows Live Family Safety home page (</span></span><a href="http://fss.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://fss.live.com/</span></strong></a><span>),
 click <strong><span>Sign in</span></strong>, and then sign in with your Windows Live ID (Parent account).<br />
<strong><span>Note:</span></strong> Don't select the
<strong><span>Save my password</span></strong> check box. If you do, children will be able to sign in and use your account.<br />
<br />
2. In the Family Safety pane, click <strong><span>Add child
</span></strong>or <strong><span>Add parent</span></strong>.<br />
If the new user doesn't already have their own Windows Live ID, click Create child ID or Create parent ID, and then follow the on-screen instructions to create a Windows Live ID for the new user.<br />
<br />
–or–<br />
<br />
If the new user already has their own Windows Live ID, click <strong><span>Sign in with this child's ID</span></strong> or
<strong><span>Sign in with this parent's ID</span></strong>.
<br />
<br />
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.<br />
Children added to Family Safety are, by default, given a set of child safety settings recommended by international child-safety organizations and based on their age group. Parents can use the Family Safety website to customize their children's safety settings.<br />

            I will give the updates a try - I see there is a Service Pack for Win 7 - could that have anything to do with it?&nbsp; Would something have changed in Family Safety that needs something from SP1?<br />
<br />
I am doubting corrupt files, because I have two different machines that have this problem at the same time.&nbsp; Could two different computers get corrupt files at the same time?&nbsp; What is shared between them that would corrupt?<br />
<br />
I will report back what I find.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            <p>Hi Jose, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately there is no option to remove&nbsp;default apps/programs from start menu. You have an option only to remove which you have pinned to start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However you can customize the start menu icons&nbsp;by following the below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In the search box type settings.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click on personalization and click on start option.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Then you have the options to customize start menu.</span></li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Refer to the below article on how to customize the start menu.</p>
<p>

    <title>How do I enumerate and select in C&#43;&#43; from the list of PCM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noggepiet  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I enumerate and select in C&#43;&#43; from the list of PCM formats published by a recording device in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I used the following to open a wave in device (USB codec) in XP: <br />
<br />
waveInOpen((HWAVEIN*)&amp;hWaveIn, idWaveIn, (LPWAVEFORMATEX)&amp;wfx, (DWORD)MainDlg-&gt;Handle,0, CALLBACK_WINDOW);<br />
<br />
How would I do this in Windows 7?&nbsp; The device is opened with its default format, and none of the approaches I tried works.&nbsp; Default format is listed in sound applet as 1 channel, 16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality). What I need is listed as 2 channels, 16 bit, 32000
 Hz (FM Radio Quality).<br />
<br />
Method 1:<br />
// set input PCM format<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PropVariantInit(&amp;varConfigBuf);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hr = pProps-&gt;GetValue(PKEY_AudioEngine_DeviceFormat, &amp;varConfigBuf);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if( (hr == S_OK) &amp;&amp; (varConfigBuf.vt == VT_BLOB) )<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(varConfigBuf.blob.cbSize&gt;0)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WAVEFORMATEX *pWaveFormatExBlob = (WAVEFORMATEX*)(varConfigBuf.blob.pBlobData);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (pWaveFormatExBlob-&gt;nChannels != wfx.nChannels&nbsp; ||<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pWaveFormatExBlob-&gt;nSamplesPerSec != wfx.nSamplesPerSec)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE *pWaveFormatExtensibleBlob=(WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE*)pWaveFormatExBlob;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pWaveFormatExBlob-&gt;wFormatTag = WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pWaveFormatExBlob-&gt;nChannels = wfx.nChannels;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pWaveFormatExBlob-&gt;nSamplesPerSec = wfx.nSamplesPerSec;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pWaveFormatExBlob-&gt;wBitsPerSample = wfx.wBitsPerSample;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pWaveFormatExBlob-&gt;nBlockAlign = wfx.nBlockAlign;//pWaveFormatExBlob-&gt;nChannels*pWaveFormatExBlob-&gt;wBitsPerSample/8;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pWaveFormatExBlob-&gt;nAvgBytesPerSec = wfx.nAvgBytesPerSec;//pWaveFormatExBlob-&gt;nSamplesPerSec*pWaveFormatExBlob-&gt;nBlockAlign;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //pWaveFormatExtensibleBlob-&gt;Samples.wValidBitsPerSample = pWaveFormatExBlob-&gt;wBitsPerSample;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //pWaveFormatExtensibleBlob-&gt;dwChannelMask = 3;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //GUID sf = (GUID)pWaveFormatExtensibleBlob-&gt;SubFormat;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //pWaveFormatExtensibleBlob-&gt;SubFormat = KSDATAFORMAT_SUBTYPE_PCM;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hr = pProps-&gt;SetValue(PKEY_AudioEngine_DeviceFormat, varConfigBuf);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(hr == S_OK)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hr = pProps-&gt;Commit();<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ShowMessage(AudioError(hr));<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
<br />
This method adds a new entry (2 channels, 16 bit, 32000 Hz ) to the list of formats under the Advanced tab, but the device still records mono.<br />
<br />
Method 2:<br />
IAudioClient *pAudioInterface=NULL;<br />
hr = pEndpoint-&gt;Activate(__uuidof(IAudioClient),CLSCTX_ALL,NULL,(void**)&amp;pAudioInterface);<br />
<br />
WAVEFORMATEX *pDeviceFormat;<br />
hr = pAudioInterface-&gt;IsFormatSupported(<br />
&nbsp; //AUDCLNT_SHAREMODE_EXCLUSIVE,<br />
&nbsp; AUDCLNT_SHAREMODE_SHARED,<br />
&nbsp; &amp;wfx,<br />
&nbsp; &amp;pDeviceFormat<br />
);<br />
CoTaskMemFree(pDeviceFormat);<br />
<br />
hr = pAudioInterface-&gt;Initialize( AUDCLNT_SHAREMODE_EXCLUSIVE,0,5000000,0,&amp;wfx,NULL );<br />
SAFE_RELEASE(pAudioInterface)<br />
<br />
Initialize() returns 0, but no change is made to the device's format. <br />
<br />
Is there any way of enumerating the list of formats supplied by the Sound applet, and then select one of those that I know is supported by the device?&nbsp; It's probably clear enough from the above, but in case not, I'm scratching around in the dark here and any
 help would be appreciated (even with derogatory remarks included!).<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Piet<br />

<h2>            What version of MS Visio will open old Visio 4.0 Tech files&#63;</h2>
                    I started using Visio 4.0 Tech, when Win95 came out, and used it occasionally through Windows XP. When I updated to a Windows 7, 64bit, I could no longer install the program. The Visio viewer program, says the files are too old. How can I update these
 .vsd files so the viewer will work?<br />

            <p>Question...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try this:</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(55, 58, 62, 1)"><span>Run the CDSETUP.EXE program from the CD with admin privileges (right-click, run as administrator) and having set the&nbsp;compatibility&nbsp;mode
 to Windows 98 first for the file. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(55, 58, 62, 1)"><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(55, 58, 62, 1)"><span>After installed, you'll want to set the compatibility on the executable that starts it to Windows 98 as well and also run it
 as administrator. &nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(55, 58, 62, 1)">If you don't do this, the program may freeze
 at the splash screen.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(55, 58, 62, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(55, 58, 62, 1)">Also
 make sure everyone (all users) have full write access to the C:\Program Files (x86)\Visio\ directory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 64-bit might be the end-problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got a Windows XP VM? heh</p>

    <title>Lower performance on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eugensattolo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lower performance on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have an ASUS laptop and like many other people I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 when it came out...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the update my laptop's performance dropped a lot...&nbsp;</p>
<p>It takes WAY too long for Windows to load itself when I type my password in, the Camera app that comes with Windows doesn't let me select any resolution higher than 480p and I have a 720p camera (this happens with other camera apps too!), Skype lags, some
 games I have lag a LOT and sometimes my laptop freezes for a few seconds...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't want to go back to Windows 8...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
