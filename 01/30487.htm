<h2>            In the registry, AppInit_DLLs lists the same DLL twice. Is it helpful to delete one of them&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Silly NVIDIA adding their nvinitx.dll entry to AppInit_DLLs again, after a driver reinstall... They should have checked if it was already there first. Instead of blindly appending it to the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Path:</p>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\
<p>
</p><p>Key:</p>
<p>AppInit_DLLs</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previous value:</p>
<p>C:\Windows\system32\nvinitx.dll,C:\Windows\system32\nvinitx.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logical value:</p>
<p>C:\Windows\system32\nvinitx.dll<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made the change and nothing exploded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if the double entry had a negative impact on my system's performance in these past years. Or if the same dll can even be loaded twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe Windows was smart enough to unique-sort / deduplicate the list of dlls before loading them into every process?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>In answer your actual question no it will have no impact having the entry listed twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is allowed because the DLL file could actually be stored in different locations, if not in the 1st then it goes on to the second, the error in your case is that the two locations are the same. Once Apinit has loaded the 1st DLL it finds it checks the
 rest of the line for different libraries then exits.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Well, you could try <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/change-your-desktop-background" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
changing the desktop background</a> and check if that makes a difference (I doubt).
<br />
<br />
Task bar color can only be changed when you change the theme. I'm sorry, but Windows 7 Home Basic doesn't have themes. That requires a more advanced version, like Home Premium. However, you can change the desktop background, color scheme, sounds, and

    <title>No sound or internet access due to failed update. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No sound or internet access due to failed update.</h2>
                    Recently I downloaded an update for windows 10 on my pc. After the update I noticed that I can no longer connect to the internet and have no audio. After extensive hours of research I have found nothing that helps, most of what I saw required downloading
 something but I cant connect to the wifi. It will not let me reset either, I use this pc daily for my schoolwork and entertainment and I've never had an issue until this update. Also it says there was an issue downloading the update and I've tried troubleshooting
 and deleting the update entirely but either it doesnt help or it wont allow me. Someone please help.

            Hi Devin.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Using another PC to download and transfer the file via flash stick, or plugging in by ethernet cable to connect, Try updating the Network adapter driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage, using the full make/model number, HP Serial or Dell Service Tag from sticker on PC:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try Rolling back and then Uninstalling the Network adapter driver in Device Manager.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose the Network adapter you're using, on Driver tab choose Roll back, restart PC.  If that doesn't help try Uninstall, then restart to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks for the reply but it seems I didn't explain well enough. My computer is hardwired with an Ethernet cord and I don't even see the network icon in the bottom right. The internet and sound issues are being caused by the failed update. And I've tried
 to uninstall the updates but it doesn't let me nor can I reset the pc. My firewall is also not working and I cannot turn it on and when troubleshooting the Windows update it says there is an issue but it never fixes it. The error code it gives me is&nbsp;0x80070422.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire Collection - Daily Challenge</h2>
                    
<p>I have been playing the solitaire daily challenge for a couple of months.</p>
<p>On the 16 October I couldn't finish TriPeaks. Yesterday i managed to complete the game, and didn't get the reward for completing all 5 games for the day.</p>
<p>When I went back to the calendar it showed 5/ 6 games completed for that day. There are only 5 games per day so how is it the day shows there are 6 to complete?</p>
<p>My total for the month so far should be 125/155 and mine is correct at 124/155 (5 x 25 = 125-1 =124) as I have yet to complete Free Cell today.</p>
<p>Anybody else had this problem?</p>

    <title>Very slow boot up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boblewisuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Very slow boot up</h2>
                    <p>I hope somebody can help me with this problem... I have an Asus S56C laptop, with Pentium i5 1.7G processor. Recently, where before it used to be very quick, the laptop now takes over 6 minutes to boot up. It also takes around 3 minutes to turn off and will
 not sleep or hibernate (It just freezes)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>reset to factory settings</li><li>numerous virus scans which show no problem</li><li>malware scans which show no problem</li><li>registry cleaners, such as CCleaner, which show problems, claim to fix them, but makes no difference</li><li>clean boot - still takes just as long</li></ul>
<p>To be fair, the laptop runs fine once it is up and running but it is very frustrating having to wait almost 7 minutes every time I need to use it for something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have a suggestion as to what the problem might be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks to anyone who can help.....</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Did you boot with a Windows disc just to see if that seemed to work better?<br />
<br />
Could be the BIOS and/or BIOS settings, memory, motherboard or virtually any hardware.<br />
<br />
Definitely check with the System/Motherboard Maker's Support, especially about the BIOS</p>
<p>and chipset.<br />
<br />
Reduce the hardware to as simple as possible to see if that makes difference.<br />
<br />
Very difficult to troubleshoot hardware issues at home since there are limited known good<br />
parts to swap in and out.<br />

            Do you actually get to see/preview the video?
<div><br />
<div>Depending on how large the video is, Windows Movie Maker could be rendering the video in the background so you can edit more effectively. This can cause Windows Movie Maker to slow down or be unresponsive; overall affecting the workstations performance.
<div><br />
<div>Once you get the MP4 video in to Windows Movie Maker.</div>
<div>
<div><span>In Windows Live Movie Maker select the movie clip you want to edit by double-clicking on it. Then use the edit TOOLS at the top [ribbon].</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>I illustrate this here:</div>

<div>I hope this helps...&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi Kenneth, Thank you for your Reply, I will the the last Step and if possible to install the latest BETA version 4474 from
<a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/26099/Intel-Beta-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-10-and-Windows-7-8-1-15-40-?product=88355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Intel</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW the flicker is on seen on that Upper Left portion of the Screen and is only occurring when there is Static Image on the whole screen (there is no moving images on the whole screen) if there is any movement anywhere on the screen flickering is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is also noticed on UEFI when there is no movement on the Screen&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Update on the issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled every driver found on intel website and currently using the latest beta driver and still issue occurs</p>
<p>
</p><p>also noticed that it is more prominent when the device is just powered on from being powered off for a period of time i.e. when at night it is powered off the powering on in the morning</p>
<p>
</p><p>also the accent color that is set in the settings is the color of the flicker retained when powering on (during bootup POST)</p>
<p>
</p><p>and as i used the device (when it heats up around an hour or so) flickering with the current accent color is less noticeable and eventually gone after continuous usage. even after restart it is gone, as long as the device is used long enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is this a hardware problem or if it can be fixed by any software/driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>additinal info:</p>
<p>this is not present when i reimage the surface using usb and image from "https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage" and only appeared when I do Windows update and apply the latest updates and
 drivers (btw i have deffer-ed the anniversary update)</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's work on this together. We suggest you uninstall the update which triggered the issue, in this case, the Anniversary update. Once uninstalled, manually install the latest updates again. This will ensure that the current drivers and fixes are running. See
 the steps below to uninstall the update: &nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. Open Control Panel. <br />
2. Tap or select Programs and Features. <br />
3. Under Programs and Features, tap View installed updates on the left corner of the screen.
<br />
4. Select the update which is causing the issue, and then click Uninstall. <br />
5. Restart Surface after uninstalling the update. <br />
<br />
Once the Surface device has restarted, manually install the latest updates by following the steps under Update Surface and Windows and Download and install Surface updates manually sections on this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/performance-and-maintenance/install-software-updates-for-surface?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.<br />
<br />
Keep us posted on your progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Hi Jasmine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not work as I already tried several combinations of drivers and to the point of completely wiping out and starting from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is already a strong responsibility that this is a hardware problem</p>

<h3> hardywang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Authenticator app&#39;s code resulted &#34;Too many invalid codes have been entered. Please try again later.&#34; message</h2>
                    <p>I have my Authenticator app installed on my Windows Phone 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently when I try to log on to my Microsoft account from a new PC (it does not matter the OS or browser) I am prompted to enter the code from Authenticator. But once I entered the right value I got&nbsp;"Too many invalid codes have been entered. Please try
 again later." message right away. It worked well previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to use a different method to get a code, I registered my cell phone already, but it took extremely long time to get a text message from Microsoft. Then I used my backup email and eventually got a code to log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know why my Authenticator app's code doesn't work completely.</p>

<p>Yeah, I hate the **** Level 1 responses we get here. &nbsp;@Hardy, please check the TIME on your authenticator device. &nbsp;I find that if I am off even by 1/2 a minute either on the PC or phone, the application does not generate an acceptable code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that you sometimes get one 2 or even 1 try to get it right is downright frustrating. &nbsp;Ah well, maybe if we had and Altair and a garage we could fix this.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I compared my device and PC, they have exactly same time. My PC uses time server and my device should be controlled by my mobile service provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is so sensitive to time, what about I go to another country one day and use, for example, a PC from Internet Cafe. Then it will be a total disaster?</p>

<p>I have exactly the same problem. It asks me for a code from my authentication app and when I enter it it says "Too many invalid codes have been entered. Please try again later". I thought it might reset itself after a period of time because it said "Please
 try again later" but I've waited 3 weeks without touching it and I tried today and got the same message.</p>
<p>Basith M please look into this further.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            When you say "turning off existing apps", do you mean to disable 2 step authentication first, then re-enable it?

            <p>From your first post the driver that appears to be the issue is the&nbsp;AsDsm.sys:</p>
<p><em>Caused By Driver : <strong>AsDsm.sys<br />
</strong>Caused By Address : <strong>AsDsm.sys</strong>+41c0</em></p>
<p>The AsDsm.sys appears to be a component of Asus Data Security Manager software.</p>
<p>Same driver was causing similar error in the following thread:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/blue-screen-badpoolheader-asdsmsys-issue-bccode-41/0e9d488b-1b44-e011-90b6-1cc1de79d2e2">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/blue-screen-badpoolheader-asdsmsys-issue-bccode-41/0e9d488b-1b44-e011-90b6-1cc1de79d2e2</a></p>
<p>So also try uninstalling Asus Data Security Manager&nbsp;and then, if you wish, reinstall Asus Data Security Manager using the latest version.</p>

            <p>Did you mistakenly say that your HP personal computer is running Windows 10 and meant that it is running Windows 7?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you prepared for the upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; How are your backups? &nbsp;Made sure your consistent data (just the stuff important to you) backups are working correctly and can be restored from? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What about your installation media and product key / serial number backups - all that sorted and easily accessible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Have you verified, by visiting with your system manufacturer and the manufacturer(s) of the software you use the most on your computer, that everything you have/use/want to continue using is supported by said manufacturers with Windows 10 and
 discovered what, if anything, you might need to do to continue a smooth usage of such things after the upgrade? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some upgraded device drivers you need to download? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some software patch? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalling the software before upgrading to Windows 10 and installing it after the upgrade completes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Have you readied a method of performing a FULL SYSTEM IMAGE backup right before you initiate the upgrade? After all the upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 7/8.1 could be likened to moving a rug while you remain standing on it - so it is fairly
 complex and has its risks. &nbsp;A full system image backup to external (and disconnected during the upgrade) media is a VERY good fallback plan in case something goes wrong or - you just don't like it.<br />

<p>You might even want to cleanup that current system some, make sure *it* is as healthy as it could be before trying to upgrade. &nbsp;A well-functioning and updated system is more likely to result in a smoother experience for an upgrade as extensive as
 this... &nbsp;You might look thru this previous conversation where I suggested someone cleanup their system before upgrading:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Use the&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Media Creation Tool web page</a>&nbsp;to kick off your upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The big take-aways there are: device drivers, software updates and BACKUP BACKUP BACKUP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could even make a full system image backup of your current system and CLEAN install Windows 10 using your Windows 7/8.1 product key (from - likely - your Product Key sticker on your machine) and start completely clean with Windows 10 - installing
 just what you want/need and restoring your personal files/etc. from your last personal file/folder backups (not the System Image.)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Then, if things are not working out (device drivers, software, etc.) you could use the system image backup to restore to 'pre-did-anything' state and continue on.&nbsp; ;-)</p>

<h2>            Edge - a frustrating mess</h2>
                    <p>I am a hardcore, longtime Microsoft user.&nbsp; I've used Windows since its DOS days, have migrated to every new version, I use a Surface Pro, have a Windows phone, I even still have and use a Zune!!&nbsp; BUT, with Windows 10, I find nothing to like about it and
 most times it's frustrating as hell!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge is mess!&nbsp; You have taken web browsing, which for years has been as simple and instinctive as knowing how to type (on any browser) and made it a nightmare!&nbsp; The simplicity of a right click to add to bookmark a page?&nbsp; GONE&nbsp; Want to jump back 5 pages without
 paging through each and every one?&nbsp; GONE&nbsp; Trying to find your browsing history?&nbsp; Who the hell knows?!&nbsp; Maybe it's there if you don't use Bing.&nbsp; Jump through 5 or 6 hoops and maybe you'll get it back but probably not the history you wanted.&nbsp; Trying to import
 your favorites from something other than Bing or Chrome?&nbsp; Sorry - that does not compute!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge has taken the most simple aspect of the internet and made it a confusing, confounding, frustrating exercise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are supposedly 'upgrading' something, the idea is to make it easier not harder.&nbsp; Why reinvent the wheel when the wheel is working great?&nbsp; People shouldn't have to learn all over how to use a web browser!&nbsp; Look at the this forum!&nbsp; The number of questions
 (and people) asking about the most basic tasks in using their browser is ABSURD!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>THAT MEANS YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I have absolutely no use for Edge and will be staying to FireFox.</p>

    <title>Two blue arrows on some shortcuts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roberto &#40;aka tim&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two blue arrows on some shortcuts</h2>
                    <p>After a few months of head scratching I've tracked down why the blue arrows have appeared on some shortcuts and not others but have been unable to stop them from showing at the moment.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When an installer uses Advertised Shortcuts a folder is created in C:\Windows\Installer\{GUID}.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this folder are InstallShield exes for each shortcut for example one for desktop, another of start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Installer folder is compressed and thus the {GUID} folder is compressed and thus the exes are compressed.&nbsp; The Advertised Shortcuts point to the icon of the exe which has the blue-arrows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried turning off compression on the {GUID} folder and contents but the files still seems to have the blue-arrows even tho compression has been turned off on the those file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to edit the registry to change the shortcut icon path to the program file exe and see if that works.</p>

<h2>            We can&#39;t show your friends right now. Something went wrong. Invalid Pointer.</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;have been to both the xbox support chat and the microsoft support chat and neither has been able to fix the issue I am having. Today My friends list was able to be seen. After a match had ended I was going to invite someone. I&nbsp;noticed the message in the title where friends show up. I&nbsp;can only see what is on the recent players tab and the followers tab. Nothing from the All, clubs or friends tabs. I&nbsp;have tried clearing cache with WSreset.exe , Uninstalled and reinstalled with "get-appxpackage *Microsoft.XboxApp* | remove-appxpackage". Still with no luck on the it showing up. Any other ideas would be helpful at this point. I noticed after searching that this problem has been going on since late 2014.&nbsp;</p>

I&nbsp;have also gone into the apps&amp;features for Xbox app and in the advanced properties and reset the app "If it isn't working right" Yesterday I gave my account info to my brother to sign in on his computer and it did NOT work on his either. He then signed in on his account and his friends list was fine. &nbsp;I&nbsp;made an alternate Xbox silver account and the friends list works just fine. It is something with my account on Xbox end that is the issue. Even after an update today from the xbox app didnt change anything.</p>

<h2>            How to prevent Windows 8.1 from installing updates&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, my Windows 8.1 won't stop downloading newer Windows updates. I checked the button 'Search for updates but let me choose if they are to be downloaded and installed' (or similar)&nbsp;in Windows Update but when I log on to my computer it says that my computer
 will automatically be shut down (in a day or so if I postpone it) to download the ''important'' updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I prevent this? Or does the computer not actually download the updates without me changing the settings in Windows Update? If so that message is highly missleading.</p>

<h2>            Accidentally installed the 32-bit version of Windows 7. How do I upgrade to the 64-bit version&#63;</h2>
                    <i>I installed the 32 bit version of Windows 7 Home Premium instead of the 64 bit version. Now I want to correct it but it won't let me.</i>

</div>
<div>I accidentally installed the 32 bit version of Windows 7 Home Premium on my Dell Dimension 9200.

<p>Hi Ayub,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe what Chris was referring to was the registration of the console's serial number on your account from your devices section of your Microsoft account since we've seen instances where this does help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go here <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>Also, I've personally never connected the Xbox One to&nbsp;a Windows 10 PC through the app, but I have connected the Xbox to the mobile app and there is a way to disconnect from the Connect panel once the Xbox connects to the PC. If it did indeed connect but
 streaming doesn't work, disconnect the console from the PC and try again after restarting both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your PC and Xbox One on the same subnetwork and wifi band? (2.4GHz or 5GHz)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the Xbox app ask for the Xbox One's IP address or does it simply just give you that error message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know so we can further assist you!</p>
