<p>Hi Edgar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the forums today. I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you explain a little more what the problem is with redeeming the code? is there an error message or code? Is the code already redeemed? Have you tried on the

console,&nbsp;Xbox App, Windows 10</a>&nbsp;or online at <a href="https://microsoft.com/redeem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    &nbsp; I noticed when XP was no longer supported I could not reinstall because the computer required the activation key and when you tried to let it do that it did not work and a reinstall was Impossible. My concern is I have a expensive Alienware i was told

 re-installs computers that are unable to update. I understand Microsoft wants to sell more platforms, etc, and wants computers to update with support to avoid malware so they probably don't want to give

            &nbsp;Just wanted to add a Possible solution and ask for it....Would Microsoft please consider working with Dell (Dell recommends Microsoft as they advertise)....to fix this issue for those Laptops which normally would upgrade to 10 as they run 7 but can't?
 could they please try to offer support so I will be confident to spend more thousands on a computer later that it will last more than a few years? It may be cheaper to just buy a old Mac in the long run if not and I&nbsp; don't see a way around that which saddens
 me. Please?

<p>Not correct.&nbsp; You can reinstall XP and reactivate it (if necessary).&nbsp; You may have to activate by phone.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>My concern is I have a expensive Alienware i was told would always be able to update to newer windows platforms...this turned out to be false as Windows 10 does not work on it and Dell themselves say it's not compatible. I was

<p>Because you haven't provided any details about why "it would not work," it's impossible to determine if your conclusion is correct.&nbsp; Depending on when you bought the computer, it may or may not support Windows 10 -- as long as there are Windows 10 drivers
 available for the various hardware bits.&nbsp; You can determine that by going to the Dell support page for your particular model and checking out what drivers are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have an Alienware desktop/tower rather than a laptop, you may well be able to replace some hardware items that would make the system work better with Windows 10.&nbsp; If you bought the computer with Windows 7 already installed, if you were to change the
 motherboard, you would have to purchase Windows 10 because you would no longer qualify for the free upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>So my question is Microsoft going to do the same thing with the key???</blockquote>
<p>It's not clear what you mean by this, but to answer the question about Windows 7 in the subject of your post, every Microsoft product to date has a "life cycle."&nbsp; For Windows 7 with Service Pack 1, the end of extended support (which is what happened to XP
 on April 8, 2014) is currently set for January 14, 2020.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not clear what Microsoft will do with Windows 10.&nbsp; The version of Windows 10 that was released in July 2015 will reach end of extended support on October 14, 2025. &nbsp; Undoubtedly, however, there will be a major update at some point (which may or may
 not be called a "service pack") that will reset the 10-year clock.</p>

            <p>Windows 7 support (meaning Security updates only) is committed to January, 2020</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is very aggressively pushing Windows 7 users to "upgrade" to Windows 10.&nbsp; The push is so aggressive that you must undertake specific measures to prevent it happening to your computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>I assume from your question that you do NOT want Windows 10???</strong></em>&nbsp; If that assumption is correct, here is the process to prevent Windows 10 from taking over.&nbsp; I should add that it is likely it already has to some degree.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<em><strong>Prevent Windows 10</strong></em>
</p><div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&nbsp;do <em><strong>not</strong> </em>want Windows 10 and wish to prevent it from being installed on your computer, follow this exactly as laid out.&nbsp; I have done this on 150 client computers and it works flawlessly, and has continued to that since Spring,
 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have followed the procedure below, and set Windows update to <em><strong>NEVER</strong></em>, once a month, start Windows Update manually, check for updates.&nbsp; When you get the list of “important” updates, right-click and choose hide to EVERY update
 in the Windows grouping that does not describe itself as Security.&nbsp; Allow the Malicious software removal tool or any C++ updates.&nbsp; Do not use ANY optional updates or place a checkmark in any unchecked updates.&nbsp; Proceed to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>
</p><p>March 3, 2016</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Be advised that Microsoft has committed to support Windows 7 until at least January, 2020.&nbsp; Most of your current computers will last that long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10&nbsp;installation promises to allow return to Windows 7 within 30 days.&nbsp; That return process is flawed and sometimes requires re-installation of Windows 7.&nbsp; For some owners without a re-usable Microsoft product key or a factory restore partition
 on their computers, it results in a useless thing that used to be a computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of people have tried Windows 10 and decided they want their Windows 7 back.&nbsp; If you are one of those, once you have Windows 7 back, you will need to take steps to keep it that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of people have Windows 7 and are quite happy with it and do not want to change their systems to Windows 10, and simply do not want the hassle of being constantly asked to make this change.</p>
<p><em><strong>You must adopt a protective stance to prevent your Windows 7 system from becoming something you do not want.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;advise my clients to&nbsp;change the Windows Update Setting to <em><strong>Never check for updates</strong></em>.&nbsp; Once a month,&nbsp;on&nbsp;the 2nd Tuesday, they will get an email from me advising to manually start WU and then hide every update except for ones specifically
 labeled Security.&nbsp; In other words, only security updates will be applied.&nbsp; In all of 2015, not a single update that was not security, was something that improved Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may feel uncomfortable with the setting — NEVER.&nbsp; Well you needn’t be.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It does NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take control
 and the responsibility of updating of Windows and Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read Woody Leonhard (one of the most respected writers in the trade)&nbsp; <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2983777/microsoft-windows/how-to-clean-the-windows-10-crapware-off-your-windows-7-or-81-pc.html?nsdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 have Windows 7, keep it, you are better off by far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see the Windows flag on the bottom right of your screen, chances are pretty high, your computer already has the Win10 files.&nbsp;Even if you do not, it may be on your computer&nbsp;shortly anyway. &nbsp;Here are instructions on how to rid yourself of it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First download and run GWX Control panel.&nbsp; A free app:&nbsp; <a href="http://ultimateoutsider.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>It will allow you to prevent any future operating system upgrades and&nbsp;delete downloaded Win10 files, but it will
<em><strong>not</strong> </em>remove any of Microsoft’s installed or attempts to install spyware.&nbsp;
<em><strong>The following process will remove those features which you do not need.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>This process works, but it only works if you do all the steps and do them in order.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>

            &nbsp;Thanks for the reply-I have a Laptop that like I said had been told by a Microsoft tec would take 10 -even some Dell tecs and a few posts said my model would or might....then later posts said it would not....I have already checked this and this was not
 my question....my concern was with Xp when it crashed trying to reinstall from disc and entering the key proved not to work as I got the message it was no longer supported so I could not activate....If as you say you can reinstall XP and reactivate if this
 is true for seven what is the correct phone number or how would I ask for it? will I have to pay each time to reactivate? how much if so? do I need to be a paying microsoft network member? and any other pertinent information to this process you can think of
 would help. When i said "Key" I mean the activation code or key that comes with every edition of Microsoft windows needed to activate it within a certain time period....So if I want to keep 7 after jan 14 2020 and I crash it and like t

            <p>&nbsp;Your reply was very helpful-I had tried 10 and it failed badly within days....which was sad as I kinda liked the look and feel when it worked initially even though updates with no choice was something I was and still am surprised came with 10 as it seems
 like a poor Idea...even so I tried it and happily uninstalled with a advanced option of just deleting all my partitions completely rather than doing it following the general instructions for uninstall which would have left bits of 10.....I already install
 updates as you indicate and your correct. I will double check your list after this post of unwanted updates....I wonder if you can answer my question posed to my other responder above (how to reactivate a fresh clean install of windows seven after support
 has stopped) will i need a phone number? will I have to pay a fee each time? will i have to belong to the Microsoft network as a paying member? etc&gt;&gt;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again thanks for your post it was very helpful and nice to know I am on the right track already with sticking
 with seven and updating.......THANKS!</p>

            &nbsp;My Laptop Model is a M!7rx3 64 bit and yes Dell says on it's own site it's not going to work with 10.&nbsp; This was not my question but was a comment-and yes it really does feel like being burned. I think I will be looking into a older Apple with a older
 processor as the newer processor I have heard is much more hackable and open to getting malware&nbsp; (I have to research this more to be sure)....I want a stable platform that lets me use it more than doing maintenance work and fixing much of which was needed
 from updates causing problems and the Platforms slow movement from windows 95 DOS type where you as a user had control and could fix issues to 10 with almost no control and ability to fix easy and pinpoint problems.....If I do not use a tablet, cell phone,
 etc and do not want the clutter of those updates and the problems they may cause What's the point of sticking with it?

<em><strong>Re-install Windows 7</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you had or have Windows 10 installed.</strong> Read Woody Leonhard’s advice first.
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are unable to make the reversion back to Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should do a complete re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, a System Repair disk is not going to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you have a corrupted Windows 7 system</strong>, you are trying to recover, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that
 has windows 7 with the same bitness (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp; You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best alternative strategies to rebuild are the following in preference order:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it.&nbsp; You access this before Windows starts using a special key that can varies by brand.&nbsp; F11 is the most common. This is an option only if the installed
 hard drive is the original.&nbsp; This is not a valid strategy on a failing hard drive.</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp;(<em>This is not an option when recovering from a Windows 10 installation</em>). You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose
 that.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is not a valid strategy on a failing hard drive.</li><li>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; If you are not using a brand new disk, when it shows the screen to select where you want to put Windows, click on the Advanced link and delete all partitions.&nbsp; Do not install
 any software until after ALL Windows Updates are installed and Device Manager shows all devices installed.</li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once install is completed, within 3 days, you will be asked to enter the key.&nbsp; If the key you have is not accepted, it will offer the opportunity to call a phone number and attempt a one-time activation. That may help you.&nbsp; There is no joining anything or
 fee to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, Microsoft is committed to support forWin7 until January, 2020</p>

<p>I guess I'm confused...if this patch is for 7, 2008 or KB968389 (I couldn't find that I have it installed) why would Windows update be telling me to install this on each of my<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">XP</span>
</strong>systems?</p>
<p>Could it be that it is important for all Windows versions or is Windows Update thinking that I have one of the above OS's when I don't?</p>
<p>PS I checked in Add/Remove and found a lot of KB patches, but no KB968389</p>

<p>Yep, it's confusing alright. But it applies to Win XP also.</p>
<p>From what I understand - It provides some additional protection for secure information over the web such as logins etc.</p>
<p>so it looks like you need this : <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=cb9a7ba1-72c7-4c72-a802-ac5bb3442ce4&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>then the update should install (in theory).</p>

            <p><span>Hi David,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the frustration when things does not work as expected.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Is the issue specific to Windows 7 Service Pack1?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you receive Windows Update error 0x8007065e or 8007065e, it means that a file needed by Windows Update is damaged or missing. Try one of these methods to resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would have you place the computer in a clean boot and attempt to install Service Pack1</span></p>

<p>Hi Abé,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may have been caused by Windows Update program file corruption and misconfigured system files. The time needed to download the update depends on the connection speed, network settings, and the size of the update. Meanwhile, to troubleshoot your
 issue with updating your computer, we recommend running the <strong><a href="https://aka.ms/diag_wu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Troubleshooter</a></strong>. The troubleshooter will perform a diagnostic process on your system that will
 check and resolve issues related to updating your computer. If the troubleshooter finds any issues, it will be listed in the result with additional instructions you may need to follow. However, in most cases, the troubleshooter will find and apply fixes automatically.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance or have other concerns, feel free to share your thoughts with us. &nbsp;<br />

<h2>            I have some hps &#91;model is Compaq Presario cq50 &#40;139wm&#41;&#93; that i recently upgraded to windows 8, and I lost Sound.</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my presarios to windows 8, and there's no sound on them.&nbsp; I followed all the typical steps to make sure it's not muted, and to make sure the device drivers are "up to date" as far as windows can tell, but to no avail.&nbsp; I proceeded to
 the hp website, but the website won't verify my computers.&nbsp; It scans to see what product I have, and it says it finds "other" hp products (which it lists as the Presario cq50), but then when I click on those products to check for downloads and drivers, it
 loops back to saying that it cannot verify my product.&nbsp; I tried contacting hp, but they want to charge me for support on the issue.&nbsp; I'm guessing their website won't identify my computer because it's been upgraded to windows 8.&nbsp; Anyone know what driver I should
 be looking for to correct the issue, or if there is another fix?<br />

    <title>Computer keeps randomly muting itself - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> metaraven  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer keeps randomly muting itself</h2>
                    <p>I regularly use my computer for watching YouTube videos on Firefox, yet for some reason, my computer has started to mute itself for no apparent reason. Every time I try to unmute it, it just mutes itself again instantly. I am currently using an ASUS Transformer
 Book T100 with Windows 10 and I have tried updating and reinstalling the sound drivers several times without any luck. What could possibly be going wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: The speakers seem to have stopped randomly muting themselves, but there's still no sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit #2: I have checked and the problem seems to be with the entire computer's sound. Trying another browser doesn't seem to have any effect and it doesn't affect only YouTube. Also, I am not receiving any error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit #3: The troubleshooter says that there are no problems with the drivers and when looking on the manufacturer's website (ASUS), I cannot find the latest sound, video and game controller driver for my model (it should be here if I'm not mistaken: http://www.asus.com/uk/2-in-1-PCs/ASUS_Transformer_Book_T100TAF/HelpDesk_Download/).</p>

            I have checked and the problem seems to be with the entire computer's sound. Trying another browser doesn't seem to have any effect and it doesn't affect only YouTube. Also, I am not receiving any error messages. The troubleshooter says that there are
 no problems with the drivers and when looking on the manufacturer's website (ASUS), I cannot find the latest sound, video and game controller driver for my model (it should be here if I'm not mistaken: http://www.asus.com/uk/2-in-1-PCs/ASUS_Transformer_Book_T100TAF/HelpDesk_Download/).

            <p>This has been occurring to me too, but I have a headset. I find when I use Troubleshoot it does nothing or turn the volume up it&nbsp;simply just decreases itself constantly. It'd be greatly appreciated for a reply and I know this was over a year ago, also all

            I'm also having this issue, restarting, troubleshooting, and trying different properties do nothing. If I turn up my volume, it will work for 1/2 a second then it will be back to being muted.

<h2>            How do i delete a picture from lock desktop preview in windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to demonstrate how Lock desktop preview worked, I took a pic and made that the Lock desktop picture. Now I want to delete it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have deleted the photo from the Pictures folder, but cannot take it out of the Lock Desktop series of pictures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to&nbsp;just set another pic as the Lock desktop picture - I want to delete the unwanted picture altogether so it cannot be selected ever again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUT HOW??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Rico, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to choose another picture to delete the current lock screen and see if it helps.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may refer to this section '<strong>To change your lock screen picture</strong>'.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>See pictures on the desktop, Start, and the lock screen</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. </p>

<p>You will have to do it in two steps.</p>
<p>- Capture</p>
<p>Use a freeware program for capturing the incoming audio into, say, mp3 format or wav.</p>
<p><a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<p>- Burn</p>
<p>Burn the captured audio to a CD as audio CD.</p>
<p>And that is all about it.</p>

<p>Hi Shailesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can disable it via default programs on windows 10. Search default app settings in the search bar. then select Choose default apps by protocol.&nbsp;scroll down to TEL and change the settings there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't work, please check if the issue only occurs on&nbsp;Cisco Jabber. If so, please check if the settings in&nbsp;Cisco Jabber.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please feel free to let me know if there is any question.</p>

<p>Hey there, so did you give the app permission or not as you won't be able to access it until you give it permission. It should give you the option when logging into the site: forzamotorsport.net &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also if you log-in at the following link you should be able to change the app permissions there too:

<h2>            Installing MS Works 8.5 on a Windows 10&#47;64bit system with no IE</h2>
                    Hi there, I've recently replaced my Windows 7 desktop with a Windows 10 laptop. I'd like to install MS Works 8.5 (I have the install CD) in order to continue to use a checkbook ledger. However the program won't install because the system lacks IE, and
 apparently you can't install IE on a 64bit machine. What to do if I want to install MS Works? Thanks in advance!

            Hi Tim
<br />
<br />Internet Explorer can be used on the 64bit version of Windows 10, I have it on both my laptops which run versions 1803 and 1809 of Windows 10. . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, then just type ie
<br />
<br />Does Internet Explorer show up in the resultign list?
<br />
<br />If not:
<br />
<br />Make sure your PC is on the Internet
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Apps - Manage Optional Features
<br />
<br />Click 'Add a Feature'
<br />
<br />Is Internet Explorer in the resulting list?

<p>Hi there, thanks so much for your reply. Using your instructions I have been able to find IE 11. However when I went to install MS Works 8.5 from the disk, after a long wait I got a message stating:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Internet Explorer and Internet Tools cannot be installed on this computer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">The product does not install on 64-bit platforms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems as thought the install disk is trying to install IE6. I've tried doing the MS Works install both as Complete and Basic but get the same results. Any further ideas would be most welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tim</p>

<h2>            Windows Essentials Error&#58; 0x80040705</h2>
                    I uninstalled Windows Essentials to download the new 2012 version, but now it won't let me. It consistently says:
<br />
<br />
"Couldn't install programs<br />

An unknown error occurred.&nbsp; <br />

I tried a few things but none have worked. I have a 64 bit. How can I fix this and download it properly?<br />

<h2>            How do i change  the temporary CD Burning folder location in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
When i burn a BR or DVD or CD, the temporary files are put in folder :<br />
<br />
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Burn\Burn<br />
<br />
To change this location i try to change the location in the record properties of the burn device and restart computer<br />
<br />
A folder named "Windows Burn Temp Files" is created on new disk location, but the temporary files always go to the old folder.<br />
<br />
I also tried to change registry key :<br />
<br />
\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders\CD Burning&nbsp;<br />
<br />
and restart but temporary files always goes to %LOCALAPPDATA% location &nbsp;?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how do i change&nbsp; the temporary CD Burning folder location in windows 10 ?</p>

<h2>            &#34;Import pictures and videos using Windows&#34;</h2>
                    <p>When I insert an SD memory card with photos &amp; select "Import using Windows" the wizard starts IMMEDATELY without leting me choose settings (like destination folder). How can I change settings when that window seems to be bypassed as soon as I insert the
 card?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>**************** edited question ***********************</p>
<p>I had already tried the suggested links on the Microsoft website. Nne helped with my problem. Here is my problem specifically:</p>
<p>1. I insert an sd card into my laptop's reader</p>
<p>2. a dialog box pops up asking what action I want to take</p>
<p>3. I choose "import pictures and videos using Windows"</p>
<p>4. another dialog box flashes up and is gone in about 1/4 second. Very fast. This is the one that lets you alter settings for importing the photos. I would like to change the destination folder, but this screen flashes by and is gone.</p>
<p>5. the next dialog screen comes up and the photos are immedialely being transferred to the first destination folder I ever set up in my initial use of this application.</p>

<p>I want to change the destination and file name settings, but can't since that screen flashes by so quickly. So, my question in this forum is "how do I change these settings, since I do not seem to be able to access that screen in the usual way (by inserting
 a memory card into the reader). </p>

<p>I appreciate any help. Thanks.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter Backward Compatibility with Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter Backward Compatibility with Windows</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Is the new Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter backward compatible with operating systems prior to Windows 8.1 (e.g. Windows 7, or earlier)? &nbsp; Your webpage on the product doesn't indicate that it is, although I had a Best Buy salesman tell me that he went
 to a training presentation on the product and was told it is going to be compatible with any Windows version that is still being supported by Microsoft (e.g. Windows Vista, but not Windows XP).</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p><br />

            <p><span>Hello Ronald,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per your description, I understand that you want to use Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter on Windows 7 or Windows Vista, but as per our support Website:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/wireless-display-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/wireless-display-adapter</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is only compatible with Windows 8 and above operating system. If the best buy guy assured you that it is compatible with Windows 7 as per their training resources
 then please have it checked during live demo of Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter as Microsoft will assist you with the compatible Operating System only.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It may or may not work with older version of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

            I'm confused...<br />
"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It is only compatible with Windows 8 and above operating system", but "</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It may or may not work with older version of Windows"?<br />
I too was given the understanding the this display adapter would be able to work in some capacity with a Win7 build, but it doesn't seems to have any possible way to function since it requires an app from the store to be downloaded, which requires Win8.1 for
 some mysterious reason.<br />
During my own research after the fact, I found that it may only work with CERTAIN specific 8.1 devices (ones that came pre-loaded win Win8.1 maybe?).<br />
This device being advertised as being able to wirelessly beam any computer to your TV is basically a lie at this point, because it will only do that if you are using one of a handful of devices. Yeah, sure, it's great if you have a Surface 2, or one of the
 stock Windows computers, but I have a custom built PC that is 2 years old, but better in every way from any stock computer Windows could offer me, yet I can't get this adapter to work?&nbsp;<br />
There is a very small chance I would upgrade to Win8.1 if I knew for an absolute fact that it would make this adapter work, but I don't. It's just a random toss of the dice basically. I call BS and false advertising unless there is some sort of third party
 program that will make this thing work.<br />
<br />
Also, on the help page, it answers the question of Win7 compatibility by literally linking me to a DIFFERENT ADAPTER from the one I already bought. How is that possible helpful? It says, "No problem", like having Win7 isn't an issue, when really it should say,
 "Sorry, out of luck #dealwithit".</span>

            <p>The device only works with hardware that supports Miracast, you can check here for a list of supported devices:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If it isn't on the list, then it likely won't be supported by any of the devices that use miracast technology</p>

            <p>Are there drivers for the windows 10 technical preview?&nbsp;&nbsp; I get it's a preview but if it's a simple fix then it would be great to be able to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many users have updated their SP3 to 10TP.&nbsp;&nbsp; The driver error is code 43 on the Miracast Display Adapter
 in device manager.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.</p>
