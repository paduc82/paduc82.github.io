                    <p>&lt;Original Title: Windows 10 Unable to Boot up&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>***TLDR: 'diagnosing your pc' shown before stuck in recovery blue screen, tried nearly all available troubleshooting options , can't do a system wipe and can't boot in safe mode. Might have something to do with corrupt pci.sys, need solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi there,&nbsp;<br />
I am currently having problems booting up my pc which runs on windows 10. When I power it on, a text displaying "diagnosing your pc" is shown before transitioning into a blur screen which says &nbsp;'Your PC did not start correctly. Press Restart to restart your
 PC, which can sometimes fix the problem. You can also press “Advanced options to try other options to repair your PC".<br />
<br />
I have tried trouble shooting and attempted system restore(could not due to no check points), reformatting which inexplicably failed midway through, repairing Windows 10 from disk as well as start-up repair which were all unsuccessful. I am also unable to boot
 in safe mode.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have poked around Google abit for answers and my best guess is my 'pci.sys' is corrupt and I'm not sure how to solve this.<br />
<br />
Also, prior to this I turned on Bluetooth and restarted my computer. I had also recently installed Windows updates.<br />
<br />
Any and all help is immensely appreciated , thank you everyone for taking the time to read this&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Greetings FEO!<br />Could you start by making sure your profile has been completely removed from the Xbox storage device. Now, follow the instruction steps up front and in given order and let us know how that goes and we'll work from there.<br /><br /></p>
<p>*If you have the two-step verification turned on/enabled for your Microsoft account, then you need to&nbsp;<strong>Create a new app password&nbsp;</strong>under&nbsp;<strong>App passwords</strong>. You will then use this new generated app password to sign in or download your profile instead of your Microsoft account password.&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/app-passwords-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here's how!</a>&nbsp;<br /><br />*This is used for when you have the two-step verification turned on/enabled.<br /><br /><br /></p>

    <title>From the Start menu and selecting &#34;Turn Off Computer&#34;, three - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> starchoice  say:</h3>
<h2>            From the Start menu and selecting &#34;Turn Off Computer&#34;, three options are presented&#58; Stand By, Turn Off or Restart. My Stand By button is now grayed out, meaning non-selectable. This button was accessible in the past.</h2>
                    I have done a Google search and while many people seem to have the problem of a grayed out Stand By button, there does not appear to be any ready solution so what caused this and what's the fix? The common answer seems to be to update the video driver.
 Not being a geek, I don't see how a video driver has anything to do with the functioning of a stand by button. I did update my video driver but all this did was reduce my font and icon sizes. I tried a System Restore as well. I tied Power Options. I have also
 checked Device Manager for errors or conflicts. This is not an isolated problem so there should be some fix unless it's a Microsoft issue which needs to be addressed in an update. Can anyone help?

            Thanks for that reply. It sounds like a lot of detective work. Here is an added piece to the puzzle which is really odd. When I reboot my computer, I am taken to the usual blue screen where one can then select which family member's file to log on. The
 bottom left of this screen has the "turn off computer" option and when this is selected, it brings up the three buttons:&nbsp; stand by, turn off or restart. If I select, "turn off computer", all three buttons appear lit up; yes, even the stand by button glows
 like a Christmas tree. If I click cancel and do it again, the stand by button is once again grayed out.&nbsp;

            Yes, computers are complicated and powerful machines and troubleshooting them can be a "lot of detective work". But you have to do it if you want to fix things. If this is important to you and you don't want to do the necessary testing, then take the machine
 to a local computer tech. This will not be a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place.

    <title>Graphics Card issue. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rp660  say:</h3>
<h2>            Graphics Card issue.</h2>
                    Purchased 128GB Surface Pro from Best Buy on Saturday, 27th of April. &nbsp;I installed steam, a couple of apps from the store, and did an "important" update from Microsoft. &nbsp;Everything was good until today when I turned it on and started to get a lot of pixelation
 and screen tearing. &nbsp;When I uninstall the driver it goes away, so I think maybe I need a new driver. &nbsp;I download a driver from Intel's site and install, still the same.<i>&nbsp;
</i>Okay, so maybe it was the update. &nbsp;I restore to a point right before the update, no luck. &nbsp;Okay, so I will restore completely to factory settings that should fix it, nope, no bueno. &nbsp;Now I am stuck, is this a driver issue or is the graphics card on my week
 old Surface going bad?

<div><br />
<div>Sorry to hear that you are having issues with the video display.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As&nbsp;BS661 mentioned, if after doing a reset and not installing any updates you still have this issue, I would recommend going back to Best buy and see about getting a replacement. If they are not able to replace it, contact
<a href="http://surface.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support</a>.</div>

<div>Let us know if that helps.</div>

<p>Seems to be a common issue. Xbox One requires quite a large install when first turned on for first time, much of it is downloaded. Sadly there is an issue with XBL and PSN (Playstation) which where both cyber attacked today. I have my system up and running
 for a year now, but even I can not get anything to install or download.</p>
<p>If the issues are hardware then you should take it back to shop, or contact Xbox via the support section to resolve the issue. Good luck, I know that my kids are eager to play the games they got, but they can at least play games, and it is heart breaking
 to watch them looking at the boxes with dreams in their eyes. But to have a console that is not working or an issue with online that is preventing the download would be much worse.</p>
<p>If not done so already, try contacting Xbox Support they can give you a more direct answer to what the issue maybe.</p>

<p>My brother got one this morning for christmas (I have had one for awhile now and it works just fine, never had an issue) and his will not even do the initial update after confirming wifi. If there is a serious XBL network issue, it does not affect xbox ones
 that have been working before today. This is very disappointing. </p>

<p>I am having the same problem with the brand new xbox one that I bought for my 2 boys for Christmas. It says there was a problem with the update. When I tried to troubleshoot the problem through Microsoft's website, it just said "Uh oh, you found a glitch
 in the system". That was it! No attempt to help or suggestions for solving the problem! Microsoft's customer service is by far the worst I have ever come across!

<p>Having the same problem. This is very frustrating. I really hope Microsoft has some type of compensation plans for this extreme inconvenience. This really put a damper on the kids Christmas. Very bad service on such an important day!!

<h2>            My status keep dissappearing</h2>
                    <p>I use W10 Skype to work, but for some reason if I got away for some time, my status disappears and I need to go and select ONLINE in order to receive my messages, because when I'm on that status, I don't get any notification or message from anyone, until
 I update the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me it looks like an AWAY status, but it doesn't seems to work at all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know a way to fix this or a workaround?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            &#34;keyboard Properties&#34; doesn&#39;t respond to repeat delay and rate changes.</h2>
                    In typing in any window I find that every time there is a repeated letter, there is an annoying delay before the key stroke will happen.&nbsp; Even the backstroke and the space key does the same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to Control&nbsp;Panel then to Keyboard then to Keyboard
 Properties.&nbsp; I had the option to change the repeat delay and rate timings.I tried applying several changes. Nothing worked.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
WPN111vx.sys is a Netgear Wireless Driver.&nbsp;Go to Netgear and get the latest driver
<strong>manually</strong> and use this<br />
method to install it. Do not just use Update drivers in Device Manager and do not use any scan for drivers<br />
at Netgear - enter information manually so you do get the latest driver.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If that does not stop the bluescreens do this. Control Panel - Device Manager - Network - Right Click on the<br />
WiFi driver and DISABLE OR Power Off and remove the WiFi device if external/removable. Use a Wire to<br />
you router if possible for this test though you do not need network at all just to test.&nbsp; Reboot to see if the<br />
bluescreens are gone.<br />
<br />
If disabling/removing the WiFi device stops the bluescreens then you need to contact Netgear Support.<br />
<br />

<h3> j.reynolds  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 install problems with .iso file burned o.  Need help</h2>
                    <p>The hard drive on my laptop died. &nbsp;The laptop had windows 10 installed, and I have a valid product key. &nbsp;Windows 10, English, 64-bit, Home</p>
<p>
</p><p>I replaced the hard drive, ran the system diagnostics, and everything checked out. &nbsp;I downloaded the .iso file from the microsoft website and used the media creation tool. &nbsp;I then burned the .iso file to a dvd and attempted to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;The first install hung at 70%. &nbsp;Error code indicated a missing/corrupt file. &nbsp;I tried it again just to confirm, and received same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Downloaded second .iso file and repeated procedure. &nbsp;This time, install died at 21%. &nbsp;Same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I then ran a hash calc, on each .iso file I downloaded from the microsoft website and the hash number for each .iso file I downloaded was different. &nbsp;I downloaded a third .iso file and the hash calc was different for a 3rd time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. &nbsp;I ran the the 3rd .iso install DVD, and the laptop did not even recognize the install software. &nbsp;I took the third dvd out, re-installed the first one (that failed at 70%) and now THAT one isn't recognized either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what is going on? &nbsp;Reading through the questions here, I am not the only person having issues like this. &nbsp;What do I need to do to get my laptop back up and running again? &nbsp;Why do I continue to get corrupted .iso downloads (if that is what is happening?).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

            Hi J
<br />
<br />I think the problem is using a DVD, the current Windows ISO does not correctly fit onto a standard DVD, you need a Dual-Layer DVD
<br />
<br />It would be best to use an 8GB USB flash drive for the installation rather than a DVD, it is more reliable and faster . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />If you still experience difficulty, this is a reliable method to create Windows 10 Bootable Media
<br />
<br />Click this link to download the Windows 10 ISO
<br />
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />Click this link to download a tool from Microsoft which you can use to create the bootable installation media from that ISO - tool works for Windows 7, 8 and 10

<p>Thank you for the reply. &nbsp;I will try your links and update the thread if successful or if I suffer yet another defeat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>two items. &nbsp;One, I used a dual layer dvd burner. &nbsp;That should not have been an issue for me, however there is definitely something going on here and I will try your suggestion and also put the file on a USB flashdrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I attempted the first install, I used my product key. &nbsp;Would that have caused any issues if the laptop already was running windows 10? &nbsp;I didn't think it would, but I read another post that suggested that if it is the same laptop as windows 10
 was running on before, to skip the key input and complete the install without it. &nbsp;Any thoughts? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>Lacrumb - thank you. &nbsp;If i do input the key, would it cause any issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>it is a new hard drive, completely clean. &nbsp;I have not moved any files from the old hard drive over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume I can enter the key later if required, however I am wondering why there is an issue with entering a valid key upfront?</p>

<h2>            Remote code for Kinect to control audio reciever</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p><p><br /></p><p>I just bought a new Xbox One S as an upgrade to an Xbox One.&nbsp; My original Xbox One was setup to control (on/off, volume, etc) an Anthem MRX1120 receiver through the Kinect.&nbsp; Since buying the new Xbox One S, and receiving the Kinect adapter kit for the xbox one s, I can't get the device control feature to recognize the Anthem receiver.&nbsp; I go through the normal process of allowing the xbox to discover the receiver by sending a "mute" command, but it never works.&nbsp; I am trying to now go the route of manually entering a remote control code for the receiver through the "advanced" part of the setup.&nbsp; The xbox says that a remote code is usually 4 numbers, sometimes with a letter in front.&nbsp; I'm not sure if it is looking for a single number to control all functions, or a specific number for each function (volume up, down, on/off, etc), but I have received the remote control codes from the manufacturer, and there are pages of them. </p><p>Won

<h3> nihar13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotfix not executing</h2>
                    <p>I want to install the hotfix mentioned in the below link:</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2416007</p>
<p>
</p><p>but when I download it and extract the same and then double-click on it to install, I get the error -
</p>
<p>Installer encountered an error: 0x80070005 Access is denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on Windows 7 64 bit Lenovo OEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a victim of the exact problem mentioned in the above KB. The USB 3g dongle device works fine on another laptop with WinXP.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT (17-Mar-2016)</strong> - The in-built Administrator account has some problem in Windows7 SP1 (32-bit as well as 64-bit) and so I added a new user and made it an Admin. After that I was able to install the KB-hotfix. But the real issue in KB
 is not resolved and the USB CDROM/FS gets repeatedly connected and disconnected (Event ID-51) and event log shows "An error was detected on device \Device\CdRomxx during a paging operation"</p>
<p>The xx gets incremented with a new enumerator everytime.</p>

 retrieves a page of memory from disk to memory. It is part of the memory management of Microsoft Windows.<br />
<br />
However, the computer may log this event message when it loads images from a storage device, reads and writes to locally mapped files or to any file (as long as it is buffered I/O). The computer does not log this event message when it performs nonbuffered I/O.
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Under certain circumstances, the system logs the following Event ID 51 event message:<br />
<br />
<em>An error was detected on device \Device\DeviceName during a paging operation</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>In this case, no harmful effects are experienced. For example, Event ID 51 is logged when blank media such as CDR, CDRW, DVDR, and so on, is inserted into a writable drive while a USB device is plugged in. The system logs
 the event even though the disc is writable, and the USB device is still usable. In these particular cases, you can safely ignore the log entries, and no additional action is required.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hello Sarandeep,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me re-phrase the "real issue".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a ZTE MF667 USB HSPA+ USB dongle, which was working very well with Windows7 (without ServicePack) and older PC with Windows XP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I installed SP1 on Windows 7 on my new laptop and then connected the USB dongle. It connects and disconnects every 6 seconds (as seen in the event log, with incrementing device number) -- This same issue is mentioned in KB2416007. For 1 second or so,
 I see a CDFS disk drive and a USB storage drive in My Computer (just for 1 second) and then the device disconnects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The event log has multiple entries (1 entry every 6 seconds) as below:</p>
<p>Event Time | Event ID | Event Description</p>
<p>10:10:36 AM | 51 |&nbsp;An error was detected on device \Device\CdRom2 during a paging operation.</p>
<p>10:10:42 AM | 51 |&nbsp;An error was detected on device \Device\CdRom3 during a paging operation.</p>
<p>10:10:48 AM | 51 |&nbsp;An error was detected on device \Device\CdRom4 during a paging operation.</p>
<p>10:10:55 AM | 51 |&nbsp;An error was detected on device \Device\CdRom5 during a paging operation.</p>
<p>10:11:12 AM | 51 |&nbsp;An error was detected on device \Device\CdRom6 during a paging operation.</p>
<p>10:11:19 AM | 51 |&nbsp;An error was detected on device \Device\CdRom7 during a paging operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed the Hotfix for KB2416007 (creating a new Admin user, etc), but the above issue is not resolved yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I am able to explain the issue. Please help as I am running out of options and Google searches.<br />
</p>

            <p>Hi Sarandeep,<br />
Apologies for late reply.<br />
I have done the following as per your directions:<br />
<br />
1. There is no exclamation mark or yellow triangle under USB Serial Bus Controllers in Device Manager.<br />
<br />
2. I uninstalled all items under USB Serial Bus Controllers and restarted the system. As you told, the items were re-installed automatically followed by a system-restart again.<br />
<br />
3. I checked the chipset drivers on Intel's website and the one's installed are the latest ones.<br />
<br />
Even after doing all of this, when I plugged the device, the same connecting and disconnecting is happening.</p>
<p>One note I would mention : The same device, same drivers are working fine on the first-plug-in on windows7 (without SP1), but connecting-and-disconnecting in win7 with SP1.</p>

<p>Hi Barbara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to gather more information for us to better understand your computer performance concern. Kindly tell us what is happening when you attempt to turn on the computer. What are the things that you're seeing on the screen during the startup process?
 Are you encountering any error messages while the computer is stating up? When the computer blacked out, did you also encounter any error messages?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us, Barbara. If you cannot see any lights when turning on the computer and if you cannot see anything on the screen, it is possible that the laptop doesn't have any power. Since you're using a laptop, please make sure that the
 charger is connected to the device. Charge the laptop for a while, and then check if you'll be able to start the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>We would like to know if you're seeing any light indicators when you plug-in the charger of your laptop. If not, there is a possible issue with the battery of the laptop. We recommend removing the battery, and then connect the charger. After that, check
 if the computer will turn on. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, there may be an issue with the hardware components of your laptop and that prevents it from turning on. If this is the case, it is best to contact the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the laptop so that they can diagnose its
 hardware components. To know how to contact the laptop's manufacturer, access this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14148/computer-manufacturers-contact-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">web page</a></strong> and click
<strong>How to find out an OEM’s contact information</strong>.</p>

    <title>Problems with Slovenian Language Pack in Windows 10 Pro Technical - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boozzoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Slovenian Language Pack in Windows 10 Pro Technical Preview Build 10586</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This will sound strange, but I have some problems with installation of "Slovenian language pack-Windows Technical Preview (KB3107313) [sl-SI_LP]". Windows said it isn't available. I installed yesterday, right after updating on Build 10586 on 32-bit desktop,
 but for 64-bit laptop it isn't available. I updated both computer simultaneously. I try "Windows&nbsp;Update" repair with "Windows Update Diagnostic-standalone pack" and it works, but still there is no Slovenian language pack available.</p>
<p>Anybody know something about that? What could be wrong. </p>
<p>I check also with</p>
<p>- CMD (Run as Administrator)</p>
<p>- sfc /scannow</p>
<p>No violation found in the system.</p>
<p>I run Windows Essentials security scanner, return "Nothing wrong"</p>
<p>What else could I do, or is this problem from Microsoft programmers?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>I think that I need to sit down and wait from them to repair.</strong></em></p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for your help and I appreciated that. But I already try this. On a screenshots you'll see what I mean.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fdbd4274-cbb1-4375-9300-39d90dd362b3" /><br />
</p>
<p>That how it looks when I open a control panel and than I click options to check if is Language pack ready to download. Than I get this answer:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e6fece8-95e7-4a49-9309-f7d2c2b0a0ed" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Than I go to check if Slovenian language pack is even available and I see that the icon of Slovenian language is
<strong>GREY.</strong></p>
<p>And you can not click on it.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f55e907-c578-4058-8e63-4c1524b716f5" />So what can I do now?</p>

            <p>I reinstall Windows with clean install and if you have "Digital Rights" for the program is no problem to make an USB flash drive to reinstall. You need to use "Media Creation Tool" and make a copy for another computer.</p>
<p>Than you start from a USB flash drive &gt; Format &gt; Install.</p>
<p>Now is working great.</p>
<p>Problem was in previous Build 10565.</p>

<h2>            Recruiting Team Captains for Halo and Call of Duty &#40;18&#43;&#41;</h2>
                    

<p><a href="http://sidewindergaming.enjin.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sidewinder Gaming</a> is recruiting 2 Team Captains to head up our British and American teams. These Captains will take charge of a small squad and act
 as my effective 'right hand men'. It will be your job to recruit new personnel for your squad in the correct manner (which will be discussed). The squad will act as a clan squad, matchmaking and Gamebattles; should the will arise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must show:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Great skills in leadership</p>
<p>- A need to adapt to changing circumstances and situations</p>
<p>- A compassionate personality</p>
<p>- A nice person!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's hard to summarise just what sort of clan we are. In essence, Sidewinder Gaming acts as a hub for players on the Xbox 360 playing various games such as Call of Duty and Halo. However, one thing separates us from the rest; organisation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sidewinder Gaming aims to be your gaming homepage. Now that might sound like an off statement, but we want it to be your homepage where you go to converse with others, set up matches and generally make the most of games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a few things that will help you decide whether this is right for you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- You are 18 or above&nbsp;</p>
<p>- You are respectful of others and yourself, treating gaming environments as your humble abode</p>
<p>- You are committed to becoming a member</p>
<p>- In regards to location, anywhere is acceptable. We are currently recruiting captains and administrators to lead within different time zones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the most major elements of becoming a member of the clan. Over time, these rules may adapt and change due to the changing nature of a larger group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an ultimate vision, Sidewinder Gaming will be a large collective of friends playing under the Sidewinder Gaming banner. For instance, if you're a Gears of War player, you can try-out for our Sidewinder Gaming team for GoW. Likewise, if you're a Halo,
 Battlefield or Call of Duty fan, a similar application for a team can be made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your time, and I really look forward to getting to know you all individually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you wish to apply, head on over to the website and click 'Join Us' and I'll send you a message very soon!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: This clan is new, we are very much young and this is your chance to be apart from the ground up. As of next month, we will have our own dedicated website along with prizes such as Microsoft Points. Look at this as an oppourtunity to be a part
 of something bigger, and a way to get the best out of your gaming experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
