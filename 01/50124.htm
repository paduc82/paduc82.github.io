<p>Hi Bulldog XX</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the&nbsp; responseYes I got the blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first the computer wold not boot and eventually gave a message saying "Windows Boot configuration data missing or contains errors". Acer advised that I try Media Creation Tool. When that was attempted I got the message&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">&nbsp;"Windows
 cannot be installed to this disk. The disk may fail soon. If other hard disks are available, install Windows to another location"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">I have not been able to do anything with the computer since then. Attempt to boot produces the "Acer" logo for about 15 minutes
 then go to a blue screen.</span></p>

            Yes, you can reinstall it without penalty.
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi GFritz_3, you have nothing to worry about, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h2>            Blu-Ray stuttering whilst watching films</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I have recently noticed that when watching films on Blu-ray films they're are occasional stutters as if the disc is skipping.</p>
<p>I have checked the discs and also tried different films, but it seems to happen on all of them. Its an intermittent problem and happens about 4 or 5 times during play back of a film. Is this a software glitch or is my disc drive dying :-/</p>

<p>Ok Guys ive got the final answer to the problem on this now after contacting MS support. Unfortunalty it is faulty hardware and can't be patched.
</p>
<p>I have just recieved my new xbox one through the edvanced exchange progam and the blu-rays are now running as smooth as butter. Get in contact with MS directly and ask for replacement hardware, or take the console back to where you bought it and exchange
 it for a working system. </p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Bluescreen &#40;ntoskrnl.exe&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, can somebody help me? I'm getting bluescreens from ntoskrnl.exe over and over and over and over and over and ...you get the point. I've tried "every sollution possible", checked my hdd and ssd with sort and sort of programs Hd Tune, Hdd sentynel,
 a western digital program, ssdlife and more stuff like this. I've checked my ram with memtest. I've disable from msconfig services and starting program (except microsoft services). I've reinstalled a fresh copy of windows (original with licence bought from
 retailer a long time ago). I've checked the temperature and on and on. Nothing, no component broken or stuff like that. From what i've seen, one day I've disconnected the hdd and let just the ssd running (before reinstalling the os) and maybe it was a coincidence,
 maybe it wasn't no bsod appeared. The ssd and hdd are running in ahci mode, maybe that is the problem? I've notice the bsod appears mostly when I enter random pages on firefox and when I enter in the hdd, to view some files, just navigating. I don't think
 I have all the rest of the bsod, but I can upload these one if needed, just tell me where and how. I've had around 30 bsod's in one hour&nbsp; a few days ago and the stuff keeps going and going. 100% of the ntoskrnl.exe and other stuff, every one "different". It's
 so frustrating. I've got all the updates installed, it's up to day. What can I do more? I've installed bluescreenview and whocrashed and didn't observed nothing "special". Can you guys please point me in a direction? Thank you. Just tell me what to upload
 and where. Thank you for your time!</p>

                    I was promised a refund by an agent, then later denied that refund, and then ignored when I tried to get an answer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Terrible customer support.&nbsp; I keep getting caught in an endless loop when trying to get&nbsp; a live agent now.&nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft stole my money
 then <span><strong>[Mod Removed – Profanity]

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My best advice, would be to either call or request a call back from Xbox Support, so your issue will get resolved. I have also had poor experiences with live chat advice and resolution of issues, so sometimes speaking to someone can alleviate any communication
 barriers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be aware of the conditions of a refund. It is down to the agent's discretion whether they are happy to process it or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this gets resolved for you, asap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>

            I appreciate your reply, but is there any reason to think I'll get a different result this time?&nbsp; I submitted a pile of feedback, replied several times and got no where.&nbsp; Add it now it's been a while, I can't imagine some random person can resolve this
 issue for me.&nbsp; &nbsp;I need some form of escalated support, not the same level that let me down so horribly before.

 the only way to dispute the denial. I apologize for any frustration that you may have incurred due to this; however, you may always dispute the charge directly with your financial institution as well.</span></p>

            thanks, but actually <strong>helps not at all</strong>.&nbsp; The lack of refund and explanation/response by MS staff was unacceptable "customer service" and has inspired me to focus more on my PS4 for future games.&nbsp; Also, inspired me to avoid Digital content
 in the future since XBox support doesn't seem to provide a small amount of customer service when an issue occurs.&nbsp; &nbsp;As such a long time customer, I am seriously appalled by the lack of consideration from the support staff.&nbsp; &nbsp;

            So I am to understand this issue is closed as far as xbox is concerned?&nbsp; I figured it was the case, I just really would like a representative to come out and directly say they don't really care about my business enough to truly address my concerns.

<p>Hello Groo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is stated within our <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Service Agreement</a></strong> the following information regarding refunds:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(82, 77, 82, 1)">Refund Policy.</span></strong><span> Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. If you believe that Microsoft has charged you
 in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old. We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation
 to issue the same or similar refund in the future. This refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.

            <p><span>Hi FritzeVQ,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community! I suggest you to try the steps provided and check if
 the "Problem starting SPIRunE.dll" issue gets resolved.<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Are you able to boot into desktop?<br />
</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>SPIRunE.dll" "belongs to SPIRun Endpoints Dynamic Link Library" "from Creative Technology Ltd."<br />
So if you have recently installed some driver or device from Creative Labs, you may have received this error."</span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unplug the external devices connected to the system, except the keyboard and mouse and check.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 1: Perform clean boot and check.</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>You may perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue.
</span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>
<p>Follow the given link to perform Clean boot:
<a href="https://mail.agent.cvgs.net/owa/redir.aspx?C=a84ffb14b3dc42a9826c6a6dea6d6a29&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2fkb%2f929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important: Reset the computer to start as usual.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span>
 After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click
<b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click
<b>‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 2: Follow the given link and contact bit defender support.</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>Bit defender support is not a Microsoft product you have to contact Bit defender support for further
 help.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://www.bitdefender.com/support/consumer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bitdefender.com/support/consumer.html</span></a>
</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u><span>Method 3:</span></u></strong><b><u><span>
</span></u></b><b><u><span>Check if the issue occurs in safe mode.</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + C’ key on the keyboard.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on settings, more pc settings and then general.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>c) Scroll down to advanced startup, click restart now.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click on troubleshoot, advanced options, Windows Startup Settings.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>e) Click restart, select safe mode and then press enter.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><b>Note:</b> Restart the computer to start in normal mode.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not persist in safe mode, then perform a clean boot
 to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u><span>Method 4:</span></u></strong></p>
<p><span>You may run a Microsoft safety scanner to make sure computer is free from virus infection:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Disclaimer:</span></u></b><span><br />
If you run the virus scan the program that is infected with virus will get deleted. So you have to reinstall the program. Also if the files and folders are affected with virus then they might even get deleted</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<span>Please reply with the results. If you have any queries feel free to post. I would be glad
 to assist you further.</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

            <p>Thanks Anshull,</p>
<p>It was a card printing program I had from Creative Techs., once I deleted it I have had no further Pop-Ups or troubles.</p>
<p>The Bit Defender thing was a separate fault, which needed an update from them. Done now.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

<div>After hours and hours of searching and trying things, I have found the solution to the...
<div><br />
<div>"error starting SPIRunE.dll... &nbsp;The module cannot be found..." error message.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You have to edit your registry.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. In Windows 8, press and hold windows button and press the X button</div>
<div>2. click RUN</div>
<div>3. in the open bar type - regedit - and hit enter</div>
<div>4. at the pop up window - select YES - and you will be in the registry editor</div>
<div>5. Select from the menu bar - EDIT / FIND</div>
<div>6. in the FIND popup window type - SPIRunE.dll - and hit enter</div>
<div>7. DELETE any SPIRunE.dll registry entries that appear</div>
<div>8. If the option exists, click FIND NEXT...</div>
<div>9. if other SPIRunE.dll registry entries appear, DELETE THEM.</div>
<div>10. Continue until the registry search doesn't find any SPIRunE.dll entries.</div>
<div>11.. REBOOT</div>
<div><br />
<div>This worked for me.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Estou com o mesmo problema e aparece o código de erro 80153410...</p>
<p>Já entrei em contato com o suporte da Microsoft no Brasil e até agora nada de solução, apenas dizem que estão em busca da solução e que vão solucionar o meu problema... Mas já faz um tempo que liguei lá na microsoft e deram essa resposta.. aproximadamente
 1 mês e até agora nada... O suporte do Brasil atualmente é feito no Brasil por brasileiros já que agora a Microsoft também está ligada diretamente aqui após o início da fabricação do XBOX no país. Mas há um bom tempo atrás, quando utilizei o meu cartão de
 crédito na LIVE os mexicanos que estavam servindo de armazenadores dos dados furtaram o meu número do cartão e quase conseguiram me levar um grana, mas como eu tinha um aviso de utilização do cartão... eles não conseguiram e cancelei o cartão pedindo outro...
 Daí comprei os Microsoft Points, porém, agora tá essa merda de situação... Estou achando que os mexicanos que gerenciam essa merda da Live Brasileira lá fora, estão criando este caos para forçar a todos no Brasil e em outros países a substituírem os MSPoints
 por cartão de crédito para furto dos dados e consequentemente levarem nossa grana. E o que estou falando está registrado na operadora de cartões como tentativa de saque em caixa eletrônico numa cidade do México, sendo que eu estava por aqui no Brasil trabalhando
 e ralando enquanto esses filhos da mãe estavam me furtando lá.</p>
<p>A atendente da Microsoft Brasil solicitou solução do problema para a Microsoft de fora do Brasil, mas sabe-se lá de onde é o suporte desta coisa... de repente é no México e não estou sabendo, porque caracas estaria demorando tanto para verem a minha solicitação
 de um problema teoricamente simples e que muitos podem estar passando?</p>
<p>Não creio que a Microsoft faria vista grossa para as pessoas do Brasil que apesar de gastarem o seu dinheiro em REAIS que valem menos do que DÓLARES, mas gastam bastante, impediriam e complicariam o gasto comprando os seus jogos e serviços.. pois dinheiro
 é dinheiro em qualquer lugar do mundo...</p>
<p>Vejo esta situação como uma emboscada articulada no país que gerenciam os dados de compra de serviços...</p>
<p>Espero não estar enganado e acreditar que isso ocorra debaixo do nariz da Microsoft no próprio território Americano...</p>
<p>E se for em outro país, que a solução seja a busca dos mal intencionados que estão causando estes problemas para que se resolva para &nbsp;o bem de todos.. &nbsp;pois isso merece processo legal e na justiça.... Não falei aqui nenhuma estória para boi dormir e nem
 uma fantasia da minha cabeça.. foi o que ocorreu e na época que solicitei o suporte da Microsoft pelo número de telefone da época, uma atendente falando em um PORTUNHOL me ouviu contando essa história que acabei de contar e pouco ajudou nessa situação... E
 mesmo eu tentando enviar mensagem cobrando soluções, que por sinal tenho cópia do e-mail até hoje de quando aconteceu, nenhuma solução ou atenção foi dada... E hoje é isso que está acontecendo... Não tenho coragem de colocar o meu número de cartão de crédito
 no site da XBOX Live por falta de fé e credibilidade na empresa e principalmente em alguns funcionários que deveriam estar na cadeia e quando compro MSPoints é como seu tivesse pegado R$ 99,00 e jogado no lixo, pois até agora não serviu de nada... Pra não
 dizer que não serviu de nada eu comprei um BattleField Vietnam e depois o MSPoints virou lixo.. não consigo mais utilizá-lo pra nada &nbsp;e acabei assim como vocês com essa mesma mensagem....</p>
<p>Pra quem podemos recorrer desses problemas já a Microsoft Americana ligou o dane-se para nós, para não falar outra coisa?</p>
<p>Espero sinceramente que o respeito e principalmente a consideração e honestidade sejam levadas em conta nesses problemas de compras da Live e em todos os demais problemas que possam a vir ser apresentados....</p>
<p>Falhar é humano, mas ignorá-los é realmente uma falta de humanidade e que deveria ser punido com severidade até mesmo judicial...

<p>Sim... Desde aquela época... Por isso que tive esse problema... Só aceitavam internacional... Não sei hoje se aceitam nacional...</p>
<p>Desde então não tive mais como utilizá-lo por falta de fé de cadastrá-lo no XBox Live...
</p>
<p>Aí veio a idéia de comprar os MSPoints, porém, parece que de propósito não funciona... e porque? Gostaria de uma resposta do porque não funciona com MSPoints... Espero que seja apenas um problema técnico mesmo... Não quero acreditar que seja por outro motivo.
 Mas se seguirmos a idéia da sequência de problemas sem motivos aparentes, seria para me forçar a colocar novamente apenas o cartão de crédito? Será que serei obrigado a acreditar em teorias da conspiração para este caso?</p>
<p>Até acredito que eu não seja o único, mas isso é muito embaraçoso... Você crê que poderia solucionar de forma simples, mas não vê outra saída... Ou perde o dinheiro sem a possibilidade de recuperá-lo, assim como está sendo até o momento, ou não encontra
 meios de utilizar cartão de crédito por falta de fé na empresa ou melhor dizendo, digamos em uma ou outra pessoa de dentro ou de fora da empresa, não sei as quais poderiam ser, que tentam te furtar na cara dura e você não tem medidas de identificar estas pessoas.</p>
<p>Lamentável...</p>
<p>Espero que o meu problema e dos demais sejam solucionados sem maiores problemas para ambos os lados...</p>

                    <p>I purchased and downloaded&nbsp;Bully: Scholarship Edition a few years ago on my Xbox 360 but after recently having purchased an Xbox One - the game is no where to be found.

 </blockquote> <p>I've added the game to queue but I'm having a problem with transferring it to my Xbox One console. All that happens when I hold down the power button is that eventually my controller gets turned off. I have tried to restart the console several times but that doesn't help neither.</p>

    <title>No option for extended desktop in Display Settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> db88intx  say:</h3>
<h2>            No option for extended desktop in Display Settings</h2>
                    
<p>Windows XP Home Edition, SP3.&nbsp; ATI Radeon 9200 graphics card.</p>
<p>I want to connect my TV to my desktop PC.&nbsp; The primary monitor is connected to the graphics card's VGA port, and I have a DVI to HDMI cable running from the DVI port on the card to an HDMI port on the TV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now, I have the same image displayed on both the monitor and the TV.&nbsp; I would like to run in extended desktop mode, with the monitor as the primary.&nbsp; However, when I go to DISPLAY PROPERTIES&gt;Settings, only one screen is shown rather than a [1] and
 a [2].&nbsp; Above the "Screen Resolution" slider it says "Display:&nbsp; (Multiple Monitors) on RADEON 9200".&nbsp; I have no option for enabling extended desktop on this screen.</p>
<p>In Device Manager, I have two monitors shown.&nbsp; One is for the SONY monitor that came with the PC and the other is called "Plug and Play Monitor".&nbsp; I have tried to update both of those but it keeps coming back that there are no later versions to install.</p>
<p>Where do I go from here?</p>

<h2>            LOCKED - DLC won&#39;t work offline for all games.</h2>
                    
<p>hello, recently i got a new xbox which was the 250gb kinect ready version and recovered my gamertag. I re downloaded all DLC i had downloaded before as it did not go on my new xbox. Since then I have been having problems offline with the dlc. For instance,
 I can no longer play smackdown vs raw 2011 offline as it says the dlc pack is damaged and won't load the game but if i sign in to live and load the game it comes up and loads. Does anyone know what I have to do to get it to work? Thanks for your time.</p>

            What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Headphones
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your Headphones
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing.

<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />If its Windows 10 1803:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hi Mazuar.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sound Settings, in dropdown menu at top make sure Headphones are selected.
<br />
<br />If not choose Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page.  While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

 didn't try the reinstall windows because I want that to be more of a last result option. Another thing is that it doesn't show up in anything. Yes, audio still works but nothing else works, but in settings and playback it doesn't show headphones and I tried
 show disabled and all of that. Is their any other way to fix this other than rolling back drivers (It didn't work), rolling back updates, or reinstalling windows.</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy

<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install

    <title>MIDI devices do not function - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josh stanley  say:</h3>
<h2>            MIDI devices do not function</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Midi Issues</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having recurring midi device problems that are quite time consuming and any help with solving them would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been connecting several different midi keyboard and controller hardware devices via USB 2.0 to my laptop,&nbsp;I have&nbsp;updated drivers and windows 8 is picking up the devices as they are listed in the device manger and also in different music production
 programmes which I am trying to use them with, although all seemed fine I still got no function from the midi devices whatsoever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I originally solved this issue after trying different hardwares, programmes etc to narrow down the problem and came to the conclusion that windows was picking up the devices multiple times and then shutting the use of them off (as a power saving facility
 or something like that?).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I solved it by going into the device manager and disabling the 2nd and 3rd listings of the same device and then midi functionality returned for the devices,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately this time round when the same problem occurred, being the lack of midi response,&nbsp;I cannot solve the issue with my previous solution as there are not multiple listings of the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder has anyone had a similar issue and successfully solved it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please feel free to question anything I have said should I have clearly explained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Josh</p>

<p><br />
Using Show hidden devices?&nbsp;&nbsp; Also watch what happens in the registry when you remove them.&nbsp; Do you have multiple USB ports and do you stick the same device in each of them?&nbsp; I think that could account for the multiple instances but supposedly that is usually
 Ok.&nbsp;&nbsp; What about the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter?&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it show you anything?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply Robert,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes it was using Show Hidden Devices. Sorry not sure what you mean when you say "watch what happens in the registry"?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes I would insert the device into the different ports. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally no, the Troubleshooter shows me nothing, the devices are listed as enabled and working properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe the devices are ok, but possibly the midi signals being sent from them are being mixed up, possibly not being sent right? Is there some form of&nbsp;a midi manager within Windows?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again thanks for your reply and any further help is appreciated.</p>

I was imagining that you were using the opportunity to remove them too.&nbsp; When I do that things change in the registry accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>

<h2>            Your connection is too weak. Please try again later.</h2>
                    <p>I am receiving the message that my signal is too weak to make calls to mobiles but only certain ones. My connection is strong (I can receive inbound calls and have used video calling). I have uninstalled and reinstalled, reset my modem, restarted my computer
 and tried on a different network. Nothing works. I have tried the community forum and to speak to your robot help desk - no joy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far the only trend I can identify is that I can't call mobiles in Jersey, but can call domestic mobiles. Please help as I urgently need a fix.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. 
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />Some users reported similar issues and resolved them by doing the following:
<br />- use CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to launch the Task Manager
<br />- Kill any instance of Skype.exe 
<br />
<br />(1) If you are using Skype app from Windows from Microsoft Store
<br />- click Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall 
<br />&gt; then install Skype again from Microsoft Store (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>)
<br />
<br />(2) If you are using Skype for Desktop 
<br />- Copy the line 
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop 
<br />- Click Windows Key+R 
<br />- Paste into Run window by CTRL+V and then click Enter 
<br />- Rename this folder to something difference for instance Skype for Desktop_Skype_Old 
<br />- Reinstall Skype (<a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a> )
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! If this still persists, please let me know. 
<br />Looking forward to hearing back from you. 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week! 
<br />Margarida

<p>Same problem here...and it's for a call to the UK from the US.&nbsp; I have a great WiFi connection, but it's not working on either my desktop or mobile phone.&nbsp; In addition, I tried calling on the mobile network, having disconnected from WiFi; no change.&nbsp; Every
 time, it says the signal is too weak, and I should try again later.</p>

<p>Hi I've tried all the techniques listed above to make my skype work again - it was fine all apart from during turbulent weather for months before that.</p>
<p>The weather is fine at the moment.</p>
<p>I use skype to skype calling usually.</p>
<p>Currently I keep getting the line "your connection is too weak try again later".</p>
<p>I hope I can resolve this as I need skype for work.</p>

    <title>Service Control Manager triggers &#34;Window Error.wav&#34; everytime - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Service Control Manager triggers &#34;Window Error.wav&#34; everytime it logs...</h2>
                    This problem started happening a couple weeks ago but cannot pinpoint exact date. System Restore is not an option.<br />
<br />
In Windows 7 Ultimate under "Computer Management &gt; Event Views &gt; Windows Logs &gt; System" I get the following "Information" log...<br />
<br />
"The Multimedia Class Scheduler service entered the running state"<br />
"The Multimedia Class Scheduler service entered the stopped state"<br />
<br />
I also get other "Information" logs but the logs are irrelevant. The problem is this...every time a log is created in the "System" logs it plays the "Window Error.wav." I know this because I changed the "Window Error.wav" to a custom .wav file that made a different
 sound and now it plays the custom sound instead of the "Window Error.wav". And since logs are being created in the System Logs so frequently it plays a sound every time which gets very annoying and it did not used to do this. I know I could just have no sound
 for the "Asterisk" in the "System Sounds" but then I would not be able to get the error sound when It really counts.<br />
<br />
So to recap...why does window sound "Window Error.wav" every time a log is written in "Computer Management &gt; Event Views &gt; Windows Logs &gt; System" and how can I fix it so it does no sound for "Informational" level logs?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
UPDATE:<br />
<br />
I have tried going to "Change System Sounds" or the system sounds configuration and DISABLING "Asterisk" sound just for the heck of it and now it plays "Default Beep" (Windows Ding.wav) sound. Its like this problem is adapting to my every move! Too funny.<br />
<br />
UPDATE:<br />
<br />
Tried again with DISABLING "Default Beep" AND "Asterisk" sounds and now it plays "System Notification" (Windows Balloon.wav).<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform clean boot on the computer and get the system log to better understand what exactly is happening.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Try to run the system file checker (SFC scan) and check if it helps.</p>
