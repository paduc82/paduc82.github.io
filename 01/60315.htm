    <title>Windows 10 no desktop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 no desktop</h2>
                    <p>I have recently installed Windows 10, as a free upgrade from Windows 7. I have an Alienware R17m3 laptop. I can reach the logon screen, where I select my user, the only one (no password) and it logs on. I can then see the desktop correctly, with the Desktop
 icons as they were on Windows 7. Then however, the screen goes blank, with the white cursor remaining, after about two seconds. There is nothing else on the screen, and right and left clicking achieve nothing. Upon trying to change displays, as is a common
 cause of this problem (Fn-F6) a light blue box highlights were the options are for selecting monitors, and I can move this up and down, but these are just empty boxes in the black, the only way I can tell what they are is because the Narrator turns on and
 disctates what's in the boxes. The Narrator minimises to the bottom left, about a cm above where I assume the start bar would be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Narrator, I am able to get to the file explorer, and then the drives and desktop, meaning I can open Chrome and others, which all work fine. However, still no desktop. I have updated all the drivers, fiddles with the display settings and started
 the computer in Safe Mode, all with the same result (Safe Mode reduces the resolution, but nothing else. I have also tried force starting explorer.exe in Task Manager, but no joy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>G'day Bangem! That's a bit of a strange issue. What happens when you try to cancel the installation? When you highlight the game in My Games and Apps and press the Menu button, there should be options to Pause or Cancel the download/install. Are you hit
 with an error? Do those options not appear? </p>

<h3> janjuyung  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD on Login to Account</h2>
                    <p>After shutting down my computer after it was running slow (having difficulties with viewing a YouTube video, lags when attempting to CTRL-ALT-DEL), attempting to log back into my personal user account resulted in a BSOD with the code "System Service Exception".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logging into the Administrator account I thankfully created still works, and I can use the computer without issue on that account. But, every time I attempt to log into my personal user account I receive a System Service Exception error code and a BSOD.
 I attempted to system restore to a save created on 01/06/2019, but the restore failed and I did not receive an error why. Similarly, a start-up repair yielded similar results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran sfc /scannow and after it encountered corrupted files and failing to repair them, I found this in the text log it presented to me.</p>

            Hi Jan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It seems you've already confirmed the account is corrupted, and not the install, since the Admin account works properly.
<br />
<br />So what I would do if you don't want to run under your Admin account as most do, is create a new Local Standard Account:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Sign in, Test it runs OK, all apps work properly, move your files over, when ready you can delete the old account in the same place.  You can then convert the Local Account to your MS Account if desired.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

<p>Hi Greg, thank you for your reply and insight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When attempting to create a new local account through the Administrator account, clicking on "Add someone else to this PC" in the settings menu opens up something called "lusrmgr - Local Users and Groups (Local)" which says "This snapin may not be used with
 this edition of Windows 10. To manage user accounts for this computer, use the User Accounts tool in the Control Panel." but when attempting to do so, the tool only redirects me back to the settings menu, creating a sort of loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems as if I'd need to purchase a different version of windows to do this, is that necessary and if so, is there a way to save the hassle? I feel as if I had created an account before, seeing as this Administrator account exists outside of my own personal
 account.&nbsp;</p>

            To address the apparent older version as well as the broken system files, I'd run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This reinstalls WIndows while saving your files and apps in place; takes about an hour, resolves most problems.  
<br />
<br />There is no version of Windows that will not let you create a new account, unless it's an Enterprise version that has Group Policies restricting this.  
<br />
<br />I have never found a reason to not operate under the Admin account, which is what Windows creates when you install it.

<p>1) To evaluate the BSOD please post logs for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Using administrative command prompt copy and paste this whole command.<br />
<br />
2) Make sure the default language is English so that the logs can be scanned and read.<br />
<br />
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3813-language-add-remove-change-windows-10-a.html<br />
<br />
The command will automatically collect the computer files and place them on the desktop.<br />
<br />
3) Then use 7zip to organize the files and one drive, drop box, or google drive to place share links into the thread for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />

8) dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
9) chkdsk /scan</p>
<p>10) net user test /add</p>
<p>11) findstr /c:"[SR]" %windir%\Logs\cbs\cbs.log &gt;%userprofile%\desktop\sfcdetails.txt</p>
<p>
</p><p>12) When these have completed &gt; right click on the top bar or title bar of the administrative command prompt box &gt; left click on edit then select all &gt; right click on the top bar again &gt; left click on edit then copy &gt; paste into the thread</p>
<p>
</p><p>13) shutdown /r</p>
<p>
</p><p>14) When the computer reboots sign on with the new user named test</p>
<p>
</p><p>15) Evaluate the performance of the computer with the new user and report the findings into the thread</p>
<p>
</p><p>16) In the left lower corner search type: system or system control &gt; open system control panel &gt; on the left pane click advanced system settings
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) &gt; on the advanced tab under startup and recovery &gt; click settings &gt; post an image of the startup and recovery window into the thread</p>

            Thank you once again Greg. I attempted to do a repair install like you suggested with the creation tool. I followed through the install wizard's directions but the system BSOD with a System Service Exception approximately 24-26% into installing windows.
 I appreciate your advice and patience with me.

<h3> marctalley  say:</h3>
<h2>            nusb3co.dll.mui</h2>
                    My computer is less than 6 months old and have files that were placed on it back on 5/5/2012, there are about 30 mui files and I cant find any thing on them or how to remove them. I don't know when they were downloaded on my pc but it has affected live
 updates.&nbsp; Ive run all kinds of scans and they come up clean but keep taking up more and more space as if they are recording every key stroke. Is there a way to safely remove them and if so with what ? Microsoft Safety Scanner shows everything is good but I
 know there is something fishy with any file on my PC that has the 05/05/2012 date on them.

            tried that but lost part of my Administrator Rights, however these popped up &nbsp;called, twain.ddl, twain_32.ddl, twunk_16 and twunk_32.&nbsp; Scans done by AVG, Microsoft Security Essentials, Defender and such say there is nothing wrong with these files but I
 think these files are smarter than the scanners are, even talking to Microsoft I am told there is nothing wrong and they are safe. Does anyone know anything about removing these off my PC, when I do they ,reload on their own. I am running windows 7 basic on
 the 64 bit.

<br />
Many MUI files can be found within the Windows <span>%SystemRoot%\</span> directory (e.g:
<span>%SystemRoot%\en-US\</span> in Windows 7). They may also be located within specific program installations, such as Windows Journal, Windows Defender, Windows Mail, and other Microsoft Windows programs, including Notepad (<span>notepad.exe.mui</span>).
 And those files are completely safe. <br />

<p>
</p><p>With the New Skype, people that is not in your contact will still be able to send you a message. However, you will have an option to either accept or reject the request.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you accept the message, the sender will be added to your contact. Also, a user that is not in your contact list can only send maximum of 10 messages unless you accept the invite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have yet to confirm if features from old Skype will be integrated to the New Skype as some may&nbsp;or may not be compatible with the current platform.</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minidump files point to the iaStorA.sys:</p>
<p><br />
<em>BugCheck D1, {0, 2, 0, fffff88001c97478}</em></p>
<p><em>*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for <strong>iaStorA.sys</strong><br />
*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for <strong>iaStorA.sys</strong><br />
Probably caused by : <strong>iaStorA.sys</strong> ( iaStorA+6a161 )</em><br />
</p>
<p>The iaStorA.sys, which is dated Nov 2, 2012, is the Intel storage driver so try updating the Intel storage driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try the following utility from Intel to check for driver updates:</p>

            I've had the same error message, but under different circumstances. I'm using Firefox, and connected to a JCPenny Wi-Fi, and I receive that error almost immediately after starting a particular downloading program, which makes no sense as to why it gives
 me this error now, when for the past few days, the program has run problem free. I only have Avast installed, just the free anti-virus, and I also have Spybot for spyware/malware stuff.<br />

<p>Consider starting a new topic on the issue to get better, individualized help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that topic&nbsp;it would help to provide the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder.</p>

<p>Copy the minidump files to another folder such as a folder on the Desktop and then&nbsp;upload them&nbsp;to a public folder on Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site and provide a link.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The driver that appears to be causing the crash is the Rt630x64.sys which is the Realtek network adapter driver.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Try the Windows 8 driver&nbsp;from the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=14&amp;PFid=7&amp;Level=5&amp;Conn=4&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=14&amp;PFid=7&amp;Level=5&amp;Conn=4&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>ESET drivers appeared also to be involved in the crashes so I would also suggest to update ESET to the latest version:</p>

<h2>            Keyboard and Mouse stopped working after uninstalling Windows 10 and re-installing Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have installed windows 10 whilst it was still free as it had notified me continuously to install it, and when I had done so, it had made my computer worse than it already is, though this is likely the few who had an upgrade that was worse than the predecessor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After seeing this, nearly everything I did before on Windows 7 was worse than before, though my PC is not what you can call good in the first place, i expected the performance to increase, even slightly. So due to this I had to uninstall Windows 10 and go
 back to Windows 7.</p>
<p>After I had reverted back to Windows 7, it has come to my realisation that the after doing so, it had connected all my hardware devices, making me unable to use my keyboard and mouse, which are both PS/2. Before this even happened I was already unable to
 use USB mouses and keyboards cause of a problem with the composite driver, so I have no other alternatives to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can only use my keyboard in the Windows recovery programme, and BIOS startup, and was able to do so on the Startup Repair (which rarely comes up so I can use this option).</p>
<p>So could you guys give me an answer to this please because I use my PC frequently and require it for most of my activities.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following methods and check if it works:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1: Try
<strong>Safe Mode</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Safe mode is the configuration of Windows, when it is running on only basic set of drivers and all the startups are disabled. To
 know more about safe mode, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue is resolved in safe mode, follow step 2 after restarting the computer in regular mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 2:
<strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps
 eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><em><span><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section â€˜<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>â€™.</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Update the drivers</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To update the drivers, you may refer to the link below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Automatically-get-recommended-drivers-and-updates-for-your-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Automatically-get-recommended-drivers-and-updates-for-your-hardware</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>If the issue still persists, I would recommend you to visit the computer manufacturerâ€™s support website and download the compatible drivers
 for your system.</span>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this information was helpful. Let us know the results once you have tried these methods. We'll be glad to assist you further.</span></span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Thanks for the information, I was unable to go on SafeMode because the hardware disconnects anywhere other than the Windows Recovery Programme, so I couldn't even log in to go through the first method.</p>
<p>The second method was also the same case, so I'm going to attempt to visit my manufacturer's website, though I wouldn't hope much since the company are Packard Bell, and they don't have any good computers in my opinion.</p>
<p>There's also the case that any help given wouldn't be able to solve downgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 7 causing a disabling in my PS/2 mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though I will still try, thanks for the information.</p>

<h2>            E3 2011 IGN Live Showing Schedule</h2>
                    
<p><a href="http://games.ign.com/articles/117/1172302p1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here</a> is the list of games at E3 2011 through IGN's showings.&nbsp; I attached the schedule below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that the times are in PST and that these are not all of the games that will be shown at E3 because at various press conferences, companies will display their "secret" titles such as the long awaited (fingers crossed) Star Wars Battlefront 3 and
 a new Rainbow Six Vegas game.&nbsp;&nbsp; A more accurate list of the majority of games shown is
<a href="http://games.ign.com/articles/108/1086456p1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Definitely looking forward to seeing Mass Effect 3, Battlefield 3, and Skyrim footage.</p>

            I don't think this game was ever released for consoles. It may be due to the reason that controls for this game using a controller would be really difficult, and not to mention the graphics it needs.

<p>Because it's up to the developer what system/s they release their games on not Microsoft.&nbsp; The developer in question here is Frontier Developments - they are also its publisher&nbsp;<a href="https://www.frontier.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.frontier.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So far this game is only available for Windows PCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's pretty much a mouse and keyboard game on the PC.&nbsp; Perhaps making it work for a controller would be too difficult?&nbsp; I'm not sure.&nbsp; There are certain advantages to only releasing your game on Windows, the big one is that there isn't a license fee to pay
 to release your game on Windows.</p>

<p><span>Hi
</span><span><span><span>Grlpink</span></span></span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Â·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error message when you try to use Bluetooth?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Â·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which version of Windows Vista is installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>I have few steps which might help you:</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try to install the drivers of Bluetooth on your computer from manufacturerâ€™s website.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>To set up a Bluetooth enabled device, you need to do three things:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Add a Bluetooth adapter to your computer.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>This is usually done by plugging the adapter into a USB port. (If a Bluetooth adapter is already built in or attached to your computer, ignore this step.)</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Set up the device so that your computer can find it.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>To do this, you must:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><span>Turn the device on.</span>
</li><li><span>Make it discoverable.</span>
</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p><span>To learn how to make a device discoverable, check the information that came with your device or go to the manufacturerâ€™s website.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Install the device.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>To install most devices, such as a mobile phone, keyboard, mouse, or personal digital assistant (PDA), you can use Bluetooth Devices in Control Panel. If you have Bluetooth wireless
 technology installed on your computer, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>To install a Bluetooth enabled device</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>a. Click the
<strong>Start</strong> button , click <strong>Control Panel</strong>, click <strong>
Hardware and Sound</strong>, and then click <strong>Bluetooth Devices</strong>. </span>
</p>
<p><span>b.Click
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Add</strong>, and then follow the instructions.</span></p>
<p><span>Link to refer:</span></p>

<h2>            Laptop does not sleep when plugged in</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop does not enter sleep mode according to the power settings used when it's plugged into AC power. I have reset all my power settings to default, but it still does not work. The laptop only enters sleep mode according to the power settings when it
 is running on battery.</p>
<p>I have Googled and tried numerous "solutions"&nbsp;offered&nbsp;by people having sleep issues with Windows but none of them&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate a solution to making the sleep setting work when it's plugged in since this is how I usually use my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<br />
<br />3. Disable Fast Startup
<br />Right click on battery icon in system tray &gt; Power options &gt; Click Choose what the power buttons do &gt; Click Change settings that are currently unavailable &gt; Scroll down to Shutdown settings and uncheck Turn on fast startup &gt; Click Save changes
<br />
<br />4. Uninstall / Install Battery Driver

<h3> martijn koekkoek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse pointer&#47;cursor automatically changes to an older version</h2>
                    <p>(Running on windows 8.1)</p>
<p>A couple of days ago i wondering if an option for the mouse was in the settings so i opened the "charms bar" and clicked on pc settings, ease of access, and then on mouse, there i found that what i was looking for wasn't there but there was some other neat
 options. So i switched the pointer color to the other two options and then switched it back to the original option. The problem was the pointer/cursor didn't go back to the original option, it went to the "Windows Default" (the one with the hour glass as the
 busy icon) an older cursor/pointer that wasn't the one that the system started with. I eventually figured out how to change it back (through the control panel) to "Windows Default (system scheme)" a.k.a: "Windows Aero".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now comes the real problem: From time to time the cursor/pointer changes back to that older icon seemingly randomly, sometimes a day later, sometimes a couple of minutes later. Now i am able to change it back to Aero through the control panel, but it still
 automatically changes back to the older icon after some time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how this happens, but i suspect it to do with the "Ease of Access" menu from the "charms bar".<br />
</p>
<p>Any help?</p>

            My recommendation is to reinstall the mouse drivers.
<br />If you are not sure how to do that i will need the make and model of your PC and mouse.

            Did you use that link and reinstall the drivers?
<br />Best way to do it is download the drivers.
<br />Right click your start button and select Device Manager.
<br />Go to Mouse and right click the Inferno mouse and say update driver.
<br />Go to the folder that you have the drivers in and use those.
<br />
<br />If this still doesn't work then maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

It is hard to pin point a particular update&nbsp;in the list of updates. I'd recommend (as suggested earlier) you to perform system restore and install the updates manually (one-by-one).

            Yes, I have tried that.&nbsp; One thing I have found in other forums is this error number has occurred with other people installing other programs, but gives a different registry entry.&nbsp; They leaned toward it being a .Net Framework related issue, but I don't
 think that is the problem I am having.

 you make any changes to the computer before having this issue?</span></span></p>

 try to print from Internet Explorer.</span></span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 failure due to unmoveable Microsoft installed partitions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> franklyn selzer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 failure due to unmoveable Microsoft installed partitions</h2>
                    <p>I am going nuts.&nbsp; No matter what I try, I cannot use my 2 TB C: drive to install the Windows 10 update.&nbsp; The partitions previously installed by the Microsoft Windows 8 disks I purchased from Microsoft are unmovable and thus I cannot expand the system reserved
 drive into adjacent space.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither EaseUS (purchased) nor MiniTool (purchased) will allow me to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, can I purchase Windows 10 disks and install the new OS and still save my files and programs -- e.g., Office 2010, Corel Paint Shop Pro, Quicken, etc.?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would Microsoft not realize that those partitions -- installed automatically, by their install process when moving from Windows 7 to Windows 8 and 8.1 -- would block it's widely touted 'free' upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; I bought the best Dell all-in-one
 PC with scads of disk space and tons of memory and the latest, best Intel CPU -- and Windows won't enable an update to Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm retired from three careers and have lots of time, but the frustration of the update taking over my PC for &nbsp;an hour every morning and then failing to install is pretty high.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I install using disks I purchase at MicroCenter or elsewhere?&nbsp; Please, somebody, answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>No, it didn't (doesn't) work.&nbsp; The problem is that both my top of the line Dell all-in-one PC and Toshiba laptop came loaded with Windows 7 Pro, 64bit.&nbsp; I had pre-purchased Windows 8 disks from Microsoft and installed them, and then upgraded them to Windows
 8.1.&nbsp; My 2TB hard drive in the PC was partitioned, not by me, but the Microsoft install disks.&nbsp; It made four smaller partitions up front and then the C drive -- which has lots of free space, then a 'recovery' partition that has lots of free space too.&nbsp; The
 problem is that none of the commercially available tools not Windows' built-in Disk management tools will let me move or extend those too small partitions up front.&nbsp; So the free space cannot be made adjacent (just before, or just after) the infamous 'reserved'
 partition.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>OK!&nbsp; I guess this can't be fixed -- you bad, not mine.&nbsp; But my question remains, can I purchase Windows 10 Pro from MicroCenter, Microsoft itself, Best Buy, Tiger Direct, or wherever and do a clean install and still save my extant programs and files?&nbsp; With
 previous editions of MS operating systems, a file called 'old.windows' was created.&nbsp; Is this still the case?&nbsp; And, as my PC has a Seagate 3TB backup drive can I copy my program files to it and then reinstall them in Windows 10 without having to start them
 all from scratch all over again?&nbsp;&nbsp;Those programs include the latest editions of Corel Photoshop, Quicken, Office 2010, Nero 2015, and so on and on.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, somebody, answer this even if you can't solve the partition problem that Windows created.</p>

<p>My 2TB hard drive in the PC was partitioned, not by me, but the Microsoft install disks.&nbsp; It made four smaller partitions up front and then the C drive -- which has lots of free space, then a 'recovery' partition that has lots of free space too.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Microsoft install disk never creates a 'recovery' partition.&nbsp; That would have been put there by Dell, and probably the four smaller partitions also.&nbsp; They are all hidden so you may not have realised they were there at first. &nbsp;I don't know why manufacturers
 like Dell create so many partitions but it can make life awkward, as you have discovered.&nbsp;

            <p>OK.&nbsp; I don't need any more help.&nbsp; I purchased a Windows 10 disk at Micro Center and deleted all my partitions and did a clean install.&nbsp; Of course I had to reinstall all my programs and recover my files from my backup drive.&nbsp; Then, a bunch of "Windows 10"
 driver updates appeared, and, fool that I was, I clicked OK to install.&nbsp; Well, a whole new problem occurred -- now Windows 10 went into a closed loop where it would load, I would log in and then two minutes later, it would inform me that there was an internal
 power issue and shut down and restart -- another log in -- another two minutes and the same problem.&nbsp; With Dell's help, I was able to reinstall (again) but lose all of my programs once again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell is not an unknown entity and one would hope that Microsoft, when embarking on a broad campaign to launch the O/S of the future would have tested its roll-out on a Dell PC.&nbsp; Ooops, too much to ask, I guess.&nbsp; Code can be written to do almost anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
 for one would like pizzazz and more attention to detail.&nbsp; This is the worst experience I've had since DOS on my very first PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my 78th year on this planet, I didn't need all this frustration.&nbsp; Nor did the thousands of others who are experiencing the identical
 problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Close the thread.&nbsp; I am all fixed up now --- 'til the next newest and greatest O/S is rolled out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Aaaaggghhh!</p>

<h2>            Game DVR Without explorer.exe&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using the 'Custom UI' group policy in Windows 10 Pro to load a games/emulator frontend. Unfortunately Game DVR and the Game Bar won't show when loading Windows like this. If I run task manager and load explorer.exe the Game Bar and Game DVR work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question - is it possible to use Game DVR when loading Windows like this? Are there services I just need to start? Or do these features actually require explorer.exe to be running?</p>
