<h2>            No sound from other party on call.</h2>
                    When a call is connected, Skype tells me it can't connect to my speakers. This has only happened since skype update. Speakers work fine with other apps.&nbsp;

<br />
<br />Go to the Windows Search Bar and type "Apps &amp; Features" and make a left click on it.
<br />
<br />Search for Skype &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Try a reset, a repair and if nothing works, reinstall it.

            I did an uninstall and reinstall.&nbsp; Still no audio. That was all I could think of. I tried the repair. No change. I tried reset.&nbsp; That fixed it I think. When I tested audio after reset, I got the call coming in notification. Thank you.&nbsp;

                    <p>My son purchased this over a year ago and stopped using it 6 months ago.</p>
<p>The Micorsoft update assistant is trying to load but there&nbsp; is not enough room so it cancels.</p>
<p>I had to uninstall but the it keeps trying to install.</p>
<p>I decided to set it back to factory default and wipe it clean.</p>
<p>However it gets to 62% will sit there for 10 to 20 minutes then it will say it something has gone wrong and can't continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I reset the laptop back to factory default?</p>

            Hi Richard.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you. 
<br />
<br /> I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  This may be the only way to do the Reset now if it is failing, but clearing space might also make it run - it is highly dependent upon the condition of the underlying install.  
<br />
<br />First here are tips for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />As more space becomes needed, you can offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>.  I would not move program files or speed will be affected.
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version 1803 since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a Cleaner install akin to the Reset, at the screen to Choose What to Save, select nothing or just files.  If you want the cleanest install at any time you can wipe the drive and do the vastly superior Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the  Upgrade Assistant  has already been installed by WIndows Update then I'd remove it and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root including C:\$Windows.~BT.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

<h2>            problems with Ecamm CallRecorder not opening with my skype</h2>
                    <p>I am needing some help to make Ecamm CallRecorder work with my Skype again. It worked well from Oct-Dec, but then suddenly stopped working. I have not been able to get it to open when Skype opens since Dec 19th. I have tried uninstalling and re-installing
 both apps, but nothing solves this. Ecamm are unhelpful as they dismiss this as impossible as they claim they have never seen it before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hello Gail,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using the new Skype version 8.xx, please be advised call recorder is no longer working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Call recording only works on classic Skype version, however, the classic Skype installer file is not available for download from our website (Skype.com) due to the known security vulnerability and we are working on restoring the official Skype Classic installer
 as soon as we have fixed this issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We do not advised our customers to download or install Skype software from third party hosts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please stay tuned for the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

 it also would not turn on with the controller as well.&nbsp; Overall a nuisance but when trying to sell the concept to your wife.... a big fat fail.&nbsp; I have reprogrammed Kinect&nbsp;settings multiple times.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; It will do everything by voice but turn on. &nbsp;</p>

<p>1: &nbsp;Push the console power button for 5-10 seconds until I turns off</p>
<p>2: &nbsp;Unplug the power cord from the console - (has to be from the console)</p>
<p>3: Wait 30 seconds</p>
<p>4: Plug back in and power up console with button</p>
<p>Should hopefully be working okay now. If not let us know :)</p>
<p>We should hopefully see this issue fixed when we start seeing updates rollout. Mine also does this from time to time :)</p>

<p>Exactly what Eggs just said.</p>
<p>I also notice that o have to be significantly closer to the Kinect for the "Xbox on" command to wake it up. Possibly by design. &nbsp;Although, I can practically whisper it at that point.</p>

<p>The initial setup you did when you got your xbox one is kind of important. You need to set your tv volume how it suggests along with other things for the mic to pick up what you say properly.</p>

<p>@adrenaline. No offense but &nbsp;I would suspect most have done an adequate to an insane amount of calibration and still it wont work. &nbsp;I'm not sure why some think if there setup works, then all else must have done something wrong on there end. Like myself,
 re-calibration is and has been done more times than I can even remember and the results yield no better each and every time. It's due time MS admits there is an issue, talk about it and tell us when there will be a fix for it. Frankly im getting tired of the
 teleprompter replies and the smoke and mirrors. This issue is real and its high time MS steps up and fixes it.</p>

<p>@Bobby, nope, in the middle of the Arizona desert.</p>
<p>Been through setup multiple times, on phone support w/ MS for 3 hours - will probably get the Kinect replaced but they don't cross-ship so trying full factory reset tonight before going without kinect for several weeks.</p>

    <title>Windows volume mixer resets to half volume with Lync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows volume mixer resets to half volume with Lync</h2>
                    
<p>This has been an ongoing annoyance for some time now, and I am writing to see if anyone has found a solution. &nbsp;Whenever I am on a Lync call, the volume is unusually low. &nbsp;After some time, I discovered that the Windows volume mixer (right-click on the speaker
 icon in the Windows task bar), that Lync calls always start off at about half volume, relative to the master volume. &nbsp;Regardless of how often I meticulously adjust the slider to match the master volume, the setting does not persist, and I need to adjust it
 every time I make or receive a Lync (now Skye Enterprise) call.</p>
<p>If anyone has a solution for this, I would appreciate it. &nbsp;I like the idea of the Windows volume mixer for adjusting relative volume between applications, but the UI could be improved to make it easy to set the application volume to match the master volume.</p>
<p>Thanks and cheers.</p>

<p>hi brent,</p>
<p>there is a setting in sound might cause the issue if there is any other im software or windows detects communications activity.<br />
here are the steps to check:<br />
1. in <strong>control panel</strong>, click <strong>sound</strong>.<br />
the easiest way to locate <strong>sound</strong> is to open <strong>control panel</strong> in windows, and then in the search box at the top of window, type sound.<br />
2. click <strong>communications</strong>.</p>

<p>please set to <strong>do nothing</strong> and check how it works, <br />
if the issue persists, i suggest you post the issue on our <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/office/en-us/home?category=lync%2cocs%2cofficecommunicationsserver&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Shutdown uses a fast-startup function that is similar to hibernate. &nbsp;I'd try a soft reset instead and see if it loads your touchpad driver and restores operation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click Start, choose Run option</li><li>Type <strong>shutdown /r</strong> and press OK (note the space after the word "shutdown")</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If it still doesn't work properly, I would recommend you go to the HP Envy driver page and re-apply the touchpad driver (even if it's the same driver you already have, re-applying it can fix and restore broken settings and registry keys).</p>

            Hi JB.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Things to try before contacting WhatsApp Support who are responsible for their app:
<br />
<br />1) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. 
<br />
<br />2) Adjust Screen Resolution to see if that clears it up, at Settings &gt; System &gt; Display.
<br />
<br />3) Also in same place check that Scaling is set to 100%.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hello Evaine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We still can't identify the possible causes of this desktop icon issues you're experiencing. To get a closer look at the root cause, we need additional information. Kindly answer the following questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you also experiencing the same issue when clicking any icons on the Start menu?</li><li>Does the issue still the same when using another mouse? How about using your mouse on another computer?</li><li>Is it also possible to send us a screenshot when the white square box appears after you double click the desktop icon?</li><li>Have you also tried performing a hardware troubleshooter? If you still haven't, just follow the steps below:</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Hardware Troubleshoot</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with hardware and devices. We would suggest that you run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with your mouse.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the inconvenience you are facing. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would like to inform you that this issue might have occurred due to corrupt network drivers.</span></span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to <strong>Uninstall and Reinstall the Network Card Drivers
</strong>and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Uninstall the Network Adapter Drivers</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press “<strong>Windows Logo” + “X”</strong> keys on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on “<strong>Device Manager</strong>” from that list.</span></p>
<p><span>c)&nbsp; Search for the Network Adapter from the device list, right click on it and then select “<strong>Uninstall”.
</strong>On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “<strong>Delete the driver software for this device</strong>” you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After the restart, please go ahead with the next steps to install the latest drivers and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Check the Windows updates for any latest driver updates.</span></p>
<p><span>Check in Windows updates if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) </span><span>Type “<strong>Updates</strong>” in the search bar and click on the icon “<strong>Windows Update”</strong> from the search result.</span></p>
<p><span>b) On the “Windows Update” window, click on the link: “Check for updates” from the left hand side of the window to receive a fresh list of updates.</span></p>
<p><span>c) If the updates are available, then install all the updates listed there.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the latest network adapter driver are not available then download and install it from the computer manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 3: </strong>Update Driver Software from the Manufacturer’s website:</span></p>
<p><span>Go to the Computer or Network Card manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 8.1 drivers available for the Network Card model and then install it by following the instructions given in the website. You can use the same Windows 8.1 Network
 card driver for Windows 10 tech preview.</span></p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to create a Windows 10 boot USB using XP&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 laptop is unable to load windows (due to an automatic update) and is in a failing continuous loop trying to repair. None of the recovery/ repair options are working. I have read that I may be able to repair windows (or at least enter it) &nbsp;using
 a boot CD/USB. I only have an old XP machine at my disposal. Microsoft has decided that their new boot disc is over that of a standard DVD, so I only have a USB option, and have managed to download to ISO file. The install.wim file is also over 4gb and so
 getting the file onto a FAT32 USB is also difficult. I have tried several programs (using my XP machine) to make a bootable USB but they all seem to fail (presumably because of the 4gb issue). Microsoft has a MediaCreationTool (1809) to do all of this for
 me but it doesn't seem to work on the XP system ('not a valid win32 application').&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know how to get around these issues or have a version that works on XP? I am able to copy the files from the ISO file but aren't sure how to them make the USB 'bootable' via a manual way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, Damien.</p>

            Hi DJ.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can download the latest media here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />Burn to DVD using ImgBurn or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1809 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>

<p>I do have a roku&nbsp; stick&nbsp; that can send video from the device to another, this includes a pc but never tried to use it as I will watch on the&nbsp;&nbsp;roku&nbsp; or pc.</p>
<p>Think the issue is we are not casting from a MS device to another MS device like xbox or other MS devices to cast to and from.</p>
<p>Other devices like amd or nvidia are not in the mix of things; just another way to try and get more users on the MS all in one system.</p>

<h2>            No sound after adding Windows 7 to IMac</h2>
                    I have Imac 24" with snowleopard and recently added Boot Camp Windows 7 Ultimate. Sound works great on Mac but no sound on Windows? I've tried everything and checked all settings. Drivers say they are&nbsp;up to date, but re-installed them just to be sure.
 Still no sound in windows but on Mac side works fine? Please let me know how to fix this.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Photos app in Windows 10 usually is able to distinguish the new photos and duplicates. This concern could be caused by incorrect settings or corrupted files. For us to clarify the concern, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you facing issue while trying to import photos from other devices as well?</li><li>Were there any recent changes made on your computer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>First, I would like to clarify that I am using the "Import Photos and Videos from this device" accessible from the File Explorer. Second, I upload all pictures and videos onto our Seagate External Drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your questions:</p>
<p>1) Yes, it has happened for my sister's iPhone 6 also</p>
<p>2) Your question is vague, since anything that you do on your computer is technically a change... lol ^^; I believe your context is whether if I made any changes to the upload settings, and the answer will be&nbsp;<strong>no.</strong></p>
<p>I look forward to your reply :^)</p>

            Hello, I have tried to uninstall the program and install it again does not work, I have also tried to reinstall Windows and installed always back to the same problem. The problem is that when you start it translated into Bulgarian
 but when I opened the program itself in submenus there gives me mixed partial transfer and partially eroglifi. With Windows 7 I had this problem once turned on Bulgarian translates the entire program. I tried it on another computer installed always and proved
 that there goes I do not know why he was again with Windows 10 may have a problem with fonts but I can not find and fix. If you can give me some advice I would be very grateful! Interestingly that makes it only on my laptop which is Lenovo Yoga 3.

<p>I have the same problem with another application.</p>
<p>I think the problem is with the tablets and the very high resolution.</p>
<p>my tablet is HP Elite X2 1012 G2 and I am using the original Windows provided by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Without Bulgarian settings everything shows question marks, but with the Bulgarian settings half of the text is in Cyrillic and the rest is absolutely same as displayed on the picture.</p>
<p>Is there a special Windows 10 Version for Tablets. Mine also have a PEN, which may be a special case when we are talking for fonts and the resolution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any guesses how to change or map/associate all the non-cyr fonts to a particular one wich is CYR enabled?</p>

<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the new windows click on the tab "<b>Recording</b>" and
<b>right click</b> in the window and click on <b>Show Disabled devices</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hello Imran: &nbsp;thank you for your suggestions.
<div><br />
<div>I've got this far: &nbsp;the Microsoft headset has two jacks. &nbsp;I can hear iTunes and everything else just fine with the audio in the rear port (pale green one).</div>
<div><br />
<div>The mic jack is in the red port, and...I can raise levels via the control panel.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But two problems:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1--I can hear nothing when I speak, despite there being levels.</div>
<div>2--The control panel will NOT allow me to make this particular unit my default.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So...does this mean that my headset cannot be identified by Vista?</div>
<div>If so, what headsets will it accept?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Or...do I have a driver issue?&nbsp;</div>
<div>If so, what driver would I need to get hold of?</div>
<div><br />
<div>That's as clear as I can make it. &nbsp;No one around me has a clue, and are stumped by this one.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again!</div>
<div><br />

                    <p>&nbsp;I've been desperately trying to update to latest Windows 10 as I keep getting warnings that this must be done by April 10.&nbsp; Initially I was repeatedly getting Error 0x8007005 when it's mostly installed.&nbsp; I tried various fixes that I found online,
 most of which did nothing, but the most recent one resulted in error 0x00000fd, when it's about 90% installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>How can I resolve these issues and get the Windows update installed?</p>
