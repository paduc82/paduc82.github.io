<h2>            Game Franchises that needs a rest</h2>
                    
<p>Here are the game franchises what I think should just be put to rest, they're suffering from either being milked every year and/or just getting downright boring now, here are some franchises that needs to just end:</p>
<p>1. Call of Duty = Reason: Being milked every year &amp; its getting really boring now, its just the same game every year but with a new story and a couple of tweaks to multiplayer, ever since MW2 came out, Call of Duty kept getting worse with new installments,
 Activision, please retire from CoD and make something else for a change.</p>
<p>2. Madden = Reason: Being milked every year, Madden may have been fun like 10-15 years ago, but nowadays, its pointless now, EA do us a favor and put Madden to rest, we're getting sick of it now.</p>
<p>3. Assassin's Creed = Reason: Milked every year and pretty much the same game but with new storylines, plus last few installments are not that good (Black Flag was decent though) so there's no telling if Syndicate is going to fix the series or not, but Ubisoft,
 give Assassin's Creed a rest, make another Prince of Persia game or whatever.</p>
<p>4. Halo = Reason: Getting boring now, Halo has had its day, its days have been over since Reach, now all of a sudden, Microsoft is slowly milking the franchise to death, Microsoft I know Halo makes a lot of money for you, but give it a rest, now since you
 have the money from Halo MCC (and Halo 5 when it comes out in October), use that money on a couple of new IPs.</p>
<p>5. Mario = Reason: Getting boring now, Mario has had its day, its days have been over since Sunshine, some of us are getting tired of Mario every year, Nintendo do us a favor and let Mario take a few years off, make something else for a change.</p>
<p>6. LEGO Series = Reason: Being milked, yes the Lego games are good and all, but how many Lego games do we really need before we're start getting burned out, TT Games, take a few years off from Lego and make something else for a change.</p>
<p>7. Sonic = Reason: Getting boring now, Sonic games used to be good, but now pretty much since Sega went 3rd party, Sonic has truly gone downhill from here and there, the last great Sonic game was Sonic Adventure 2, after that, the rest became mediocre to
 terrible to awful, Sonic 2006 &amp; Rise of Lyric really shows that Sonic days are over and had been over since the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube era, Sega just let Sonic retire, he had its time.</p>
<p>What do you guys think, what game franchises do you think should need a rest, share your thoughts on the comments below.</p>

<p>Is milk your favorite word? Btw, you don't have to buy any of those games. Mario is being put to rest soon. Imo, none of those franchises need to be put to rest. I still enjoy all those games except for Madden cus I don't play that. Why didn't you just put
 sport games in general? /facepalm </p>

<p>Hello Defy Lightning, I don't care for all of these games anymore so I don't buy them, but I will give Halo one last chance to redeem itself though, if Halo 5 is a flop as well, then no more Halo for me. As for Madden, yeah the only reason its still around
 anymore is because dude-bro gamers continue to buy them, as for me, I never purchased a Madden game in my life, but back then, me &amp; my brother used to play Madden 06 on the PS2, some decent fun times though.

<p>The Final Fantasy series. &nbsp;The remake of 7 is brilliant, but it's time for the series to be dead and buried. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Silent Hill - Unless konami can go back to their roots, they need to kill the series immediately.</p>
<p>I could go on, but that's enough for now.</p>

<p>Lego does not need a rest. DLC packs are a bit much, but there's still content they could announce and I'd get amped. We'll be picking up Lego Jurassic Park some time this year.</p>
<p>I also have to disagree w/ Assassin's Creed. &nbsp;They do need to wrap up the series or step back to a more distant time again, they're getting too close to current events. Would not want to see Kennedy as a target, just sayin'.</p>
<p>Madden/Annual Sports games in general: Stop saying it's a new game. Make a DLC update option, make a full version option for someone who doesn't have the current engine. Use the same engine for a few years, then revamp the whole thing. Look at Street Fighter
 4. Each new iteration has added things, that you can either update, or jump in fresh if you haven't got a SF4 title yet.</p>
<p>Halo can retire. 4 was horrible, wasn't fun to play, didn't feel like Halo. 5 looks like it's gonna strike me the same way.</p>
<p>Call of Doodie needs to retire: &nbsp;X cheated on Call of Duty threads, I got banned playing CoD &amp; didn't do anything! ugh.</p>
<p>Happy Wars can go to hell too. ;) </p>

<p>Call of Duty needs a break badly. &nbsp;I think Activision really needs to take a step back and reevaluate their franchise. &nbsp;However, i think we are in the minority as the game still sells millions.</p>
<p>Madden doesn't need a break, it needs competition. &nbsp;Madden was at its best when 2K was going head to head with them.</p>
<p>Halo is just fine. &nbsp;The Halo Franchise is taken care of wisely. &nbsp;Halo's face (Master Chief) has been seen 4 times (with an additional cameo) in 14 years. &nbsp;They release spin off's such as ODST, Reach, Halo Wars, Spartan Assault because the Halo Universe is
 huge with lore. &nbsp;But the games are diverse. &nbsp;RTS, and Top Down shooters are not everyones bag.</p>
<p>Ubisoft needs to slow down the Assassins Creed yearly releases. &nbsp;Ubisoft is flat out cash grabbing a lush franchise. &nbsp;Something that could have went on for 25+ years is nearly dead to me after 8. &nbsp;It is a tradegy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of all of the games i can think of.... Only Assassins Creed and Call of Duty need to just take 2 years off and let people miss their franchises.

<p>I think the sports games (Madden,nhl,ufc,nba,wwe) need to stay because most people who buy them do it for the updated roster plus other tweaks and updates. I think call of duty could use a break for a while then &nbsp;some back but not in the future. Assassins
 creed is getting old it should be shelved for &nbsp;at least one or two years. Also cut down the ad campaign by half. Halo is probably fine right now. After halo 5 maybe have a halo wars 2 in between halo 5 and 6. I agree on,sonic. Unless Nintendo buys it and reboots
 it, it's basically dead. As for mario I think it's doing good</p>

<h2>            Removing distracting key modifier popups when using a Wacom pen &#38; tablet on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just upgraded to Windows 10 and am a regular Wacom pen user. I managed to remove the circle that appeared as usual in previous versions of Windows, however with Windows 10 a new feature has appeared which shows on-screen attached to the cursor when I'm both
 using the pen as my cursor and holding a modifier key (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, and any combination, see picture), which get in the way of what I'm trying to do on-screen and are entirely un-necessary: I already know which modifiers I'm pressing! Other answers for
 Windows 8 said to disable the Tablet PC Input Service, but this has been removed from Windows 10, it doesn't appear in the Services list (at services.msc). Disabling Windows Ink from the Wacom settings fixes the popups but removes pressure sensitivity from
 the pen which is essential for working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please could someone supply a fix for this? It's extremely frustrating and is getting in the way of my work.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft&nbsp;Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand your query, kindly reply to the following question.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Did you make any modifications apart from upgrading to Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you try uninstalling and then re-installing&nbsp;drivers from the manufacturer's website. Make sure you run the setup file in compatibility mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also&nbsp;recommend you try&nbsp;post this query on Wacom support and ask for their assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please respond if&nbsp;you have further Windows related queries.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi Jesinta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nope, no modifications to Windows 10. This is something that is a feature to the OS that I'm trying to disable, not something that I've accidentally added and trying to remove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reinstalled the drivers and it hasn't removed the problem, because this is a feature of Windows 10, not something added by Wacom.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Windows has encountered a critical problem and will restart in one minute. Please save your work now.</h2>
                    <p>So I get this error popup and after a minute Windows restart, I log in and the same happens again and again. I've tried several suggested solutions I came across(some of which included to turn off auto restart, to clean boot, to scan for corrupted files
 and viruses either with cmd using sfc /scannow or Security Essentials or ESET online scan or Farbar Recovery Scan Tool) and AVs detected some short of viruses which I later deleted. I also used MBAM rootkit scan and I found a rootkit or two which I later deleted.<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, I've tried booting in safe mode with Internet Connection and I never got this error message. I've also tried the check disk option provided by Windows but everything was alright. Since I began to get this error message, almost all programs,after
 some time of usage, showed this similar message: "(program) has stopped working" leading to the program to close.
<br />
<br />
I've also tried to restore my computer to a previous restore point which did also not work.<br />
I've been trying to solve this problem for months now but I haven't accomplished anything.Any useful suggestions?</p>
<p>This is the error I get.</p>

<p>Although it won't hurt to run a check on your hard drive, the fact that the problem doesn't occur when starting in Safe Mode with Networking suggests that the hard drive is not the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given your report of malware infection, I was originally inclined to think that you had a more deeply buried malware problem, but the following thread suggests that the problem actually is a software conflict.&nbsp;
</p>
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-has-encountered-a-critical-problem-and/b9f4c989-0d3b-4f42-9cbf-1aaaa69059e3?tm=1528738876404">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-has-encountered-a-critical-problem-and/b9f4c989-0d3b-4f42-9cbf-1aaaa69059e3?tm=1528738876404</a>
<p>
</p><p>The posted solution essentially describes starting your computer in "Clean Boot" mode (see
<a href="http://support.logitech.com/en_us/article/228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.logitech.com/en_us/article/228</a>) and then systematically re-enabling services (or startup programs) until you determine which of the items that runs in a normal startup but not in "Clean Boot" is the cause of the problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You did mention that you had tried "clean boot," but you didn't describe what you did then.&nbsp; If you never get the error when you start in Safe Mode with Networking, you similarly should not get the error when you start with a "clean boot."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Merely starting the computer with a "clean boot" doesn't actually solve or fix anything:&nbsp; you have to iteratively re-enable things in order determine what is actually causing the problem.&nbsp; I've seen far too many people advise that you start the computer
 in a "clean boot," but then fail to explain what you need to do next.</p>

            It seems that that I didn't actually perform a clean boot in the right way. Now that I've done that, Windows only boot in safe mode, even if I press F8 and select normal boot. Is this what was supposed to happen?<br />

<p>When you use msconfig to change how the system starts, those settings will remain until you run msconfig again and select "Normal startup."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it actually say "Safe Mode" on the screen when the computer starts?&nbsp; If so, you need to make a change on the "Boot" tab of msconfig as explained below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Search screen, and press Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the "Boot" tab.&nbsp; UNcheck the box next to "Safe boot"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now select the "Services" tab.&nbsp; Check the box at the bottom left to "Hide all Microsoft services."&nbsp; Click the "Disable all" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now select the "General" tab.&nbsp; You should see the following, with the radio button next to "Selective startup" selected and the box next to "Load system services" unchecked.&nbsp; The other boxes under "Selective startup" will be checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c7496fc-a37d-4b74-8191-6e6990b37dc8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c7496fc-a37d-4b74-8191-6e6990b37dc8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, you can either click OK and restart or uncheck the box next to "Load startup items" and then click OK.&nbsp; If you uncheck "Load startup items," you'll see that the radio button next to "Diagnostic startup" gets selected instead of "Selective
 startup."&nbsp; This is the "clean boot" configuration.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The procedure described in that other thread left the startup items (programs) enabled and only disabled all non-Microsoft services (and then re-enabled 5 of those services at a time).&nbsp; You might as well try this.&nbsp; If you don't get the error message when
 non-Microsoft services are disabled but normal startup items are allowed to start, you won't have to go through the tedium of selectively re-enabling the startup items to see if it's one of them that's causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you're done -- or anytime you want to get back to a "normal" startup (that is, not starting in Safe Mode), run msconfig and select "Normal startup" on the General tab and then click OK.&nbsp; That should re-set everything for the next restart.</p>

            Once I check the original boot configuration box, at the boot section, the safe boot option is checked. If I uncheck the safe boot option, then the original boot configuration is unchecked as well. That may be the reason I can't boot in normal mode.<br />

<h2>            Very very high disk usage on Win 10 after upgrades</h2>
                    <p>I have recently had&nbsp; to&nbsp; rebuild my Dell Inspiron 17 5000 series running 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On rebuild I have only installed&nbsp; the following: Adobe DC, WinZip, MS Office, Skype, Firefox, WeChat for Web, Whatsapp for Web, Kakao Talk, Mcafee, VSO Light Image resizer, The Bat (Ritlabs) and Intel True Key. All of these used to work just fine prior to
 the rebuild. No issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now on every reboot it is watching paint dry as the disk usage stays all the way up to 100% for at least 20/25 minutes. The CPU and Memory also stay very high between 50-75 %. This is not&nbsp; letting me work and most importantly is not letting me install my
 email client (The Bat - RIT Labs) which is mission critical for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read most of the blogs - have rebuilt my laptop with a loss of another 4-5 days and am getting nowhere. Can somebody help urgently please. Thanks.</p>
<p>

            Hi Terry.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If the Recovery partition containing the bootable repair files for Windows 10 is in the way then you cannot extend C into deleted D's space without also deleting Recovery partition.  If you do that, though, you'll need to have a Recovery drive or bootable Installation media to do repairs since the onboard repair tools will not be available.  
<br />
<br />If you reinstall Windows, properly booting the media as a UEFI device if offered, deleting all partitions down to Unallocated Space, then choose to create new partitions and specify the full drive for C, it will create the same service partitions but place them out of the way of C since you set it's size to begin with.    If you decide to do this then here is the tutorial to Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hey ChangingRaven,
<br />
<br />That's quite unfortunate, but hopefully I will be able to help you with this. Can you try these steps?
<br />
<br />- Go to Device Manager (right-click the Start button and choose Device Manager from the menu).
<br />- Expand the Mice and other pointing devices category.
<br />- Right-click on the ASUS Support Device then click Update driver.
<br />- Click on Search automatically for updated driver software.
<br />It should perform an update, and you can restart your PC when prompted.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this solves it, or if not, I can venture on finding solutions. Someone else in the same forum post recommended that you uninstall the driver (uninstall it twice if you have to), then reboot, OR you could click the computer icon with the magnifying glass on the toolbar on the top of the window to check for hardware changes each time. Wishing you luck here.
<br />

</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon checking on the Skype account associated with your Community profile, it is showing that your Skype Number expired last August 2018.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following Skype's terms, once a Skype Number expires, it will be reserved for 180 days to the same account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If however, it is not reactivated within this timeframe, the specific Skype Number will be returned to the pool and be available for others to purchase. With this being said, we cannot guarantee that you'd still be able to repurchase the same Skype Number.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards, </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 No Access To All Fix Repair and Restore Options</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have an issue with my HP laptop running windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it starts up, it goes straight to "Choose A Keyboard Layout" screen, when i hit enter, it goes to a screen containing "Troubleshoot" , "Turn Off PC".</p>
<p>When I hit the troubleshoot, I get the "Recovery Manager" and&nbsp; "Advanced Options" page. If i click on Recovery Manager, none of the options work after trying them. In the Advanced Options, i have tried system restore, start up repair, go back to previous
 version, start up repair etc..none of the options work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start Up Repair</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running this gives message. Start Up Couldn't&nbsp; repair your pc , so either shut down or back to advanced options which takes me to the first screen, the trouble shoot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running System Restore </p>
<p>
</p><p>Message - To use system restore, you must specify which windows installation, i close that and back to the troubleshoot page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back to previous version gives message - we ran into a problem and won't be able to take you back to the previous version of windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried all variations to start in safe mode but to no avail. I also tried to reinstall by booting from disk but even that was unsuccessful because it states i already have the version of windows installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't want to lose important files on this laptop and just want to get it back up and running again.</p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />I recommend you try the below troubleshooting article from Microsoft:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />You'll need to try one of two things, either restoring to a previous system restore point, or repairing Windows using a bootable USB drive.
<br />You'll need to use another PC to create a bootable USB drive by typing "create recovery drive" into Start, or by following the steps in the below link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/</a>...
<br />
<br />The USB drive needs to be empty and have at least 8GB storage space. Once you've created to bootable media, you can plug it into the computer that won't boot and set your startup boot options to USB. It'll load up the Windows Recovery Environment, and from there you can repair Windows. It should fix the error.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

<p>Hi Preyash,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yes I've tried that option but it won't allow me to install as the option i have with those 3 options you put forward is the upgrade. I can't upgrade because i have the same windows 10 version already installed..so i'm pretty much stuck
 with this option unless i do a complete reinstall which is something that i need to avoid as to not lose years worth of important docs..&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have tried those options too but even this way gives me same results..still no access to any of the repair options. Its like certain areas of the operating system is being prevented from executing. I think the only regrettable option
 here is a complete reinstall..</p>

                    <p>I had to reinstall XP on Insignia D400a after the install I needed to install drivers but had to leave, I shut down the computer. I returned later and started up the computer but it won't show anything on the screen. Maybe video drivers missing? I can here
 the computer running and booting up, How I do install video drivers without a being able to see anything on the screen.</p>
<p>Restarted computer pressed F-8 then it went to the safe mode screen (it came on). I scrolled up to the safe mode selection and pressed entered. It starts to work and the it shuts off and reboots. I tried different selections but the same thing happens.
</p>
<p>When I start up in safe mode the Insignia logo comes on (looks good) then the XP start up comes on (looks good) then it goes to the blank screen. Its like I'm waiting for the desktop icons to come on kinda of dark blueish.</p>

<p><span>The issue will occur when the Skype user’s account isn’t associated with a Microsoft ID.</span></p>

<h2>            How do I remove duplicate Icons in the control panel on Windows 7</h2>
                    Nvidia has two Icons in my Control Panel on my Windows 7 Professional. They both do the same thing, taking me to their control panel. No big deal but it's annoying. I seldom even use this application and they have stuck two of their links here.

            <p>Hi <strong>GregToth</strong>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have 2 Nvidia drivers listed in the list of installed programs in control panel?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to uninstall the Nvidia Driver from the Programs, in Control Panel. And check if both the icons are removed or not. If yes, then try to install&nbsp;the latest Nvidia Driver from the manufacturer website.
</p>

            It would be interesting to know what your system make and model is and what your XP version and Service Pack is and a few other things, but I guess it is just a fantasy of mine that the Microsoft Answers forum would actually prompt for such things as fundamental
 system information when a new question is created. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Issues would be resolved so much faster and with less trial and error if they would listen to me.<br />
<br />
If you mean are seeing message like this:<br />
<br />
No Disk, Exception Processing Message c0000013 Parameters 75b6bf7c 475b6bf7c 75b6bf7c<br />
<br />
Some folks think it may have to do with not using the Safely Remove Hardware feature (and that may be), but I never use Safely Remove Hardware with any external USB devices and I do not have this message.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp; you if you can't figure it out and other things are working okay, you can tell XP to just not show you that message when there is no reason.<br />
<br />
Until you can determine what the "real" problem is with your hardware, you can disable the pop up message by making a registry adjustment.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Before making registry changes, backup your registry with this popular free and easy to use tool:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a><br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
regedit<br />
<br />
Click OK to open the registry editor and navigate to the following key:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Windows<br />
<br />
On the right hand pane, check the value of the ErrorMode parameter. <br />
<br />
If the ErrorMode parameter is set to 0, double click ErrorMode and change the value to 2 (2 = disabled).<br />
<br />
Click OK to save the changes, then click File, Exit to close the registry editor.<br />
<br />
Reboot your system and check things now.<br />
<br />
Setting the ErrorMode parameter to 2 stops the pop up message but will still log any hard errors to the Event Viewer log.<br />
<br />

            <p>I just started getting this problem with Halo5. I was playing online co-op with a friend... took a break, went back an hour later and this happened. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling,,, same problem. I've removed and re-added my account... reset xbox to factory defaults, etc. All my other games still work fine, just Halo5 won't work. Crazy thing is, I can't even rebuy it if I wanted to because it shows I already own it.</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            Is hybrid sleep function on Windows 10 similar to Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Hybrid sleep in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello, I had a doubt about Windows 10:</p>
<p>Basically I have a lot of Apps installed in Windows 8.1 on my Windows 8.1 Bay trail Tablet.</p>
<p>I wanted to know if all the apps that function normally under hybrid sleep in Windows 8.1 will work normally under Windows 10.</p>
<p>Right now, if I out my tablet to sleep and log in after some time, I get updated cricket scores, Live mail updates, alarms, It can also tell me actively the Wifi state(Unlike my Windows 10 PC, which just tells me the last Wifi State before I log in).</p>
<p>Could you please help me out?</p>
<p>I basically want to know if these Windows store apps will work the same in WIndows 10 and also, whether it just the store apps that work in hybrid sleep or all of them.</p>
<p>So, basically, can I use other apps in Windows 10`s Hybrid sleep mode.</p>
<p>I searched on the web for results pertaining to my issue, but just found that sleep in Windows 10 would mostly work like in Windows 8.1, but nothing much else.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Aditya,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hybrid sleep is designed primarily for desktop computers. Hybrid sleep is a combination of sleep and hibernate. Hybrid sleep saved any open documents and programs in memory and on the hard disk,
 and puts the computer into a low-power state so that you can quickly resume your work. Doing so, if a power failure occurs, Windows can restore your work from the hard disk. Hybrid sleep is typically turned on by default on desktop and off on laptops.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The function and performance of power options is same in both Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 operating system. The updates and notification you receive on logging in into the tablet from hibernate
 sleep mode is displayed due to the settings enabled on the device.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to <strong>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write to us for further assistance on hibernate sleep query in Windows 10, we will be happy to help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <strong>8007000D</strong> - Error_invalid_data.&nbsp; Corruption in the SoftwareDistribution folder.&nbsp; Please rename
<br />
%windir%/Softwaredistribution folder.<br />
<br />
This is how you do it in Vista so I'm assuming it's the same in Windows 7 (make sure you reboot though as the folder cannot be recreated properly without a reboot).<br />
<br />
<strong>How to rename the Software</strong><span><strong>D</strong></span><strong>istribution folder in Vista -</strong>
<p>1. Stop the Windows Update service (make sure you are logged on as an Administrator)<br />
<br />
Start button || Control Panel ||System and Maintenance ||Administrative Tools<br />
Double-click Services <br />
(Provide the Administrator password or confirmation if prompted to do so.)<br />
Right-click the Windows Update service and click Stop.<br />
<br />
2. Click Start, type %windir% in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
Locate and rename the SoftwareDistribution folder. <br />
<br />
3. Start the Windows Update service <br />
<br />
Start button || Control Panel ||System and Maintenance ||Administrative Tools<br />
Double-click Services <br />
(Provide the Administrator password or confirmation if prompted to do so.)<br />
Right-click the Windows Update service and click Start.<br />
<br />
This procedure will erase your history on the Windows Update Site. Not important.<br />
You can always check what updates have been installed easily enough.</p>

    <title>Issues with Backup Windows 10 on external hard drive. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issues with Backup Windows 10 on external hard drive.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 10 Backup</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our computer forced us to download Windows 10. Since then I cannot perform a backup. It says our old backup drive was incompatible and it would have to be erased and started over. I did not do that in case there was a problem/crash- didn't want to lose our
 current backup data without any guarantees. So we bought a brand new backup drive. I plugged it in today and went through the backup process from the main menu to setting up a backup. It automatically shut down multiple times. It also 'worked?' at one point
 and said 'running backup' for 4 hours, but never showed any progress bar or that the storage space on the bu drive was changing. I don't think it was doing anything. Many people have had this problem on the microsoft community site and I'm frustrated that
 from the forum you have to be a flipping computer programer to solve the issue. I also called customer service/support and talked to someone that couldn't help me 'unless it was a problem with Windows 10'. It IS a problem with Windows 10, it worked before
 we upgraded to it. Anyhow, the technician was not helpful and redirected me to the website. Common Microsoft. This is obviously a problem on your side and I wish you'd fix it.&nbsp;<br />
