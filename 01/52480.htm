<h2>            surface dock ethernet speed</h2>
                    I have a surface pro 4, 8/256. I pay for 200mps internet. If I connect the ethernet to the dock I get about 40. If use wifi I get 200. The Spectrum technician came yesterday and gave me all new equipment but it didn't help. He said it was the dock slowing
 the spee. Is this true? Or is there a fix?&nbsp;

<p>Hello Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us help you check the credibility of your Surface Dock. We need to perform several steps to resolve the slow internet connection on your Surface Pro 4 when hard wired to the Surface Dock. We recommend that you download and run the
<strong><a href="https://aka.ms/surfacerepair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong> then restart the Surface was done. After restarting, kindly update the Surface Dock&nbsp;using the
<em><strong>Surface Dock Updater tool</strong></em> to ensure the Dock has the latest firmware available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how to get the Surface Dock Updater tool</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=46703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Surface Tools for IT</a></strong>.<br />
&nbsp;
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<div style="margin-left: -24px">
<div>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">You don't need to download the entire software package. When you select&nbsp;</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Download</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">, select the Surface Dock updater by itself.</span></p>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<p>Select&nbsp;<span>Download</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under&nbsp;<span>Choose the down load&nbsp;</span><span>you&nbsp;</span><span>want</span>, select Surface_Dock_Updater_v2.7.136.0.msi (or later).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select&nbsp;<span>Next</span>&nbsp;and follow the rest of the instructions to install the tool.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Now that you’ve installed it, you can use the Surface Dock Updater tool to update your Surface Dock. Connect your Surface Dock to your Surface, open the tool, and select&nbsp;</span><span>Start</span><span>.
 Then follow the onscreen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Please note that you’ll be asked to disconnect and reconnect your Surface Dock during the update. After you’ve disconnected the Surface Dock, it’ll need to stay powered on for at least 3 minutes for the update to install. The LED light on the Ethernet
 port of the Dock will blink while the update is happening. Wait until it stops blinking before you unplug your Surface Dock from its power.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the Surface Dock didn’t update with the Updater tool, try these same steps with another Surface device running Windows 10 Pro. Or, you can get your Surface Dock updated free of charge at a&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/answer-desk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft
 Store near you</a></strong><span>.</span></p>

            I, too, have this same issue.&nbsp; Wired ethernet and cannot get more than about 350 mbit.&nbsp; Previously it has worked just fine with symmetrical speeds of about 900mbit. A recent update has svrewed something up. I have updated dock and all drivers.&nbsp; No change.&nbsp;
 My desktop plugged into same switch sees full speed.&nbsp; I have switched ports on switch, connected directly to ATT router and same results of 350 mbit every time.&nbsp; Appears to be a Surface Pro 4 firmware issue with the Marvell driver?

<p>I have the same issue with my Surface Book connected to the docking station. With WFI the network speed is about 200mbs. With wired internet the speed drops to 60 mbs while I have a 500 mbs internet connection.</p>
<p>When is look at the properties of the the ethernet adapter is says its a 1 Gbs connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Surface Diagnostic Analyzer and updated the firmware vof the docking station. No result. Wired speed stays low.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried another laptop on the same cable and this gave a sped of 500 mbs. So the cables are ok.</p>

<p>I was able to determine (as did Microsoft) that my dock became defective.&nbsp; Very strange occurrence.&nbsp; I started off going to the Microsoft Store to get assistance, but they told me to pound sand.&nbsp; Completely worthless and gave me little hope of resolution.&nbsp;
 I purchased my dock on Amazon.&nbsp; I was within the 1 year limited warranty period and even had a copy of my receipt.&nbsp; &nbsp;I figured I would try to call the 800 Microsoft number and see if they could help me.&nbsp; After the fairly lengthy calls (yes, many calls over
 several days and yes my awesome support agent called me back) and running all the diagnostics/updates (that I had already done and determined the issue was the dock) the EXTREMELY nice young lady at Microsoft support told me they would be replacing my dock
 free of charge.&nbsp; During the testing we did notice that the USB was also acting up and was likely related.&nbsp; Not only was the dock's ethernet port only running at about 300-350mbps, but I was also getting random "USB Device Not Recognized" errors with no USB
 devices plugged into my dock or Surface Pro.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very happy to report that I did indeed get a brand new dock 2-day aired to me and all the mysterious errors are no longer present.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even received a follow-up phone call from my support agent to ask how everything was working.&nbsp; She went above and beyond.&nbsp; She was in Nicaragua and helped me plan a trip there with some must-see places to visit for my wife and I.&nbsp; I hope others have this
 great experience with their phone support.&nbsp; It is a lost art.&nbsp;</p>

<p>WOW - that is great news - especially since I have changed out everything but the dock itself to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your dock issues sound spot-on to what mine are. I will call MS and see what they say about replacing the dock.</p>

<h2>            line on screen</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
Wonder how many defective screens out there for surface.&nbsp; We have a surface here, bought from a local windows store and opened box two days ago and now I notice a thin vertical malfunctioned line about 2 inches long along the left top edge of the screen.&nbsp; It
 became noticeably clear when it's against a blue background like the desktop.&nbsp; I said it's malfunction because it looks like a dotted line with color offset.&nbsp; What puzzle me is if the surface can be replaced, if there will be time limited?!<br />

<p>The Nov 13, 2012 firmware update is already installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just look at the back closely, I notice that the top cover to access the compartment is not properly sealed.&nbsp; water and moisture can sip into the PCB easily....</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 taking 2&#43; hours to get past &#34;...Please Wait&#34; screen at startup</h2>
                    <p>This is a problem I've had in the past few weeks with Windows 8.1. Basically if I have to restart the computer then just as the title says, it'll get to "...Please Wait" and will stay there for a few hours - literally a few hours - &nbsp;before I can get past
 that and be able to log in. I've looked on a few forums before and people who have had similar problems said they disabled SkyDrive (which I'm aware is now OneDrive) and their computers worked fine after that. I turned off every option of OneDrive that I could,
 and figured before my computer was temporarily bricked for a a few more hours I would ask on here and see if anybody can offer any suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few things I've seen Microsoft staff ask and would answer ahead of time:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer has no viruses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is about 3 months old and was bought at Best Buy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only new hardware I've installed is a new video card, which I've confirmed is working fine and there should be no conflicts with the OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running a clean boot does nothing, and system restore does nothing. In fact, one of the previous Optional Updates released in the past couple months would crash my OS every time I installed it, and I'd be forced to do a system restore after installing every
 time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>At this point I'm out of ideas, and I'm pretty close to downgrading to Windows 7 just so that I can have something working normally if I can't get this fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help offered.</p>
<p>

<p>Where is the delay, in the shutdown or in the boot?&nbsp; You probably could deduce that much I think from the standard Event log.&nbsp; Otherwise this sounds like a good case for using&nbsp; WPRUI for its Performance scenarios tracing.&nbsp; I think I have actually seen better
 tutorials on how to use xbootmgr for xperf but supposedly for W8 we are supposed to be using WPR instead.</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The delay's in the boot, it seems to shut down without any problems. I'll check out the link and do some research as I'm not familiar with WPR or xbootmgr.</p>

<h2>            Microphone - Realtek High Definition Audio not working since last major windows update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>So my laptop's (Asus G551J) microphone stopped working since the last windows update.</p>
<p>Skype tells me it cannot access my soundcard, however I can hear sound but only the microphone doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the trouble shooter - didn't fix it</p>
<p>I updated the driver from the manufacturer's site - didn't fix it</p>
<p>I updated the driver from windows device manager - didn't fix it</p>
<p>I uninstalled the device and reinstalled it - didn't fix it</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows is fully updated, the device is enabled yet the issue still persists even after all the above attempts to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get my laptop's mic working again?</p>

    <title>Failed to boot from Windows 7 DVD, error 0xc00000e9 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Failed to boot from Windows 7 DVD, error 0xc00000e9</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I tried formatting my laptop and installing Windows 7 by using a DVD which I once created by burning the official
<a href="http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-24395.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 iso</a> http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-24395.iso, but it doesn't boot and hangs in between the 'Windows in loading files' process. I tried another DVD that was created at
 the same time as the previous one, but that didn't worked either. I can't understand the reason behind it, because everything worked fine after I created an iso image of the same DVD and burned it on a USB Flash Drive. I used the
<strong>Windows USB DVD Download Tool</strong> to burn both the DVDs and the USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried booting through a System Repair Disc to check out if something is wrong with the optical drive, but everything worked fine again, and the 'Windows is loading files' went flawlessly. So I don't think anything is wrong with the optical drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if the DVDs I created are of any use at all if I can't use them when needed. I don't know what I'd have done if it had been a case of an emergency. And I can't keep an 8GB flash drive reserved for that purpose. So I wanted to know how I can
 fix this. Should I use some other disc burner software like ImgBurn or Nero in place of the Windows USB DVD Download Tool?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. The isos were not tweaked or anything, and both the DVDs were very clean and scratch free, and worked fine when I created its iso image. Tried all three of them (2 DVDs and 1 USB) on another laptop, the situation remains the same.</p>

<p><strong>I have a Dell Refurbished 1545 Laptop with Windows 7. &nbsp;I have had no issues until today. &nbsp;I logged onto my computer, and tried to open an internet window. &nbsp;No window would open, so I figured I should restart the computer. &nbsp;I tried to restart, and
 a screen popped up saying that there was a program running that prevented the computer from restarting. &nbsp;I canceled the restart, and tried again. &nbsp;This time, the screen popped up for a second, and then the computer switched to the Logging Off screen. &nbsp;It has
 been stuck on said screen for over and hour now. &nbsp;I have tried hibernating the computer and turning it back on (holding the power button for around 5 seconds), but when I do so it brings me right back to the logging off screen! &nbsp;What should I do?&nbsp;</strong></p>

                    <p>I have an ASUS X202E that has been working perfectly fine until yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First issue: BING opens in all of my web browsers when I open a new tab. I have tried the UNINSTALL option, but there is no bing option there. Tried a few different ideas people gave online, but nothing has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second issue: I am trying to reset my device, however it tells me "DRIVE PARTITION REQUIRED." I would like to know how do I do this and will it restore my computer back to how it was when I took it out of the box.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third issue: I am unable to download any program now, whether it be java or anything!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help - I need my netbook for school and am a bit stuck if I cannot use it!</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How exactly have you uninstalled BING from the computer? </p>
<p>2. What happens when you download any program? </p>
<p>3. Are you aware of making any changes to the computer prior to the issue? </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try to disable BING from the manage add-ons section to see if that helps. You can try this using Internet Explorer, follow the steps provided here.
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That means that the pre-loaded Asus recovery drive partition is missing. It is likely that you might have repartitioned the drive when you upgraded or reinstalled operating system. You'll need to contact Asus to get a replacement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best thing I would suggest you is that you can try to restore the computer to an earlier point when it worked fine, this would resolve all the issues.
</p>
<p><br />
<strong><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>To restore your PC to an earlier point in time</span></span></strong></p>
<ol>

<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>Tap or click <span><strong>Open System Restore</strong></span>, and then follow the instructions.

    <title>2 BSOD screens and multiple game crashes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vynax  say:</h3>
<h2>            2 BSOD screens and multiple game crashes</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer started to encounter BSOD and game crashing to desktop a few days ago. BSOD could occur when I browsed on chrome or when playing games such as Starcraft 2 or Rainbow Six Siege. I decided to reset my PC - twice in fact. First time I saved my&nbsp;personal
 data, but the system kept crashing, so I decided to wipe everything off for a fresh start but to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I proceeded to reinstall the games and the games still crashed to desktop with occasional BSODs. Specific BSOD errors include:</p>
<p>- IQRL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</p>
<p>- Memory Management&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>sfc/scannow</p>
<p>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image/ RestoreHealth</p>
<p>
</p><p>sfc/scannow revealed data corruption at first, but after fixing it through&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-10-bug-of-setting-the-zh-hk-as-the-primary/5182a7da-e922-481f-94fb-f2f4b27fe7e0, no issues were shown
 during the scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated both my graphics card driver and ethernet driver on device manager as well. None seemed to have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would gladly appreciate any help on this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Corrupted system files and hardware running beyond its specification limits are two of the possible reasons why blue screen errors occur. We would like to verify, what changes were made on your device prior to the issue?
</span><span>Was Windows upgraded/updated recently?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest&nbsp;<span>performing a clean install.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>This is like you're reinstalling your copy of Windows.<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>A clean install will delete all of your saved data and installed apps.<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Important:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Back up your personal data and files to an external hard drive, USB thumb drive, or cloud location (such as OneDrive) before you begin any reinstall of Windows 10.</span></p>

<p>Hello Kris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. I run windows update pretty regularly but I was away from my desktop for two weeks and it started crashing only once I started using it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst performing the clean install during the language selection stage, I encountered a BSOD regarding IQRL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL. The installation continued after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the event viewer afterwards and was presented with multiple errors and warnings post installation. Sources include Service Control Manager, Device SetupManager, DistributedCOM, EventLog, AppModel-Runtime, SMBWitnessClient, BugCheck, EnhancedStorage-EhStorTcgDrv,
 and ESENT. Based on the date and time, they occurred&nbsp;during the windows installation stage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I be concerned? Would this be a hardware issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Thanks for the additional details about your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, how did you perform the clean installation? Did you download the media creation tool from this
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>? Since the error occur during the process of clean installation, there is a possibility that there are files that got corrupted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend performing clean install again. If the same thing happen again, there is a high probability that this issue is related with your device hardware.
<span>In this case, we suggest contacting your device manufacturer and check if they can perform a hardware diagnostics.</span></p>

                    Okay so I'm on my phone right now and this problem happened yesterday night, I have a Lenovo black desktop that was recently bought a few months and at first before the problem occurred my keyboard smelled like burnt oranges and I tried getting rid of

            Freddie, thanks for confirming that the forums software is buggy as suspected.  <br /><br />You should be able to use Partition Wizard extend function to extend Y into C by 500 megabytes.  That tool is exceptional because it allows extending into any partition or space whether it is adjacent or not.<br /><br />Using merely mortal software shrink c by 500mb from the front, then Resize Y into it<br /><br />It's always safer to use a bootable media for these operations.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the detailed update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. This article describes how to
<span>run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span> to scan your system files and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows 8.1. If a Windows Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For
 example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Run the System File Checker (SFC) scan. Follow these steps:<br />
<strong>a. </strong>In the charms search box, type cmd<br />
<strong>b</strong>. Right click on command prompt and select run as administrator.<br />
<strong>c.</strong> Type <strong>sfc /scannow </strong>and then press ENTER: </span>

            <p>Have done the sfc/scannow thing but didn't help. The Clean Boot thing is going to be time consuming, especially since I am soon going to be in travel.</p>
<p>I did do the Selective Startup which again proved of no worth. Unless someone has got something else or a bit simpler, I'll have to do a call to Microsoft and have them come aboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd do a Refresh, but I'm told this will wipe out Outlook 2013 which I cannot do right as of yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Try to refine this symptom description because there are some possibilities that could be overlooked by omitting details about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; In particular please hover your pointer over the Taskbar icon to see if it has a thumbnail.&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, it would mean that the
 app was not closed but minimized or open somewhere off screen.&nbsp; A related test would be to right-click the Taskbar icon and tell us whether it was pinned or unpinned.</p>

            <p>Thanks guys for the replies. Done the things with the Antispyware etc. No changes. When the App goes down to the Taskbar, it is empty. There is nothing in it. Hovering the mouse (Logitech Mouse of course) over it shows nothing - no x either.</p>
<p>If I click on that little critter, it opens and closes back to the Taskbar again.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I am having the exact same problem. Its very annoying because I have Windows 8.1 on both my laptop and my desktop but only desktop is having this problem. This is what I get when I run the app troubleshooter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Store cache may be damaged - Not fixed</p>
<p>Windows Store configuration may be damaged - Detected</p>
<p>Display adapter drivers might be out-of-date - Detected</p>
<p>
</p><p>My display adapter is a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 and its driver is up to date. I have also run the System File Checker utility but it did not help. Then I followed the exact steps for a clean boot and still no luck.</p>
<p>What did Microsoft Support have you do to resolve this problem?</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 slim wont pick up any router signals. </h2>
                    
<p>I have been playing on xbox live all day when suddenly I lose connection. So I say ok I'll just connect to my second router. Well when I clicked search for router nothing came up. It has been doing this for an hour. I have no idea how to fix it and I have
 already tried everything from customer support for trouble shooting and so forth. Does anyone have any idea how to reset the internal wifi of the xbox 360 slim??? thats the only other thing I can think of doing.</p>

<p>yes i have tried all that. I have reset both routers, both motems, set up settings in 5 different ways, unplugged my xbox... I have done everything short of hardline it in to the router because I am too far way for a 5 foot cord to connect to the router.
 so I would have to haul a tv and my xbox into another room just to try and see if a hard line would help.

<p>Ok all of the sudden it is picking up signals again from all over the neighborhood. I don't know what was wrong but some how my xbox fixed its' self. And Taidara I checked my gamer profile and it was fine and had already cleared system cache. All that happened
 is I was playing minecraft while in a private chat when suddenly I lost connection to xbox live. This is nothing new to me because I know how unreliable the internet is in my house however my neighbors have a stronger signal and bandwidth. So when I lost connection
 I automatically left the game I was playing went to network settings and I looked at the wireless network I was attatched to which showed no bars at all. So I disconnected and hit scan for networks. It just kept poping up with no networks detected and usually
 there are atleast 5 that show up in my area. So i turned off my xbox and unplugged it, reset both routers and motems. came back and turned my xbox back on then went back to network settings and my Xbox360s still was not detecting any routers in my area...
 No error mesages, no trouble shoot suggestions, no nothing. so I tried to manually put in the name and password of the network and still nothing happened. This problem consistantly occures with my xbox, usually for 7 hours at least once a month. I know its
 not the routers or the motems because I had my computer less than 3 feet away from my xbox still able to log into youtube and play videos when the xbox no longer would pick up signal. And when I plugged the ethernet cord into my xbox it still did not detect
 it. It was like my xbox just decided for itself that I was not allowed to use xbox live. All the items in the link you posted that needed to be on or off I had already checked and set correctly from last month when this occured and I checked them again tonight
 and they were still set correctly. I know it's not the router or internet provider because I would have picked up several other routers if it wasn't the xbox360s wifi.

Here is a tool that removes all versions of .NET framwork. I just tried it and it worked perfectly. He does say that this should only be used as a last resort though. I didnt bother to read why :)<br />

    <title>An UWP app have high-contrast taskbar icon but Windows is not in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronny jordansen  say:</h3>
<h2>            An UWP app have high-contrast taskbar icon but Windows is not in high-contrast mode</h2>
                    <p>After installing Windows 10 version 1709 Fall Creators Update, the taskbar icon for Skype for Windows 10 changed to high-contrast mode even though Windows 10 is not in high-contrast mode.<br />
</p>
<p>The version of Skype for Windows 10 is&nbsp;12.8.487.0.<br />
</p>
<p>I have tried to uninstall Skype, reboot my computer, and install Skype again. But the taskbar icon is still in high-contrast mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to enable and then disable high-contrast mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried other UWP apps like Facebook and Netflix, and they have the colored taskbar icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tested the classic version of Skype, version 7.40, and the taskbar icon is the correct blue one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am clueless to what to try next now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sidenote: I have already asked this question in the Skype for Windows 10 section. And after the usual reboot and reinstall suggestions, I was told to contact Windows technical support which landed me here.&nbsp;<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can't use a password to protect files and folders in Windows. </span>
</p>
<p><span>There are other ways to protect your files and folders in Windows. You can encrypt your files using Encrypting File System (EFS), manually specify who can access the folders or files by setting permissions, or hide them. Choose your method based on
 how secure the folders or files need to be. Encrypting is the most secure, while hiding the folders is the least secure.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
For more information about EFS, refer:</span></p>
<p><span>What is Encrypting File System (EFS)?</span></p>

<h2>            Skype- Group video call - recording</h2>
                    I have a Skype account, I want to ask some questions about some of its services and in my country your company does not even have even phone support !!!!!!<br />
&nbsp;I'm going to take part in a training program and I want to ask and get answers to the following questions.<br />
1) Skype gives the ability to record and store a multi-person chat; And if so, how does this happen?<br />
2) Where do I find the saved files and how do I start to record such a conversation? That is, what actions will I take and which keys should I press to start recording and have the desired effect?<br />
3) If this feature is available after the last application, is there a time limit for recording the video or not?<br />
4) Will the other participants in the conversation know that the conversation is recorded by a member of the conversation or not?<br />
5) And if, finally, this is not possible through your application, is there a safe and valid application that meets the above requirements and which you could recommend?<br />
<br />
I will expect your answer.<br />
