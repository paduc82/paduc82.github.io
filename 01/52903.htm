<h2>            No sound on flash player over the browsers</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Hello there, <br />
I have no sound on flash player over the browsers. The sound works perfectly fine when I am playing any movies or mp3 with any players such as real player, Windows media player, VLC, core player and so on. I had the latest version of flash player which was
 working just fine in all browsers before.<br />
<br />
I was doing some housekeeping on my laptop and I might have deleted some registries or something by mistake, not 100% sure though.
<br />
<br />
same day I noticed I had problem hearing youtube while the video part is playing just fine and the microphone settings of the flash player is showing activities.<br />
<br />
I tries tons of things such as uninstalling - reinstalling different versions of flash players. uninstalling -reinstalling my audio driver then codec packs, adding things to the registry which comes with different names like youtubefix.reg or missing.reg, trying
 different browsers, and unfortunately so far none of them worked for me.<br />
<br />
One thing weird I have noticed (and I'd like someone explain it to me) is that as soon as I activated the guest user on my laptop and I logged in as the guest user, I was able to hear voice over the flash. I am assuming that there is nothing wrong with the
 flash player. So I thought maybe I should just create another user account and transfer my file and documents to that user account. I got back to work and I did create a new USER as an Admin and logged in to try it before transferring my folders and documents.
 Here is the freaky part, there was no voice agian via the flash player again. I tried again and again by logging off and in back to different user accounts, non of them was working except for the GUEST one.<br />
I know Guest user is an standard user. so I made a new standard user and to my surprise , when logged in, it worked again.<br />
I thought lets experience this again, differently. I downgraded one of my new Admin users to a Standard one and upgraded one of the newly created Standard USER to have the Admin power.<br />
I then logged in to each of them, and noticed that I have voice via flash player when logging as of a Standard user and shockingly no voice when logging in with an Admin USER account.<br />
I tried it again a few times with downgrade or upgrading the type of users and all was the same :
<strong>no voice via flash player when logging in as an Admin USER.</strong><br />
<br />
I know I can fix this by reinstalling the windows again, but I hope some one with insight to user profiles and registry in vista can help me find a quicker way to fix.<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated.<br />

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>CoolCool</span><span>,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community Site.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also try Enabling the Built-in Administrator Account and check if the issue persists in the Built-in Administrator Account</span></p>
<p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766343(WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766343%28WS.10%29.aspx</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Built in Administrator account in Vista and Windows 7 will be disabled, below are instructions on how to enable that account should you deem it necessary
 for troubleshooting purposes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Go to your
<strong>Start</strong> menu and in “<strong>Accessories</strong>” list, open “<strong>Command</strong>
<strong>Prompt</strong>” by right-clicking on its icon and choosing “<strong>Run</strong>
<strong>as</strong> <strong>Administrator</strong>”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. When the Command Prompt window appears, enter the command
<strong>net user administrator /active:yes</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. When done, log out from your current account.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. The Administrator account should now be present on your log in screen.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To turn the build in administrator account off, do the same except the command will be</span></p>
<p><span><strong>net user administrator /active:no</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let me know if that work. Good luck!
</span></p>

<h2>            Server hasn&#39;t been patched in over 2 and a half years</h2>
                    <p>Is there a best practice for patching a server which hasn't been patched with windows updates for over 2 and a half years?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking into MS Baseline Analyzer or ISOS as well</p>
<p>
</p><p>The server itself is a virtual machine and a file server</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone could tell me the best practice steps involved for this that would be great</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to just apply every patch from MS Security Bulletins</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

    <title>Error Code for banned&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> agent cbk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error Code for banned&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I keep getting a error message when I try to log in and when I look up the code it says that its a banned code. Which doesnt make sense I did not violate the code of conduct and this happened right after the update. Also on xbox.com it still says I have
 account but at time is says, "uh oh that should happened. It appears you found a glitch in the system." im wondering if i was banned or is it just the error that everyone is getting during this new update and if i was banned can i know what I did wrong and
 how long I am banned for and email saying I am banned.</p>

 then your account hasn't been banned. You will need to contact official Xbox support.</p>

<h2>            Computer Freezing&#47;BSOD when watching YouTube videos and talking to friends on Skype. &#40;I think it&#39;s an audio issue&#41;</h2>
                    Hello! I've been having an issue for about a couple months now. Whenever I watch a YouTube video full screen for a while, my computer will start to stutter and freeze. Eventually, it gets so bad that it freezes and doesn't unfreeze. It also makes an obnoxious
 buzzing noise. I have to manually reboot my computer by removing the power plug and reinserting. I've experienced one BSOD throughout the whole time this event has been happening, and it said "Page Fault in Nonpaged Area". I proceeded to look it up, and it
 told me use the memory diagnostic tools, etc. They all found nothing. I checked the hard disk as well with chkdsk. The thing that puzzles me is that, it sometimes also occurs when I'm talking on Skype with my friends. The whole screen will freeze up, and I
 have to do a hard reboot again. However, it doesn't occur whenever I play games like Skyrim or League of Legends. I can play those games for hours on end without ANY issues. My friend told me to check event viewer, and this is what we found. &nbsp;Any help would
 be appreciated. Thanks!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b88b734-6e82-451c-8c16-f5b8fc9e11f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b88b734-6e82-451c-8c16-f5b8fc9e11f8" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e92decb-4fee-42f8-af85-6ec2559b9743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e92decb-4fee-42f8-af85-6ec2559b9743" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8cc057ee-0b5f-4bb1-a3bc-b3f2448be513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8cc057ee-0b5f-4bb1-a3bc-b3f2448be513" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59fedeeb-af03-4c24-8217-64e41e94f5d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft

    <title>Borderless Window games not minimizing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flying sim.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Borderless Window games not minimizing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After the most recent Microsoft updates, i have been unable to minimize full screen and full screen borderless games. I have two monitors and when I minimize a game it stays on the screen and still keeps focus unlike before. I have the most up to date graphics
 drivers too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant view anything behind the game but I can still browse on the second monitor fine. This is getting irritating when I want to do something that is behind my game because I either need to fully close the game or set it to windows mode and drag it out
 of the way to see things behind it and even when I do this is still stays on the screen overlaying it. It appears to be like when you have Task manger to always be on top but it is doing it with games at full screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any fix for this as speaking to two of my friends who also play a lot of games with multiple monitors, it appears they are also having the exact same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We all have SSD's as primary hard drives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Wilfred,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue was happening to multiple games when I made this request but now it seems to be only happening to Battlefield 1. I was having this issue with War Thunder too but this appears to have been resolved. Running that trouble shooter did have something
 to fix but it has not fixed this issue. I have tried single monitor too but this did not solve the issue. This may just be an issue with Battlefield 1 then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the single monitor too and this also did not solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Both&nbsp;of these Iv's are &nbsp;listed under my network stuff &nbsp;Ivp4 and Ivp6</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what to do, just leave it be? from what I read the Ivp6 is the new language for talking on the web, &nbsp;because Ivp4 is getting full,&nbsp;if I delete one of these is this going to screw up my internet connection, I use DSL</p>

            <p>Hello Gandian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In computer networking, Teredo is a transition technology that gives full IPv6 connectivity for IPv6-capable hosts which are on the IPv4 Internet but which have no direct native connection to an IPv6 network. Compared to other similar protocols its distinguishing
 feature is that it is able to perform its function even from behind network address translation (NAT) devices such as home routers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you facing an issue? If yes, what is the exact error message/code?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time I would also suggest you to delete one of the Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter entry from Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do so, follow the steps given below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Click on <strong>Start</strong>, type "<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong>" In the Start Search box and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. Device Manager Window will be open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Expand "<strong>Network Adapters</strong>", <strong>r</strong><strong>ight <span>
click</span></strong> on the <strong>Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter and </strong>
click on <strong>U</strong><strong>ninstall. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>d.&nbsp;Restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to inform you that if you are not using at all then you can remove it from Network and Sharing Center then Right click on it and select Properties. Select IPV6 and Uncheck Teredo Tunneling Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also see:</p>

            <p>Sorry this is late, I'm finally taking some real time to look at this computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer is HP</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Ver</p>
<p>model p6716f</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this MS terado tunneling adapter error back in August, it is still there in the event viewer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the network adapters it reads it is not running for both of them, I believe the
</p>
<p>#2 terado is an update I found when I found this error, anyway it appears both are not running and the Realtek is what is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have run the troubleshooter back in August&nbsp; and run the fix it tool,&nbsp;maybe that is how the Realtek one appears&nbsp;there, you can see below, also it looks like with Realtek the network&nbsp;uses the Ipv4 and Ipv6</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have dsl and when set up it choose broadband connection, now see&nbsp;Realtek connection but the broadband box has the green circle with the check mark, confusing..</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't know, maybe just let it be? as long as I don't need to worry about this stuff</p>

            Hi Paul,<br />
<br />
Regarding your concern, it seems that the problem is not on your laptop since it was able to connect to another phone hotspot. However, we recommend that you check your phone hotspot settings or contact the manufacturer to assist you with configuring it since
 that's what causing the problem. <br />
<br />
We could also recommend that you forget the network connection of your phone from your PC, then re-connect it to your phone thru using the hotspot to see if that will work..<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>Modern games can strain a computer's resources. A computer that runs some programs perfectly can become sluggish and potentially unresponsive when faced with the demands of complicated games.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><span><font color="#000000"><font>Method 1:</font></font></span></b></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000"><span><strong>Check for known issues and updates for the game.</strong></span> Most software problems are not unique, and when you encounter one, it's likely that other people are having the same problem. Frequently, game

<p><b><font><font color="#000000"><font>Method 2:</font></font></font></b></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000"><span><strong>Get the newest device drivers.</strong></span> Because game performance can be affected by device drivers, it's a good idea to make sure that you have the latest drivers for all of your hardware.</font></font></font></p>

            <p>Mr Shahbaz Aulakh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is time to stop&nbsp;complaining. The Microsoft team can't help you with this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;GS means that&nbsp;the graphic card&nbsp;tries to&nbsp;shared&nbsp;your RAM's memory plus the NVIDIA 8400GS graphic card is as old as Microsoft XP. Even if you switch back to XP with&nbsp;4GB of RAM the game will still run slow.&nbsp;Since you have upgraded to windows&nbsp;8 its time
 to upgrade your graphics card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps.</p>

                    <p>Hi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a chance of Windows Movie Maker coming back in Windows 10?</p>
<p>It was the only video editor that I could ever use quickly, and the alternatives just can't hold a candle to it.</p>

            <p>I have Movie Maker on Windows 10. I still have version 1511, but I imagine you can download it too. It's still offered through Windows Essentials and is compatible with Windows 10. I use Movie Maker all the time.</p>

</p><p>I also downloaded Photo Gallery. There's other options for downloading more programs like Windows Live Writer, etc.</p>

            <p>Hey, Velt! First thing I suggest is making sure that the game is installed to your internal hard drive for troubleshooting. This will rule out any issues with an external hard drive that you may be running into.</p>
<p>If that doesn't help you out, I suggest doing the following steps. It will clear out all of your 360 games on the internal hard drive, but it may clear out any corrupted data that your console is trying to launch, too.</p>
<div><ol>
<li>Scroll left on the <b>Home</b> screen to open the <b>guide</b>. <br /><b>Note</b> Double-tapping the <b>Xbox</b> button will open the guide from any other screen on the console.</li>
<li>Select <b>Settings</b>.</li>
<li>Select <b>All settings</b>.</li>
<li>Select <b>System</b> and then select <b>Storage</b>.</li>
<li>Select <b>Clear local Xbox 360 storage</b>.</li>
<li>Select <b>Yes</b> and restart the console. This will not affect your cloud saved games or Xbox One games and profiles.</li>
</ol></div>
<p>Let us know if that helps you out! We'll be able to continue from there. :)</p>

            <p>I also am having the same issue, click on the Windows 10 Upgrade App from the task bar and it starts checking my system, and then says my CPU is not supported.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e3fa62a-fecb-4a75-8ede-f025a3dc9659" /></p>
<p>But when you go to Microsofts Windows 10 Upgrade Q&amp;A pages it says all I need a 1GHz processor.</p>

<p>I'm hoping that someone at Microsoft's Windows 10 software programmers can provide and answer as to why the confusing information.</p>

<h2>            Event Viewer Will Not Close</h2>
                    Even though I have closed all of the dialog boxes in the event viewer when trying to exit the consol it give me that error. Close all dialog boxes before you exit event viewer.

<p><span>Hi bmxjumperc,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you made any recent changes on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 it happen every time you open event viewer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you open the task manager and try to close the event viewer and check if it closes completely.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Open the event viewer and navigate multiple logs and later try to close the event viewer.</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the issue persists again.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Exit a program that is not responding</span></strong></p>
