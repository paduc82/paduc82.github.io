Let's make you the subject of a science experiment.&nbsp; Try downloading and installing directly</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;critical&nbsp;security update&nbsp;KB2870699 and see if afterwards updates are working normally&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.neowin.net/news/svchost-bug-still-spikes-cpu-at-100-6-months-before-windows-xp-support-cut-off#comment-2366845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.neowin.net/news/svchost-bug-still-spikes-cpu-at-100-6-months-before-windows-xp-support-cut-off#comment-2366845</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installing this critical&nbsp;security update&nbsp;KB2870699 will reportedly restore normal operation of Windows Update
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the fix then it should be bannered on every page that hits as related to a Windows update&nbsp; problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; And yeah it is a security issue obviously.</p>

            Tried that without any luck. Still get same error code (0x802460008) for every update I try to install including priority updates.. Still looking for solution.What about installing update package that includes BITS 2.0 and WinHTTP 5.1 for windows xp? Found

Anything is worth a try.&nbsp; I haven't returned to another attempt at a clean install yet since a half dozen fails has left me stressed and searching for new things to try on attempt #7 ......which could turn out to be Windows 7 since i have the whole package
 ready for it to go.&nbsp; I still use XP and have several computers that have worked fine with it until this recent issue with Windows Update failing to sync with any computer having a clean install of XP.&nbsp; Microsoft Corporate would have to be aware of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing I haven't seen mentioned that would seem to the most obvious workaround would be to manually download every update and install them offline to the computer having a clean install of XP, which should serve to resolve the issue where Windows Update
 can't sync with a clean install of XP not existing in a more evolved and already updated condition.&nbsp; The situation we are experiencing is that the Windows Update site itself has been updated and is now speaking a different language from what language requests&nbsp;it
 receives from a clean install.&nbsp; The current ActiveX being used by Windows Update is not reverse compatible with machines having a clean install that are requesting the Windows Update server for a correctly prioritized and sequenced&nbsp;list of updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;The server
 request from the clean install of XP SP2 or XP&nbsp;SP3&nbsp;running IE6 is not being accepted as a valid request.&nbsp; Neither does it help to upgrade to IE8 as a preparation.&nbsp;&nbsp; I only had a partial success on one of the 6 clean installs of XP SP2 which made it up to the
 seventies of the more than 125 updates before crashing unrepairably sometime after SP3 and the prerequisite validation process for the update installation of SP3 which I allowed it to run even though I have the standalone SP3 both as a network install and
 a CD that was a bona fide genuine Microsoft iso.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of my XP licenses are bona fide genuine COA stickered on the case HP corporate desktops, and I even tried a generic OEM install CD which is also genuine Microsoft</p>
<p>so there is no piracy detection issue that is the problem unless Windows Update now thinks everybody still running XP is a pirate and not a paying customer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is really ridiculous that customers are having to troubleshoot what is obviously a server software issue at the Windows Update server where protocols have been implemented which are crippling the&nbsp; update service for clean install update&nbsp;requests&nbsp;and are
 causing system crashes on users already partially&nbsp;updated&nbsp;existing&nbsp;machines.&nbsp; Microsoft is the source of the problem and needs to reconfigure the Windows Update server to accept and process update requests in the functional&nbsp;manner that it used to do before
 the update sequence&nbsp;protocols were changed.&nbsp;&nbsp; If Microsoft can't fix the Windows Update site so it works then there needs to be a standalone Cumulative update iso made available with all of the updates&nbsp;together as&nbsp;a service pack.&nbsp; Resync the Windows Update
 servers to have a new starting point prerequisite as Windows XP&nbsp;SP4.&nbsp;&nbsp; That will fix the problem.&nbsp;

            <p>Installing 2879017 was a slow install and after rebooting then I installed java and confirmed&nbsp;java was working.&nbsp; The ActiveX used by Windows update is java.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I got java installed and confirmed working and then Windows Update has no issues and literally
 flies through a hundred plus downloads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't say it works for everybody, but it sure did work for me.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I did finally get everything back to normal from a clean install, compl;ete with all updates and obviously did get Windows Updates working normally,&nbsp;but I didn't take careful notes on every detail,&nbsp;so now it is mysterious to me exactly how I did succeed
 as an exact 123 step by step.&nbsp; I was worn out with it by the time I was finished.&nbsp; User friendly it was not.&nbsp; Compares well&nbsp;with alligator wrestling.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of what I did is covered in the other thread I linked before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is some more about the BITS issue which I encountered also along the way, but managed to get that resolved without a regedit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm sure I will get the exact steps mapped out better on the next machine. I am doing refurb and CPU upgrades and checkouts on several old socket 478 HP&nbsp;machines which are supposed to be upgradable to Windows 7 but have been&nbsp;making sure they are fully&nbsp;checked
 out with XP first.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WRT the java the first attempt I thought I had it installed and working but it wasn't. There is a confirmation test at the java site where you can check to make sure the java install succeeded and is confirmed working. For me it failed on the first install
 attempt. There was an update that had to manually go into IE8 which went slowly and a reboot or a couple of reboots before I could get the java to cooperate and confirm working.&nbsp; And it was immediately after that the Windows Update gridlock ended, and everything
 came pouring through.&nbsp; At some point in that process I also had installed the changeover from Windows Update to Microsoft Update so that may have factored into the solution also but it sure wasn't the entire issue. That had been ruled out earlier.</p>

            Just had an interesting conversation with Microsoft Support(?) after waiting for about 50 minutes for a callback. After telling the person about my problems with windows update and describing my PC I was told that my OS was out of warranty and for $99
 I could get one month further warranty! When I told them forget it, that I expected MS to support their products especially those that were running fine but because of installation on a new hard drive does not work. What do I do? Their reply floored me! I
 was told Microsoft Support does troubleshooting but does not supply answers to problems!!!! If I had the money I would trash my PC with windows and buy as Apple! Another American company goes down the tube as far as I am concerned.&nbsp;

                    <p>Dear users,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked around this forum, but I fail to see an explicit answer from a Microsoft developer or technician as to why Windows 10 does not have support for machines without NX-BIT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP Workstation XW6200 and I would like to use Windows 10 on it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is turning me to alternative solutions to be able to continue to use my workstation computer (e.g. Linux / Unix / BSD etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I could please get a proper answer as to why NX-BIT is a requirement in Windows 8 - 10, I would be very happy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            It's an old computer so you shouldn't be surprised that it's run into a wall.&nbsp; You won't get any authoritative answers from Microsoft here.&nbsp; The simple answer is that requiring the NX-bit capability is a security measure, and all modern processors have
 the capability.&nbsp; You can read more about it from MS <strong><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn482072.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396#scope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.

                    <p>the People app on my laptop computer running windows 10 worked in March 2017, but just stopped working. It no longer shows my contacts. I do see my contacts on my Windows phone people app. I also see my contacts in Outlook.com people app.

<p>
</p><p>I've tried to re-attach my account to the app but it keeps saying this account is already attached.

            <p>Hi Marc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several symptoms and causes of synchronization issues. It is possible that this is caused by corrupted cache files. To diagnose and fix this problem, we suggest that you follow the methods below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Run <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the troubleshooter for Windows apps</a>. This tool finds and fixes common problems with apps on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Reset the People app. This will reinitialize and refresh the app and may fix synchronization issues.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Click on the gear icon to open Windows Settings.</li><li>Select <strong>S</strong><strong>ystem &gt; Apps and features</strong>.</li><li>Look for <strong>People </strong>in the list and select it.</li><li>Click on <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Reset </strong>button.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Download any pending updates that need to be installed on the computer through Windows Update and check if it helps resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated with the results.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion. I performed the "Reset" option suggested but now when I try to launch the People app it kind of starts. The screen is orange, but then the app immediately closes and I can't see my contacts. Luckily, I can see my contacts when
 I login to Outlook.com. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming I need to pair/connect my Microsoft account&nbsp; some way to the app but I don't know how.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I uninstall the People app and try to re-install.</p>

            <p>A corrupted system file related to the People app can cause this issue. Before reinstalling the app, we suggest that you run

            <p>I think you misunderstood my previous statement or I was unclear. Two possibilities. The Windows Store works great for me. I've had no trouble launching the Windows Store. I did what you said "WSReset.exe".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is I want to follow your advice and remove my account from the People App but I can't even launch the app at the moment and the app remain active. What started this entire thread April 1 was I could launch the People app just fine but did not see
 any of my contacts in the App. I have reset the App data many times since and rebooted my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my original "lack-of-data-problem" I've developed a new problem with the People App. It won't remain running more than 2 seconds! The app looks like it will run. My screen turns orange. I see the beginnings of the App on my screen but the App immediately
 closes. I don't get to select the setting button to "Remove my account" as you suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the People App immediately closing when I try to open it? </p>

<p>There is also another way; for all iOS devices, using the USB cable plugged into the device, plug it in to the computer and on the device, tell it to trust the computer and then on the computer, open the file manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One folder will display from the device and that folder will contain the photos and videos stored on the device.&nbsp; You can copy them that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple unlocked the DCM folder on iOS devices so that it can be viewed by other systems.</p>

    <title>XBOX GAME DVR CRASHING - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ibtg  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX GAME DVR CRASHING</h2>
                    
<p>I recently started trying to record clips using the xbox game DVR. I will hit "start recording" and come back about 3 minutes later and about 20% of the time, when i re-open the game DVR, It is as if it was never recording and i have the options to "start
 clip" "end clip" and "show my captures". I want to know why this is happening because it is quite frustrating to waste 3-4 minutes on a clip that only "might record". (A hard reset wont work btw)</p>

            <p>Hey, IBTG! What a unique situation! While I haven't seen any similar reports to this, I do hope that I can get you resolved. Just so that I cover all my bases here, I'm going to ask you to do some basic troubleshooting. Please do let me know if any of it helps.</p>
<p>First, aside from the hard reset that you've done, I suggest <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/security/remove-profile-from-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">removing your profile</a> and <a href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/sign-in-to-another-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">adding it again</a>. Since the app itself is built into the console, we will be unable to uninstall that to test that out. We go for the next thing, and that is where profiles come in.</p>
<p>With you stating that it's been crashing, have you noticed if your controller is disconnecting, or going off because of idle, when this happens? If it does, have you tried having your controller connected up so that the idle doesn't cause it to go off?</p>
<p>The last thing I am curious about is if you are in the preview program. You may be experiencing issues based on that, and if you are, I can get you to the right forums to get this sorted. :)</p>
<p>Post back with all the details you can, and we'll see which path we have to take to get you resolved! :D</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply! And yes I am in the preview program, I'm not sure if that has to do with anything. &nbsp;No my controller hasn't been Turning off. I say its "crashing" because when I open up the game DVR menu to start recording and open it up later to stop
 the recording it opens up as if I was never recording in the first place. It was only working about 20% of the time before but after a while I have noticed that it has been happening a lot less. I will try removing my profile and adding it again.</p>

<p>Please let me know the results of removing your profile! To get better visibility on your issue, since you're in the preview, we'll want to post in those forums if the issue persists after that step. :)</p>

<h2>            Unknown usb device link in compliance mode error code 43 device manager</h2>
                    I have an internal multi media card reader that worked until the major update to Windows 10. It now shows "unknown usb device (link in compliance mode)" I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling, replugging it, reinstalled chipset drivers and made sure all
 others are up to date. I still have the same error with code 43. Driver for this device says none required or installed. Where do I go to next?

            Hello Christina,<br />
<br />
Believe it or not.&nbsp; Windows Movie Maker does not support .mpeg video format.&nbsp; You will need to do a web search for a converter that will convert .mpeg to a different file type.&nbsp; ie .wmv .avi etc.<br />
<br />
I would reccomend going to <a href="http://www.download.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.download.com</a> and typing free mpeg converter in the search list.&nbsp; This is a good safe site.<br />
<br />
Cheers

                    <p>Hello everyone and thank you for your time/attention. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a question regarding system restore.. how long does it usually take? because mines have been restoring for about 2 hours now.. This is odd to me because I recently made a restore point(3 hours ago)and used it to restore my computer back so I didn't
 think it would take this long. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Did my computer freeze? The loading animation is still going and it says "Pease wait while your Windows files and settings are being restored. System Restore is restoring the registry.. ".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the help.&nbsp;</p>

            Hello, depending on how much file is stored on your hard drive(or SSD), it will take time. More files will take more time. Try waiting at least 6 hours, but if it doesn't change in 6 hours, I suggest you restarting the process. Either the restore process has gone corrupt, or something has failed critically. 
<br />Hope this helps! :-)

<p>Infact we just powered the machine down by holding the power key. When it restarted the restore was reported as having failed but windows was up again so we can try again</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I sign in to my microsoft account&#63;</h2>
                    I keep having trouble signing in to my microsoft account. I keep getting a note that there is a problem with my microsoft account and to fix it I need to sign in, I get past the first hurdle, then when I am told I need to use my email address to sign in
 and when I type in my email address I either get the message that my password is wrong or the my email is part of a reserved domain, I suppose depending on how the OS feels that day. (The same thing happens when I try to sign in to the feedback hub). I can
 sign in and out of my outlook email on all 3 of my machines, so I don't see where there is a problem with my password. Is there some reason that I can't use the email that I used to sign in to other microsoft services to sign in to my microsoft account?

            Hi Zen.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> I'll give you everything possible to try for sign-in failure so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br />
<br />This could also be due to account corruption so see the fixes here:
<br /><a href="https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profile-windows-10-9139/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profi...</a>
<br /> 
<br />To access another account to try to fix corruption, or create a new Admin account to replace a corrupted account, see these steps enable the hidden Built-in Administrator used for emergencies like this. First try whichever method works here: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable</a>...
<br />
<br />If it blocks these by requiring a password, then see this tutorial for enabling Built-in Admin from Log-in Screen.  <a href="https://www.isumsoft.com/it/enable-hidden-administrator-account-in-windows-10-without-login/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isumsoft.com/it/enable-hidden-admin...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m</a>.... Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only.
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor</a>...
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, or on second screen choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />Restart PC, Sign into new Admin account, elevate the desired account by typing netplwiz in Start Search, opening the wizard, highlight desired account (tick box if necessary first), then under Properties &gt; Group Membership, change to Administrator. Save that and then if desired highlight and remove the old Admin account.
<br />
<br />If these fail then create a new Admin Account: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a</a>...
<br />
<br />If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki</a>.... It is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, You have to purchase the pass again for the PC version. The pass does not transfer over to another version of the game, no matter which device you play it on.

            sadly its not a play anywhere title so the pass has to be for the platform the game is on so if you got it for the pc you need the pc version&nbsp; it wont cross over.

<h2>            High latency on xbox live.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys. When i run a multiplayer connection test my latency is over 210 ms.</p>
<p>im using wired connection and my stats are 49.78 mbps and 15.54 Mbps upload</p>
<p>im behind a cone nat, tried to activate ipv6, upnp, post forwarding several ports such as 53,80,88,500,3074,3075,3076,4500,3544</p>
<p>my internet box is siligence np-00.</p>
<p>btw by running bandwithplace.com speed test on xbox one on us servers i Ping 85-110.</p>
<p>How to fix That latency? 217ms for 50mbps/15 mbps isnt fair.</p>
<p>Cheers. Quicky</p>

<p>The latency shown on the network connection tab is not an accurate reading and does not resemble in game latency. The latency is the Xbox pinging the Xbox servers in Washington and not the nearest server.</p>
<p>If however you experience a lot of lag and rubberbanding in game I suggest trying a different cable to connect your Xbox to the interner or resetting all your network devices. As your NAT is open everything should be fine</p>

<p>Honestly I can't help you with COD, I'm having the same issue. Static IP which is port forwarded on my router and DMZ on my gateway. I believe there is a hidden port maybe for COD which I haven't been able to find on the internet.</p>
<p>But Moderate in COD doesn't affect the game that much, since it's already open on the console itself</p>

                    <p>A few weeks ago I began having problems with Chrome. I could not remain signed in on my blog homepage although I was logged into the Google universe and could access the inner workings to edit the blog. But I could not and cannot post comments on any blogger

<p>
</p><p>Now Firefox is having the same problem, so IE still works, but for how much longer? With two browsers involved, this seems to be a Windows thing, and it's just this computer. Other Windows 8.1 and 7 computers are not affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've scanned for malware and viruses with MalwareBytes, SuperAntiSpyware and Panda. Any suggestions?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok just got my xbox one today, and I wanted to try out a kinect game, downloaded peggle 2 when I loaded up the game it said "kinect not available in your locale" or some such... is this going to be patched I hope very soon , just wasted my money only reason
 I bought the game:(</p>

<p>I'm guessing this will be supported when the voice recognition gets updated to full support on the Xbox One. But seriously, you bought Peggle 2 because it supported Kinect? I didn't even know or expect it to have Kinect support until I saw that error message.
 Peggle 2's a great game with just the controller so I doubt you wasted your money. Just give it a go - I know I was instantly hooked and spent way too long on it in my first sitting.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>By saying "Lid Open" I believe&nbsp;<strong>TopDog1961</strong> is talking about waking up from sleep or hibernate mode. Unfortunately this seems to be broken for many people who upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 or 8 across many different laptop/PC manufacturers.
 Definitely something broken with Windows 10. </p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. After reading several blogs, I have come to realize the feature I am looking for
 with a laptop's BIOS. Not all computers have this feature. If it is available it must be setup in the BIOS settings (for example pressing F2 during preliminary boot-up) before Windows even boots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer has this feature. I have now discovered my computer battery is going bad and is causing my laptop to completely skip BIOS SETUP. This is also affecting my audio input/output (mic &amp; headphone) operation. Unfortunately these problems exist even
 when plugged into a power supply (but this is a completely different subject matter). New battery is on order. Will be able to "re"-set "lid open - power on" feature shortly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other Windows options associated with my laptop's lid still function properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!!</p>

<h2>            Silhouette Cameo software install but says missing several dll files and couldn&#39;t find Framework DLL</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP TS10 Pavilion Wind 8.1, was running so slow so finally did a PC recovery to default settings and then went in to re-install my Silhouette Studio software.&nbsp; When I then launch the program it goes through a host of different .dll files saying
 couldn't find and each one you click it then ends with couldn't find Framework DLL.&nbsp; I just went through and did a bunch of updates that had already been done previously but since I had to do the recovery, had to do all the updates again...I then installed
 .Net Framework 1.1, tried 4.7.2 but wouldn't let me with out the KB2919355 update, so did all that, then got the new Framework to install.&nbsp; Then went in and re-installed the Silhouette software and it is still doing the same thing with all these .dll files
 missing.</p>
<p>

                    At any given time I have 19 SvcHost.exe's running ~350MB of memory. It essentially locks up the computer. Does this come from Windows 10 or are some left over from Windows 7? It wasn't as bad with 7!

<h2>            autochk program not found</h2>
                    
<p>I got a new 500 gb hdd and migrated all of my old 250GB hdd to it including my windows installation. I did a startup repair from the install disc too. when i try to boot the system on the 500GB hdd i get an error "autochk program not found - skipping AUTOCHECK"
 then a blue screen with maybe 2 lines of text flashes for a moment and the system reboots. I need a solution. I didn't make any changes to my old hdd (at least not yet).</p>

<p>I suspect that it isn't or that something went wrong during the cloning process. You probably need to repeat that step.</p>

            Its meant for hard drive cloning, and works like a seperate OS and boots from a CD so I don't see why it shouldn't work.

            Windows 7 has its own way of doing things. I found that many older partition management tools failed to work under Windows 7.

You either migrate the whole Windows installation with a suitable cloning program or else you do a clean installation, then install the various applications and updates and redo you personal settings. I use Acronis TrueImage to clone my disks (or Acronis DiskDirector)
 but here is a solution that relies on native tools: <br />

If your old disk still works and the new disk doesn't then the new disk is obviously not a true clone of the old disk. What the difference is I do not know. Here are the things I would look into:<br />
<ul>
<li>Did you completely erase the new disk before using TrueImage? </li><li>Where exactly did you park the TrueImage image file? </li><li>Did you apply the image file by booting the machine with a TrueImage Rescue CD?</li><li>Did you copy all partitions? </li><li>Did you remember to disconnect the old disk before booting the PC with the new disk for the first time?</li><li>What is the size of the system partition on the new disk? </li></ul>
