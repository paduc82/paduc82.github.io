<h2>            Alien Isolation update won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t download or install.</h2>
                    
<p>I've had Alien Isolation for a couple days now and have yet to see anything past the first mission. When I first got that game I disconnected for Xbox live to install the game. And after verifying that it did work, I reconnected to download any updates,
 lone-be-hold there was so I tried my first of many attempts to download it. My first attempt was met with failure when it would not pass 2%, I uninstalled, disconnect, reinstalled and tried again. 2% and stop. Uninstalled, disconnect, reinstalled and download.
 Got to 100% this time! Yey I can now play. NOPE! It claims to have nothing left to do, yet nothing happens, so I leave it for an hour on 100% to finish.. I don't know tieing its shoes. Nothing happened.&nbsp;Uninstalled, disconnect, reinstalled and download. 100%,
 nothing.&nbsp;Uninstalled, disconnect, reinstalled and download. 100% and nothing. By this point I have a nice little pile of Xbox one controllers laying in half in the corner. Then I gave up and just watched Alien.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody else got this problem? If so have you found a fix.</p>
<p>And to those who are still struggling with this, might I recommend watching the first two movies if you haven't seen them already. And if you have seen them watch them again. So far my Xbox can handle that. The job of an £30 DVD player.</p>

<p>I would I have also been stuck on the update installation and would like to recommend that everybody who is interested in purchasing this game, strongly reconsider purchasing a product that is so bugged, even the very core of the game, cannot download and
 update itself. I am so extremely disappointed. I should have been more aware when the purchase very clearly stated No Refunds.

<p>I'm having the same problems. Installed fine then struggled with the update, went to 100% on the first day and didn't complete so I uninstalled and started again, got to 21% then nothing for 6 hours, uninstall try again, this time got to 2% and then keeps
 disconnecting my xbox from the wifi, says it " cannot connect to your DHCP server" does the same on my hotspot and home network, but all my other devices work fine on the network, so I uninstallled it and it all re connected fine again. As you said they were
 quite adamant about no refunds at the shop. Might just have to get the PS4 instead lol</p>

    <title>RDCman authentication always directs to Two factor agent - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> misbahsyed mashkoorul haque  say:</h3>
<h2>            RDCman authentication always directs to Two factor agent</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>We have windows 2012 R2 servers joined to a domain as RDS server. We have two factor authentication agents installed on these systems. These systems are used to remotely connect and manage other windows servers using RDP.</p>
<p>We started using RDCman for RDP connections but are facing authentication issue. When we connect using the
<strong>RDP client </strong>from RDS server, it asks for password and username and the authentication is directly send to the remote server.</p>
<p>But whenever we use <strong>RDCman </strong>to connect to remote server, it keeps prompting us for the Two Factor credential. The remote server are not part of the same domain and do not use the same user name and password as used to login to the RDS servers
 (using two factor authentication). The TFA credential do not work as the remote systems are not using these TFA, they have local credentials / another domain credential.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The direct RDP client is working without any issue, i am not sure why RDCman is directing its authentication to the TFA agent</p>
<p>Can someone help?</p>

    <title>Is modifying controllers legal&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seannyseans  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is modifying controllers legal&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've seen companies modify Xbox controllers and sell them. I'm curious whether they've asked for Microsoft's consent. Assuming Microsoft allowed you to modify the controllers and sell them, would you have to pay a partial amount of the sale to Microsoft?</p>
<p>Reason being, I'm a 15 year old who's interested in making a little bit of money. I don't intend to add "rapid fire modifications" or anything like that, merely alter the aesthetics of the controller. Paint it, add custom LED's, all of that. But I don't
 want to go ahead and do this, and get caught committing a crime, or whatever.</p>

<p>they don't do anything about it since the modder buy and sell real Xbox controllers.</p>
<p>If they started using knock off cheapish ones, things would change.</p>
<p>dunno how your gonna make money doing it, gotta be 500+ different sellers on ebay doing the same thing.</p>

<p>And a vast majority of that 500+ are successful.</p>

<p>Waste of time now for modifying 360 controllers. If you plan on doing it, focus instead on PS4 and XBOne controllers. Volume is only going to go up.

            <p>Hello Trek,</p>
<p>
To resolve this problem, remove the affected filter drivers. To do this, follow these steps:
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fkbgraphics%2fpublic%2fen-us%2fvistastartbutton.jpg" />, type
<span>regedit</span> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then click
<strong>regedit</strong> in the <strong>Programs</strong> list.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fkbgraphics%2fpublic%2fen-us%2fsecurityshield.jpg" />&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password
 or confirmation, type your password or click&nbsp;<strong>Continue</strong>.
</li><li>Locate and then click the following registry subkey:
<div><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</strong></div>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2fLibrary%2fImages%2f2684263.jpg" /><span>Warning</span>&nbsp;There can be many instances of the registry subkey that is mentioned in step 2. You must make sure that you are in
 the appropriate registry subkey before you change the UpperFilters and the LowerFilters values. To verify that you are in the appropriate registry subkey, make sure that the Default value is DVD/CD-ROM and the Class value is CDROM.</li><li>If you see <strong><span>UpperFilters </span>
</strong>in the pane on the right side, right-click&nbsp;<strong>UpperFilters</strong>, and then click
<strong>Delete</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> to confirm the removal of the UpperFilters registry entry.</li><li>If you see <strong><span>LowerFilters&nbsp;</span></strong>in the pane on the right side, right-click&nbsp;<strong>LowerFilters</strong>, and then click
<strong>Delete</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> to confirm the removal of the LowerFilters registry entry.</li><li>Exit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer. </li></ol>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2fLibrary%2fImages%2f2683283.jpg" /><span>Note:</span>&nbsp; After you remove the UpperFilters registry entry and the LowerFilters registry entry, you may lose functionality in
 certain programs, such as CD recording programs. In this scenario, you must reinstall any affected programs. If this problem occurs again, contact the program vendor to determine whether an update is available for the program.&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so: Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore,
 make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following
 article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</span></p>

</p><p>Most of the time this indicates the drive has failed and must be replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desktop new drive costs about$20 and a couple of screws.</p>

Fix: DVD Drive Not Detected In Windows 8/10<br />
<a href="http://www.intowindows.com/fix-dvd-drive-not-detected-in-windows-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.intowindows.com/fix-dvd-drive-not-detected-in-windows-8/
</span></a><br />
<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
If needed let's test the CD/DVD drive to see if it works at all &nbsp;:<br />
<br />
Try this to see if the drive is viable at all (you will need to make these on another computer&nbsp;- XP, Vista,&nbsp;7,&nbsp;8/8.1, or 10 or even running&nbsp;Linux&nbsp;does not matter).&nbsp;You could also try booting with another Windows disk&nbsp;- any OS version though do not use&nbsp;it to
 do ANY repairs unless it is absolutely the same&nbsp;version of Windows on your system - just boot to see if the drive&nbsp;works. You can even&nbsp;make a Windows 10 USB boot drive&nbsp;by running the Windows Media Creation tool&nbsp;(on any computer) - Windows Media Creation Tool
 (make 32 or 64 both disk same as the OS<br />
version you are running).<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10&nbsp;&nbsp;</a><br />
<br />
Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 so watch the screen as you boot - set <br />
the boot&nbsp;order to CD/DVD first. Remember to set it back when done.<br />
<br />
Or try booting to a Linux boot disk.<br />
<br />
If the drive will not boot to these then it has failed or there are other hardware
<br />
issues&nbsp;affecting it. However even it does boot that does not mean there are <br />
not some possible&nbsp;hardware issues affect the drive's other functions.<br />

<p>Have you checked the TurboTax site to make sure that version you have on the CD is compatible with Windows 10?&nbsp; It will be listed there.&nbsp; They will also have info if any other TurboTax customer has ever encountered the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing you can try out:&nbsp; open File Explorer, go to the "This PC" section.&nbsp; Find your CD drive icon (it may have a TurboTax logo on it while the CD is in) and right-click and choose "Open" (so that it doesn't try to run the setup program yet).&nbsp; Find
 the actual setup file icon, right-click, and choose "Troubleshoot compatibility" from the menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many times, this is all it takes.&nbsp; I recorded a demo about doing this, it's only a 45-second video if you want to take a look.&nbsp; It says Windows 8, but the steps are 100% identical in Windows 10 too (and 7 for that matter).&nbsp; Here's a link:</p>

<h2>            Problems uninstalling and installing Java</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I am facing problem in uninstalling and installing Java in my computer. It&nbsp;installed Java previously&nbsp;and it installed in &nbsp;C:\users\myname\somefolder. Currently there is some problem and I am not able to use Java in my computer, so I tried to install
 Java and disply a message that this programme is already installed in computer. When I tried to remove and install it, it was not successful. So I tried to remove the Java from control pannel, but is not successful and shows a message that "The path C:\uses\vijay\App
 Data\Locallow\Sun\Java\jre1.6.0_20-c-l.msi cannot be found. Verify that you have access to this location and try it again" Please suggest, I want to remove this programme and reinstall it again. Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Be sure to logon as ADMIN<br />
<br />
Do both of these <br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;-&nbsp; click reset all zones to default - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
Close IE<br />
<br />
Then use Revo to&nbsp;uninstall Java so you can reinstall it - Free Version<br />
<a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html</a><br />
<br />
Reboot.<br />
<br />
Now go back to Java and reinstall<br />
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.java.com/en/</span></a></p>
<p>You can also try the Off-Line installer</p>

<br />
&nbsp;----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If needed - look for something conflicting and reset IE<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but<br />
Java still installs it and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.)<br />
Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look<br />
right. Permitted are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a<br />
program ask about it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and run<br />

What antivirus/antispyware/security products are you using? Which have EVER been on<br />
your computer as remnants can cause strange issues.<br />

Hope these help.</p>

<h2>            OpenGL Hardware Acceleration is invalid. Please check your display drivers. &#40;Windows 7 32x Ultimate&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've changed my OS from Vista home premium 32x SP2 to 7 ultimate 32x last years december and I redownloaded the game I had on vista back on 7. For some odd reason, I suddenly recieved the error "OpenGL Hardware Acceleration is invalid. Please check your
 display drivers." The weird the thing is, I only changed from OS and NOT from computer (so there are no different Display drivers, processors, etc....).</p>
<p>I read about it having to do with my processor or display driver, I don't know, but this is a really weird thing because I didn't change my computer or anything that's inside. I only changed OS.</p>
<p>I have an ATI Radeon 2100 Display driver, my processor is an AMD Athlon(tm) Dual core processor 4850e. This should be fine because otherwise, I wouldn't be able to play it on Vista....</p>
<p>Any help is really appreciated,</p>

 but it said important on my automatic update.&nbsp; These were tried to download 5 times and were unsuccesful.&nbsp; So far the update window has not popped up! (Yea).&nbsp; You are a life saver.<br />

    <title>Dell Monitor will not work after latest Nov. 2017 Windows 10 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell Monitor will not work after latest Nov. 2017 Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>At first, my monitor would not awake from sleep mode. I was forced to cold boot the entire PC, and I've been doing that for about a week or more. Now, my monitor doesn't even come on. I've checked all connections, restarted multiple times, and I even unplugged
 the PC from the wall and unplugged all</p>
<p>connections and reconnected them. Nothing works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY WON'T MY MONITOR WORK? It's a Dell monitor no older than 2 years old, and it worked fine until the recent update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect drivers, but how can I update drivers if I can't see anything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would go back to a previous back up point, but I can't see. I"M BLIND WITHOUT MY MONITOR!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no other monitors to plug in or use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions? I need this for my job.</p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>When you uploaded it to OneDrive, did you check to make sure where it uploaded to?</p>
<p>Also, OneDrive will automatically create another folder for your videos, and sore them there. I would also recommend searching for the clip as well, just to make sure it has not been stored in a folder somewhere on OneDrive?</p>
<p>Also, how was you trying to view the file?</p>
<p>If you still can not find it, please could you try again and post back your results</p>
<p>Regards, </p>

<p>I've recorded clips, edited them, saved, making sure I clicked upload to one drive and says it done it. It shows on my videos and feed on the Xbox one but nothing is going onto the one drive. Checked on the XB1 app, android app and online.

<p>This has been advised from Xbox Support.</p>
<p>I have also looked at the Onedrive's Status, though their website and the Microsoft community, and have found no problems with OneDrive at all. This is why I am thinking it could be something to do with the Upload Studio on your Xbox One console. But I could
 be mistaken. </p>
<p>Hope this helps, </p>

<h2>            World 60 mins mobiles and landlines</h2>
                    <p>Anybody can advise?</p>
<p>Subscription: World 60 mins mobiles and landlines.</p>
<p>In the beginning I had two subscriptions active: World 60 mins and 100 mins Russia. The last was working perfectly well with all the numbers. But after 100 mins used up the World was just staying charged with 60 mins not allowing making any calls (nor mobiles
 nor landlines)</p>
<p>To troubleshoot the issue I have canceled the 100 mins. Now I can call world landline numbers with no problems. After the call I see that the account balance reduces according to the minutes spent on a call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if the number is a mobile device - the call drops immediately after I press the call button. I see 0.00 minutes on a call in the report page.</p>

    <title>Microsoft account Alias - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karl.dean75  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft account Alias</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to sign into my Skype account.&nbsp; For some reason I had to go through a series of screens asking for information. &nbsp;Not really knowing what I was doing and getting a bit frustrated I added a new alias name with an email address I do not have.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Microsoft then sent an email to this address for verification.&nbsp; As I do not have this email address, I can not verify the Alias and now I can not access my skype account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time I try to sign in it takes me to the verification screen saying an email has been sent to the address I setup as the Alias.&nbsp; There is a fix option for instances of typo mistakes but this does not help.&nbsp; No matter what I enter (my current email
 account I do have and is actually mine) it says the name has already been changed in red and it will not let me proceed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anybody suggest what I can do to sign in?&nbsp; Alternatively how do you actually contact a Microsoft Customer services person?</p>

<p>Hi there&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a way to get that sorted and its normally goes through as a 2nd step authorization process. I suggest going to check your security on your Microsoft account www.mircosoft.com to make sure all your details are correct. If it continues there is support
 on there as well to make sure all you account is secure.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Quiet Speakers with Insane Buzzing Sound - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcusxu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Quiet Speakers with Insane Buzzing Sound</h2>
                    <p>Connected my stereo system to my desktop with a 3.5mm jack but they have an extremely loud buzz as soon as theyre plugged in and the sound is barely audible at max volume (maxed in the stereo and pc).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I put the speakers between a monitor, desktop and modem, i dont think that this is what is causing the buzzing because it disappears when I turn on the radio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sound is also very quiet in comparison to the buzzing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The buzzing can still be faintly heard when the 3.5mm is unplugged too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to internally fix this. Thank you &lt;3&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well, there's the obvious : are you plugged into the line-in jack ? not the mic jack.&nbsp; I assume the stereo output you're using is the headphone jack - that should be enough to power a line-in.&nbsp; Sounds like there's an expander somewhere in there.&nbsp; You could

<h2>            Halo The Master Chief collection n&#38;&#35;227&#59;o quer abrir</h2>
                    
<p>Comprei o jogo Halo The Master Chief collection na SARAIVA , chegou direitinho em casa, tudo certo, até eu instalar ele, bom instalar foi normal, pus ele no Xbox ONE instalou tudo, tentei iniciar o jogo ele abriu em tela toda, só que uma atualização foi
 requisitada que era aproximadamente 18 GBs, cliquei em atualizar só que ae que &nbsp; o jogo deu &nbsp;problema, ele simplesmente aparecia "PRONTO PARA INCIAR" e ficava nisso, não abria, não acontecia nada(Na verdade eu via o quantidade de Gigas livres do Xbox ONE diminuir
 bastante mas não mostrava qualquer progresso la na lista de download, simplesmente ficava "Pronto para inciar" mas não abria), tentei fazer limpeza de cache, tentei desinstalar e instalar de novo só que offline, mas nada funcionou, será que é problema com
 a midia ? ou é outra coisa ? ME AJUDEM PLS</p>
