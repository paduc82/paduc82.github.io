<h2>            How to synchronise photos from camera to SkyDrive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Surface RT. With the inclusion of two cameras, I've been taking photos, which are automatically saved in Pictures app Camera Roll. Is there a way to set this up so that it synchronises with SkyDrive, so that I'd always have those photos available
 on other devices?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ray.</p>

<p>Since you have the SkyDrive app <u>i</u>nstalled, you can upload files <span><span>and folders</span></span> to
<span><span>SkyDrive</span></span> automatically by copying, moving, or saving them to the
<span><span>SkyDrive</span></span> folder on your computer. </p>
<p><span>When you sync a Picture folder\file in your SkyDrive folder, this file will be available to your SkyDrive account and to other devices where you have a SkyDrive client using the
<strong><span>same Windows Live ID</span></strong>.<br />

            <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed I know that I can upload files to SkyDrive. However, the question arises because I don't want to do it manually; having to select specific files and folders every time and then uploading them. What I want is to take a picture with my camera, and for
 it to automatically be available on SkyDrive - like it does on Windows Phone 8, for example. Is there any way to either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the default save location of Camera app to a SkyDrive location, so instead of C:\Users\USERNAME\Pictures\Camera Roll. E.g. setting it to SkyDrive\Pictures\Camera Roll, or</li><li>Set so that contents of C:\Users\USERNAME\Pictures\Camera Roll is synchronised automatically with a folder on SkyDrive such as SkyDrive\Pictures\Camera Roll?</li></ol>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure that this is possible with Surface RT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ordinarily, from a standard Windows 8 device, you could install&nbsp;the SkyDrive <em>
desktop</em> app, and it would create a folder on your PC that would automatically sync its contents into the cloud, whether they be pictures from your camera or otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Surface RT cannot run the SkyDrive desktop app. It can only run the version of the SkyDrive app that is in the Windows Store, which is (in essence)&nbsp;a front end to the SkyDrive website. You can manually upload contents to SkyDrive with this app, but you
 won't get the synchronized folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

            <p>I don't have my Surface in front of me, but I do remember looking at the app store over the weekend and noticed that there's an app that synchronises with SkyDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you run a marketplace search for "SkyDrive", you should see it.&nbsp; Might be worth investigating.</p>

<br />
I've got to admit, this is one of the most ludicris problems, and I think we're shipping back our surface units today because of it.<br />
<br />
We purchased 8, which we had hoped to use in our maintenance app, replacing iPads.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we use them to mostly RDP, this seemed sensible.&nbsp;&nbsp; But whereas the iPads allow us to take a photo and have it instantly appear on all other ipads on those so that they
 could train with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereas before, maintenance staff could take a photo and *bam* everyone in the staff had it, now they would have to go to skydrive, manually upload..<br />
<br />
This seems ridiculous when the Windows Phone 8 does this automatically, iPads do this automatically, Android does this automatically..&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, despite the fact that the RDP client is fantastic and works better than what we've experienced elsewhere, this is
 a significant dealbreaker.&nbsp;&nbsp; It basically makes these tablets nearly worthless to us.<br />
<br />
That's too bad because a lot of the platform really makes sense to us, and it really works out.. but it baffles me that Microsoft would setup Skydrive on these and protect documents, but not think original content created on them... LIKE THE PHOTOS FROM THE
 INBUILT CAMERA should automatically go to the SkyDrive.. I mean, that is a completely bonkery development.<br />

            I know this is months after the fact but it is simple.&nbsp; Go to PC Settings under SkyDrive there is a setting for Camera Roll to automatically upload photos and at what quality.&nbsp; Works pretty easy but was confusing why it was occurring at first since that
 was my default. <br />

    <title>Windows 10 WiFi issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> levigradiz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 WiFi issue</h2>
                    Hello. Did my upgrade to Windows 10 on a Nextbook 10.1 tablet, everything went pretty smooth. I even had Internet connection right off the bat. However, in the last couple of days my connectivity seems to drop off constantly. It seems to recognize the
 modem and it connects automatically but just as quickly it goes to limited access, which has no connection at all. I resettled the modem and that didn't really do anything for it, and I read about the cmd method but my problem seems different than theirs because
 unlike theirs my system picks up the available networks. I downgraded back to 8.1 and everything was fine, went to device manager and Uninstalled everything that wasn't a LAN, re upped to 10 and still have the same issue. Went back to 8.1 and Uninstalled everything
 else and went back to 10 and same. Just before this post I ran Troubleshooting and it said it didn't have a valid i.p connection but it "fixed" it but still went out. &nbsp;Any ideas? Thank you in advance.&nbsp;

<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this happens in another user account?

<p>This only happens when I am trying to play Events, in the Microsoft Solitaire Collection.&nbsp; There are no other issues with other games.&nbsp; There have been several people with the same issue, and as far as I understand they have not been able to resolve the
 problem either. I am using the Xbox/Windows 10 format playing the games.&nbsp; When you go back to the event tab and check on previous standings it only gives you the points for the game, and no time, the time icon is spinning.&nbsp; This also happened on 1-31, and
 when you check that day the little icon is spinning and no time registers for your play, only gives you credit on one game because it keeps throwing you out of the game, back to the main screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying to help with this.</p>

            Thanks for all your help.&nbsp; The problem turned out to be with Microsoft programming.&nbsp; They have fixed it and no more problems.&nbsp; I haven't been ignoring you, I had to wait until it happened again.&nbsp; A lot more people were affected so the problem was dealt
 with.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>"These links are now dead.&nbsp; I need a way&nbsp;to get the MTP garbage working, as I&nbsp;cannot connect my Samsung Galaxy S2 to my XP service pack 3-version PC as a "media device" ever since the phone did an "upgrade" to Ice Cream Sandwich&nbsp;which&nbsp;has switched it to
 this MTP garbage&nbsp;(the way it connected&nbsp;before was as a USB connection, and it worked fine on "Gingerbread")."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am having the&nbsp;exact same problem with XP SP-3 but with a Motorola Atrix HD.&nbsp; Updating to WMP11 did no good; the computer&nbsp;refuses to recognize the phone.&nbsp; I connected the phone to&nbsp;a Vista system and the phone popped right up.&nbsp;Help!</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do you receive any error codes or messages?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>You may try running the Hardware device Fixit from the link and check for the issue:</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            White Elite Controller revisions&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I was thinking about preordering the white elite controller but was wondering if there were any revisions to the bumpers. my last one the LB broke off in 4 months and was out of warranty and im not paying for repair on a 150$ controller. So basically just
 wondering if they made the plastic any stronger?

<p>I doubt it’ll be any different than what they have now. If they were built better they’d be shouting that from the rooftops because the standard Elite controllers are built very poorly. In my opinion, they are the biggest waste of money for any console accessory
 ever and that includes the 32x, Kinect etc etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’d wait for a complete overall and redesign so that the quality is there.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Authenticator Android app and fingerprints - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fabiopolidori  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Authenticator Android app and fingerprints</h2>
                    <p>Hi, the past few days a notification kept popping up on my laptop, from Microsoft, saying I can use the Microsoft authenticator app on android to login via fingerprints.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on the notification send me to this page:</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/authenticator?cmp=3kd316_qw9r2t</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the android app from the link, configured and verified the account. It's all set, all it do is giving me the eight digit code for pin authentication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How I configure it, and windows, to authenticate via fingerprint scanner?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Some context:</p>
<p>- My Nexus 5X android Device has fingerprint scanner and I use it all the time for android.</p>
<p>- I tried configuring Windows Hello, but it say I don't have a compatible device attached to the PC, and sends me to a generic windows hello page.</p>
<p>- I found lot of info on internet for doing this exact thing using third party software. I don't want use third party software to authenticate on my laptop: I prefer to use password if that is the only option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Microsoft Authentication app would not allow you to login to your device with a fingerprint, it is for signing into Microsoft Account on a web browser.

<h2>            BSOD &#40;System Service Exception&#41; only while gaming.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having BSOD's on and off now for about 2 years and have exhausted all options thus far. I have replaced almost all my hardware except motherboard, ram, cpu. I have updated all drivers, software and windows dozens of times. I upgraded from Windows
 7 to Windows 10 last year and the BSOD persisted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly it will only BSOD while gaming at random times. I could play 3 hours without it and then poof. Normally I only get the error message "System Service Exception", but every now and then I'll get a different message like "IRQL Not Equal or Less".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So any help would be appreciated. I could send you my dump file as well if need be. Here is a little sample.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Description:<br />
The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck.&nbsp; The bugcheck was: 0x0000003b (0x00000000c0000005, 0xfffff80114164e22, 0xffffab8130dc7380, 0x0000000000000000). A dump was saved in: C:\WINDOWS\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: f182ef02-5df8-4759-b44e-e7d1b827752b.</p>

            <p>I think you have 4 8gb Ripjaws installed, and according to the specs for these RAM Modules, they should be at 1333MHz and can be OC'D up to 2133MHz?? Am I reading this wrong?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All four of yours, according to the Windows debugger output are all running at 667MHz. Am I missing something?</p>

</p><p>How do I perform a clean install of my Nvidia drivers?</p>

            <p>Yes I have 4 8gb ram sticks. The ram speed in the bios screen says 1333 mhz. I think that's just the single ram speed default? In system information and under NVidia control panel it says 1333 mhz. I've tried in the past bumping it up to 2133 MHz but my
 games get kinda messed up if I do. That's a separate issue all together I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the Nvidia driver being the culprit. It's possible but I've uninstalled previous drivers and did a clean install a few times. I've also gone into device manager and completely removed my GPU and all drivers related. I recently got the GTX 1080
 from a 980 Ti that died.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something I'm missing as far doing a clean install? Do I have to go into the registry and remove the old drivers?</p>

<h2>            Advanced Start Up not accessible</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to boot to safe mode, in Win 8.1&nbsp;&nbsp; First through PC Settings.&nbsp; When&nbsp; I clicked on Advanced Start Up/ Restart, it restarted, no options on how to restart.&nbsp; The same for holding Shift&nbsp;+ F8, the laptop simply restarted.&nbsp; I would like to access trouble
 shooting options, in the Restart options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it makes a bit of difference, I wanted to do this because I was having problems turning off password protection.&nbsp; I had accessed User Accounts, using the run command "netplwiz".&nbsp; Sometimes it would boot without a password required, other times it would
 be required.&nbsp; Then, it just refused to boot, even after the password was entered.&nbsp; Using the Shift + F8 I did get it to boot, and, for safety, simply required a password, until I sort out the problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help will be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>New Info:&nbsp; When holding only the Shift key, I receive this error message:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\logonerror\system32\ul.exe</p>

            <p><span>Hi John, </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These are some of the ways you can use to boot to Advanced startup options:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: SHIFT + Restart</span></p>
<p><span>1.Hold down either SHIFT key while tapping or clicking on Restart, available from any Power icon.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: This method does not seem to work with the on-screen keyboard. You'll need to have a physical keyboard connected to your computer or device to open the Advanced Startup Options menu
 this way.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></p>
<p><span>2.Wait while the Advanced Startup Options menu opens.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: PC Settings.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Swipe from the right to open the charms bar.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Tip: If you have a keyboard, use WIN+I and then skip to Step 3.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></p>
<p><span>2.Tap or click on Settings.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></p>
<p><span>3.Tap or click on Change PC settings at the bottom of the charms bar.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></p>
<p><span>4.Choose Update and recovery from the list of options on the left of the PC settings window.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Prior to Windows 8.1, choose General instead and then skip to Step 6.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></p>
<p><span>5.Choose Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></p>
<p><span>6.Locate Advanced startup, at the bottom of the list of options on your right.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></p>
<p><span>7.Tap or click on Restart now.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></p>
<p><span>8.Wait through the “Please wait message” until Advanced Startup Options opens.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reply with the status of the issue and we will be glad to offer our assistance.</span></p>

<p>Method 1 resulted in a restart/reboot, to the log in screen.&nbsp; Not to advanced start up options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 did nothing, except reboot to a blank blue screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called my laptop maker, and&nbsp;it had built in a reboot using F9.&nbsp; Just as the old F8 procedure.&nbsp; But, I still would like to know how tor repair the Method 2 way of accessing Advanced Start Up.</p>

<p>I have only seen it demonstrated (in a Build blog video) using the OSK from the Accessibility button on the Login screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps that is enough of a difference?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW I think the&nbsp; shutdown.exe&nbsp; /r&nbsp; /o&nbsp;&nbsp; suggestion would avoid any problems with the Shift- key.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>

<h2>            Games wont sync data - rendering games unplayable &#47; won&#39;t launch</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I've recently installed some games I want to play again and I can't launch either of them. Gears of War 4 and Forza Horizon 3 say that they are connecting to sync my user data, but that's as far as they get. They're either stuck on 0% (tried leaving for hours)
 or the game launches to the main screen and nothing happens.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I tried resetting the xbox app and un-installing and re-installing but this didn't work.

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Did you</span></span></span><span><span><span>update
 the Lexmark printer drivers for Windows Vista?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. Were you able to print on Vista before without any issues?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If you are using a network printer, then you may try connecting the printer directly to your Laptop and check
 if you can print.</span></span></span></p>

<p>I bought Apple USB Ethernet Adapter, but it didn't work.</p>
<p>I was not able to locate the right drivers either.</p>

            <p>The Apple USB NIC is proprietary and Apple provides no Windows drivers. Previously you could get the driver files online from someone who had built them but they are unsigned so you would have to disable driver signing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This USB NIC works great:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cisco-USB300M-Cisco-Linksys-Ethernet-Adapter/dp/B001NLV4TQ/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362020214&amp;sr=8-1-spell&amp;keywords=cusco+usb+nic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Cisco-USB300M-Cisco-Linksys-Ethernet-Adapter/dp/B001NLV4TQ/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362020214&amp;sr=8-1-spell&amp;keywords=cusco+usb+nic</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gigabit-Ethernet-Network-Indicator-Warranty/dp/B00A0ABQLM/ref=sr_1_5?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362020288&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=usb+nic+gigabit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Gigabit-Ethernet-Network-Indicator-Warranty/dp/B00A0ABQLM/ref=sr_1_5?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362020288&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=usb+nic+gigabit</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been some issues with USB 3 on the SP so be wary of that. Otherwise both should work fine. I would seek a more reliable Windows solution instead of the Apple adapter.</p>

                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had spoke with one of the xbox ambassadors via the web chat about my game restarting after I completed a heist (GTAV) and they advised me to delete and reinstall the game. Since doing this, the game now crashes on the loading screen and doesn't actual
 enter the game at all.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello, I have done this, I don't know if you've played GTAV, but because of me deleting it and reinstalling it, its reset the whole game and when I started doing the first mission, it stops and crashes as soon as I go through to 'threaten the people inside'.</p>

<p>Hello, mine is a xbox 360, a xbox one game wouldn't work would it? I'm also going back to the shop I bought it from to see if I can exchange the discs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when reinstalling and playing for a while with my friends discs, my online data is saved and I've got that back but not the normal mode. Any chance of getting that back when I didn't know there was a cloud I could activate on the xbox?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to the Forums for insight on getting your cloud saves set up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer your last post, a One version of the game will not work as GTA V is not backwards compatible and backwards compatible games don't even work that way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you had previously overwritten the save you have, or weren't able to save your progress last time, you would have to start from the point it did save to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player is loading unwanted media files.</h2>
                    <p>For some unexplained reason wav and mp3 files from folders other than My Music, eg. My Documents and Microsoft Train Simulator backup folders wthin My Documents&nbsp;have been loading and trying to retrieve informaation for these files.</p>
<p>I have tried the recommended advice on deleting the Media Player Folder after stopping Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service but it still reverts to loading unwanted files.</p>

<h2>            Disable external USB drive autoplay&#63; Windows 7 Pro.</h2>
                    <p>I have two USB external drives connected to my computer. Every time I boot up, an Autoplay window appears for each drive asking me what I want to do with it. It gives&nbsp;2 choices of "Open folder to view files", or "View more AutoPlay options in Control Panel".
 If I select to view more AutoPlay options, my USB drives are not listed at the bottom of AutoPlay under devices. I want to continue using AutoPlay for my CD/DVD drives, but I want to stop the AutoPlay windows from appearing every time I boot the computer.
 It is frustrating to have to click the X on both of these windows every time I boot the computer.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            So, i faced the same problem with my external HDD 1TB. I read all the replies here but none of them helped. Here is the solution that worked for me.<br />
<br />
First make vissible all hidden folders and files.<br />
To make this follow:<br />
<br />
1.Click Organize ----&gt;Open Folder and search Options----&gt;Click View<br />
<br />
<br />
To Show Protected Operating System Files<br />
NOTE: For example, desktop.ini files.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) Uncheck the Hide protected operating system files box.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B) A Warning message appears,click on Yes to confirm.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C) Click OK<br />
<br />
<br />
2. To Show Hidden Files, Folders, and Drives<br />
NOTE: This will also allow hidden drives to show despite if Hide empty drives in the Computer folder is checked.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) Select&nbsp; Show hidden files, folders, and drives.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B) Click on the Apply button. <br />
<br />
Open your HDD<br />
Check if there is a folder named autorun.inf<br />
Check if there is a file named autorun.inf<br />
Delete both of them.<br />
Then create a new folder with name autorun.inf and leave it empty.<br />
<br />
In case you don't like to see the folder make these few steps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To super hidde this folder open a command prompt.<br />
Click Start and in search type cmd.<br />
<br />
Then go to your HDD root.<br />
For example we assuming that the drive letter of the disk is E.<br />
You must type.<br />
E:\<br />
E:\attrib e:\autorun.inf +s +h<br />
<br />
That's it,close command prompt and hidde again your hidden files and folders.<br />
<br />
Restart your computer and see if it worked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>.bat files won&#39;t open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> quinnvan de keere  say:</h3>
<h2>            .bat files won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I've been getting this error for every single .bat file I open. It goes like this:</p>
<p>Windows cannot find 'C:\Users\User\Desktop\mybatfile.bat'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again.</p>
<p>Like I said, It doesn't matter what file I open and where I open it. I just always get this error. I am double clicking on the file to open it. I am trying to open it from on my desktop. I read some posts of other people having a similar problem and their
 solution was to make sure the ComSpec variable was the correct format. Unlike those people, my ComSpec variable is the correct format and it still isn't working. I even tried restarting my computer but I still have had no luck. If I could get some help, that
 would be great. Thank you!</p>

            Hi Quinn please try this:
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center 
<br />
<br />Go to Virus &amp; threat protection - Virus &amp; threat protection settings 
<br />
<br />Depending on your version of Windows, you may have to select 'Ransomware Protection'
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access 
<br />
<br />Turn that option off
<br />
<br />Then try to execute a batch file from your Desktop - does it succeed?

    <title>Issues connecting to Netflix and Amazon Prime - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vicinalpepper20  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues connecting to Netflix and Amazon Prime</h2>
                    Everytime I try to launch amazon prime or netflix, my Xbox One S suddenly stops my WiFi working. By this, I don’t mean it disconnects, but rather it will throw a generic can’t connect to server Error Code on the app of choice, so when I then test my network
 connection it claims it cannot connect to IP or DNS, or other similar things. These issues don’t occur when playing games, or on any other devices I use so I’m confused as to why this has happened?&nbsp;

<p>Hi there Vicina, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I'm sorry to hear about the connectivity issue with the Netflix and Amazon Video app. I recommend to try
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycling the Xbox One&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;(Disconnect and reconnect your console's power cable0 and the network hardware. This may help any disruption that may be occurring with the IP address associated with the Xbox One network set up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, try the following article to Soft Reset the consoles operating system :
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to reset your console to factory defaults on Xbox One</a>. Please make sure to choose the option
<strong>Reset and keep my games &amp; apps.</strong></p>
<p>Important note: Please make sure to know your account emails/passwords and have a stable internet connection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this out and let us know the results. </p>

            Hi there i would perform a power cycle reset and remove your xbox profile and re add it in case its a issue with authentication, i would also reinstall the apps for both netflix and amazon prime video if you have not done already.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sometimes temporary memory stored can cause problems, it could also be your networks router firewall blocking the connection so you may need to check your router firewall settings as well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kind Regards<br />

            I would recommend performing a full shut down and reboot of the console, as well as possibly uninstalling and reinstalling both apps.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as you were online when you were playing FH4 on your PC, the save game will also be stored in the Microsoft Xbox cloud servers.&nbsp; You must be signed in with the same account you were using prior to formatting your hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you launch the game for the first time on PC, a Window will pop up downloading your progress from the Microsoft Cloud.&nbsp; If you stop this download, you won't get back your previous progress and would start the game again from the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you having technical difficulties with Windows 10 that you need to keep formatting your system?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PC'nizde FH4 oynatırken çevrimiçi olduğunuz sürece, kaydetme oyunu ayrıca Microsoft Xbox bulut sunucularında da depolanacaktır. Sabit sürücünüzü biçimlendirmeden önce kullandığınız hesaba giriş yapmış olmanız gerekir.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oyuna bir PC'de ilk defa başladığınızda, ilerlemenizi Microsoft Cloud'dan indiren bir pencere açılır. Bu indirmeyi durdurursanız, önceki ilerlemenizi geri alır ve oyuna baştan başlar.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sisteminizi biçimlendirmeye devam etmek için Windows 10 ile ilgili teknik sorunlar mı yaşıyorsunuz?</strong></p>
<p>
