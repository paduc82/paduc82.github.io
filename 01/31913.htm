<h2>            In built web cam on HP laptop stopped working because windows 7 has stopped it &#40;Code 43&#41;. Appears to be driver problem but not clear how to reinstall.  Any advice&#63;  </h2>
                    Windows seems to see the in built web cam&nbsp;as an unrecognised device attached to a USB port.&nbsp; The device type is USB controllers and the Manufacturer Standard USB Host Controller The driver provider is Microsoft.&nbsp; I've run through the troubleshooting guide
 on the lap top and it says the device driver is up to date.&nbsp; Also hd messages sayingdriver installation failed.&nbsp; I've tried system restore (going back a few days) &amp; this seemed to work initially but when&nbsp;I try to use Skype windows shuts the web cam down&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi Scott carmichael,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. What is the model number of your HP laptop?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Code 43 implies that Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>One of the drivers controlling the device notified the operating system that the device failed in some manner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I’d recommend you to&nbsp;<strong>d<span>isable and re-enable the USB controller</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><span>and check if that does the trick.</span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Use Device Manager to disable and re-enable all the USB controllers. This lets the controllers recover the USB port from its unresponsive condition.
 The USB controllers represent the USB ports in Device Manager.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To disable and re-enable the USB controllers, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>
 , type&nbsp; "<strong>device manager"</strong> in theStart search box and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Expand<strong>
 Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong> .<br />
<strong><br />
Note</strong> You might have to scroll down the list to find this item.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 the first USB controller under&nbsp;<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong> , and then click&nbsp;<strong>Uninstall</strong> to remove it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Repeat
 the above step for each USB controller that is listed under&nbsp;<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong> .</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 the computer. After the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan for hardware changes and reinstall all the USB controllers that you uninstalled.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Check
 the USB device to see whether it is working.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>Additionally, you may re-install the chipset drivers and check if that fixes the issue. Visit the manufacturer’s website and download and install
 the latest Windows 7 compatible drivers. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For more information on updating drivers, see&nbsp;<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Update
 drivers: recommended links</span> </a></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Uninstall and Re-install the webcam from the device manager:</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><br />
You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</p>
<p><br />
a. Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Security, and then, under System, clicking Device Manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Administrator permission required If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p><br />
b. In the list of usb devices or imaging devices locate the webcam and right click on it and then click on Uninstall.</p>
<p><br />
c. Restart the computer and webcam again, it will re-install it back automatically.</p>

<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />

<h2>            Can Bluetooth 3.0 driver be updated to that of 4.0&#63;</h2>
                    Hi. I own a <b>Lenovo G580 Notebook</b> supporting <b>Qualcomm Atheros Bluetooth 3.0</b>+<b>HS</b><b>&nbsp;AR3011</b>. My question is whether I can install a

<b>here</b></a> and so are given the system requirements. Please go through the page and tell me whether I can install it over my current driver. If it is possible then I am really very eager to move ahead with it and install the latest one :) And also please

            <p>Hi Deepak, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your computer runs satisfactorily now, it may not be necessary to update the software.</p>
<p><br />
However, upgrading is not guaranteed from Microsoft's end in this matter. It would be better if you contact the OEM(Original Equipment manufacturer)&nbsp;regarding this issue which in this case is Lenovo.

            Were you able to resolve this?&nbsp; I am having a similar problem.&nbsp; When I plug the usb in, the yoke and quadrant work fine.&nbsp; After a few minutes however, it stops working completely.&nbsp; If I unplug the usb and plug it back in, it works again for only a few
 minutes.&nbsp; I have tried in all my usb ports.&nbsp; I have tried un-installing and re-installing drivers.&nbsp; I've done the usb power fix where you disable the setting that lets windows shut the usb port down if inactive.&nbsp; I've tried everything I possibly can.&nbsp; Please
 tell me you have found a fix.&nbsp; If not, do you have any other suggestions I can try?<br />

<h2>            WiFi and WiFi printer connetivity</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 10 on a Lenovo Yoga laptop.&nbsp; I connect to the internet using WiFi and I have a WiFi printer.&nbsp; My question is how can I stay connected to BOTH the internet and my wireless printer at the same time.&nbsp; If I've been using the internet and
 want to print something, I have to clink the connection icon and manually reconnect to the wireless printer.&nbsp; When I'm done printing, I have to click the connection icon and manually reconnect to the internet.&nbsp; Both are setup (properly, I think) to automatically
 reconnect.&nbsp; It just seems that I cannot stay connected to both - seems to be an "either/or" situation.

            Hi James, what sort of connection do you have in your house?
<br />
<br />If you have a WiFi Router
<br />
<br />Basically both devices your PC and the Printer should be connected to your WiFi Router wirelessly
<br />
<br />There should be no Switching involved, when you say you switch to your printer - how are you doing that?       
        </p>

            This very much possible, since I have both a wireless network connection and wireless printer, both which I connect to without affecting the other.
<br />
<br />Does your home network lack a router?
<br />
<br />You don't want to click connect to your printer. You have Wireless Direct turned on. This is only for folks that have no router or ISP to connect in the house.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />You need to turn off Wireless Direct in the printer and connect the printer to your routers SSID with password.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you’re not able to connect your speakers via Bluetooth. I will certainly help you with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know a few information:</p>
<p><br />
1)&nbsp;Do you face any issues connecting other devices via Bluetooth?<br />
2)&nbsp;Have you installed the Bluetooth driver on your PC?<br />
3)&nbsp;Do you face any issues when speakers are connected with wire?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest you to follow the steps as mentioned below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why isn't Windows finding my Bluetooth or other wireless device?</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/why-isnt-windows-finding-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/why-isnt-windows-finding-device</span></a><br />
Applies to Windows 8 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp;Adjust the distance between the speaker and the Bluetooth device.<br />
2)&nbsp;Reset the speaker to its factory default settings. For instructions on how to reset your speaker, go to the product's support site to view the relevant knowledgebase article.<br />
3)&nbsp;Clear the current pairing entry from your Bluetooth device. For instructions on how to clear the pairing entries, consult the user's manual of your Bluetooth device.<br />
4)&nbsp;Try re-pairing the speaker and the Bluetooth device. For instructions on how to pair the speaker with the Bluetooth device, go to the product's support site to view the relevant knowledgebase article.<br />
5)&nbsp;To further isolate, try pairing the speaker with other Bluetooth device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Your problem is with the finding of the speaker. Most of these devices need you to press and hold a button, usually the power button from when the speaker is turned off, to allow you to make the device visible.&nbsp;

            But when I connect speaker with my phone, it display the name in the list of Bluetooth devices and get connected without holding the button. In laptop case, its not even showing the name of the speaker when I try to add a device.

 to uninstall Hamachi using the method of Control Panel---&gt;Uninstall a Program and select LogMeIn Hamachi for uninstall, a window pops up reading "<span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">This

    <title>Win10 reboot loop and troubleshooting issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erickda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 reboot loop and troubleshooting issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So recently my notebook suddenly has reboot loop issues, so at this point I cannot get to my log in screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>After researching the issue, I tried following the the answer from&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-10-restart-loop/d47eee3c-b3db-42ea-8f56-6b57dfe78003</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is that, as I tried the Startup Repair, it says it couldn't repair my PC and there is some kind of referencing to log file: C:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i tried command prompt, what I found after I input command bootrec /scanos and /rebuildbcd is that it says there are 0 windows installation identified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to reset my PC with removing all my files, it also says there is a driver partition missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to install windows, the primary disk falls under OEM type and it says I can't install it there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I am really lost and don't know what to do</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I sadly couldn't revert to the previous OS, I'm not sure why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My notebook is Razer Blade QHD+ intelcore i7 4720HQ and 16GB Memory. It was preloaded with Windows 8 and I upgraded it myself to Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not that tech-savvy so If anyone could give a detailed instruction on how to resolve it, it would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much beforehand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BEHAVIOUR UPDATE:</p>
<p>Now I do not need my Windows 10 Installation USB again to get pass the boot screen. Now It will start to do "automatic repair" but then it will fail and able to continue to blue "advance option" screen that I attached the image. Still unable to go to log
 in screen though.</p>

            <p>Hi Thofikh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was freely upgraded through Windows Update and my Windows version on my troubled PC is 10.0.10240. But, I used Windows 10 Installation USB that I made myself to try to repair it, otherwise I wouldn't be able to pass the boot option screen (the screen
 shows the logo of my manufacturer and shows something like "press &lt;F12&gt; for Boot Menu".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, currently, the PC behave differently, it will attem "automatic recovery", then failed, and I am able to go to "advanced option" even without my Windows 10 Installation USB (I have updated my main post with image showing the screen which contain
 "advanced option" within "Troubleshoot" option). I tried my best but all my attempt to repair it did not work. I have listed all things I have done on my main post above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My previous OS is Windows 8 and yes, it was the active OS prior to the upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the information I gave will help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>I have not tried to reset my PC by fully clean the drive as I am too scared if the result will just make everything worse.</p>

            My Dell pc is doing the exact same thing. &nbsp;I turned it on and it went to the repair loop and nothing i do fixes it. I had Windows 7 and i used the free online Windows 10 upgrade last month. &nbsp;I used the usb for win 10 for back up which didn't work either.
 &nbsp;I tried reverting back to my windows 7 and that didn't work either. &nbsp;Ieven tried the command prompt from videos on YouTube. Looking online it seems there was an auto update and after that, users were not able to run Windows again. I just want all my pictures
 &amp; personal files, &nbsp;the ones that havent been backed up in the last month and a clean version of 10 back on without having to pay since i had an upgrade.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 Skype opens new split chat windows bigger than my monitor.</h2>
                    Each time I double click a contact to begin an IM session, the new pop-up is too big. Like bigger than my screen. I have to drag the&nbsp;interface to my other monitor to resize and drag back. How can this be corrected?

            Hi WGambella
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

So by changing build to 8.41. I have now lost split-screen mode.&nbsp; I may typically have 5-10 chats going on which I now can't see independently. What is the workaround for that?

            Don't worry, you haven't lost anything. 
<br />
<br />If you need Split View mode then that is available only in Store version. This must already be on your computer. You will have two Skypes - One is Store version and one is Skype for Desktop.
<br />
<br />If Store version is missing, reinstall from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>

<h3> chowcifer  say:</h3>
<h2>            What are the risk&#63;</h2>
                    So I live in a country where Xbox live isn't Availble, I was so desperate to play it online that I created a fake billing address in the US, while paying the subscription fees to them through PayPal, I had all the fake billing address with me, just in
 case i need to change something in the future,I turned off the auto renewal to make sure I don't have unpaid bills because I don't want them to try to find me since I'm using fake billing address info, will I be involved in taxes issues because I bought the
 items as a US costumer due to my billing info set in the US, but I'm actually from Asia, will they sued me for shipping taxes evasion? I'm Cambodian and please help by answer and provide useful advice From A Guy who just want to play Xbox Live in peace!

<p>Hey Chow. As mentioned, using correct information in your account is required by our Terms. Trying to circumvent the system by getting LIVE in a region it is not intended for is no excuse for using false information. As for taxes and international shipping
 issues, we would not be able to comment on those matters. Hopefully this clears things up from our end at least. Thanks!</p>

<h3> amroeldosoky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Credential Manager, Verify, Sign in options in Windows 10 Pro 1607</h2>
                    before updating I changed all the permissions on C to get to access some folders then I changed them back to the windows trusted installer I had problems with the credential manager services and if I started it it wouldn't let the windows start and I get
 the spinning wheel for hours and I couldn't get in sign in options<br />
After updating to 1607 which happened just a few days from now credential manager services works without stopping the start up but sometimes the sign in options opens and sometimes it doesn't and I don't really know what is it depending on to act like that
 and I can't verify my account either when I click on the pin change button or the verify or login as a local or login with an account the windows go blank like it is having issues with the graphic drivers or something or it opens the lock screen like it is
 starting up or it tells me an internal server error<br />
I tried to make another account it is having the same problems so I deleted it I tried to login as a local in the same account it took a lot of time just trying to change so I didn't stand it and restarted when it started up it was logged in as a local account
 and when I try to login to my account the same cycle and problems above happens<br />
I have a pretty old laptop hp 6730b compaq but believe me it is better than the newest laptops I get to work on Autodesk newest programs on that lap without problems and I like created everything on it as my own and I know how to fix it like it is a living
 thing so I don't have the time to make a new windows<br />
any help would be very great?

            Thanks for the reply but it didn't help<br />
the troubleshooting didn't help now and I don't think it has ever helped me before but in just two or three problems<br />
and the safe mode option doesn't solve anything too it just gives me access to the computer when I can't login but it doesn't make something work<br />
is there anything else I can do cause I am still facing these problems<br />
I can't sign in my account or verify it or use pin codes

    <title>Windows 10 stuck in boot loop after Anniversary Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andreasciab&#224;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 stuck in boot loop after Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>after downloading and installing the Anniversary update, my desktop PC (Asus Maximus VIII Extreme, Core i7 6700K, Samsung 950 Pro as system drive) is stuck in an infinite cycle of reboots, where it restarts after some seconds of reaching the Windows logo
 (the message "Restarting" is visible for a fraction of a second).</p>
<p>I tried to repair Windows from an USB installation media, but to no avail. In particular:</p>
<p>- There is no way to use system restore</p>
<p>- Startup repair says that it couldn't repair the PC</p>
<p>- "go back to the previous build" says that it ran into a problem and asks me to reset the current build, but THE OPTION "RESET THIS PC" DOES NOT EVEN EXIST</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, there is no evident way to repair the installation. The only option seems to be to format the system drive and install from scratch, but I refuse to believe that Microsoft would put its customers in such a situation just for having tried
 to install the most important Windows 10 update after its release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any solutions available?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Ashwin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disconnected everything but mouse and keyboard, still the same issue.</p>
<p>I tried several times to enter Safe Mode by holding pressed or pressing repeatedly F4, but it didn't work, most probably because I have an SSD and the boot is too fast to catch the key press.</p>
<p>I was thinking: is it possible that the problem is due to having as system disk an M.2 PCIe SSD?</p>
<p>Another guess: if I try to reinstall Windows on the same partition as before, I'm told that it's impossible because the disk has an MBR partition table and on EFI systems Windows cal only be installed to GPT disks. So, maybe something changed with the Anniversary
 update which made my system drive not good?</p>
<p>I can still access the files on that volume if I open the command prompt from the recovery screen.</p>
<p />

            <p>I've managed to go into Repair mode from boot partition with SSD by going into my BIOS, then exiting without saving and pressing fast F8. This way it manages to run Repair sometimes. From it I can select an option to return back to previous windows version
 (not a system restore point but last item in list). I did install of this update two times and both times I'm also stuck in a boot loop. Too bad. Also, it asked for my password before restoring previous version on second try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, when I'm launching Repair mode from HDD partition with fresh Windows 10 install media it fails to find Windows to manage - both System Restore or Restore to previous version. Also not very nice.</p>

            <p>I've got the same situation. I downloaded the Anniversary Update from Microsoft's site and installed it. At the end my PC restarted three times while updating the system and then went into endless reboot loop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried many ways to change UEFI BIOS setup settings but nothing helped. System Restore disk options didn't help either. First, I thought there was a mistake in updating and restored my system disk with &nbsp;the help of an Acronis backup made by me before
 updating. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I took a second take. The result is the same. Everything goes fine till the very last reboot. Instead of presenting the updated system I get terribly irritating cycling restarting and nothing can do away with it.<br />

            <p>Eventually I gave up and reinstalled Windows from scratch, which was not even so bad after all (I repartitioned the system drive using GPT instead of MBR and now the boot is much faster).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What pissed me off wasn't even the problem itself, but the total inability to revert the system to a working state using the official recovery tools. It's even impossible to get any hint at what was the cause of the problem, as no error message was ever
 displayed. I understand the wish to protect the average user from too much information, but at least people with technical skills should be able to see what's going wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another total disappointment was the Microsoft support chat: they simply didn't have a clue, and asked me to do crazy things like removing my video card or my HDDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway it's comforting to see that Anton and Ramix experienced the very same problem, in every detail: at least I'm not crazy. :)</p>

            I had this problem as well. I used another PC to create an installation disk with the latest ISO from Microsoft. With this disk and no other Windows Disk, I was able to use the Go Back to the Previous Build Option.

            <p>I am definitely not a techie but I tried to update to the Windows 10 anniversary &amp; it got stuck in a forever loop. &nbsp;I had to turn off my computer, then turn it on again (it went back into loop mode). The second time I turned off &amp; turned on, the computer
 restored itself on its own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone figured out why it is not updating properly?</p>

            <p>Is it a branded PC from one of the larger manufacturers or from a small system builder and how long have you had it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are&nbsp;3 basic types of Windows installation that can expire. Any installation that has no key supplied will expire after 30 days. The Enterprise Edition trial license is valid for&nbsp;90 days. Volume Licenses can only be installed in corporate environments
 and must reauthenticate with a license management server every 6 months.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The BIOS date (2011) would make it feasible that it was supplied with Windows 7 but which version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be a COA label underneath or in the battery tray which will list the version of Windows that&nbsp;can be on the computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not familiar with the&nbsp;make but HCL India sell both their own brand as well as Lenovo, has this system been repaired at some time? Each major manufacturer has its own key and one manufacturer image cannot be used on another computer.</p>

<h2>            Lag when opening the application for the second time</h2>
                    <p>I've been facing this problem since a week now.<br />
When i boot the system and open an application specifically games it opens quickly without any lag.</p>
<p>If i quit the game and open it again it takes more than a minute to launch,after the launch if i quit the game it takes another 30 seconds to close the application.</p>
<p>And until the next reboot all games lag the same way.</p>
<p>I've no problems in gameplay.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is Lenovo Y700 running Windows 10 home build 14393.222</p>
<p>with latest nvidia drivers installed.</p>

How much RAM (memory) do you have installed, what is the maximum you can install and are your games online or offline?

            <p>Okay, then I would figure that the next step is to figure out your hardware and perhaps the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if this will work? http://www.windowscentral.com/how-successfully-install-windows-10-build-14393222-workaround</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may address the problem you are having, which I'm suspecting is involving saving game data. It's also a fairly common emergent problem from the latest updates a I understand...I'm using 7 but troubleshooting is not OS specific.</p>

<p>Try this: Look for the BT Driver in device manager and disable the option to turn off this device to save battery under the power management tab.</p>

<h2>            RA Media Server became an Administrator after changing my account to standard user</h2>
                    What is the password?<br />
<br />
RA Media Server became an Administrator after changing my account to standard user. Now, I can't get my admin rights back because it kept asking for admin password which I don't know. System restore did not help coz' it wasn't far back enough to the time I
 changed my account to standard user. <br />
<br />
I have called Dell but I don't want to pay the support service that costs more than a hundred bucks.<br />
<br />
I need help to how I could get my admin rights back again. <br />
<br />
I have no copy of installers to some of my important softwares that's why I'm afraid to reinstall the program or even do a system recovery.<br />
<br />
I'm using a vista 32-bit. The only solution I can think of is to gain "system user" but I don't know how.<br />
<br />
Please I need help.

Read info about it at above Dell link.<br />
<br />
It is Dell's software, not Vista's.<br />
<br />
If the info at the above link does not resolve the issue, contact Dell:<br />

                    Loaded W10 2 months ago. WLM was working fine. &nbsp;Now sent box is empty. &nbsp;Why?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us check if you have enable to save a copy of sent emails in Windows Live Mail. Follow the steps below and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>1. Open Windows Live Mail and click on <strong>File &gt; Options &gt; Mail</strong>.
</p>
<p>2. Click on the <strong>Send</strong> tab and check the box for <strong>Save a copy of sent mail in "Sent items" Folder</strong>.
</p>
<p>3. Click on <strong>Apply </strong>and then <strong>Ok</strong>. </p>
<p>

            <p>Not working:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thank you for those steps, which I followed but the Send Tab already had SAVE A COPY OF SENT MAIL IN "SENT ITEMS" FOLDER checked.&nbsp; I unchecked it and checked it back, clicked apply then OK.&nbsp; No change.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation of the missing sents happened during the same day that all sent items were properly showing.&nbsp; Later when going back to WLM they did not show from then on.&nbsp; Nothing was changed on my mail account which is Gmail.&nbsp; If I open Gmail through Google
 I can see my sents there.&nbsp; But I want to use WLM as my main option.&nbsp; I also tried a system restore which ran&nbsp;for several minutes, then&nbsp;said it could not restore the system.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also&nbsp;I tried to run a program check on WLM and was given a failed&nbsp;message.&nbsp; I was given the option to notify&nbsp;Microsoft and I clicked yes.&nbsp; That was days ago.&nbsp;

            This is just a stab in the dark as I don't even use WLMail, but while in Sent Items, click on the View Tab and then Filter Messages. Is
<em><strong>Show All Messages </strong></em>checked?<br />

            <p>Thank you Bruce but today WLM will not open at all. &nbsp;I ran a trouble shoot on it and was given this message INCOMPATIBLE PROGRAM. &nbsp;It will notify microsoft. &nbsp;Making it the 2nd notification. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went from W7 to W10 a few months ago and it said all programs and files would transfer to W10. &nbsp;And everything did transfer and worked fine for the first months. &nbsp;Now no WLM. &nbsp;WLM still shows but will not open.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, Windows Live Mail 2011 and Windows Live Mail 2009 is no longer supported by Microsoft. I would recommend you to install Windows Live Mail 2012 by downloading&nbsp;installing Windows Essentials package from
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> link. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also inform you that Windows Live Mail will no longer connect to Outlook.com email accounts upgraded to the new interface, therefore if you wish to add an Outlook email account to Windows Live Mail 2012 then please connect it using IMAP server settings
 through which you can access your emails but the contacts and calendar will not sync. For more information regarding this please refer
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Windows-Live-Mail-2012-will-not-connect-to-Outlook-com-45453b92-373b-4bbb-88ca-f8ec74f8e8fd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have installed Windows Live Mail 2012, add your Gmail account and then check if you still face the same issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jesinta Rozario</p>

<p>
</p><p>The Save a copy of SENT mail was checked. &nbsp;I unchecked it again, rechecked it, clicked APPLY and then OK.&nbsp; No changes resulted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice it had HTML checked for mail sending format and not PLAIN TEXT.&nbsp; Which I assumed made no difference for this GMAIL account on WLM.&nbsp; But I don't know.</p>
