<h2>            Dell laptop can&#39;t resume from sleep</h2>
                    <p><span>Today I had to leave the house,&nbsp;so I opened the power menu from the Windows button, and selected the option for my Dell Inspiron i5577 laptop to "Sleep." I come back later, hit the power button to turn the laptop on, and lo and behold, the power button
 light turns on. There is absolutely no power to the display of my laptop. My "gaming" mouse's rgb backlight is off, but whenever I click it, the rgb light comes on. It stays on as long as I hold the left or right click. My external monitor says there is no
 input from my laptop. I hold the power button down until the light on the power button turns off. I wait for a few seconds and then hold the power button to boot my laptop. I strongly believe it's due to no power going to the SSD when it comes back from sleep.
 It works fine now, but I do not understand what caused this and does this damage my laptop's hardware?</span><br />

            Hi Osly.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the Dell Support downloads webpage here <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Products/?app=drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Produ...</a> for your Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Update History, then uninstall them from the link there, and immediately hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here: <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2</a>...
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them: <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t</a>...
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi osly2081 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option.
<br />
<br />1. Troubleshoot Power
<br />Type troubleshoot in Cortana Search &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &gt; Click Power &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow on-screen direction.
<br />
<br />2. Restore Default for Power Settings
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; sleep &gt; Click Additional power settings to open Power options &gt; Click Change Plan Settings &gt; Click Restore default settings for this plan
<br />
<br />3. Disable Fast Startup
<br />Reach to Power options as in previous step &gt; Click Choose what the power buttons do &gt; Click Change settings that are currently unavailable &gt; Scroll down to Shutdown settings and uncheck Turn on fast startup &gt; Click Save changes
<br />
<br />4. Uninstall / Install Battery Driver
<br />Shut down your computer &gt; Detach power chord &gt; Remove battery (if fixed no need to remove) &gt; Attach power chord &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; Expand Batteries &gt; Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System &gt; Uninstall &gt; Shutdown the computer &gt; Remove the power chord &gt; Attach your battery &gt; Attach your power chord &gt; Reboot the computer to automatically install the driver
<br />
<br />5. Take actions related to Display Driver
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Display Adapter &gt; Right click on entry below &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Rollback the Driver 
<br />Click Properties &gt; Go to Driver tab &gt; If there is rollback option, click it
<br />
<br />B. Update driver from manufacturer's website
<br />Go to the website of the driver's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that &gt; In previous option, click Uninstall &gt; Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer 
<br />
<br />6. As a last resort, you should perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not an install of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<br />
<br />Then make the resulting .nfo file available via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site. 
<br />
<br />Also, can you do the following: 
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type eventvwr in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; expand "Custom Views" and then right-click "Administrative Events" &gt; select "Save all events in Custom View As" and save as an .evtx file 
<br />
<br />Then make the resulting .evtx file available via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.

            Hi James.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Run the Print troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Install the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall any printer software.    
<br />
<br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click printer to delete  Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />5) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />6) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>ok&nbsp;for some reason my old post has no characters in it and I cannot delete&nbsp;or edit it : ( can a mod or admin&nbsp;delete it for me&nbsp;please and thinks here is what my&nbsp;post should have said&nbsp;</p>
<p>I keep getting the disc unreadable error while playing games but if not getting that it's my console freezing the really weird part is I'm now getting the disc unreadable error on games that are installed to my HDD and demos two I thought it was my hard
 drive so I put the HDD on my sister's 360 elite and played for about 2 hours and didn't have a problem so I put the HDD back on my console and within 40 minutes it froze so from the way it looks it's my box that's messed up right? oh and in case you wanted
 to know my box is about 2 1/2 years old</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to effectively know the reason behind this, can you confirm what device are you using for the application? Also, have you tried pressing the Esc key on your key board and see if it helps? In most cases, users are dragging the ruler out of their screen
 if they are not using it but some are having issues using the virtual ruler as their device is not specifically compatible with the application. For further details regarding this, kindly check this link

    <title>Windows 7 screen saver password stops working spontaneously - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aluisious  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 screen saver password stops working spontaneously</h2>
                    I keep getting this problem where I go to my screen saver options, enable a blank screen saver for 10 minutes, select the option to require a login screen (password) on resume...and then after some days I'll leave my computer, come back and shake the mouse
 when the screen is blank, and go straight to the desktop. This is not acceptable security.<br />
<br />
I have power options set to turn the monitor off after 15 minutes, but the computer does not go to sleep at any time. I don't have any "group policies" that I'm aware of, this is a 3 month old, fairly simple installation on a PC. I have a theme running to put
 various pictures on the background but that shouldn't make a difference. There are FAQs that talk about "3rd party apps" being responsible but honestly that's a cop-out. I'm running Steam, Origins, SpeedFan, CPU-Z, nothing particularly amazing. Some Creative
 background apps that came with the sound card drivers. Either way it's ridiculous that a "3rd party app" could defeat something as elementary and vital as a screen saver password. Visa didn't have this problem, so why does the vaunted Windows 7 not work properly?<br />
<br />
Addition: I just watched the screen turn off while I was doing something in the same room, and the 10 minute screen saver never activated. It went straight to the 15 minute display power off. That would explain why the login screen doesn't come up but not why
 the screen saver isn't activating.<br />

            Let's check to make sure the setting is saved correctly in the Registry:
<div>
<ol>
<li>Click Start, type <b>regedit</b>&nbsp;into the Search box, then press Enter to run Registry Editor.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Open the following folders at the left: &nbsp;HKEY_CURRENT_USER, Control Panel, Desktop.<br />
<br />
</li><li>With Desktop selected, look at the right. &nbsp;Find&nbsp;<b>ScreenSaveActive </b>and make sure the value shows as 1 (for on). &nbsp;Also check to see that&nbsp;<b>ScreenSaverIsSecure
</b>is also equal to 1. &nbsp;Finally, make sure the&nbsp;<b>ScreenSaveTimeOut </b>is set correctly. &nbsp;10 minutes should read as 600 (the value is in seconds).</li></ol>
<div><br />
<div>If all of these are set, the issue may be a wireless mouse or keyboard. &nbsp;There is options to tell those devices to stop keeping the system from idling, so just let us know the results and we'll carry on.</div>

            Alright, here's another thing to try. &nbsp;I'm referencing this from Windows 8, but I am pretty sure the steps are the same in Windows 7:
<div>
<ol>
<li>Click Start, choose Devices and Printers, then double-click your mouse.<br />
<br />
</li><li>In the "device functions" list, double click an item (for example, <i>HID-Compliant Mouse</i>). &nbsp;A new window will open.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Click the <b>Change Settings</b> button. &nbsp;The dialog will close and re-open with expanded options.<br />
<br />
</li><li>On the Power Management tab, uncheck the option to allow the device to wake-up the computer, then click OK.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Return to step 2 and repeat for any other device functions (if any).</li></ol>
<div><br />
<div>This should stop the wireless communication from resetting the system idle timer.</div>
        </p>

            I tried that for a few days. It just failed to work after I let my computer idle while watching a movie on TV. The screen was off according to the power plan, but when I moved the mouse it still came back to the desktop without requiring a password.<br />
<br />
Oddly, the previous few times I tried to wake the computer, it did require a password.<br />
<br />
Really I don't see how the computer can be idle enough to turn the screen off, but not to start the screen saver 5 minutes prior. This never happened with Vista, so it must be a fault in Win 7. Also honestly, this is way too important to let something stupid
 like a wireless mouse setting prevent the system from locking.<br />

            I must have misunderstood -- I thought the system wasn't idling or screensaver coming on at all.
<div><br />
<div>So you have it set like this:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>At 10 minutes, screensaver should come on (and lock the computer when dismissed)</li><li>At 15 minutes, monitor should turn off completely</li></ul>
<div>So the screensaver is coming on, but it's not requiring a password? &nbsp;There is a grace period setting that might be misconfigured. &nbsp;It's not user-accessible, but it's in the registry (or group policy editor).</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>
<span>The
 key to add is called&nbsp;</span><strong>ScreenSaverGracePeriod</strong>&nbsp;(DWORD
 [<em>decimal:
 60</em>]), and goes into this registry key:&nbsp;<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows
 NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
With that set, the screensaver won't ask for a password until it's been active for more than 60 seconds. &nbsp;Try creating that value, and setting it to 0 seconds, so that you can override the default grace period and enforce your own policy of immediate lock (from&nbsp;<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd349797(WS.10).aspx#BKMK_13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd349797(WS.10).aspx#BKMK_13</a>).</p>

            Yes, at 10 minutes the screen saver should come on and require a password, and at 15 minutes the monitor turns off. The monitor always turns off as I expect.<br />
<br />
I haven't actually seen the screen saver activate because I tend to either be using the computer or going somewhere for longer than 15 minutes by the time I get back. All I know is the screen is off, I wiggle the mouse, and sometimes I have to enter a password,
 and other times I don't. <br />
<br />
I added the key you defined. I'm familiar with the grace period from using other computers.<br />
<br />
Anyway I'll see how it behaves for a while with the new key.<br />
<br />
Added: still works sometimes, and not others.<br />

            Yeah, sometimes it works, and not other times. I've seen the screen saver activate a few times, and any time I saw that the password worked. Other times the screen is off, and I wiggle the mouse and it comes back to the desktop with no password required.<br />

            I have exactly the same problem, I have the screen saver set to Blank and require a password to unlock it.<br />
For a while it works fine then it randomly&nbsp; stops and by moving the mouse the screen will fire back into life and display the desktop and NOT ask for a password. It will then be this way until I make a minor change to the settings e.g. add then minus a minute,
 then apply those changes. This as has been mentioned before is terrible security and a basic fundtion that MS should be able to get right after all these (tedious) versions of Windows being 'more secure than the last'<br />
<br />
For Ch***t's sake can't somebody at MS get this sorted. I'm soo fed up with having a PC that isn't secure because&nbsp; I'm using Windows!!<br />

            No it's with any of the standard screensavers supplied with Windows 7 although I usually use the 'Blank' screen saver. The password on re-displaying the desktop is more important than the screensaver used BTW.<br />

<br />
<br />Windows 10 automatically run maintenance activities in background. 
<br />
<br />If something is wrong, you can run System Maintenance troubleshooter from Settings app &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot. See if it helps you. 
<br />

            Hi Madhuri.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Until then you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />These steps will introduce you to the built-in maintenance which is adequate for WIndows 10 providing you have a good install and stick with the steps I've given to keep it that way.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> toshibalaptoppwner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Someone is using my password-free wireless internet connection and they have the same IP Address as me.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm using a Link-Sys Wireless Router to connect to the internet.</p>
<p>And I just found out the other day someone is using the exact same IP Address as me...</p>
<p>How can I fix my computer so that they don't have the same ip address as me..</p>
<p>Does everyone have the same exact ip address when they hook up to my password free wireless internet connection???</p>
<p>I Don't get it... and im scared that if they have the same IP Address that they could possibly do something to my laptop...</p>
<p>I know when I click on my folder Icon at the bottom and I go to NETWORK... and I can see his computer ICON there and his name is Brandon... im pretty sure he lives next door to me...</p>
<p>Is there a way I can block BRANDON from using my ip address or even connecting to my computer completely??</p>
<p>and also is there a way I can block him from connecting to my wireless router without putting a password on it???</p>
<p>Thanks for your help... MUCH NEEDED!!!!!</p>

<p>It's important to note that you have two different IP addresses, the private address (usually assigned by your router) and the public address (assigned by your internet provider).</p>
<p>Your neighbor cannot have the same private IP address as you do at the same time.&nbsp; One computer or the other would be unable to access the network at all in that case.</p>
<p>Your public IP is a different matter, though.&nbsp; Neither you nor your neighbor actually "has" that address -- rather, the Linksys router does.&nbsp; Part of the purpose of the router is to do translation between one or more computers that have private addresses,
 and a single public address, so that your computers can share a single internet connection.</p>
<p>If you are seeing online that your neighbor has the same public IP that you do, all that means is that he's connecting through your router.</p>
<p>With all of that said, unless you specifically intend for your neighbors (and any random car that drives past) to be able to use your internet connection, you<strong>do</strong> need to secure your router, and Jack's response (above) gives good instruction
 on how to do that.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Two computers with the same IP <strong>cannot</strong> exist on the same network.</p>
<p>Router's has a DHCP server that assigns IPs, some times it can switch the IP between computers, but each number would be unique.</p>
<p><strong>Thus, same IP is Not the problem</strong> . Running Wireless without password is a<strong>Big mistake</strong> , others when on the same Network can access your computers regardless of the local IP that you have. They also can do "Bad" things on
 the Internet through your connection, and the FBI would be at your door.</p>
<p><strong>There is No way to insure that someone cannot use Wireless connection it if it is Open and does not have at least strong WPA password.</strong></p>
<p>From the weakest to the strongest, Wireless security capacity is. <br />
No Security<br />
Switching Off SSID (same has No Security. SSID can be easily sniffed even if it is Off)<br />
MAC Filtering______(Band Aid if nothing else is available, MAC number can be easily Spoofed).<br />
WEP64____(Easy, to "Break" by knowledgeable people).<br />
WEP128___(A little Harder, but "Hackable" too).</p>
<p><strong>-------------------<br />
The three above are Not considered safe.<br />
Safe Starts here at WPA.<br />
-------------------</strong></p>
<p><br />
WPA-PSK__(Very Hard to Break).<br />
WPA-AES__(Not functionally Breakable)<br />
WPA2____ (Not functionally Breakable).</p>
<p>Note 1: WPA-AES the the current entry level rendition of WPA2.</p>
<p>Note 2: If you use WinXP bellow SP3 and did not updated it, you would have to download the WPA2 patch from Microsoft. &lt;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/89335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/89335</a> 7&gt;</p>
<p>The documentation of your Wireless devices (Wireless Router, and Wireless Computer's Card) should state the type of security that is available with your Wireless hardware.</p>
<p>All devices MUST be set to the same security level using the same pass phrase.<br />
Therefore the security must be set according what ever is the best possible of one of the Wireless devices.</p>
<p>I.e. even if most of your system might be capable to be configured to the max. with WPA2, but one device is only capable to be configured to max . of WEP, to whole system must be configured to WEP.</p>
<p>If you need more good security and one device (like a Wireless card that can do WEP only) is holding better security for the whole Network, replace the device with a better one.</p>

<p><span><span>If you have one of the following AV, anti-virus, programs installed, it will shut down your Windows Defender. Reason being those AVs have their own defenders. 2 defenders
 running in the same machine will create conflicts.<br />
Bottom line : it's ok. It's normal.<br />
List of AVs that will shut down Windows Defender :</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Norton<br />
McAfee<br />
AVG <br />
Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span></p>
If you don't have anyone of the above installed, here is how to turn Windows Defender back on :<br />
<br />
<span><span><span>Start button &gt; in the search box, type&nbsp;<strong>Services
</strong>&gt; press Enter key &gt; scroll to find Windows Defender, click it &gt; ....<br />
under <strong>Status</strong> heading, it should say ......... Started<br />
under <strong>Startup Type</strong>, it should say ............ Automatic<br />
If it does not say that, Right click at Windows Defender &gt; click <strong>

at Startup Type, click the pointer at far right and select Automatic<br />
at Service Status, click Start <br />
click OK when done.</span></span></span><br />

            <p><span>Hi nikushabuachidze,<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s follow these steps &amp; check if it helps.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>a) You may configure the computer in clean boot. It will start Windows XP by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs and helps to eliminate software conflicts.
</span></p>
<p><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a><br />
<br />
<b>Note:</b> Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the section ‘Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state’ from the article: How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a><br />
<br />
</span><span>b) </span><span>If you have any security software installed, disable them temporarily.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ensure to enable your anti-virus back on the computer after you check.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>c) Thereafter, try to install the Windows Live games.</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />

<p>I just talked to Microsoft Support and they suggest that I do fresh install of win 8.1 but I don't know how to do that either....Its driving me nuts.

<h2>            Windows 10 - Will Not Retain WPV Settings for JPG, PNG Files</h2>
                    <p>First let me start by saying - If you are going to tell me how to "Set Default Programs by File Type" STOP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is not the problem, and I know how to set default programs.&nbsp; I have been doing it for 6 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My work pc - Windows 10 will not save the Windows Photo Viewer Default Setting for PNG and JPG Files.&nbsp; Every morning when I log in I have to reset them from photos to WPV.&nbsp; My desktop support team has tried to fix it.&nbsp; I have googled the **** out of it trying
 to find answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can SOMEONE please tell me how to make this setting stick?&nbsp; It was always set to this default until a Microsoft update!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really tired of having to stop working to reset this.&nbsp; It is ridiculous.&nbsp; I have read post after post and the only answer provided is to "Set Default Programs", of which nearly every single user responded with "I DID and IT DIDN'T WORK".</p>

            Hi Pam.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I can't say for sure since this is the first case I've seen daily in forums, but since we know that Windows Photo Viewer was discontinued and is hidden in Windows 10 so that it must be unhidden to even use it, it is likely it's starting to lose functionality such as this just like all of the Windows Essentials that are still able to be installed but are shutting down now.  
<br />
<br />If you want to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it.  
<br />
<br />Again, Windows Photo Viewer is discontinued.  It was hidden in Windows 10 for backward compatiblity and we were happy here in forums to help consumers access it since it was still there.  But there was no expectation that it would not eventually be replaced fully by Photos app since that is the only built-in Photos app for Windows 10.  
<br />
<br />Here are some guides for using Windows 10 Photos app which works pretty well:
<br /><a href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/computing/how-to-use-the-windows-10-photos-app-1314866" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techradar.com/how-to/computing/how-...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/exploring-the-new-photos-app-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.cnet.com/how-to/exploring-the-new-p...</a>
<br />
<br />And here are alternatives to the Photos app:
<br /><a href="https://www.guidingtech.com/best-alternatives-windows-10-photos-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.guidingtech.com/best-alternatives-w...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will check out the links and do the dev post.&nbsp; This is a huge issue. I am admin for a website for my job, and it has .tif images, they need WPV to open and display properly.&nbsp; If it is going to stop working altogether that needs to be made clear so companies,
 state agencies etc., people can work to have an alternative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will re-post if I have further questions.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side question note.&nbsp; This is not because I want to view pictures/photo's.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is for screenshots that are saved, sent, taken and are png or jpg.&nbsp; I don't have a choice when it comes to me, how or in what format it saves.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are people supposed to do?&nbsp; I am sure you can't verbally agree, but this is ridiculous.&nbsp; There are so many programs non-msft, and tools that the default is png or jpg, and if I understand what you are implying - they will just cease to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks pam</p>

            Actually Pam as a MVP I am awarded for my independence so I will always give my honest opinion without fear or retribution.  
<br />
<br />Those files types are so common they should be easily manipulated as you wish in any Photos app.  I see no complaints (yet) that Windows Photos app will not handle them in any way.  
<br />
<br />If I'm missing the gist of your question then please clarify and I'll try to help further.  You might also want to post this at our  sister forums for IT Pro's Technet since you are clearly a System Admin and we are merely an end-consumer forums:

            Have you tried hiding again the unsupported, discontinued Windows Photo Viewer and assigning the defaults to Photos app only?  I believe the issue here is a tug of war between those two.

            <p>Hi Herded,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear that you are not able to use the graphic card options from your video card. I will do my best to help you get the issue resolved, however if the issue is with the hardware, you might have to contact the manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked with the graphic card drivers from the <a href="http://www.sapphiretech.com/presentation/product/?cid=1&amp;gid=3&amp;sgid=1159&amp;lid=1&amp;pid=1454&amp;leg=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
manufacturer website</a> and it seems the drivers for Windows 8 is not available. Therefore you might want to install the drivers in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
compatibility mode</a> and check if that helps. you may also contact the manufacture to know if Windows 8 drivers would be made available soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Download the drivers from the manufacturer’s website.<br />
b) Right-click on the driver and click on properties.<br />
c) Click on the ‘compatibility’ tab and check the box "Run this program in compatibility mode for” and select Windows 7 operating system from the drop down.<br />
d) Click on ‘Apply’ and click ‘OK’ and run the file to install it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to help.</p>

            Hi, I downloaded the windows 7 graphics card driver off of Sapphire's website: "<strong>AMD Catalyst™ driver features support Radeon™ HD 7700 Series".&nbsp;</strong>I then ran it in compatibility mode for Windows 7, and as it was analyzing it paused
 on "Enumerating source media for installable packages".
<div>I have tried it over and over. I have also done your above steps to this package: http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/radeonaiw_win8-64.aspx</div>
<div>Which is the latest version of catalyst control center. Again I have tried this multiple times.</div>
<div>I don't think that it allows you to install it in compatibility mode for some reason. The installation only works without compatibility mode, but then my graphics card options don't show up.</div>
<div>Any more suggestions?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks.</div>

            No, sadly. But when I look on my device manager it says that the HD7750 driver is installed: "AMD Radeon HD 7700 Series (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM v1.20)". It is just the Catalyst Control Center that isn't working properly, but it probably has something
 to do with the drivers.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glad you're up and running...I was just getting ready to reply that I had just purchased a HIS Radeon HD7750, and installed the latest 12.10 drivers from AMD, and it works flawlessly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 had installed it's own drivers after detecting New Hardware that worked fine, but no Catalyst.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No issues at all installing the newest from AMD.</p>

To get back the options once you've upgraded, uninstall/downgrade to version 11.11. This will give you an AMD Vision Control Center, replacing the old Catalyst Control Center&nbsp; It still has the advanced options that were missing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, install the latest driver by doing a Custom install and deselecting the AMD Vision Control Engine. That will preserve the keep those options while still upgrading everything else.<br />

<h2>            Error  &#34;No Bootable device.  Insert boot disk and press any key&#34; on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original title:</strong> Windows 10 OS Removed? Need HELP</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, when I boot up, I get an error message that says: "No Bootable device. &nbsp;Insert boot disk and press any key."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right before this happened, I was removing a partition that had Ubuntu (Linux) on it, but when I restarted my computer, I got that message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a panic, I quickly checked my hard drive partitions using SlackoPuppyArcade (Linux), and the specific partitions are still there, I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the partitions on my hard drive:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56e59d3c-4a13-47b9-815e-c7ad6ca51a5a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56e59d3c-4a13-47b9-815e-c7ad6ca51a5a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I really have no idea what to do at this point... any help is greatly appreciated...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note - The computer came with Windows 8 on it. &nbsp;I upgraded it to Windows 8.1 when that came out. &nbsp;More recently, I upgraded to Windows 10 on the second day of release, which was months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>-Matt</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update - I added a boot flag to the large partition in the middle, but it seem that nothing has changed...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologize for the difficulties that you're experiencing regarding this issue and also for the delay in getting back to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cause for the error "<strong>Unable to reset your PC. A required drive partition is missing</strong>" is normally a corrupt MBR (Master Boot Record) or BCD (Boot Configuration Data) files which contains boot configuration parameters and controls operating
 system. To resolve this issue, follow below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Restart </strong>your PC and boot into <strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong>. From the Windows Recovery Environment, select
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Troubleshoot </strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced options </strong>&gt; <strong>
Command Prompt</strong>.</p>
</span>
<p><span><strong>2. </strong>Run </span><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb491051.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">check disk
</span></span></span></strong></a><span>using the command line <strong><em>chkdsk /r</em></strong> command.</span></p>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (This command locates bad sectors and recovers readable information)</p>
<p><strong>Ex: </strong><em>chkdsk /r</em> E:</p>
<p>Here E is the drive letter of the USB or External drive or any drive on the system.</p>
<p>Scan for errors and repair the errors if found. So make sure you replace it with the correct letter in your case, carefully, and hit Enter.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Important: </p>
</strong>
<p>This command scans for errors and resolves any errors that are found. The chkdsk utility may require you to restart the computer or force an unmount. In this case, make sure that you save your work to avoid data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the status of the issue and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p><span>i've asked this question once, but i'm going to ask again since the last person didn't help. the above is the problem that i'm experiencing. whenever i plug something
 into my usb port that problem explanation pops up and then i can't do anything. i can't use my ipod or upload pictures or even use my printer. this is getting to be a little ridiculous, so if you guys could help out that would be great. last time i was told
 to go to the "run as administrator" and type "regsvr32 wdpshext.dll". that wouldn't let me do anything. then the second method was to uninstall my usb ports and the restart the computer to let windows re-install them. that didn't help either. if you could
 provide more possible solutions, that would be awesome. i currently have windows 7.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Please remove ALL the portable device from the computer - Power Off 1st - phones, cameras, and<br />
any others - USB Keyboard and Mouse and drives are OK to leave.</p>
<p>wpdshext.dll&nbsp; = Windows Portable Devices Shell Extension</p>
<p>===============================================================</p>
<p>Now use these methods :</p>
<p>Issues that affect IE also affect Explorer, they are closely tied together.<br />
Often BEX errors are caused by Toolbars such as Google, TrendMicro and others. Are you using<br />
any 3rd party toolbars in IE? Cause and fix is same for Vista and Windows 7.</p>
<p>What antivirus/antispyware/security product do you have on machine? Include any you have<br />
EVER had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which<br />
causes issues).</p>
<p>Start - All Programs - Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?</p>
<p>IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore Advanced Settings and then click RESET - APPLY / OK</p>
<p>IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab - click Reset all zones - APPLY / OK</p>
<p>Close and restart IE and/or IE with no addons</p>
<p>Start - All Programs - Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?</p>
<p>IE - Tools - Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java<br />
still installs it and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look<br />
for other possible problems.</p>
<p>Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look<br />
right. Permitted are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program<br />
ask about it here.</p>
<p>Could be a BHO - SpyBHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download, UnZip<br />
and run. Also not all BHO's are bad, some run toolbars and features you have added.<br />

<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware UPDATE it and then<br />
run it as a scanner. <br />

            Also, it may be useful to try to capture a user-mode dump of the explorer.exe crash.<br />
<br />
You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.<br />
<br />
If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file, then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file&nbsp;at the time explorer.exe crashes&nbsp;should be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:<br />
<br />
<em>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\explorer.exe]<br />
"DumpFolder"=hex(2):43,00,3a,00,5c,00,43,00,72,00,61,00,73,00,68,00,44,00,75,\<br />
00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00<br />
<br />
</em><br />
After&nbsp; Explorer (explorer.exe) crashes, can you then make the .dmp file&nbsp;available (provide link)&nbsp;via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?<br />
<br />
The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:<br />

 have mcafee anti-virus software, but ever since this problem started that hasn't been working either. it tells me to turn it on and click on that option but nothing happens...

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>McAfee could be the cause or at least aggravate it so I would uninstall it. Disabling it is not sufficient<br />
as it will still load pieces of itself into memory. Uninstall it and then run the McAfee Removal Tool to<br />
prevent&nbsp;remnants from being left behind which can cause strange issues. See below for recommendations<br />
to use while testing, even better permanently.<br />

------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend :&nbsp;(These are all Free versions and very effective.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and<br />
Network running.</p>
<p>Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free</p>
<p>Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)</p>
<p>IE - Protected Mode</p>
<p>IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)</p>
<p>I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 5.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 5.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />

<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>By wiping out do you mean you re-installed Windows from scratch? If so and have the same<br />
error then you must have re-installed the problem program. <br />
<br />
If you need help find a real computer shop or the System Maker's Support - leeks and peeks<br />
are probably less knowledgeable than you are and all they are good at is charging for doing<br />
nothing.<br />

What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause<br />
strange issues). We know you had McAfee, any others ever and now?<br />

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

programs, update major drivers and BIOS, and also troubleshoot with the cleanboot method<br />
first.</p>

<h3> greyslost  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to reformat hard drive and reinstall Windows 7 with no disc&#63;</h2>
                    <div>I bought an <strong>HP Pavilion dv6-1149wm</strong> laptop awhile ago with <strong>
Windows 7 Home Premium</strong> already installed in it. So it came without any recovery discs or
<strong>Windows 7</strong> discs and whatnot. By the way I'm not that great with computers so you can talk to me like I'm dumb when explaining things. My computer is pretty messed up with tons of viruses. It keeps crashing and I want to totally wipe it out
 and start over like it was factory-fresh. I already backed up any important things onto a USB drive. How can I do the recovery without a disc? I have a drive called
<strong>Recovery:(D),</strong> how can I use that to do system recovery? And does that reinstall my OS also? Because like I said it didn't come with any
<strong>Windows 7</strong> discs so how am I supposed to reinstall it afterwards? Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks.
