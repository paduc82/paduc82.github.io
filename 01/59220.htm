    <title>Windows 10 Backup fails at 97&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave_574  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Backup fails at 97&#37;</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 10 I created a backup for my recently purchased computer when I first used it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The scheduled backup stops at 97%, whilst trying to create a system image of the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find a solution that I understand or can follow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing that the Windows 10 updates have caused the issue, no other software installed between the first and second backup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can Microsoft please issue an update to correct this problem.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Dave, </p>
<p>
</p><p>For your concern, we recommend that you do the methods below: </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run System File Checker scan to your computer. </p>
<p><strong>System File Checker</strong> is a utility in Windows that allows user to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted file.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click <strong>Start button</strong>, then select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong></li><li>Enter <strong>sfc /scannow.</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Run the DISM command. </p>
<p>If no corrupted files were found in the previous state, it is still a good idea to run a
<strong>DISM</strong>. For instructions, please check this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">
<strong>article.</strong></a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>

            <p>Unfortunately this does not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is with the Backup software which no longer does the backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this is most likely due to the Windows update changing the way the Backup works, it will continue to be a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until the Backup function is either amended to cope with the change or a further&nbsp;update removes the issue from a previous update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To repeat, I do not want to start playing around with settings in the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had&nbsp;followed the advice from other questions, such as running a scan disk and no errors were found.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 7 changing colour scheme after hybernate or sleep - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 changing colour scheme after hybernate or sleep</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Problem: I have, like most users, W7 Aero colour scheme. This scheme is used by the laptop each time it starts from a cold or warm boot or from the user log on screen. However, if the computer sleeps or hibernates (auto or manually), when it restarts it
 comes up with another colour scheme after a few seconds. It sometimes blinks (changes to a new colour scheme then back to the old one after a few seconds) or changes to a new colour scheme (which is ALWAYS the same one) and stays like that. When it happens
 that the colour scheme goes back to normal after changing to a new one for a few seconds, it also does the same when certain tasks are performed, such as when I open a game which requires a resolution change or when I disconnect my account or stuff like that
 (it seems that stuff which make the screen black for some seconds or change the resolution give that issue). That only happens for a few seconds, then the old scheme comes back.</p>
<p>I have tried going to "Personalise" -&gt; "Display" -&gt; "Change colour scheme", and it resolves the issue (until I put the computer in an hybernate/sleep status again). The strange thing is that, even when the colour scheme goes back to normal after a few seconds,
 when I open the colour scheme settings panel and follow the steps to balance the colour scheme (which is, note this, ALWAYS already balanced itself), when it comes to the end, where it allows you to check the difference between the old scheme and the new one,
 when I click on the old scheme button, it shows me the colour scheme which I was talking you about (the one which comes up for some seconds or just stays after I wake up my laptop from hybernate or sleep), EVEN IF most of the times the new colour scheme DOES
 NOT stay, but instead it changes back to normal after a few seconds. Also, when the colour scheme stays, it CHANGES BACK TO NORMAL AS SOON AS I PROCEED WITH THE FIRST STEP OF THE WIZARD. There's indeed something wrong here!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Oh, by the way. With "resolves the issue", I mean that, after doing the colour scheme balancing wizard, it doesn't change the colour scheme for a few seconds when I disconnect or open games or software which changes the display's resolution anymore. BUT,
 if I hybernate/sleep the laptop again and wake it up, it gives, once again, the same issue.<br />
</p>
<p>Also, the issue doesn't show up when I start up my laptop regularly.</p>
<br />
I'm running on an account which is Administrator. No, this does "colour thing" does not affect the operation of the computer, but it is driving me nuts trying to solve the problem apart from the fact that the colour scheme it is giving me is yuk!
<p>I do not know where the problem lies, but I guess it is probably in W7, as I've tried switching off the Asus Power Management software and it didn't work. No, I haven't recently installed software which could have affected my screen's colour schemes. I've
 also updated my video drivers to the latest version, hoping that it'd resolve the issue, without success.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you able to solve this problem for me I will be eternally grateful.</p>

            I resolved this. It was an issue with colouring modes which is a feature I didn't knew of which was implemented in my laptop. Changing to normal mode fixed the issue. That was pretty strange..<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong><span>Try creating another power plan on your computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<strong><span>Power plans: frequently asked questions:
</span></strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-create-or-delete-a-power-plan-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-create-or-delete-a-power-plan-scheme</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2: </strong>Also<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I would suggest you to&nbsp;uninstall and reinstall the display driver completely from device manager.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a. Type devmgmt.msc in start search box and hit Enter.<br />
b. In device manager, expand display driver.<br />
c. Right click on it, click on Uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>After restarting by default the driver will install successfully.</span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>However I would recommend you to install the latest version of display driver from the manufacturer’s website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

<p>Your disc drive could be on it's way out, I think I had this several weeks before my first red ring of death. Could try contacting customer support, as the status code will let them know exactly what the problem is, and the best ways of fixing it. Either
 that or google the status code, some people may have had the same issue before and found ways to sort it.</p>

 the circle going around than "automatic repair" but if the hard disk is broken how can it repair?&nbsp; I cant get to bio to have it boot from a cd or usb.&nbsp; Tried whatever I could find online but nothing helps.

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.

<br />You can diagnose the hard drive using this bootable tool to know for sure it's condition:  <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>
<br />
<br />If the hard drive is good then use whichever method works here to access Advanced Boot Options to try a Refresh or Reset:  <a href="https://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4924-advanced-startup-settings-boot-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4924-adva...</a>
<br />
<br />If you need to create bootable Windows 8.1 media see here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to turn off Fast Boot in BIOS if necessary to get the media to start when powering up while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu key:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />Here is the key to press to enter BIOS setup to turn off Fast Boot first if necessary:  <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />If Refresh or Reset will not run then use the same booted media to Install Now following this guide:  <a href="https://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2299-clean-install-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2299-clea...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just switched to Fast Ring on Insider preview. The update 16199.1000 (rs_prerelease) was downloaded and asked me to restart the computer. It starts installing, and then the computer restarts. I have a dual-boot&nbsp;(Ubuntu/Windows 10) so at boot, I choose
 Windows 10, and it logs me into Windows without installing the updates. Under update history now it says&nbsp;&nbsp;"Requires a restart to finish installing" 3 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Yes, especially if you're using GRUB boot loader this can interfere with Windows in ways like you're seeing now.&nbsp; A solution to still have both is to install them on separate hard drives and boot via the BIOS so they cannot interact at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Short of that you can also use the Windows Boot Manager to boot the Dual Boot similar to the way described here:&nbsp;

    <title>Surface Book DPI Scaling Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ckcstatesman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book DPI Scaling Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, I am using the new Surface Book i7/512GB/16GB Memory.&nbsp; I am sure this question have been asked till death.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the Surface Book (and I under same for Surface Pro), when running some application, the Software does not scale properly.&nbsp; It display in an extremely small font.&nbsp; While I know there are fixes available in various forum to prepare a Manifest file to
 store in the same directory as the application being used, some application don't seems to honour this - resulting in the requirement to change the display resolution before use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is extremely painful when you are required to connect to say an external projector - it throws the resolution complete out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has a more permanently solution to this ? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Barb, thank you for replying to this query as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The product includes MSTSC on older version on Windows (which in some cases the manifest file fixes to someone like Cisco Webex.&nbsp; I know it the developer / originator of the software will have responsibility to ensure their program scale correctly but I
 have changed laptops every two to three years with various DPI, it has never been an issue until I bought the Surface. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I will question if it has to do with the program or the device drivers being used in Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Neil, thank you for your reply.&nbsp; Yes I'm on the Creator Edition - all Windows Update have also been installed.&nbsp; I tried the compatibility option - it works for some but others are still having issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I don't have this issue with other high resolution laptops - so can only assume if's a surface display driver issue ? Hopefully I am wrong and there is a permanent fix for all programs.</p>

<p>what is the aspect ratio of other devices that do not exhibit these issues? are they the same&nbsp; 3:2 that MS uses for Surface Book? I wonder if that is a factor.</p>

<h2>            HELP&#33; Automatic Windows 10 Update &#40;10 already installed&#41; Files and settings are gone&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p><span>I updated to Windows 10 a few weeks ago. I had tried to do so months ago but&nbsp;as so many others experienced, I could not find my files and went back to&nbsp;Windows 8.1.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This time when updating to 10 I had no issues and all was fine. Until this morning.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I was watching a movie on Netflix last night and paused it. I left my computer on and went to bed.
<strong>Apparently overnight, there was an automatic update</strong> and when I signed into my computer this morning-- I recall seeing a brief message about how my files were still on my computer---as if whatever update had been installed, they anticipated
 that I wouldn’t see my files right away and wanted to assure they were there—but everything was changed. Cortana was visible, everything was rearranged…just as it had been when I first tried to update to Windows 10 months ago and the reason I turned it back
 then.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I clicked on the Outlook icon to see my email but received an error message that I didn’t HAVE PERMISSION TO open .pst files!! I went on to click other Office which opened only with prompts to help me set them up…no trace of any of my files.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I went online to look for a solution to find my files, etc. <span>&nbsp;</span>But just as importantly, I want to go back to the settings
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I had before this supposed update.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>As for&nbsp;the recommendation of uninstalling the most recent update(s), I see that the only recent updates on my computer are from a week or so ago and are one-off things like Silverlight.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Nothing about an entire Windows 10 update. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As I said I cannot find my files nor can I see how to restore my settings. This is my personal computer--I work for myself and this is wreaking havoc on a deadline.&nbsp; I am beyond&nbsp;upset and angry. I have used Microsoft for decades and even worked there
 for a number of years. WHY would they do something like this? I’m sure I’m not the only one who has encountered this problem, yet there is no information readily available to rectify this in searching Bing (ha!) or on Microsoft.com.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate anyone’s help as to how find my files and restore them quickly AND restore my settings (e.g. get rid of Cortana!!) How do I prevent getting a message when trying to open my email that says I don’t have permission to open .pst files???
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>THANK YOU!!<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<h2>            April update</h2>
                    Since the April 2018 was installed none of the computers on our home network can see the others. Our internet connection is fine. So how do I get my home network back? (Yes, I know the old home group thing is gone, that is not the question/answer.)

<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Status
<br />Scroll to the bottom
<br />Click Network and Sharing Center
<br />
<br />Click Change advanced sharing settings
<br />Expand All Networks
<br />Under Password protected sharing
<br />
<br />Switch between 'Turn on password protected sharing and Turn off password protected sharing' 
<br />
<br />Then choose 'Turn off password protected sharing' 
<br />
<br />Then click 'Save changes'
<br />
<br />Also:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: optionalfeatures.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support
<br />Tick the SMB 1.0/CIFS Client
<br />Untick SMB 1.0/CIFS Automatic Removal and
<br />Untick SMB 1.0/CIFS Server
<br />
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />Restart if prompted. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft apparently has a workaround which does not require enabling SMBv1, for those who rely on the ability to 'browse' the network.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4034314/smbv1-is-not-installed-by-default-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403431...</a>
<br />
<br />Explorer Network Browsing
<br />
<br />The Computer Browser service relies on the SMBv1 protocol to populate the Windows Explorer Network node (also known as "Network Neighborhood"). This legacy protocol is long deprecated, doesn't route, and has limited security. Because the service cannot function without SMBv1, it is removed at the same time.
<br />
<br />However, if you still have to use the Explorer Network in home and small business workgroup environments to locate Windows-based computers, you can follow these steps on your Windows-based computers that no longer use SMBv1:
<br />Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them to Automatic (Delayed Start). When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />All Windows devices within that subnet that have these settings will now appear in Network for browsing. This uses the WS-DISCOVERY protocol. Contact your other vendors and manufacturers if their devices still don't appear in this browse list after the Windows devices appear. It is possible they have this protocol disabled or that they support only SMBv1.
<br />
<br />Here are some additional troubleshooting steps you can try:
<br />
<br />- shut all computer and network gear down.
<br />- Try browsing to some of the computers manually, press Windows key + R, type: \\computername, hit Enter
<br />- Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />1. Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them toAutomatic (Delayed Start).
<br />2. When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X &gt; computer management--&gt;shared folders--&gt; choose the shared folder, right click it then click Properties &gt; Share Permissions --&gt;protection that everyone can read and execute, see folder contents and read permissions.

<h2>            Skype for Business - Share Screen turns the number lock off</h2>
                    <p>We are running Windows 7. Every time we use Skype for Business Basic and share the screen during the call, the number lock turns off. We like to keep our number lock on and it's inconvenient to have to remember to turn it back on every time we share screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a remedy for this?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Visualist6x6,</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to your description, I understand that you cannot share the screen (the icon is grey) when you hold a call during a Skype for Business meeting. And you must resume the call to share the screen, which is an excepted behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anything is misunderstood, please provide the details (screenshot)about your situation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

            <p>Hi Visualist6x6,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem maybe caused by some third-part Apps and your customer’ computer configuration. We suggest you update your Skype for Business to have a shot: open any Office software (word/excel)&gt;File&gt;Account&gt;update Options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or, you can <a href="https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx?source=ohp-ib" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
log into Office365 Software</a> to download the latest version of Office.</p>

    <title>Optional Language Packs disappeared in Windows update, how to get them - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Optional Language Packs disappeared in Windows update, how to get them back&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Just received my new computer with Windows 7 Ultimate.&nbsp; I went into Windows update, which at the time contained both Important and Optional updates.&nbsp; I downloaded and installed all the Important updates first, with no trouble.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then looked through the Optional updates, and saw that there were a couple of updates related to my hardwares (monitor, sound card, video card), as well as 30 or so language packs.&nbsp; I decided to download and install those hardware related updates first.&nbsp;
 During the installation of one of them, I got the Blue Screen of Death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I waited until Windows restarted, and reopened Windows Update.&nbsp; I notice all the Optional updates have disappeared - all the Language packs were gone!&nbsp; Not even in the "hidden" updates location.&nbsp; Is there a way to get them back?</p>

    <title>System32 folder opens up every time I start windows. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ganga.bai  say:</h3>
<h2>            System32 folder opens up every time I start windows.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a seven year old desktop.&nbsp; It had to undergo some hardware repairs and I had to re-install everything from scratch.&nbsp; The OS is Win-XP with service pack-3 and all automatic updates as available have been applied.&nbsp; Office 2007, Adobe reader, VLC player,
 AVG antivirus, firefox browser and 7 Zip are the additional programs.&nbsp; Well, some other things like Java, .net or other stuff which are necessary for browsing are also installed.</p>
<p>Since the time this re-install of windows was done about a month ago, every time I boot up, the folder named "System 32" opens.&nbsp; It does not show the contents --- (<em><strong>they are hidden, as is brought out by the message on it</strong></em>) --- and,
 the additional message to say that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>you should not modify the contents of this folder</strong>
</span>is also there on that.&nbsp; I just click on the red "X" mark on that window and it closes.&nbsp; No problems there.&nbsp; But it is irritating to see that during every start up.</p>
<p>Can someone please advise how to avoid this folder opening up during every start?</p>

    <title>How can I unhide a gpt volume&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronald fleming  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I unhide a gpt volume&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently installed a 3TB drive in a machine running Windows 7 64-bit, and the default attributes of the drive (or perhaps the volume, the way I created it) have it hidden. &nbsp;Each time I boot I have to open a command prompt, run
<b>diskpart</b>, and assign a letter to the drive. &nbsp;I have read the information in
<b>diskpart</b>&nbsp;regarding assigning volume attributes using <b>gpt attributes</b>, but that information only includes parameters for
<i>hiding</i>&nbsp;a volume or causing it <i>not</i>&nbsp;to be assigned a drive letter. &nbsp;I have been unable to find anything that explains how such attributes can be
<i>undone. &nbsp;</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div>Could someone please advise me as to what I can do to make this new drive visible automatically at startup?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank You,</div>
<div>RF</div>
                </div>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of the methods worked, but method 1 revealed something that may shed light on what's going on.&nbsp; The disk was listed as an EFI System Partition, instead of simply a Logical Drive, as my other disks are labeled.&nbsp; I don't know if this is normal for a GPT
 volume or not.&nbsp; In any case, I'm back to square one.</p>
<p>One thing I failed to mention, though, is that in <strong>diskpart</strong>, if I select the volume and type "attributes volume" I receive a message that the "object is not found."&nbsp; "Attributes disk" and "attributes partition" both reveal information, but
 not "attributes volume," which I was hoping to be able to use to solve one of my problems (i.e., "attributes volume clear hidden").</p>
<p>Thanks for your efforts on this.</p>

    <title>Delay restarting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oherb40  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delay restarting</h2>
                    <p>I posted on this previously but can't find my post now. The answer was useless, so let's start over with some updated info. It seems that, every time there's an automatic&nbsp;Win 10 upgrade, my PC stops short of rebooting and completing the install. Instead
 it just sits at a black screen with an active mouse cursor. When I finally give up and pull the plug, it boots up and completes the install, including a further reboot. This does not happen on my tablet, which had a clean install. I only upgraded this laptop
 (now having problems) because a window permanently started blocking my screen announcing my PC was eligible to upgrade. This wouldn't be as big a problem if Win 10 weren't being upgraded twice a week, though so far&nbsp;doing nothing to&nbsp;make Edge, Mail or other
 apps more usable. I hope I get an answer, but let me go on notice that I won't bother reading anything from Bangalore or elsewhere on the Subcontinent advising me to do a clean boot or run Troubleshooter. I wish there were a "Totally Useless" category to which
 those answers could be consigned. I'll try to paste in a screenshot of my PC's specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, that didn't work. Something else to fix! For the record, it's an&nbsp;HP dv7 laptop with dual Intel &amp; Radeon graphics.</p>

            I'll treasure all this boilerplate in case I get an intractable black screen in future, but it was irrelevant in this case as my black screen went away, as I described, if I pulled the plug or, as in the most resent upgrade iteration, just waited half
 a minute. Unfortunately, the boilerplate did give me the idea of downloading AMD's latest Catalyst upgrade for Win 10, which promised to restore my switchable graphics. Instead, it&nbsp;left me with&nbsp;the screen permanently dimmed so I had to squint to read it. Nothing
 worked to fix the situation except reverting to Win 8.1. I assume my 3-year-old HP laptop wasn't eligible for the Catalyst upgrade, though I'd have appreciated a warning. But, hey!&nbsp;that's AMD for you. Short of MS blackmailing them into backdating their upgrade
 to older models, I don't see them changing their policy. So I'm stuck with choosing between keeping Win 8.1 with switchable graphics and upgrading to Win 10 without it. Warning to others who get in the same situation:

    <title>Restoring a .bak file on a Win 7 machine - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Restoring a .bak file on a Win 7 machine</h2>
                    I backed up my files from my old XP box to .bak files using the XP backup tool.&nbsp; I am now trying to restore those files in Win 7, but it would appear that MS has once again left those of us using the old backup system out to dry.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any idea how to restore a .bak file onto a win 7 system?

Hi<br />
<br />
The old NT Backup recovery utility for Windows 7&nbsp;is scheduled to be available after the first of the year.<br />
<br />
If this is critical for you and you do not have an XP system available to retrieve the files or you cannot wait for the Windows 7 utility,&nbsp;please see the following website for an alternate method.<br />
<br />
