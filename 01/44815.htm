    <title>Bitlocker encrypted backups - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bitlocker encrypted backups</h2>
                    <p>Apologies if this duplicates other posts. I don't think I saw the answer in the messages I searched, but with my limited knowledge of Bitlocker, I might have seen the answer but not understood it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to store a backup disk image online. I have an HP Elitebook with a TPM and have Bitlocker enabled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I have read, Bitlocker uses strong encryption and the only dangers are social engineering or (in some cases) a black hat having physical possession of the notebook. For that reason, I'd rather store the encrypted version of the backup rather than
 trusting to the security of the online site or of the backup program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I do that and, if so, how do I go about it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I load a standalone backup/restore program on a CD and save the encrypted volumes to an external drive? (In other words, is the encrypted drive in a format that's readable by a backup program?) Can I restore the encrypted backup to the original drive
 and use it as I did before, or do I have to use the Bitlocker recovery key at some point? Does it make any difference if I restore to a new physical drive rather than the one that's currently on the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another method that may be better/safer/easier but still accomplish the goal of storing a Bitlocker encrypted backup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is this a bad idea from the start?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>You might be able to do this, but obviously you can't be concurrently&nbsp;running on the same system that you are backing up.&nbsp; You would need to boot from a CD/DVD/ThumbDrive and run a backup program.&nbsp; As you have stated, since the whole drive is encrypted,
 there will not be any recognizable file system for a backup program to deal with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I read the website correctly, the freeware "Clonezilla" might be able to do what you want.&nbsp; Since the file system will not be recognized, it will force the program to create a sector-by-sector backup of your disk and your backup will be roughly the same
 size as your hard drive (anything encrypted does not compress).&nbsp; So if you have a 300 Gigabyte's worth of&nbsp;cloud storage (or whatever size your hard disk is), it could possibly work for you.&nbsp; Also, you may need another disk the same size or larger than your
 current disk to hold the backup file until you can boot to a normal file system and upload it to the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clonezilla:&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://clonezilla.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://clonezilla.org</a> &gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course a much less wieldy method would be to create a .zip file of just the files that you need to archive and then encrypt that .zip file with GnuPG
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://www.gpg4win.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gpg4win.org</a> &gt;</p>
<p>GPG&nbsp;(also commercial&nbsp;PGP)&nbsp;has been around much longer than BitLocker (at least 20 years), has not been known to be compromised, and is open-sourced with much peer-review&nbsp;(Microsoft can't claim that).&nbsp; It uses some of the same encryption algorithms as BitLocker.&nbsp;
 I personally trust GPG more than I do BitLocker.</p>

    <title>printer que deleted before printing only on one computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brim13stone  say:</h3>
<h2>            printer que deleted before printing only on one computer</h2>
                    recently upgraded to win7 from vista.&nbsp; I have two computers in the house both with win 7 one a desktop that is hooked to the printer and set to share over a wireless network.&nbsp; the other is a laptop which before with vista would print just fine with the
 hp c4280 printer, but now the que gets deleted before it prints.&nbsp; This happens whether it is over the network or hooked directly to the computer.&nbsp; I have hooked it up to other printers and they work just fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; the desktop and my friends laptop can print
 to the printer just fine with the win 7 default drivers.&nbsp; I can even hook the printer to the laptop with it shared and use my desktop over the network and print.<br />
<br />
Please help <br />

<p>If you are setting up the printer locally make sure you disable the HP CUE Discovery service&nbsp; (of download the fix from HP).<br />

            couldn't find the hp cue Discovery in the services on either computer.&nbsp; I'm trying to get it to print over the network, but it won't print locally either.&nbsp; Reinstalled the latest print driver from hp and ran the patch and still nothing.&nbsp; All the other
 computers print to the printer just fine without having to change any settings and they all are running win7.<br />

            Question? Did you uninstall the driver you have now in the laptop before reinstall? If not I would uninstall the driver in the laptop then if you have the printer shared on the network with the desktop try installing the driver over the network. To do
 this you will open Devices and Printers, click add a printer, then click Add a network, wireless or bluetooth printer, and then you should see your printer show up in the list. Select it from the list and a window should pop-up saying it wants to install a
 driver. Say yes and let it download the driver from the desktop to the laptop. Do a test print and see if it prints and that should be it.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps

            I've never seen print queues that delete themselves unless you are using deployed printer connections.&nbsp;

            sorry it took me so long to get back to you but the printer is still not working for this computer.&nbsp; the print jobs go into the print cue then after a few seconds disappear, but if you pause them in the bottom of the cue it says there is a computer error.&nbsp;
 the error it gives is 0x00000057, so i run troubleshooter and it says there is a problem but doesn't know what it is.&nbsp; When i first ran troubleshooter it found a solution by separating the job or something didn't pay it much attention because I thought that
 it wold fix the issue.&nbsp; so if you can think of anyway to help me out it would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
thanks <br />

            sorry for being unclear but you are correct. &nbsp;when you tell the computer to print it goes through all the steps like it is printing but nothing happens the printer doesn't even come out of sleep. &nbsp;I only get the error if I have the print cue open when
 I print something and then I have to click on the print job to see properties. &nbsp;I am at my wits ends I have installed all the new drivers and patches hp offers for the printer. &nbsp;I don't think this is the prob though since all the other computers work over
 the network with just win &nbsp;7 installing it's own drivers. &nbsp;So any steps you can offer will be well received.

            If the only machine that is having issues is the one which was Vista with the HP driver installed and you upgraded to Windows 7, most likely the Vista HP driver remnants are interfering with the newer driver.<br />
<br />
If there is uninstall software use this is remove the print driver.&nbsp; If not make sure you delete the driver package as well as the print driver during the removal process.&nbsp; HP has a couple of services that are installed with HP.com drivers that do not conform
 with the inbox driver program so HP cannot include this stuff with the drivers available with the operating system.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the only way I know how to get rid of this software is removing the information from the registry or deleting the files from the system so the services do not start.&nbsp;&nbsp; After you have removed the driver packages from the machine look fo HP* files
 located in \windows\system32.&nbsp; Here is my list but the computer I am currently on is&nbsp;the HP /Compaq nc6000 so some of the HP drivers are not for printers.&nbsp; Send your list back after have removed the driver again, but also compare the list to a machine which
 has no problem printing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
One last thing, are the machines running the 32bit or 64bit operating system?&nbsp; <br />

    <title>Windows 10 Computer Freezes and BSOD WATCHDOG_ERROR when watching - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Computer Freezes and BSOD WATCHDOG_ERROR when watching youtube videos, help&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>First a description of the problem:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last few weeks (around the time of the Windows 10 Creators update) randomly when watching youtube videos my computer will freeze with a loud buzzing sound coming from the speakers. Sometimes it resolves itself, but several times now it crashes with
 a BSOD and a WATCHDOG error. It is only with youtube videos--twitch videos play fine, and I have no problem playing any online games at highest graphical settings etc. I've done multiple virus/malware scans and turned up nothing, and the troubleshooter for
 BSOD for windows found no issues. I've tried disabling extensions for google chrome, still have freezes and crashes. Tried multiple browsers (chrome, IE, and firefox) all have the same issue when watching youtube videos. All of my drivers are up to date. I've
 checked multiple times and gone directly to the manufacturer's websites to download the newest versions for my graphics card etc. and did a clean install of those today and I still have the same issue. I have scanned multiple times for HDD problems/corruption
 and found nothing. I have no idea what is causing this issue at this point and have exhausted any and all options I've been able to find online.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System Specs:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Home 10</p>
<p>Manufacturer: ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC.</p>
<p>Model: ASUS Desktop PC G11CB_G11CD Series</p>
<p>Processor: Intel (R) Core(TM) i5-6400 CPU @ 2.70GHz 2.70GHz</p>
<p>Installed RAM: 8.00 GB</p>
<p>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Type: 64-bit Operating System, x64-based processor</p>

<p>There were no minidump files in your link. Make sure to copy the minidump files to another location such as the Desktop prior to zipping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the MSinfo there is a Realtek 8821AE wireless adapter using driver version 2023.54.331.2017</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recent Realtek wireless drivers have been problematic such as <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/bsod-dpc-watchdog-violation/310fd88f-8744-4f6a-a924-de39aa6ea991">
here</a> so I might suggest to use the Device Manager to have the Realtek 8821AE wireless adapter use an older driver such as one from 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Device Manager can you&nbsp;right-click the&nbsp;Realtek wireless adapter<span>&nbsp;&gt; Update driver&nbsp; &gt; Browse my computer for driver software &gt;&nbsp;Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What is listed under Model (with "Show compatible hardware" "checked") ?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What are the versions listed?</span></p>

<p>To remove the "permission" issue copy (don't move) the minidump files from the C:\Windows\Minidump folder to the Desktop.</p>

</p><p>If the minidump files are now on Desktop just move them back to the&nbsp;C:\Windows\Minidump folder then copy and paste them&nbsp;to the Desktop.</p>

            Alright it's been about two days since I changed the driver and everything looks like it's back to normal. Thank you again so much for your input as it seems this has completely fixed the issue. I haven't had a single freeze up or crash since changing
 the driver!

<h2>            SVGA to standard TV connection</h2>
                    I have a SVGA to RCA component video adapter. I connected it to my RF audio/video modulator,(the same one my DVD player is connected to so I can get the picture on my "standard" TV) the 15 pin connector is connected to the Toshiba Laptop. All I get on
 the TV are lines. I tried adjusting the resolution on the laptop but it still gives me snow and lines and some sort of flickering picture.Thats all I can get. Do I need a new video card that supports a 2nd monitor and can decode digital to RF. Or is there
 a patch I can download to upgrade the video card. I would like to watch my downloaded movies on my TV. It's a RCA model witch has only a regular TV cable connection. It has no line in.

<h3> haiderzafar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows cannot access files</h2>
                    <p>Well, My computer messed up and I refreshed it. But after I was reinstalling my apps, from internet or even windows explorer it said 'windows cannot access files'. Furthermore, whenever I tried to diagnose+troubleshoot, it just said it can't troubleshoot.
</p>
<p>What is says is this:</p>
<p>Windows cannot access </p>
<p>File location</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check the spelling of the name. Otherwise, there might be a problem with your network. To try to identify and resolve network problems, click diagnose....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And after clicking it, nothing happens. I can't even change settings because of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASE, I NEED URGENT HELP! :l</p>

            I had a similar issue wouldn't let me into anything said it was a security issue. I couldn't go into control panel to look around for things to change so I just refreshed my PC and everything has been great ever since. The new refresh and reset options
 have worked for me now they are actually a very good feature to have except when you reset the thorough reset takes a rather long time but it fixed my problem and what more can I ask for.<br />

            <p>I'm afraid this wasn't linked to what my main problem is. I can't even access 'msconfig' now either, I've realised that it is exe. files which won't open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I click any of these, these are the exact words:</p>
<p><strong>Windows cannot access </strong></p>
<p><strong>*File location*.exe</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Check the spelling of the name. Otherwise, there might be a problem with your network. To try to identify and resolve network problems, click diagnose....</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After clicking diagnose,&nbsp; nothing happens. And if I try going on the control panel and change settings such as windows smartscreen.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it may be necessary, this is what it says on the details:</p>
<p>Error code: 0x800704b3</p>
<p>The network path was either typed incorrectly, does not exist, or the network provider is currently unavailable. Please try retyping the path or contact your network administrator.</p>

            I too still have a problem with "Artist" pictures.&nbsp; After performing Method 1, most of their (Artist) pictures did populate the areas designated for their pictures.&nbsp; Strange thing about it, they are really old black &amp; white photos, and there are still
 voids for the different artist.&nbsp; Again - I must use the title "OLD" photos....So now what?&nbsp; Thanks for your directions.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you posting on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might have caused due to some windows update crash.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's try the below steps and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Disable third party anti-virus software</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have any third party software installed on the computer, then I would suggest you to disable the anti-virus software and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Important Note: </span></strong><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span>If this doesn’t resolve try with the next method.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>I would suggest you to
<strong>run an inbuilt troubleshooter</strong> which helps you.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Refer:</span></strong><span> </span></span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-update-troubleshooter</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Windows update troubleshooter makes sure that your computer is connected to the Internet, and checks to see whether your network adapter and Windows Update services are running correctly.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Perform a Windows update and check if the issue resolves.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong><span>: If issue still persists I would suggest you to manually
<strong><span>reset Windows Update components</span></strong> and for that try to run the
<strong><span>fixit</span></strong> provided in the following article. If you had already tried the same fixit before I would request you to run the fixit again.</span></p>

            I have this same problem - there is and will be no answer from Microsoft -if there was a fix it would have been been silently pushed to your machine long ago.&nbsp; They blew out faulty code and don't have a way to fix it.&nbsp; They know the only real solution
 is to reinstall; they just wont SAY that.&nbsp; I did what they wanted.&nbsp; It doesn't work.&nbsp; It's still stuck on the update. I just purchased this refurbished laptop; in less than a week I need to fix it in order to install current updates??&nbsp; Please, what a joke.

<h2>            Bluetooth audio not playing on Bose Solo 15 II - Surface Pro 3 &#43; Lumia 930</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>after the latest updates (PC 14393.222 / L930 14936 - Insider Fast) both devices cannot play music on my Bose sound system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are both paired and connected but, looking at the Surface, I see the audio playback device for my bose is disconnected and doesn't connect if I right click on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver for the bose is pretty recent (15 Sept) and I guess that may be the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solution for this? I tried everything, nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Iacopo</p>

<p>Have you tried uninstalling the Bluetooth drivers for your speaker? If you haven't, we recommend that you uninstall all drivers for it, restart your Surface Pro 3 and pair them again. Once they're paired, it should automatically install the Bluetooth drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the audio still wouldn't play on your Bluetooth speaker, we suggest that you contact its manufacturer for additional assistance.<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would like to know what is the build and version of your Windows 10. To find out which version of Windows your PC is running, press Windows logo key+R, type winver, then select OK. In line with this,
<span>updating drivers should always be your go-to option when something goes wrong with your computer or system. Whether you choose to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
update the device drivers manually</a> or using <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ie/help/4028685/windows-10-get-the-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Update</a>, it’s essential that you have&nbsp;the latest correct device drivers for your operating system at all times.

    <title>How to purchase and install a new WiFi adapter in a surface pro 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dancaruso  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to purchase and install a new WiFi adapter in a surface pro 3</h2>
                    <p>I have tried all reset options listed in the community and still have an internal adapter that cannot find any networks.&nbsp; The drivers have been reinstalled and system reset to no avail.&nbsp; This happened out of the blue with no recent updates or programs having
 been installed on Win 10 Pro.&nbsp; I have a USB WiFi adapter and a USB ethernet adapter; both of which function properly.&nbsp; I cannot get the Marvell Avastar adapter to find any networks.&nbsp; It has no errors in the device manager and the driver search states that
 I have the most up-to-date driver available.&nbsp; This is obviously a major known issue from the amount of comment on the faulty driver/product.&nbsp; (For an expensive WiFi only device it is unfortunate that Microsoft is unwilling to stand behind the product!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Surf Pro 3 is out of warranty, I would simply like to know:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; How I may purchase a replacement internal adapter (hardware)?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; How to properly disassemble the case and replace the adapter?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; If the hardware is part of the motherboard, what option do I have to replace it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you please provide the cost for 1 and 3 above?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Duplicate Programs Folder in Start Menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rlx3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate Programs Folder in Start Menu</h2>
                    I've noticed that ever since I upgraded from Vista to Windows 7 there is a duplicate Programs folder in my Start Menu under All Programs. It consists a duplicate of all the shortcuts and folders already in my menu. I remember a fix when I had the same
 problem a long time ago, where you go to properties of the start menu and uncheck the default program box. Solution explained here:
<a href="http://jen3ral.wordpress.com/2009/03/25/vista-start-menu-duplicate-programs-folder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://jen3ral.wordpress.com/2009/03/25/vista-start-menu-duplicate-programs-folder/</a><br />
However this solution doesn't work for Windows 7 and I've gotten the same or atleast a similar problem again. Is there anyway to fix this?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If the Operating System you are using came preinstalled on your Laptop&nbsp;your Product Key will be on a Sticker on the underside of your Laptop and it will consist of 25 digits, divided into 5 groups of 5 digits.</p>
<p>It may also be inside the Battery Compartment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Product Key Finder Programs will not assist you with preinstalled Operating System on Dell, HP, Acer, etc.&nbsp;as they will only find a non-useable for reinstallation PK from within the running&nbsp;the Operating System.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you bought and installed an Operating System yourself and upgraded the Dell, you may use Key Finder Programs to locate that PK from within&nbsp;a running and activated&nbsp;Windows Operating System.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the best two for that:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to obtain a replacement product key </p>
<p>If the software came preinstalled on your computer, please contact the manufacturer of your computer to obtain a replacement product key (<strong>they normally do not do that).<br />
</strong><br />
To replace a Microsoft product ke for a product you purchased separately from your computer, you must contact Microsoft Customer Service and Support. To locate the appropriate telephone number, visit the following Microsoft Web site:
</p>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">Contact Microsoft</font></a>
<div>(http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS) </div>
<p><b>Note</b> When you contact Microsoft Customer Service and Support for a replacement product key, you may have to pay a fee. You may also have to provide information from your computer or from the product CD or DVD when you are speaking to the customer
 service representative. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is a preinstalled Operating System and you still can not locate the Product Key or the sticker is worn or lost, follow these steps to reinstall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can&nbsp;ask the&nbsp;Computer manufacturer&nbsp;to send you a set of Recovery disks for your Model Computer&nbsp;to reinstall the operating system back to how it was when new.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also while you are in contact with them, if you never receviced a reinstallation Disk at purchase, ask them how to make Recovery disks to do the same thing, if you still have access to the Recovery partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you purchased your Computer there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall&nbsp;the Operating System&nbsp;back to how you bought your Computer.</p>
<p>The Recovery process can be started by pressing a particular Key or Keys&nbsp;combination at Boot. (Power On / Startup)</p>
<p>It may be F10, F11, Alt + F10, etc depending on the Manufacturer.</p>
<p>Ask them for the correct Key sequence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>None of the above reinstallation methods normally requires you to supply a Product Key during the Installation Process as the Recovery Process uses the Factory Installation Product Key to automatically Activate during the reinstallation process.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span>Check the certificate of authenticity sticker located in the battery compartment of your Dell:</span></p>
<span><font>
<p>COA Certificate of Authenticity:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/howtotell/content.aspx?pg=coa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#0000ff">http://www.microsoft.com/howtotell/content.aspx?pg=coa</font></font></u></a></p>

<p>What is the Windows Certificate of Authenticity?</p>
</span>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-the-Windows-Certificate-of-Authenticity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#0000ff">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-the-Windows-Certificate-of-Authenticity</font></font></u></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 1:</p>
<p>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 instalaltion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. This will exempt the need
 to use the product key also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 3:</p>
<p>If the neither options 1 or 2 is possible, then you need to invest in a new retail full version license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-------------------------</p>
<font>
<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are running Windows 7:</p>
<p>As the computer starts, press &lt;F8&gt; on the keyboard until the<strong>Advanced Boot Options
</strong>menu appears on the screen. </p>

<p>Ctrl + F11 is to access Dell's XP Recovery partition,&nbsp;not Windows 7.</p>

<p>You press F8 at Boot to start the Dell recovery process from the Recovery partition in Windows 7.</p>

<p>In answer to the OP question. No the forum cannot provide the Windows Product Key. End of response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly all the "conversation" about recovery procedures is completely irrelevant to Windows 7. The Dell D520 was only ever available with Windows XP with support limited to XP and Vista. Nor does it have a recovery partition.
The only option was to reinstall from CD.</p>

            <p>You will have obtain Windows 7 Home Basic through other means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Details
</p><div>
<p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? In this article, we take a look at what users can do if they end up in a situation needing such media.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>What to do if you cannot get recovery media from your manufacturer, refuse to use or purchase it or the Microsoft Software Recovery Website is not working?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your next best option is to borrow the corresponding retail edition (upgrade or full version) or OEM System Builder disc from a friend or family member who has a Windows 7 disc. You can also borrow any of the following editions: Home Premium, Professional
 or Ultimate and create your own disc which will give you the option of selecting the desired edition you are licensed for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Identifying the edition - Windows 7 comes in many editions, you need to get the edition that corresponds with your product key. You can easily identify this according to the disc and labelling. Also note, you need to obtain the architecture you desire, so
 if you need 32 or 64 bit Windows 7, you need to specifically borrow that disc. See below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Retail</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c3cbf4e-783f-48a1-9640-ed52628c4e50" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the disc does not look like any of the above, these instructions will not work. If you are running editions of Windows 7 such as Starter and Home Basic, these instructions should also work. Keep in mind, Starter is only available in a 32 bit architecture,
 so a 32 bit disc will be required if you need to reinstall that particular edition.
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Create a digital replica of the disc</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have obtained a copy of the disc, the first step is to turn it into a .ISO file. This will require you have access to a computer with a DVD drive. Follow the instructions in the following article to&nbsp;create a .ISO file:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have a .ISO copy of the software, you can return the disc to your friend or family member and follow the instructions to create your own bootable copy:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then&nbsp;use the <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Windows-7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool/3000-18513_4-10972600.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 possible solution is written as follows by microsoft:</span></p>
<p>
The error code 0x80070005 is also described as "ACCESS DENIED." It usually occurs when you lack file or registry permissions that are required to install the update (Because file or registry permissions may be changed by malware, we recommend that you scan
 for malware after you repair the permissions).</p>
<p>
To resolve the issue, make sure that you are logged on as an administrator, and then install the updates again. If the problem continues, use the SubInACL tool to repair file and registry permissions. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SubInACL tool</a>&nbsp;and install it in the
 %windir%\system32 folder. The %windir% placeholder represents the Windows operating system folder. For example, C:\Windows.</li><li>Start Notepad, and then copy and paste the following commands:<br />
<span>@echo off<br />
<span>subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f<br />
</span><span>subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CURRENT_USER /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f<br />
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f<br />

</span></span><span><span>@Echo =========================<br />
@Echo Finished.<br />
@Echo =========================<br />
@pause</span><br />
</span></li><li><span>Save the file as reset.cmd.</span></li><li><span>Right-click the Reset.cmd file in File Explorer (in Windows 8.1 and Windows 8) or Windows Explorer (in Windows 7 and Windows Vista), and then click&nbsp;<span>Run as administrator</span>.
 In Windows XP, double-click the file in Windows Explorer.</span></li><li><span>Wait until the execution finishes, and then try to install the update again.</span></li></ol>

<h2>            XBox Live Status and Network Tests Not Accurate&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've not been able to log onto my account from my Xbox One from Dec 24th 11:30 pm to Dec 25th 12:45 am EST. &nbsp;Yet, XBox live status shows no issues. &nbsp;I'm also unable to play CoD Ghost because of the same problem. &nbsp;Their status is Defcon 4 and says issues
 would be brief. &nbsp;I do not consider over an hour and counting brief. &nbsp;Why a disconnect between what I'm experiencing and the status pages? &nbsp;I've had issues connecting before but the status is always reported as Ok. &nbsp;This is frustrating. &nbsp;On top of that, the
 multiplayer network test on the XBox One comes back as a success but I can't even get on XBox Live. &nbsp;What gives? &nbsp;What's the point of tests and status updates if they don't seem to work???</p>

            Hi Greg,<br />
<br />
The attached DMP file is of the <b>DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE (9f)</b> bugcheck.<br />
<br />
<i>This bug check indicates that the driver is in an inconsistent or invalid power state.</i><br />
<br />
Under normal circumstances, we'd simply grab the address of the blocked IRP (4th parameter of the bugcheck) and run an !irp to see the guilty driver. However, Microsoft's symbol server lately is having issues and therefore we cannot do this.<br />
<br />
<i><b>With this said, we'll need some assistance from Driver Verifier, so please enable it:</b></i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
8. Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />
Any other questions can most likely be answered by this article:<br />

<div>Patrick,</div>
<div><br />
<div>I had to give the computer back to the user for now and they are going to avoid the sleep / hibernate process and just shutdown for now... until I can get it back.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You mention under normal circumstances. &nbsp;What is it we could normally do and why can't it be done? &nbsp;You mention Microsoft's symbol server? &nbsp;Can we not download the symbol files? &nbsp;I actually tried this and downloaded the Windows 7 x64 retail symbols installer
 and the installer put them in c:\symbols then in the debug application I put the path to this folder, but it didn't seem to help with anything. &nbsp;I have never used this process so obviously I was doing something wrong which is why I posted the details and file.
 &nbsp;Was hoping someone had the needed debug / symbol files and could load up the mini dump file and post what it is showing as the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can make the failure happen at any time by just telling it to go to sleep. &nbsp;Even though the user needed the computer back right away I was a little hesitant to use the Driver Verifier knowing he needed it back the next morning... I saw notes about leaving
 the system in a failed state and just didn't want to take the chance late last night.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Until Microsoft updates their symbol server, there is nothing we can do. It was supposed to be as far as I know updated today, so if you have any latest DMP files from that system you can attach them.<br />
<br />
As I said, under normal circumstances what I would have done is run an !irp on the blocked IRP address (4th parameter in the bugcheck) to get the guilty driver that's causing the crashes. However, as I said, since the symbol server needs to be updated, it's
 not permitting us to do that and that is why I recommended the assistance of Driver Verifier. If it happens when going into sleep or hibernate, you could have enabled it and then forced either of those to get a crash.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

            Hey Patrick,
<div><br />
<div>My first post has the link to the DMP file on my skydrive. &nbsp;So hopefully that will do. &nbsp;Since the user had to have it back and knows not to allow it to sleep I can probably wait on their symbol server to be fixed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the meantime could you either explain the process you would use to see the guilty driver or to a web page that sort of does a walk through on this. &nbsp;I did some searching and thought I found it, but I couldn't get it to give me the results I thought
 I should be seeing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And thank you very much for your time and help!</div>

If you cannot find it via Intel's website, you may need to go through Dell as that's the computer's model -

<br />
If the above does not help, we usually see network related crashes when there's a 3rd party antivirus or firewall causing conflicts. By checking the loaded modules list, I can see Sunbelt firewall is installed. I recommend removal of this ASAP for troubleshooting
 purposes.<br />

            Thanks Patrick,
<div><br />
<div>That driver from Dell was the latest, BUT I can see if Intel has a newer one or even try to uninstall it completely and re-install. &nbsp;But either way I will focus on that area once I get the computer back and report back what happens.</div>

Patrick,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for all your assistance.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was able to download a newer Intel driver directly from Intel site and it solved the problem. &nbsp;The Dell site did not have a newer version.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All is well now.</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Windows update, restart option not working</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 10 x64 . Windows downloads the updates as needed but does not install them. I get no notification to restart. Since my laptop is on constantly, I rarely shut it down. When I do, that's when the updates install.&nbsp; So I went into settings
 to set up the install time. The "restart option" toggle is greyed and cannot be moved. I cannot change the time to install the updates because of this. I tried a link in the forum to reset the windows update but the link is no longer working. What can I do
 to fix this?

<br />Another thing you can do do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<p>There are no actual methods of extending the wireless range of the controller. The hardware is built-in and remains constant.</p>
<p>You can, however,&nbsp;<em>improve</em> the range by removing all physical obstructions, minimizing wireless interference from other devices, and ensuring that the controller is in direct line-of-sight to the console.</p>

<p>So why microsoft dont solve it, the internet full with people who has the same problem and dont know how fix it.
</p>
<p>Actually its very simple, adjust the pc wireless reciever to the xbox and you have a wonderful range extender whenever you want.
</p>
<p>I open a facebook page abot it if it will be much people i sure microsoft wont ignore it</p>

<p>I can already plug a bluetooth dongle into my PC and windows 10 will find the controller as a bluetooth device, which i can then use to stream the xbox to a PC. But my network is poor, the video quality is low and there is too much latency.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why on earth cant Microsoft install a patch on the xbox to allow a bluetooth dongle plugged into the USB port of the xbox to do the same? At least then i can use a USB extender cable with a bluetooth dongle to get my controller range extended to where
 i need it. Its running the same OS as the PC under the hood&nbsp; is'n't it!!!</p>

<p>i use the xb1 controller on pc also with the attachment to plug into my pc. i have problems even with this as well and i have nothing really in the way, maybe a piece of wood (my desk) when i have my hands under it, thats it. now i just have a usb extension
 and that seems to work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not all of us are bachelor cavemen. If you want your XBox in your AV closet so you dont have to look at a bumch of devices in your livingroom then you are pretty much screwed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All we need is an ir receiver to grab the signal and transmit it back to the Xbox. Its pretty silly that this isnt a thing yet.&nbsp;</p>
