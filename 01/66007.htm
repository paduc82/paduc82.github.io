<h2>            Audio Device is in use by another application</h2>
                    <p>As the title says, however,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting Windows Audio,</p>
<p>I've uninstalled, and reinstalled my Audio Drivers,</p>
<p>no other programs are attempting to use my television's speakers,</p>
<p>forcing audio to play through my television (shutting off all alternative audio devices) causes a blue screen,</p>
<p>also rebooted several times during different attempts to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. the sound plays through all other outputs such as headphones, it's only my television's speakers that cause the blue screen, and won't accept sound. It's an older model of the Sony Bravia.</p>

<h3> bob is interested  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 0x80070490&#58;  Windows Setup cannot find a location to store temporary installation files.</h2>
                    <p>The full error message:</p>
<p>Windows Setup cannot find a location to store temporary installation files.&nbsp; To install Windows, make sure that a partition on your boot disk has at least 683 (MB) of free space.&nbsp; Error code: 0x80070490</p>
<p>I have 4 hard drives connected right now.&nbsp; 2 are blank, 1 is used by the OS and the other is used for data.&nbsp; I did this before and it worked fine.&nbsp; I'm trying to install Win7 on one of the hard drives like I did a few weeks ago.&nbsp; I googled this error and
 it seems to be related to Windows Update most of the time.&nbsp; I'm doing an install from a hard drive (because its a lot quicker than an optical drive).&nbsp; I tried running setup.exe as an Administrator but got the same error code.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>Why I need this is that I accidentally wiped one drive that was acting as a boot drive.&nbsp; If I shut down my computer I won't be able to start it up again as it won't boot from the present drive so I want to install a Win7 version on a drive in case I mess
 up the boot manager copying and pasting fix I need to do (that I should have done a while back).&nbsp; Then I'm looking at several hours of needless wasted time setting everything up again from scratch.&nbsp; The system is running great right now.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 - 1803 &#38; 1903 missing &#34;make start menu, taskbar, and action center transparent..&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Okay this is super annoying.. I've searched every single post and gotten literally no where... First tried the registry tweaks yet they already existed on both machines, aka;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced DWORD32&nbsp;UseOLEDTaskbarTransparency = 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>&amp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT _USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Themes\Personalize DWORD32&nbsp;EnableTransparency = 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>None of this works... Enable transparency is checked within personalize options, however it appears that some people have an option in windows for a check box that's located in personalize settings towards the bottom called&nbsp;"make start menu, taskbar, and
 action center transparent.."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Both my laptop and my desktop are missing this option, both were on 1803 now both are on 1903... See picture below, even when I search for the setting, Windows actually recognizes it AND brings me to the damn color page where the setting normally lives...
 Whats even crazier is on the laptop at least, when I unplug it from the wall, it switches into power saving mode automatically and makes the damn task bar completely transparent. Like ****... I thought I was going crazy so I ran a SFC scannow on both machines,
 no issues then ran&nbsp;<span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth again with no issues...
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The more I dug into this the more I found people online having the same issue being redirected to 3rd part software to make the **** start menu transparent.. Like WUT... We're 2019 Windows doesn't need 3rd part software to do something its been able to do
 for a decade+... I also read a post saying this setting has been moved to another location.. Yet I cannot find it nor does windows bring you to that place when you search and click the search result it finds.. It always brings you to Color within personalize...
 Can someone tell me whats going on? All the registry tweaks online already were in place and dont do anything changing them yet switching into power saving changes the transparency on the laptop... Where is Window pulling this setting from??? AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</p>

            Hi Ex.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See if any of these fixes works for you:
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/how-to-enable-aero-glass-transparency-with-blur-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/how-to-enable-aero-glass-...</a>

<br /><a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/aero-not-working-in-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/aero-not-working...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/windows-10-transparency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/windows-10-transpa...</a>
<br />
<br />It may also be dependent upon your Display Adapter supporting it.  Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />If none of this works and you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. If you are an Insider I can also vote it up with my MVP badge and track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I've done some diving into your speculation that this is a driver issue related problem, and I can say with certainty that this is not the case. I have ran 3 benches, one with Intel, one with Nvidia, and one with AMD. Using 1903 Build 18362.145, this issue
 has persisted on all three benches. I tried resetting the drivers, no luck. I tried updating the drivers progressively, again no luck. Even latest drivers, no luck. I made sure other drivers like sound and firmware were the issue, they were not. You speculated
 BIOS was a cause, I tried as many BIOS updates as I could without bricking any of my machines, still not fixing the issues. I read into your reply to OP via the links, but they all just cover what they already said, I suggest you read more clearly next time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can conclude after over a sample of 40 tests on all 3 benches, the issue persisted in its original format 37 of the 40 times, the other 3 had the same related issue, but did not fix the problem. Clean installs of the benches were also tested, again issue
 remained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion, this is NOT a driver or BIOS related problem, this is perhaps an OS related coding or UI issue that seems to be affecting random systems as my personal laptop, work desktop and laptop are fine, my personal PC and benches have this same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider what OP said and read more carefully, as the links you sent them, were topics they already had covered and didn't have any solution in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Be sure to check the top half of the Colors tab. A workaround that I have tried and works (To an extent and only in the current login session). Go to your display settings and try changing the resolution. Select any resolution BUT your default or currently
 selected resolution, once selected a window will pop up asking to keep your settings. Select the box that says "Revert" and the option should pop up and Aero Glass should work again on the Taskbar. Looks like we will have to wait for Microsoft to patch it
 as it's clearly now an OS issue.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b3f9014-6944-4e5e-92e7-046763a2a1cf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b3f9014-6944-4e5e-92e7-046763a2a1cf?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Many if not most of the people I help have old drivers and BIOS, so the need to update the Display and all other drivers comes first for this reason.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
The links provided are the latest fixes and discussions on this issue.&nbsp; How would I know if the OP had covered each and every step in each link, or was already privy to the full discussion on this issue?&nbsp; My goal is to be as thorough as possible and then watch
 what works on these trending issues.&nbsp; There is not yet a definitive fix so we are casting the widest possible net to find one.&nbsp; Those who cooperate with us often find the fix through trial and error.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I updated to 1903 it turned my taskbar opaque grey and I have not yet found a way to regain more transparency.&nbsp; So I am looking for fixes for this too, at the same time I continue to help with dozens of other issues that are trending.&nbsp; This is what
 I have been doing daily in forums for ten years with great success.&nbsp; Along with my tutorials I service which have millions of users, I directly help tens of thousands of consumers, more than almost anyone else on the web.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If others want to use this as a tracking thread for this issue I will monitor and escalate it as necessary.&nbsp; If there is any more piling on by anyone it will be locked and the discussion will need to be shifted to more productive threads.&nbsp;

            Hey thanks for the update Greg... I wasn't trying to be rude I literally thought you were a bot or something.. I appreciate you trying to find a resolve this issue, its like one day the option was there then poof, gone... The setting has seemingly disappeared
 and more weird that in power saving mode turns back on automatically for the laptop at least. If anyone figures out where windows is changing this in the registry or a different location let us know. I find it odd that switching to power saving mode makes
 the start menu and task bar completely transparent.. Only in 1803 does not do it in 1903 though... 😒

<p>No worries there.&nbsp; Let's see if we can find an answer to this.&nbsp; With your experimental approach you would be a great source for Feedback to the developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your
 problems.<br />
<br />
If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. If you are an Insider I can also vote it up with my MVP badge, link them to this thread and track the issue for you.<br />

            Okay so, back to what MVP said, this seemed to actually be a mix of OS and Graphics Drivers combined. The last OS update did fix my icon bar (because I don't like icons on my task bar), and the latest AMD update seemed to fix the rest. I suggest you check
 your graphic driver for any recent updates.

<p>Tested already on Intel 25.20.100.6471 and newer as well as Nvidia 417 and newer... Also, the setting in my screenshot is actually missing from Windows Personalize Options.. So I guess yea it may be possible but at this point I think its a Microsoft thing...
 Or the settings has been removed completely and most people haven't noticed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to confirm, you're saying after you updated your OS to 1903 the setting "make start menu, taskbar, and action center transparent" was added BACK into personalize settings? The setting I have circled at the top in my original post?</p>

<h2>            skype meeting not showing under meetings tab in Skype for Business</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to find out why the meetings that are in my Outlook calendar are not showing up under the Meetings on Skype for Business? I've tried accepting the meetings, ensuring the settings are enabled for Skype for Business but they still are not showing
 up. It's just one meeting in particular. The other meetings are showing up fine. Any one have any ideas or suggestions?
</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi </span><span>Victoriak2015</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your situation, I recommend you can try to clear the cache in Skype for Business, and then check whether the issue disappears. Following are the detailed steps:</p>
<p>1. Log out of Skype for Business</p>
<p>2. Delete any sign-in information</p>
<p>3. Exit Skype&nbsp;for Business</p>
<p>4. Navigate to "<span style="font-weight: bold">%localappdata%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync\</span>"</p>
<p>5. Delete the "<span style="font-weight: bold">sip_profileName</span>"&nbsp;folder</p>
<p>6. Delete all files in <span style="font-weight: bold">Tracing</span> folder.&nbsp; Do not delete the folder itself</p>
<p>7. Open the command prompt and run "<span style="font-weight: bold">ipconfig&nbsp;/flushdns</span>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, please offer me more information for further analysis.</p>
<p>1. If you create a new meeting, can it show in meeting tab correctly? If so, you can try to edit the problematic meeting and save again.</p>
<p>2. If you add your account to another Skype for Business client, whether the problematic meeting cannot also show up.</p>
<p>3. Whether your account is managed in pure cloud, On-Premises or hybrid.</p>
<p>4. The version of Skype for Business client. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Betty</p>

<h2>            11 different Visual C&#43;&#43;, do I need ALL of them&#63;&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    So, I've noticed lately that my CPU usage spikes up to 100% usage without even doing much. I'm working at running a virus scan as I type this. I've deleted several of my old programs that I don't use, as well as running CCleaner to fix registry errors
 and remove temp files, etc.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As I was going through my programs listed in my uninstall portion of the Control panel and found ELEVEN different versions of Visual C++.<br />
<br />
Here's the list:&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable<br />
Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable</div>
<div>Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable (x64)<br />

<div>Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable - x64 9.0.30729.6161</div>
<div>Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable - x86 9.0.30729.17<br />
Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable - x86 9.0.30729.4148<br />
Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable - x86 9.0.30729.6161<br />
Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 x64 Redistributable -10.0.30319<br />
Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 x86 Redistribuatable - 10.0.30319</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Do I need every single one of these? Or any of them for that matter?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I also noticed some other odd things that I don't think I use at all such as:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile<br />
Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Extended</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone could help me with this, it would be GREATLY appreciated.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>&nbsp;Do NOT run registry cleaners!&nbsp; They are unnecessary, do no appreciable good and sometimes cause problems.&nbsp; Avoid them whatever you do because when your registry gets corrupted, problems are very difficult to diagnose and often requires reinstallation of
 Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;The first thing I'd do after checking for viruses in <strong><u>Safe Mode </u>
</strong>woould be to do a CTRL-ALT-DEL and start Task Manager, then click on the Processes tab and click TWICE on the CPU header.&nbsp; This sorts the tasks so that the ones using the most cycles are listed at the top.&nbsp; Also click the button that says Show processes
 from all users.&nbsp; You should be able to see what's eating all the cycles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Apparently this problem is caused by some conflict between Defender and some programs which they discuss.&nbsp; I believe the last page has most of what you're looking for.&nbsp; They say the solution is to uninstall Defender.&nbsp; Apparently I don't have Defender installed
 on my Toshiba Satellite L755 laptop because I can't find any trace of it here.&nbsp; If you have it on your system, I assume you could go to the Programs and Features applet of the Control Panel, click&nbsp;the button "Turn Windows features on or off" and uninstall
 it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

            Well, I uninstalled Defender completely, although it still showed up. So I decided to try turning off my Microsoft security essentials, which is what it ended up being. My computer now goes to a very low CPU usage (Thank God) but still spikes up to 100%
 upon opening Photoshop. Which is odd because my computer exceeds the recommended system requirements for photoshop. =/.

<h2>            Skype for Business no longer supported&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A user has been trying to use skype for business but when they launch it and sign in there is only the option to log into Teams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Skype for business and it still works as normal, I signed out and back in and still fine (I also use Teams and have the client installed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Teams supposed to be taking over from Skype? If so can you call (voip) an external Skype user using Teams? If Skype is now defunct then why is it only seem to be for some users and not others?<br />

<p>Hi<span>&nbsp; </span>AM_780,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there is a upgrade from Skype for Business Online to Teams currently, and this upgrade is not applied to all Skype for business user. It depend on the upgrade journey that your organization has chosen, by assigning the appropriate coexistence and upgrade
 mode to your users. Please see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/upgrade-to-teams-execute-skypeforbusinessonline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>upgrade from Skype for Business Online to Teams</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to communicate with external Skype for Business user, both organizations must
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/let-your-teams-users-communicate-with-other-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
let your Teams users chat and communicate with users in a Skype for Business Online organization,</a> then you can search the external Skype for business sip address in Teams like following image and communicate with him.

<p>Hey mate, have you tried a different power outlet? Also, if a friend has a power supply you can borrow, you may want to try that too. If neither of those resolve the issue, I believe your console will need a repair.</p>

<p><span>Hi Chruel,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you are able to scan using other programs I would suggest you to access Samsung’s website and download the
 latest drivers for your scanner and install it and check if it helps. </span></p>
<p><span><br />
Link to download the drivers from Samsung:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.samsung.com/sa_en/support/download/supportDown.do?group=&amp;type=printers&amp;subtype=monomultifunction&amp;model_nm=SCX-4200&amp;disp_nm=SCX-4200&amp;language=&amp;cate_type=all&amp;dType=D&amp;mType=DR&amp;vType=&amp;prd_ia_cd=06010300&amp;model_cd=&amp;menu=download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.samsung.com/sa_en/support/download/supportDown.do?group=&amp;type=printers&amp;subtype=monomultifunction&amp;model_nm=SCX-4200&amp;disp_nm=SCX-4200&amp;language=&amp;cate_type=all&amp;dType=D&amp;mType=DR&amp;vType=&amp;prd_ia_cd=06010300&amp;model_cd=&amp;menu=download</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also you may use try installing scanner by adding it manually in devices and printers and check if it helps you
 fix the issue. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To add the device manually, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Start and click on Control panel.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select View by to large icons.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select devices and printers.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Add a Device and follow the instruction to install the scanner.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After the installation is complete restart the computer and check if you can scan using Windows fax and scan.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also you may refer the link below to install the scanner on your computer and working with scanner.

<h2>            What does it mean when there&#39;s a multicolored square on my screen&#63;</h2>
                    <p>so I'm not even gonna lie, I was trying to download something and my laptop told me not to run it so I didn't and I made sure to run two full system scans with Norton and it only found cookies so I didn't think much of it. Then, a little while later I was
 finding out how to play a game that you have to disk to but when you don't have a disk slot and then a message saying 'the application was unable to start correctly (0xc000012d). Click ok to close the application' so I clicked ok and then closed internet explorer
 and noticed that there was also a multicolored square at the top of my screen which had also appeared once before but I just turned my computer off and back on and it went away but this time I closed it and opened it and now my screens just black with the
 multicolored square at the top. My laptops always been pretty glitchy and such but if I tell my mom what happened she'll just say oh well and not talk to me for like a week.</p>

Thanks for your detailed reply to Charles.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
On my 4+ year old Lenovo laptop with Windows 7 32-bit (upgraded from the dreaded Vista) , I have updates set to notify me when available, rather than installing automatically so as not to interrupt my work.&nbsp; I eventually realized that I wasn't receiving notices,
 went to check for updates and received error code 80073712.<br />
<br />
On my own, I pursued your Method #1 &amp; Method #4 to no avail.&nbsp; Now I'll try Method #2 &amp; Method #3.
<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I purchased an ASUS desktop with Windows 7 64-bit and am encountering difficulties installing Microsoft Security Essentials because, apparently, the download file is corrupt -- a known problem at Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I'm not a very happy Microsoft camper these days.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks again for your detailed instructions.<br />
<br />

    <title>My laptop&#39;s touchpad won&#39;t highlight text properly&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniel_1994  say:</h3>
<h2>            My laptop&#39;s touchpad won&#39;t highlight text properly&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been having this problem for a couple of hours now. Basically a couple of hours ago, my laptop went berzerk. When I clicked a link a couple of hours ago, my laptop froze. Then my mouse started to move very, very slowly and it came with a very annoying
 and repetitive 'beep, beep, beep' noise. I had no decision but to turn off my laptop. Then I came back on the laptop and I thought everything came back to normal. However, sometimes when I try to highlight something, it won't let me do it. It still works on
 some things like search bars, etc. However, when I try to highlight something like a tweet on Twitter, it won't let me highlight it at all. I haven't had this problem before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Asus X550CA laptop or something like that, and it runs on Windows 8. On 1st November, my little sister spilled some water on my keyboard and since then I have to use the on-screen keyboard since the following keys are not working:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 'o' key</li><li>The 'y' key</li><li>The 't' key</li><li>The caps lock key</li><li>One of the two shift keys</li></ul>
<p>What could be causing this? It wouldn't be the water damage from last month since it would've dried out by now.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for reporting this issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On Windows 8 before the upgrade, did you manually install a driver from Kodak to have&nbsp;the bidirectional support&nbsp;working, or was it working just by plugging in the printer?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

</p>
<p>By 'other printers' I was referring to Fax, OneNote and the XPS document writer. Not strictly printers but all have this option greyed out.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The printer is connected via a local&nbsp;WIFI router.&nbsp; The printer is available to other users who have not upgraded to Windows 8.1, and have no trouble using the Kodak software for the printer.</p>

</p>
<p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp; I simply loaded the software that came with the printer, I guess bidirectional support was working, as I have had no trouble using the printer until upgrading to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; It seems to get the software working again I need to
 enable something that I am now not allowed to alter.</p>

            <p>Hi, Andrew:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the printer bidirectional support was working before the upgrade when you just ran the software came with the printer, then I suggest on your current Windows 8.1 system, you delete the printer on the Windows 8.1 first, then re-install that software coming
 with the printer,&nbsp;and see if that will make the printer working again.</p>
<p><br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
To resolve the same problem, I used the most updated software from the Kodak support website for my ESP 310. The bi directional message appeared but my printer was detected. I changed my driver using Windows Update and selected AOI-3. I now have all functionality
 of my AOI.<br />
<br />
Note- I now have 2 Status Monitors in the icon tray. The newest one has 4 maintenance options instead of 3<br />

            <p>Changing the file association should be easy, but first please tell me the file type(s) of your picture. By this I mean the few letters after the&nbsp;"." near the end of the filename. For example,</p>
<p>holidayphoto.JPG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (file type = .JPG)</p>
<p>cartoondrawingofdog.GIF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (file type = .GIF)&nbsp; .</p>
