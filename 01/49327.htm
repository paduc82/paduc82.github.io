<h2>            Region Blocked &#42;South America&#42;</h2>
                    
<p>It's amazing how after all these years Microsoft and
<em><span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)"><strong>XBOX</strong></span></em> haven't taken under consideration some countries, especially in the south of the American continent, and to be more especific, the country of
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Venezuela</strong></span> (South America is part of the American continent for those in Microsoft that doesn't know their geography 'cus they think they're a country by itself). All i've heard from Microsoft is, that the
 fault comes down to developers and/or publishers, which if you think it through, it doesn't make any freaking sense whatsoever. Microsoft owns XBOX right? They have the technology and the creative minds to think of a way to not have these restrictions and
 xenophobic actions (that's racism towards other countries and its people), towards Venezuela specificly right? Couldn't they fix that? Shouldn't they fix that? I can't believe no one has addressed this issue, not even Latin Americans. Like myself, there are
 others, alot others, that feel the same way but haven't taken the time to do this so i'm up for this gruesome task, which its kinda liberating actually. Finally comes another console, the amazing
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)">XBOX </span><span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)">ONE</span></strong></em><span><span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;and my worst fear is that it will happen all over again and i wouldn't be able to enjoy some
 or most of the features this new console will bring</span></span></span><span><span>. Now to the issue at hand; i've tried like crazy to download some of the free games that the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)"><em><strong>XBOX</strong></em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;has</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;has
 launched <span>(which aren't the best games the&nbsp;</span><em><strong><span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)">XBOX</span>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)">360</span></strong></em><span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;has released)</span></span>&nbsp;and like many
 other Latin Americans, i couldn't because of my region code, that means that my country isn't compatible or worthy to get some of the features the
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><em><strong><span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)">XBOX</span>
<span style="color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 1)">360</span></strong></em></span><span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> has to offer. The same thing has happend with DLC's, videos, apps, music, movies, you name it and i wonder,
 why in the name of video games, Microsoft haven't changed these restrictions yet after all this time? Because they're racist and they think that North America alone is the only place that makes them earn money? But it is not true, other countries make you
 earn money, not all developers are in North America. Please Microsoft and XBOX, see this as a serious problem, because it is. I've been a huge XBOX fanboy since its beginnings and want to keep being ONE, so please don't take the last ounze of hope we still
 have in you. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

            Jim,
A new Surface should not act this way. You can try a two button reset:

Step 1:	Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.

	
Step 2:	Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both. 

	
	The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.

	
Step 3:	After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.

	
Step 4:	Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.

--------------------
Next step would be to uninstall the driver in Device Manager (if that option is available) but don't delete it when prompted. Restart, and that should reload the driver.

---------------------

If that does not work, you could try reimaging from a downloadable recovery image https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage 

If it were me, I'd return and repurchase rather than go through that effort. Do

            Hello Jim,
This sounds like you need to reinstall the driver for the wireless adapter. Follow the steps below and let me know if it resolves your issues.

Uninstall the Network drivers in Device Manager then restart the device&nbsp;
- Press the windows key and the “X” button on the keyboard then select Device Manager&nbsp;
- Select the arrow beside Network adapters from the list provided to expose a sub-list&nbsp;
- Right click on the option that reads HID-Complaint MARVEL AVISTAR&nbsp;
- The Uninstall the driver&nbsp;
- Restart the device three times&nbsp;

            Hi Laura, Windows Explorer is useless when it comes to working out where your hard drive space is being used . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility called Treesize. Using that tool, you will instantly see where this space is being used
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have worked out where this space is being used, please let Me know so I can advise on what is safe to remove, or indeed what the problem may be . . .
<br />

            Here are the results from TreeSize. I am confused because these numbers don't go over 50GB (which makes sense because that's the size of my partition) but in settings I am getting that 400 number. Could it be that the files on the Mac side affect the storage

            Hi Laura
<br />
<br />That report in settings is incorrect, this is a known bug in Windows and will hopefully be resolved in an update soon. 
<br />
<br />Your whole Windows installation on that Mac is just under 50GB

            okay thank you! this all started with me trying to find space for an update so maybe I can get enough room for that and see if it helps. In the meantime, is there any recommendation you can make to free up more space? I do see that I'm using 49.8GB out
 of 50.

<h2>            SAMSUNG NP270E5G-K04CH problem with Internet Explorer randomly opening or becoming active</h2>
                    <p>If I have clicked on a link that opened Internet Explorer, finished using IE (this is the onle instance that IE is used on my laptop, since I prefer Firefox), and closed it with Task Manager (using end task), despite it not showing as active in Task Manager,
 at unpredictable points as I use the touchpad, IE is spontaneously re-opening on the page I closed. I end up in a cycle of IE spontaneously opening requiring me to terminate it in Task Manager each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I leave the spontaneous IE session open and navigate back to whatever else I was doing on the laptop, at unpredictable points as I use the touchpad, IE will spontaneously become active on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is never resolved, unless I do a reboot of the whole laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no self-made shortcuts to IE anywhere on my laptop. IE is listed in Tiles, but they are not working on my laptop (they show, but nothing happens if I press them), so I have no idea why this is happening, but it is extremely annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me how to fix this.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>This issue can occur due to application conflict or virus infection. I would suggest you to refer to the steps and check if it help.</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Boot the computer in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Safe mode</strong></a><strong> </strong>and check if the issue persists. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode then perform a
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>clean boot</strong></a> to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After troubleshooting, see the section “<strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong>” to return the computer to
 a <strong>Normal startup</strong> mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow these steps and run the
<strong>System Maintenance</strong> troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/where-is-control-panel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Control panel</strong></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click on
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click
<strong>View all</strong> on the left pane of the screen.</span></p>
<p><span>d. In the list of options, click on
<strong>System Maintenance</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click
<strong>Next</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Run virus scan using
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></a>, which would help us to get rid of virus, spyware, and other malicious software.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the status of the issue. If you need further assistance, please post back. We will be glad to help you.</span></p>

<p><span>In method 1, you can rectify if the issue is caused due to third-party application conflict. I would suggest you to check if the issue persists in safe mode with networking and keep

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be more detailed in answering me about Method 1 - how long do I need to stay in that mode? Am I able to do everything I need to do on my laptop during this time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot repair IE. Here are the instructions from your link:</p>
<p>-----------------------------------</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Close all Internet Explorer and Explorer windows that are currently open.
</li><li>Start Internet Explorer. <br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> If you are running Windows 8.1 or Windows 8, start Internet Explorer from the desktop. Changing your settings will affect both Internet Explorer and Internet Explorer that you start from the desktop.</li><li>On the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, tap or click
<strong>Internet options</strong>. If you don't see the <strong>
Tools</strong> menu, press Alt. </li><li>In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> window, tap or click the
<strong>Advanced</strong> tab. </li></ol>
<p>-----------------------------------</p>
<p>There are 2 problems with this for me - I have no IE icon on my desktop, and I have no menus showing in IE, regardless of pressing the Alt key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What next?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you keep on looking for point-to-point response, you will never get one.. As Anil suggested check if you have Internet Explorer set as default in the computer…
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First of all make few things clear..</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you use IE or firefox on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>If IE is not corrupted why are you trying to repair it?</span></p>
<p><span>What is the exact issue you are facing with IE?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also you should not create multiple case.. it creates confusion in providing TS..</span></p>

<p>
I want Microsoft to find a fix that will allow me to revert back to my 1607 version as this update / upgrade has completely erased my saved documents as well as corrupt my mail contacts addresses and under no operations can I recover or revert back to or find
 my backup or do a systems restore and Microsoft says [ <span>We appreciate you providing additional information. Regarding the message that you’ve encountered when you’ve tried to go back to the earlier build of Windows 10, it was already a reported bug after

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We appreciate the information that you’ve provided. To assist you with your concern, we suggest that you enable the hidden administrator in Windows 10 for you to proceed with the revert process or going back to the earlier build. Before doing the process
 of going back to the earlier build of Windows make sure that you had already back up all your important files to avoid data loss in the process. To enable the hidden admin, you can follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>In the <strong>Search</strong> box, type <strong>Command</strong> <strong>
Prompt.</strong> </span></li><li><span>Right-click on the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> and select <strong>Run as Administrator.</strong></span></li><li><span>Once the <strong>User Account Control</strong> window pops up, click <strong>
Yes.</strong> </span></li><li><span>Type the command below and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span><br />
<strong><span>net user administrator /active:yes</span></strong></li><li><span>Type <strong>net</strong> <strong>user</strong> <strong>administrator</strong> &lt;Password&gt;, and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
Note: In this command, &lt;Password&gt; represents the actual password that you want to set for the administrator account.</span></li><li><span>Type exit, and then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Log off the current user account.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><br />
Give us an update with the outcome.</span></p>

<p>Maybe I did not make myself perfectly clear. I did employ the command prompt by typing into search sense it is no longer available by left click in the start sector and I Did right click for Run as Administrator which produced no window to apply your command
 instructions. It seems just as a reply given to me earlier that microsoft engineers are aware of this problem and are working on a bug fix not yet released. You can go to setting and use the search feature and still cant get command prompt to open and power
 shell is the replacement for the standard command prompt Which by the way, gave me the same error message. I can send a screenshot of that but I want positive solutions, not try this and let me know your results.</p>

<p>I did configure a new adminstrator account which is redundant as all i does is give you a new users format. This is not resolving the problem of microsoft not allowing to revert back to a prior build as though that has been locked out with this creator 1709
 build. You guy keep providing me options which does not address the primary problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered in my dropbox and cloud some of my lost documents as well as my pictures but my microsoft office was reset to new and all my documents will not open as I seem to have a fresh document folder. My windows old folder will not show the old document
 folder. This is not the first time a upgrade has done this and as I stated earlier, microsoft engineers are aware of this latest snag and say they are working on a bug fix so why not you guys consult that department to see what bug fix they are talking about.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live connectivity issues...</h2>
                    
<p>Let's try and keep this short...<br />
<br />
I've been having problems with Xbox Live for a few months now. The problem was always relatively minor, such as I didn't have ports forwarded on my router or a few other minor tweaks I had to adjust to allow me to play with ALL of my friends Online and have
 no connection errors between us. I now have it so my NAT is open, well for the most part...</p>
<p>My brother and I share a network with our Xbox 360's. I have an open NAT when just mine is connected by itself, but when he's online my NAT is restricted. It doesn't really make sense to me, but that's why I'm here. I've forwarded all ports to his Xbox,
 and how my router is configured right now I can't assign Static IP's. This, however is a relatively small, OCD issue, where I just want things perfect.</p>
<p>What isn't perfect is that for the last 4 months I've had to manually test my connection via the Xbox Network Settings tool in order to be able to connect to Xbox Live. Sound funny? It does to me as well. Funny, and very annoying. What's even more annoying
 is that lately, for the passed 5 days, I've had to manually reboot my modem AND test my connection via the Xbox Live Network Settings tool, before I'm able to connect to Xbox Live.</p>
<p>All of my connections are wired.</p>
<p>What I'd like to know is...</p>
<p>A) Is anybody else having similar issues?</p>
<p>B) Does anybody know possible solutions?</p>
<p>C) Am I wasting my time posting here?</p>

<p>The most issues are because there is a connection issue at home if you haven't setup your router or modem. I'd like to know how many of you setup his NAT. (with ports open manual or just with uPnP enabled) Tell me what kind of code you get when you run Xbox
 Live Test. If you have not setup the router at all, look up the manual of your router and modem and visit this page.

<p>To add to that, Still, the ideal setup for two consoles would not be port forwarding, actually, but enabling UPnP on the router you're using (and using a
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/connecting/network-hardware-compatible-xbox-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>To confirm that, I've actually just the uPnP and NAT enabled in my modem and router. I have a Thomson Modem from my provider and bought myself a Sitecom Router.&nbsp; Which is not even supported when you look at the link provided by Mr. Fitzer. So if a friend
 comes along, he can plug-in on the fly without even have to change a thing.&nbsp; :-)</p>

<h2>            How does one set default profile for synaptics touchpad</h2>
                    I use an external mouse, and I disable the touchpad on my HP ENVY dv6 running Windows 8. I have a profile set up for the touchpad that disables it, but I have to go through six or seven mouse clicks to activate that profile. How do I make that profile
 the default when I boot up the computer?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for keeping us posted. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a hotkey you can press to disable/enable it usually located on the top row of your keyboard (F-keys).&nbsp; It is indepedent of the model, you can check the computer manuals or you have to get in touch with HP.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also refer a similar discussion on HP support forums.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some assistance.&nbsp; I bought a Microsoft Surface 8.1 RT in the USA and I was using it in the US on wifi fine.&nbsp; But now I am back home in Australia and I cannot connect to my home wifi.&nbsp; I can see the available network but when I put my wifi key password
 in, it says it cannot connect to the internet.&nbsp; My modem also is not picking up my tablet.&nbsp; I have tried everything, including uninstalling and reinstalling network adapter and running all the troubleshooters.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Technicolor TG797n v3 modem connected to Telstra NBN and I have had no trouble connecting other wifi devices.&nbsp; Is there an incompatibility with Microsoft Surface 8.1 RT and the modem?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else using their Microsoft Surface 8.1 RT on TELSTRA NBN?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please could some one give me some advice I really would appreciate it.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu unavailable</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a new Asus laptop a month ago that came with Windows 8.&nbsp; I upgraded immediately to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I opened my computer from sleep mode and received the BSOD with the words FAULTY_HARDWARE_CORRUPTED_PAGE. When the computer finished restarting, there were some major changes made to my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, my start menu has been replaced by the start screen (tiles taking up the entire screen).&nbsp; I'm unable to access my desktop.&nbsp; Also unable to minimize or resize any windows/applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restoring my computer to an earlier date, but it just flashes my desktop for a second and then reverts back to a full-tiled screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm unable to reach taskbar properties or desktop properties.&nbsp; Under settings &gt; personalization &gt; start&gt; I have checked the box that turns OFF the full start screen, but I continue to only get the full start screen.&nbsp; This is so frustrating!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've scoured the internet trying to find a simple answer to my problem, but continue to come up short.&nbsp; Please help!!!</p>

            <p>Normally the User profile folder derives its name from the name of the Account used to create the profile in the 1st place, there is no option to choose a folder name during setup. One of my computers has the profile folder of Hairy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although you can change YOUR name in the user settings it is all linked to the same security ID which does not change and points to the user profile folder. This path is irretrievably linked to the security ID and if you were just able to change the folder
 name those links would be broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may find guides on how to change the User profile folder name but it is generally unsupported and could create problems going forward. Don't do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As MA says the simplest option is to create a new user and copy the data across. Remember the point about how the folder is named and choose carefully. When I now set up a computer for myself I create it using a local account 1st using my given name then
 change it to a Microsoft Account after I have logged on. As per above my given name is not the Account login any more but the profile folder does not change.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Hi fahadhasee, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
From your issue description, I understand that you are unable to boot to the computer after trying to partition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Let us start with a few questions-<br />
1) How exactly did you install Windows 8 on the computer?<br />
2) Was it a clean install or an upgrade?<br />
3) Did you purchase Windows 8 through your email?<br />
4) Have you made any software or hardware changes on the computer prior to the issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Let us now perform some troubleshooting steps. All the steps are to be performed systematically and in an order.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Method 1-<br />
Let us start by disconnecting all peripheral devices from the computer except the keyboard and the mouse.<br />
Perform a hard reboot and try to boot normally into the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Method 2-<br />
You need to boot from the disk or the USB device (after changing the BIOS settings) and perform a startup repair.<br />
Boot using Windows 8 Installation disk and perform startup repair. <br />
b. Insert the disk into DVD drive and restart the computer.<br />
c. Press F12 key (typically this is F12, but it can differ between computer manufacturers) and choose the drive that you inserted the installation media into.<br />
d. Once the Windows Setup window appears click Next.<br />
e. Click on Repair your computer.<br />
f. Click on Troubleshoot and then select Advanced Options.<br />
g. Click on Automatic repair.<br />
h. Follow the on-screen instructions and finish the repair.<br />
I. If a repair does not fix the issue, then select “Advanced options”.<br />
j. Choose “system restore” and load the computer back to an earlier date.<br />
k. Similarly, try the other recovery options.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the above information helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do get back to us and let us know the status of the issue by your next post or in case you need further assistance regarding Windows.</div>
<div><br />

<p>We're glad to hear that the issue has been resolved.&nbsp; Should you encounter any issues with your download speed on the browser, here are some helpful steps you can do to resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Restart your modem</strong></p>
<p>Often slow connection may be due to the speed of connection that you are getting from your Internet Service Provider (ISP).&nbsp; Attenuation may be present as well depending on the type of connection that you use.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Try to see if the issue occurs in another browser</strong></p>
<p>Often the speed of download may only be occurring in one browser, i.e. Internet Explorer but not in other browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Reset Browser Settings</strong></p>
<p>There are also times when the slowness of download is due to the cache and temporary internet files that is being stored by your browser and often, resetting the browser or clearing cache and cookies does the job.</p>

    <title>Windows UEFI Reboot Loop After Windows 10 September Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows UEFI Reboot Loop After Windows 10 September Update</h2>
                    I have been having a ton of issues after what I believe to be was installing the September Cumulative Update for Windows 10. Ever since then, after Restarting, I run into a reboot loop. It fast boots through BIOS, then as soon as it tries to load Windows
 UEFI, it reboots itself. This happens both for RAID and AHCI configurations. I cycle the power off and back on and then it will continue on to Windows 10. Please fix this.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Corrupted Windows Store components are one of the possible reasons why this issue is happening. We recommend using the App troubleshooter and resetting the Microsoft Store cache to see if it helps. Check out this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>and click <strong>Run troubleshooter</strong>, then type <strong>wsreset
</strong>in the search bar and press enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us in the loop with the result.</p>

</p><p>Please run the troubleshooter first, but if that does not help you could reinstall the Windows Store App component.</p>

            mI just had this issue too. I think what fixed it was going to my Microsoft account on the computer, the change settings option, and then click to verify your PC if necessary. I didn't realize this was something that hadn't been done, had to have them
 send a code to my email and I entered it.

            I discovered that my Microsoft account and the laptop password were different. I logged out of the laptop and logged in with my Microsoft password. Then I opened Microsoft Edge and clicked the store app. Everything then linked up. Opened the tv &amp; movie
 app and finished downloading.&nbsp;

            Hi Tim, my name is Max and I'm an independent advisor.
<br />
<br />Please go to the Microsoft Update Catalog to download cumulative updates. It will allow you to update Windows offline. Try to search using KB article. For instance KB4464330 for latest build version 1809
<br /><a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx</a>
<br />I also recommend that you install the latest servicing stack update (SSU) before installing the latest cumulative update (LCU). You can download this update automatically from Windows Update.

<h2>            wireless mouse in usb 3.0 port - Device descriptor failed</h2>
                    <p>i'm having problems when connecting wireless mouse to usb 3 port in laptop (lenovo Y510P). I'm getting "device descriptor failed" (code 43 in device status) in device manager. Mouse is working fine in computer's only usb 2 port (and other devices are working
 in laptop's usb 3 ports), but due to its placement it is already in use. It is also working in my desktop's usb 3 port. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I already tried:&nbsp;</p>
<p>- disabled fastboot,</p>
<p>- reinstalling all usb drivers under bus controllers in device manager,</p>
<p>- turned off usb selective suspend in power options,</p>
<p>- turned off "allow this computer to turn off device..." under power management of usb hub,</p>
<p>- rebooted and plugged multiple times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>usb 3.0 driver on lenovo's and intels's websites are for windows 7 only (extensible host controller 1.0 (Microsoft) is driver installed by default).</p>

<h2>            BRANCHEMENT OPTIQUE XBOX ONE&#63;&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Bonjour a tous ca fait au moins deux mois que j'essaye d'avoir un bonne audio sur ma xbox. Jai acheter une barre de son hdmi et apres l'explication et l'aide d'un expert audio future shop: rien a faire le son n'était pas compatible. (question de television,
 aucune prise audio ni hdmi ni optique)&nbsp; Il y a eu recament une mise a jour prenant en charge l'audio. Avec une barre de son optique, puis-je la brancher uniquement sur la prise optique de la xbox? Ou dois-je absolument avoir une connexion via ma télé pour
 obtenir le son? Dans les parametres de son xbox on peut activer l'audio optique et desactiver l'audio hdmi. Merci de votre aide j'espere juste ne pas avoir a m'acheter une tvhd qui a absolument besoin de sortie audio et hdmi&nbsp;ou optique.</p>

<p>Pour ma part je pencherai pour brancher la barre directement sur la console en conservant la vidéo via HDMI.</p>
<p>Du moins je ne vois pas comment la barre peut-être connectée directement sur la TV et retransmettre le son émanant de la console.</p>

<p>salut.</p>
<p>si la TV est munie d'une sortie optique il est préférable de brancher la TV sur la borne audio comme ça &nbsp;le son de tout les appareils branchés en HDMI sur la TV sortira par la borne si non tu n'as qu'a branché la console en optique seule sur la borne mais
 il est dommage d'acheter cette appareil (la borne) pour ne brancher qu'un seul appareil

<p>je ne te comprend pas dsl... la borne? si je branche le hdmi pour avoir la video sur ma tv mais que dans les options de la xbox je ferme l'audio hdmi (conserve tjs image) alors la es-ce que je peut brancher la barre sonore via la plug optique de la xbox
 et par la suite dans les option de la console allumer l'audio optique?!? cela va-t-il marcher? vais-je avoir le son optique via la barre sonore et l'image hdmi sur ma tv? ou ces branchement ne fonctionne pas du tout? lolll jespere me faire comprendre. Merci
 a l'avance.</p>

<p>si tu n'as pas de output optique sur ta télé.. dans ce cas tu branche le output optique de la console sur la borne il n.est pas nécessaire de désactiver l'option audio du branchement HDMI de la console mais si tu ne le fais pas tu auras le son de la console
 sur la borne et sur la télé.. en même temps et si tu le désactive tu ne perdras pas limage tu vas seulement couper le son sur la télé mais pas sur la borne voila &nbsp;!!! j'espère que je suis assez claire dans mes explications

 a besoin d,une alimentation électrique et sert à émettre le son de tout appareil brancher soit en branchement optique (numérique) ou RCA (analogique) et oui tu branche ta console à l'aide d.un fil optique à partir de la console sur optique output de la sur

<h2>            Driver Verifier causes crashes incriminating</h2>
                    <p>Hello, today I runned the tool "Driver Verifier" in order to stress my drivers to assure everything is okay. After rebooting, t got a BSOD caused by the antivirus Bitdefender.</p>
<p>
On Mon 26/06/2017 14:13:44 your computer crashed<br />
crash dump file: C:\Windows\Minidump\062617-8578-01.dmp<br />
This was probably caused by the following module: bdfwfpf.sys (bdfwfpf+0x1203)&nbsp;<br />
Bugcheck code: 0xC4 (0x2000, 0xFFFFF80D7DA11203, 0x0, 0x57464442)<br />
Error: DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION<br />
file path: C:\Program Files\Common Files\Bitdefender\Bitdefender Firewall\bdfwfpf.sys<br />
product: BitDefender Firewall<br />
company: BitDefender LLC<br />
description: BitDefender Firewall WFP Filter Driver<br />
Bug check description: This is the general bug check code for fatal errors found by Driver Verifier.&nbsp;<br />
This appears to be a typical software driver bug and is not likely to be caused by a hardware problem.&nbsp;<br />
A third party driver was identified as the probable root cause of this system error. It is suggested you look for an update for the following driver: bdfwfpf.sys (BitDefender Firewall WFP Filter Driver, BitDefender LLC).&nbsp;<br />
Google query: BitDefender LLC DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION<br />
