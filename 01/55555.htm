            Hi booboo87<br />
<br />
Thank you for Posting on Microsoft Answers.&nbsp; I will be moving your Post to the proper category, which is Hardware, once I am done replying.&nbsp; This category is the installation of Windows Vista.<br />
<br />
Is your Scanner compatible with Vista and does it have Windows Vista Drivers?&nbsp; I searched for this model scanner and do not see any drivers for Vista.&nbsp; Most programs do not put an ICON on the Taskbar, you have to copy and paste one there.<br />
<br />
Did the installation create a ICON on the Desktop?&nbsp; If so you can drag and drop it to the Taskbar, if not click on Start, All programs, find the scanner program and look for the application for the scanner, create a shortcut to the desktop, then drag/drop it
 onto the Taskbar.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps answer/resolve your issue - thank you<br />

    <title>Reading Pane - Win 10 Mail App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> technik21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reading Pane - Win 10 Mail App</h2>
                    <p>Now that I have to use the inbuilt Mail app within Windows 10 because WLM is discontinuing, I would like to know how to set the reading pane for all email to show at the bottom of the message list rather than on the right hand side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be no option to change this. I have looked in Settings\ Reading, but no mention of changing the view pane from side view to bottom view....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this actually possible within the Mail app??</p>
<p>

            <p>AFAIK there is no way to do that.</p>

<div><span>If you are ONLY using windows live mail (any version) for email and not calendar &amp; contacts you can configure it to work using IMAP/POP.&nbsp; If you do need to sync calendar &amp; contacts ..</span></div>

</span></div>
<div><span>There is a great replacement for Windows live mail that is free to try (up to 2 accounts) that DOES work with the new outlook mail format called emclient. &nbsp;There is also a paid version. You can get either here</span></div>

</span></div>
<div><span>It works with Exchange, POP, IMAP, and looks similar to Windows live mail. &nbsp;Frankly it is the first replacement I have seen that actually works. &nbsp;I have switched.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>They have their own support forums, a decent product, and seem to be the only replacement for WLM that has the look and feel of it.</span></div>

</span></div>
<div><span>You can import all your windows live mail into emclient easily by doing a file&gt;import&gt;windows live mail. &nbsp;This will&nbsp;import&nbsp;your current WLM data into emclient</span></div>

<h2>            Unable to shut down WIndows 7 computer</h2>
                    Original title: Shut Down Error<br />
After reinstalling windows 7 my computer wont shut down unless I manually turn off the power. It's all mostly new hardware except for the HD and RAM. Everything else works fine it just wont shut down... At first the problem seemed to be the logoff sound as
 stupid as it sounds. It would ask me to force shutdown simply because the logoff sound was running but it would also freeze while doing this. I disabled all&nbsp;log on and log off sounds and now I no longer have that problem. Except it still will never shut down
 on it's own...&nbsp;Any advice?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Do you receive any error message when you try to shut down the computer?<br />
2.&nbsp;Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>If you are able to shut down the computer check the Event viewer for any error logs once you restart the computer.</p>
<p><b>Open Event Viewer<br />
</b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer</span></a></p>

<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to shut down any networking applications or devices (if at all you are using) before performing a shut down and then check.</p>
<p>You may also try to force shutdown by pressing the power button of the computer.</p>
<p>Once you are able to shut down the computer try to boot into safe mode.</p>
<p>Check the link provided below for information on Safe Mode.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
<p>If the issue does not persist in Safe mode then you may perform Clean Boot.</p>
<p>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install
 the program.</p>
<p>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>You cannot make a computer that is running Windows 7 shut down or sleep

<h2>            Cannot Map, or use symlink to point to folder on NAS device under Windows 10</h2>
                    I use a CrashPlan Pro (CPP) to back up my (currently) Windows 7 system both to the Cloud and to a local WD CloudMirror NAS device. Some backup programs, including CPP, have difficulties directly addressing folders on such devices under Windows (this is
 apparently Windows' problem), but there are various workarounds for this, including mapping the folder as a network drive (which doesn't work for CPP), and creating a symlink to it on a local partition (which does). Under Windows 10, which I am currently dual-booting,
 I now (after jumping through a hoop or two!) have full access to the folders on the NAS device by 'Opening' it from the Network Devices screen, but I can neither map them to drive letters nor access them through&nbsp;symlinks. Attempting the former fails with an
 obscure&nbsp;error message. It is possible to create the symlink, but attempting to use it provokes a similar error message. Is this a result of enhanced security in Win 10 'saving me from myself'?! Does anyone have

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            After further research, I found a workaround. It is first necessary to ensure that the NAS device is assigned to a fixed IP address, either in its own Network BIOS or (my preference) by setting the router to recognize its MAC ID and assign it to a fixed
 address. Once this has been done, the device or folders on it can be mapped or accessed&nbsp;via&nbsp;symlinks
<strong>by using the IP address in place of the device name</strong>, so, for example,&nbsp;'\\CloudMirror1\Backup' is represented as '\\192.168.3.201\Backup'. The mapped device or symlink can then be used in the normal ways.

            This did not work for me.&nbsp; I assigned a static IP address in my router, rebooted and router and NAS device (and it showed the new, static IP), and assigned the symlink via mklink /D.&nbsp; When I tried to open the resulting shortcut, I was told that "the username
 or password is incorrect."&nbsp; No password is being enforced for network access by the NAS device.&nbsp; When I inspect the properties of the shortcut, Windows informs me that the target (of the shortcut) is invalid.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 file transfer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jill.sil86  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 file transfer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I updated my windows from 8.1 to 10. After a couple of days it stopped working and would not let me access the windows start menu. I researched the issue and tried a couple fixes recommended that ultimately failed (uninstall windows apps and then reinstall
 again; scan using task manager for any corrupt files which there weren't any).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It lastly told me to create a new windows account which I did, and it works fine. The only problem I have is that it did not transfer any files or Microsoft applications (word, excel, etc.) which I have on the other account that does not let me access my
 start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not the best with computers and I can't figure this out. Is there someone who can help me?</p>

<p>Hi Francis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conflicts with a third-party program or a corrupted Windows system files could be one of the possible reasons why you encounter this issue. For us to assist you better, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Which version and OS build number of Windows 10 is currently installed? To check, press the Windows key, type winver, and press the Enter key.</li><li>Do you have a third-party security software installed?</li><li>Do you have a game controller connected on your computer? Try to disconnect and check if you will still encounter the same issue.</li><li>Does the issue exists in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a>?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I would suggest that you try to run your computer in clean boot and check if you will experience the same issue. Running in clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program
 in Windows 10. You can follow the steps in this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to run your computer in clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Please go through the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting
</strong>of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

<p>This is no corrupted windows system. That was game controller. funny, It don't have been pushed down any button. Ok, this is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I can disable the game controller in windows system? (note: I knew I can unplug the controller. so I would to have it plugged in.) so it would not cause "strange" black box in search box, edge, etc by game controller.</p>

<p>Actually, No. I do not want to disable joystick. (by the way, joystick is Microsoft xBox 360 controller for windows.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read my message above. I want to disable this joystick controller feature that use in Windows system, But not for game or other apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reason, If this joystick left stick stuck, You would get black or which box in Edge, Start, Device, etc. (It have no effect on old IE, Firefox, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem that windows 10 do not tell us if it detected "jammed or shuck" joystick at boot up. It would to let user know their joystick have pressed or stuck. So, User can unstuck it.</p>

<h2>            &#91;XBOX&#93; FM3 crashes to dashboard at start</h2>
                    <p>Hello, it was suggested by the XBOX Support that I post here because it might be something to do with my account being a Preview account (console is all retail though).<br /></p><p>Below is rough copy of an e-mail I've sent to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with an exception that I've tried it on another profile and it works there. I still cannot play both games on my main profile.</p>

<p><br /></p><p>Hello,</p>

<p>since the last update I am unable to play Forza Horizon 3 and Forza Motorsport 7.</p>

<p><br /></p><p>Forza Horizon 3 loads until it shows press "A" to continue then it shows the syncing progress then it crashes to dashboard without any error information.<br />It works offline when I disconnect XBOX from the network.</p>

<p><br /></p><p>Forza Motorsport 7 loads until I choose "Continue career" after which a cogwheel is turning for a while then it stops, a static sound can be heard and it crashes to dashboard without any error information. After the latest update I was able to play once and after that it also stopped working like FH3.</p>

<p><br /></p><p>The console is XBOX One X (Scorpio), OS version is the latest at the moment - 10.0.16299.4059.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Both games are fully patched (1.0.112.0 for FH3 and 1.116.450.0 for FM7 form the loading screens).<br />Both games are digital.<br />Both games were redownloaded.<br />Both games are on the internal HDD (I don't have any external drives).<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>I've tried to delete the save data from the disk and the cloud for the FH3 but it either was not deleted from the cloud or it did not help the issue.</p><p><br />The console was reset to factory settings with removal of everything.<br />NAT is open.<br />All the other games work fine.</p>

<p>Profile is set to Poland, console is set to Poland/Polski. But even when set to English/US it still doesn't work.</p>

<p><br /></p><p>The issue was also sent to XBOX support with a case number 1413030048 without any resolution so far.</p>

<p>The issue is similar if not identical to:</p>

<p>I already talked to technical support on this... But I want people to read this. If so they have time.</p>
<p>You mention the process most had tried to do that. However, sadly phone action cannot work here. And the methods people try to use to verify this are somewhat not legal. Let me explain what a real problem is and why you must have a valid Windows or at least
 owned your copy.</p>

<p>And my apologies to the Microsoft Representative who actually answered this.<br />

 the generic icons are showing up for some globally installed apps even for other user profiles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that some apps, like Outlook, display fine in the taskbar when the app is running, but as soon as I right click and pin to the taskbar or pin to the start menu, the icon becomes generic. Other office apps, show as generic icons always. several
 thrid party apps, cush as PuTTY do the same, but other apps, such as TextPad or Chrome display fine. This basically makes the taskbar and start menus nearly worthless. I can not afford the downtime to do a clean install and re-install of all of my tools on

<p>
</p><p>I am facing the same issue! This happened just a month ago and it is very annoying! I've tried all options given like rebuilding the cache, resetting the apps, clean reboot, disk check and even install windows (upgrade option so that I can keep my programs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My symptoms are exactly like @william's. Have you managed to solve yours?</p>
<p>I also noticed that the programs in the root install folder shows the generic "window" icon instead of its own icon. a handful of .exe files from other programs are unaffected, it baffles me why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried to change the icon of its shortcuts. When i click change icon, i can see all available icons for that .exe which is as expected. If i choose the default (which has the best resolution), it changes to the generic "blank file" icon. If i choose
 the lower resolution icon, it does it successfully, before changing back to the default one after computer reboot.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 File Explorer Adress Bar Resizing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fire_thanatos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 File Explorer Adress Bar Resizing</h2>
                    <p>I have my text sizes set to 24 pt on a FHD screen I'm trying to use the Windows 10 Address bar breadcrumbs to navigate folders, but if I click directly on the name, the address bar shrinks, as if I had to type the path. Afterwards, it stays shrunk &nbsp;after
 clicking out of the bar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Advanced sizing of text and others... all set to 24 Bold (Icon setting changes font size in Address Bar)</p>
<p>DPI scaling at 100%,</p>
<p>Resolution at 1920 x 1080p, native resolution</p>
<p>I use Magnifier frequently</p>
<p>
</p><p>NONE OF THESE ARE SOLUTIONS OR WORKAROUNDS. I want to know either how to disable inputting text into the Address Bar, &nbsp;or forcing the Address bar to remain the same height and not snap to the size of the text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Also, there was no issues in windows 8, and this was customizable in windows 7 Appearance settings. There are many problems with Windows Explorer interface customizability, and many of them could have been solved with the old Windows 7 Appearance settings</p>

    <title>Xbox Fitness problem with Insanity course. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> omega mad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Fitness problem with Insanity course.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm loving the Insanity episode on the Xbox fitness app, or at least was.</p>
<p>When I try to start The Insanity course now the PiP screen appears then almost immediately an error box appears "CDN Error, Resourse not available".</p>
<p>This is really frustrating as other fitness courses seem to run fine.</p>
<p>How can I clear the error?</p>

<p>How about other workouts? I discovered yesterday i can do any workout apart form insanity.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing is that it's just my profile that has problems with it. Other profiles on my xbox CAN run Insanity just fine!</p>
<p>I've ried deleting fitness and my profile but still no joy. xbox support on twitter are being very helpful though. they've given me a few things to try. I'll keep this thread updated with results</p>

<p>Hey guys, </p>
<p>I'm having the same problem as well. Went through troubleshooting with xbox phone support, and the issue was not resolved. Im unable to use the beach body total body 10 min and cardio 10 min workouts, and it constantly gives me a CDN ERROR when it loads.
 Restarted and cleared cache, and even did a factory restore. Still not working... getting very agitated.

<h2>            Windows Media Player - MP3 Tagging</h2>
                    <p>Right,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen this asked many times but cannot find an answer to these simple questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Can I change the tagging service provider that Windows Media Player uses <strong>
(f</strong><strong>ai.music.metaservices.microsoft.com)</strong>?</p>
<p>2. If YES, then how?</p>
<p>3. If NO, then why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I want to change it is because it is rubbish, and I cannot be bothered typing them all in. I have loads of CD's to rip. Through 10 today so far I have managed to get 3 matched properly by the service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very simple. &nbsp;Please answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Bernard - Hi...</p>
<p><strong>f</strong><strong>ai.music.metaservices.microsoft.com </strong>has its limitations and IMO the
<strong>'Gracenote' </strong>database used by iTunes is better particularly when in search of less mainstream or classical items (AFAIK one can only access 'fai' with WMP) - One tip I picked up here is that with fai it is better (counter intuitively) to enter
 a couple of key words from a title rather than the whole thing thereby reducing the number of words searched and refining the results. Otherwise it might be worth downloading 'iTunes for Windows' even if you only use it for metadata, rip your CDs there and
 transfer them to your WMP library. (The 'If Not - Why Not' bit is one for MS...!!)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheers - R&nbsp; )

    <title>Problem with screen driver. Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luis enrique13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with screen driver. Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a two year old dell Inspire n4050. It is an old model, however it has an i5 and 4gb of ram. The quick scan said that the comouter was compatible with windows 10 so I did de upgrade.</p>
<p>the computer was doing its job and had like a 25% when the first reset occured and after that the screen got black. I decided to wait as the cpu light was showing activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another hour later, my screen turns on an is ready to start with the new windows. Everything looked Good &nbsp;so I checked it out and turned it off. however after turning it on again, the scren was black again. So i connected it to a tv and and surprisingly
 worked after believing I hade done something wrong.</p>
<p>After a research, i found out dell stopped updating the drivers since windows 8, and this problem had also appeared on windows 8.1.</p>
<p>the specific driver is the Generic PnP monitor to control the screen and had an Error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the pc runs win 10 smoothly, but I don't know what to do in this case. Can I use another generic driver or Im doomed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>*for all the people I have read with a black screen without Cursor. If windows 10 is installed and after turning it on you can see the cpu is working and windows logo, wait for it to load and close it to suspend it. Now open it again and it should turn on
 on the login screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The driver starts working after a suspension, i dont know why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>
