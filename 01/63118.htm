            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, if you are receiving bad sector then the issue is related to hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While running your computer, you may receive error messages suggesting your hard disk might contain bad sectors. The errors are typically flagged as "CRC" or "Cyclic Redundancy
 Error". Some of your data files are missing, unreadable or corrupted and it takes forever or impossible to access certain files and folders. This may be a cause of bad sector problems. Sectors are pie-sliced divisions of a hard disk. And a bad sector is a
 sector on the disk which data cannot be written or read due to a physical damage or inconsistencies of parity checking bits on disk. Any data that is written or stored on that area is likely to be lost or corrupted. Data residing on the rest of the disk may
 be unaffected and the disk is considerably usable if the bad sectors are few. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bad sectors are mainly due to the magnetic weakening of the domain and mechanical faults. Over time, the magnetic areas of a disk lose its magnetism and hence its inability to retain
 permanent data loss on the disk. When bad sectors spread, it can result in system instability when important system files are destroyed. Mild corrupted data however can be corrected by most file system utilities.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unknown to most, the bad sectors could some times be due to bad parity checking bits written on disk. Most modern disk while storing data will transparently store parity bits together
 with the data. When the data is read, the parity bits are also retrieved and compared to ensure the data integrity. This goes on without the knowledge of normal user. When the parity bits are corrupted for some reasons, it will result in bad sector errors.
 In this case, through some proprietary recovery software, ADRC could actually repair the bad sectors without loss of data by correcting or rewriting the corrupted parity bits on disk.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very often, bad sectors are manifested as a result of failing Read Write head. When the Read Write heads fail to read and interpret the magnetic signals normally, the same kind
 of bad sectors errors could occur. Frequently, bad sectors are also early signs of disk crash as it deteriorates over time.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solution to Bad Sector Problem If the disk is still working well, important data should be backed up immediately to avoid further data loss. If the system respond is virtually "hanging"
 to a standstill and you have valuable data, the best option is to consult a data recovery specialist without doing this yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commonly, a full format process should be able to "mask" the bad sectors or earmark the bad sectors in file allocation table. One could continue to use the disk while the operating
 system will take notice of the location of bad sectors and avoid them altogether.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another common CHKDSK utility provided by Windows Operating System may help to detect and mark for bad sectors. During a surface scan, it attempts to write data to that sector and
 then read back what it wrote. If the two do not match, the sector is marked as bad as it does not maintain data integrity. The operating system will note the particular sector and avoid writing new data onto that area of disk. After which, the bad sector will
 be remapped to a special sector on the drive which is reserved for this purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps</p>

<h2>            &#91;Solved&#93; Headphones not working after Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>[EDIT: I got it working after uninstalling something I had just installed (AVG Antivirus).] After installing the Creators Update, my headphones no longer receive audio (though they were working fine right before the update). My laptop can play audio through
 its speakers, but when I plug in my headphones (into headphone jack), nothing comes through (the speakers stop transmitting audio until I unplug the headphones, as usual).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The headphones no longer appear in the Device Manager nor in the list of Playback Devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restarting the audio service</li><li>Restarting my computer</li><li>Installing more updates</li><li>Running Windows troubleshooters (the "Playing Audio" one and also the "Hardware and Devices" one)</li><li>sfc /scannow (it verified fine)</li><li>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth (it says it completed successfully, but the problem persists)</li><li>Uninstalling audio drivers (one under "Sound, video and game controllers" ("High Definition Audio Device") and one under "Audio inputs and outputs" ("Speakers (High Definition Audio Device") -- there is also a "Microphone" under the Audio inputs/outputs,
 but nothing about headphones.) They always reappear within a couple seconds. I have also tried to update these drivers, but everything is apparently up-to-date.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mediaq/2015/07/30/windows-10-audio-troubleshooting-tips/ &nbsp;&nbsp; recommended including the Hardware Ids for the "High Definition Audio Device"; they are these:</p>

            It seems new Windows auto disabled my manufacture installed headphone driver! . I have to re-install audio driver(download from laptop manufacture website) , reboot my laptop, then select "play back devices" and choose enable &nbsp;audio diver just installed
 when being asked and headphone works as before.

<h2>            Windows 8 and the Hanvon&#47;Hanwang GraphicPal 0806</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>&nbsp; I'm struggling to get my GraphicPal 0806 tablet to work at all in windows 8. &nbsp;I've tried all the tricks I can think of, and have tried both the Win 8 specific drivers and the older drivers available on their website. &nbsp;In the best case scenario so far
 the following happens:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) The HWTablet control panel loads successfully but finds no tablet.</div>
<div>2) The tablet is recognised by Win 8 in Devices &amp; Printers as "Tablet" but does not appear to use the driver from the installer.</div>
<div>3) It does not operate the mouse pointer and is not recognised in any other software (e.g. Photoshop).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; This worked fine in my old Windows 7 install and also still works fine in Mountain Lion on my laptop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; I've tried to contact hanvon/hanwang directly for help but their support email address bounces with a mailbox full error, a problem I cannot see disappearing any time soon as it's been a month now.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; So to summarise, it appears to be a Windows 8 specific driver issue, there are windows 8 drivers available but I cannot discover if they have worked for anyone else.... both google and bing foo eludes me. :D</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; Can anyone here offer advice that isn't "Go and buy a Wacom"?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />
</div>

 tried restarting the laptop many times and starting it in Safe Mode, I also tried reinstalling my graphics card driver, but none of that made any difference. I also tried connecting an external monitor but everything looked in grayscale there too.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 64 bit audio problem</h2>
                    I did a clean install of windows 8 then downloaded 8.1. I did update my video driver but haven't for my creative sound blaster card, it said I didn't need to. So now when I open Microsoft flight sim X&nbsp; I have sound but when I open a webpage to get info,
 sound stops. System is not in pause mode. When I left click on the fsx window, the sound returns. It seems like windows 8.1 auto mutes the audio????&nbsp; I haven't tried this with other programs yet. Thanks

<h2>            Android remote desktop won&#39;t connect&#63;</h2>
                    I'm running on windows 7 32-bit, I have remote desktop enabled and I'm entering in my IP address, username/domain and password all correctly but I keep getting the same message on my android device whenever I try to connect remotely. It says "Unable to
 connect to remote PC. Please verify Remote Desktop is enabled, the remote PC is turned on and available on network, and then try again". What am I doing wrong here? Any help would be appreciated. I'm not much of an IT guy. Thank you.

The problem happens only when I open this page: http://bugguide.net/node/view/248891<br />
It happens only in Firefox, not in Explorer and it persists no matter how many times I turn the computer and Internet off. An error message shows up that reads:<br />

A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.<br />

I have to wait and stop the script or continue (it makes no difference) every time.<br />

    <title>Storage Spaces&#47;REFS recovery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brandon rinebold  say:</h3>
<h2>            Storage Spaces&#47;REFS recovery</h2>
                    <p>I have a storage space that has failed. Trying to open it results in the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9139dd9-f0c8-4940-9aa5-d3b6d7ad99f0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9139dd9-f0c8-4940-9aa5-d3b6d7ad99f0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a two-way mirror on the same set of physical disks as another storage space that is a simple no resiliency storage. Since the no resiliency mirror is still functioning perfectly, there isn't a disk failure and the storage space should survive a drive
 failure anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9cb211f9-e4b9-4efb-80b6-634d4277a586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9cb211f9-e4b9-4efb-80b6-634d4277a586" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone aware of a tool for repairing an existing storage space or at least recovering data from a broken one? The storage space volume shows a raw partition so this feels like a file a file system issue but chkdsk doesn't run on REFS partitions. It says
 "the REFS file system does not need to be checked", which under the circumstances sounds like an extremely Microsoft thing to say: it doesn't fail so you don't need to repair it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55980c58-e2a0-4947-8b4d-5e9e1e1c85d4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55980c58-e2a0-4947-8b4d-5e9e1e1c85d4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I'm looking at data recovery from either&nbsp;http://www.reclaime.com/ + the demo of http://www.storage-spaces-recovery.com/ (Techncially I think the StorageSpaces Recovery paid version might allow me to image the drive out to a VHD but I don't need
 anything except the files and the data isnt worth $299.95 to me) or&nbsp;http://www.r-studio.com/ . However, I just wanted to see if I was missing an easy tool to actually repair the storage space itself without losing the data or needing to transfer out most of
 a terabyte via USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, is there anything known to cause this or any way to avoid it in the future?</p>

 it was working fine then i downloaded a program from ''Softonic'' which I've used loads and never had any problems with, After I installed it, my laptop suddenly stopped me from clicking anything. The mouse still moved and highlighted things, but just wouldn't
 let me click and open them. I tried factory resetting my laptop, but it still won't let me click anything.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know why and how I can fix it?<br />
I also scanned it, apparently there's no virus or malware on the laptop, I have also tried system restore.</span>

            A Factory Reset seems to be a bit of an overkill. Anyway, I do not think that you tried this method. If you check the Acer web site then you will find that you can invoke the Factory Reset without Windows running at all.
<div><br />
<div>I recommend this method:</div>
<div>
<div>1. Keep tapping F8 during the early boot phase.</div>
<div>2. Select Repair from the menu.</div>
<div>3. Enter the Administrator's password when prompted. It is often blank.</div>
<div>4. Select System Restore when prompted.</div>
<div>5. Set Windows back by three days.</div>

    <title>Recent Windows 10 update taking long time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> czar05  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recent Windows 10 update taking long time</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday, I ran into a problem in which Windows updates took a very long time. When the laptop restarted and began to boot again, a blank screen appeared along with dots, signaling its start up. The problem was, this state took forever from 2:00 pm to 6:40
 pm. I then started a hard reboot, which finally brought out the blue screen with a prompt signaling the installation was commencing again. Then later that night when shutting down, Windows ran another update.&nbsp; When I turned the machine on this evening and
 waited for it to boot, the black dotted screen appeared again and stayed that way for about 30 minutes. Tried hard booting again, with no luck. I'm not sure what the problem is. I'm sure its the update because I've never had this problem before. Searching
 around the web, I've found other users having a similar problem in which the installation process fails.

            After waiting for hours to complete I forced a re-start (power button). After the OS reverted back, I turned off the auto update service.&nbsp; Until I see that Microsoft has fixed this the update service will remain off.

            <p>My second PC (windows 10) started updating yesterday at 8 pm. This afternoon, at 14 pm, it was still running - grey screen and the rotating dots. No reaction, when I use keyboard or touch-pad.</p>
<p>Then I removed the wireless usb mouse connector. Suddenly the screen went black - but the PC is still working.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I should have continued my story.</p>
<p>After I removed the usb dongle, the PC screen was black for a period of 5-30 minutes.</p>
<p>(I left after 5 min. and came back half an hour later)</p>
<p>Then it had restarted on its own and I could log in normally.</p>
<p>Everything works fine now.</p>
<p>I will remove all usb connections before next update.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10, Skype, Lifecam and Camera</h2>
                    <p>I need to adjust my Lifecam brightness - it is currently too dark.&nbsp; Although you can adjust this in the camera app, it resets itself whenever the app is closed.&nbsp; Also it does not affect the brightness in Skype.&nbsp; Previously I was able to adjust the brightness
 settings in Skype, however with the latest versions this option is not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be grateful if anyone can tell me how to make this change to the brightness in a way that it continues between sessions and makes the image brighter in Skype as well as in the camera app.</p>

<p>Hello Jomel.&nbsp; Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No there were no changes.&nbsp; The only change has been the upgrade to Skype for Windows 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with the LifeCam has been a potential issue since Windows 10 was released, as you could no longer use the LifeCam software, but instead had to use the Camera app, which does not save changes to the brightness.&nbsp; However, it was still possible
 to control and save settings for brightness in the old version of Skype, and that carried across back to Camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since Skype for Windows 10 was recently upgraded, that function has been removed.&nbsp; So it seems to me that first through Windows 10, and then through the upgrade of Skype, Microsoft has made it impossible to adjust the settings of the camera they
 manufacture, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or to put it another way, my Microsoft camera seems to be next to useless now, due to software changes made by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you, or someone else knows of a way to adjust and save the adjustment to the settings...</p>

<p>Hello Julie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp; Unfortunately I can't see an 'Advanced' option.&nbsp; On clicking Skype in the Apps list in Settings the only choice is between Modify and Uninstall, and Modify is greyed-out, so not available.&nbsp; I'd be grateful if you could advise again
 please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>Hello again Julie</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid I've done that and there's no change.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only difference is that having reinstalled Skype there is an advanced option in Settings/Apps.&nbsp; So I've tried the Reset process too and that also hasn't worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The camera remains too dark to use with Skype and adjusting the brightness in the camera app does not then carry over to Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further thoughts would be appreciated.&nbsp; I'm aware this seems to be quite a widespread problem: that Microsoft has removed the ability to set the exposure in both Camera and Skype and has not provided updated drivers for the LifeCam HD-3000.&nbsp; I'm not
 able to see any way of working around this at present, meaning that these upgrades have rendered my Microsoft Webcam useless.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be delighted if someone can find a work around, and I think there are many others around the web who will also be pleased about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Chris.</p>

<p>Please try updating your video driver. You may follow the steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select the Windows logo/Start button, type Device Manager, and select it from the list of results.</li><li>Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select Update Driver.</li><li>Select Search automatically for updated driver software.</li></ol>

<p>Thanks Julie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all that without any further success I'm afraid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got to think the easiest solution is for Microsoft to add back basic video control to the Skype app.&nbsp; Otherwise, they need to provide drivers that manage the automatic exposure on the LifeCam or provide a standalone app to manage the camera's settings,
 particularly exposure/brightness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As noted earlier, as I've researched this I've seen this is a widespread problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, is there anything you or anyone else can suggest to try and make this work better, or work around this problem please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>

<h2>            inaccessible_boot_device</h2>
                    <p>Hello to all,<br />
<br />
I recent upgrade to W10 from a lenovo laptop with W 8.1. The installation went fine, but it was a little slow so, after backuping my files, I decided to format and reinstall W10 throught the Configuration menu in W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to sleep and, when I woke up, my laptop was rebooting in a infinite loop with a message like this "Something happened :( we need to reboot you laptop [...] If you want to know more about this, search for: inaccessible_boot_device" (I'm quoting from
 memory).<br />
<br />
I have tried creating a booting pendrive (I downloaded W10.iso from the official page and used Rufus) and the bios wont start/mount the usb.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried the recovery windows disk with an usb. When I got to the menu, I tried the following: "Refresh your PC", "Reset your PC" and, in Avanced Options, "Automatic repair". None of this options worked.
<br />
<br />
Edit: I can not access windows. And when select "Reset your PC" option, I can only choose W10.<br />
<br />
Please, help :)<br />
<br />

            <p><strong>Hi, thanks for asking a question on the Community!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Are you sure you have BIOS system on your laptop or do you perhaps have a newer UEFI (Unified EFI)? It depends on how old your laptop is (UEFI can be found on laptops that are about 4-6 years old or younger). You have to properly set Rufus so that
 your PC can boot from USB. It can be a real issue sometimes to get it working, as you often have to dig through BIOS/UEFI settings, but as far as I know, Lenovo makes it as easy as possible, so check your settings for "boot order" or an option to boot "Legacy/USB
 devices".</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I suggest you to try to make a bootable USB a couple more times with diffrent settings (try MBR or GPT options in Rufus) and see if that works. If it doesn't, make a bootable Windows DVD (download "Windows 7 USB/DVD download tool" - it's free and
 easy to use), insert a blank DVD into your other computer, run the software and follow instructions, then boot from CD/DVD on your laptop (press the blue ThinkVantage button if you have it, or other designated button to select a boot device - it should be
 written on the screen as you turn on your computer).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you still can't solve your issue, please post a model/serial number of your laptop and possibly a MFG date (usually found inside battery bay or on the bottom side of the laptop, at least on older Lenovo laptops).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Hope this helps! If this reply solves your issue, please mark it as an Answer, so other community members can also see the proper solution.</strong></p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Dual Monitor Blurry Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fesawstar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Dual Monitor Blurry Screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>I use my Surface Pro 3 for 1 year now with the Docking Station and an external Monitor (1920x1080). I always used my Surface as my primary Monitor and everything worked and was sharp (even Applications like Skype). Then i decided to change that and use my
 external monitor as my primary monitor. I changed it and it was still everything sharp. But then when i restarted the Surface, everything on the Surface was blurry (Skype, Google Chrome...). I already searched for a similar problem but everybody changes the
 size on the Surface from 150% to 100%. I don't want to do this, because it would be too small for me. I already updated my drivers. So the main problem seems to be in the restart. Cause before do that everything is perfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope somebody can help me fix this problem.</p>

</p><p>Dear sir/madam</p>
<p>
</p><p>My e mail account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** was blocked by Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I've tried multiple times to recover the account using the recovery form. Because I've had the account for many years I've been unable to remember some of the vital security information.<br />
<br />
However, fortunately on the 15th April '14 through a combination of the various information I've been providing to Microsoft I was finally accepted and given chance to unlock my account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Due to obvious reasons I however hesitated to trust the Microsoft email and so made a post on the Microsoft community forum. Asking if the email address *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and it's links were authentic. I was unable to get a reply
 from the US Microsoft Helpline. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately by accident in trying to copy the email to the community forum using my iPad I accidentally activated the link which cancels the account reset request.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've now tried several more times to open the account reset link and also resubmit the account recovery form but have finally received an email saying I must open a new account as I've tried multiple times.<br />
, &nbsp;<br />
I, AS ALL OF US DO, &nbsp;REALLY NEED MY ACCOUNT BECAUSE I HAVE ALL MY WORK INFORMATION STORED ON ALONG WITH VITAL CORRESPONDENCE.<br />
<br />
I CANNOT SIMPLY LOOSE ALL THIS DATA AND INFORMATION AND OPEN A NEW ACCOUNT AS IS BEING SUGGESTED BY THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
MICROSOFT BLOCKED MY ACCOUNT SO I FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE COMPANY HAS A DUTY OF CARE TO SUPPORT MY SITUATION. AND THAT I'M GIVEN FULL OPPORTUNITY TO UNBLOCK IT.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The CHAT HELP FACILITY on the general Microsoft website has FAILED 5 times to respond to my chat request.<br />
<br />
Having submitted adequate information once which authenticated me as the account holder it seems absurd that now I've been asked to open a new account.<br />
<br />
I do appreciated that a lot of communication messages are automated responses but as Microsoft are in the business of electronic communication I fail to appreciate the challenges present in simply talking or chatting to customers.<br />
<br />
Fully communicating the procedure towards security are vital as Microsoft clearly do, but FULLY communicating the steps to reverse the procedure is what Microsoft appear to be failing to do.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
kind regards.</p>

            <p><span>Hi
<span>KAD Rebar,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Have you made any recent changes on the computer?</span>
</li><li><span>When was the last time it was working fine?</span>
</li><li><span>Do you face similar issue with all the files you try to move or delete on the computer?</span>
</li><li><span>Do you have any security software installed on the computer?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 1</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below and run the Fixit tool available, check if it helps.</span></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 2</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then I would suggest that you boot the computer into safe mode and check if the issue persists.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 activation problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickpick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 activation problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi just purchased a new computer which has windows 8.1 pre installed. However, in order to keep my old data and software I took my old hard driver over to my new computer. The hard disk has windows 10 installed, from a previous upgrade. Now Windows is asking
 me to activate and enter a product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get a product key? I have basically paid twice for windows, once on my old and once on my new computer. I can hardly be expected to purchase windows a third time. Who can I get a product key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

            <p><strong>I have basically paid twice for windows, once on my old and once on my new computer.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is normal, when you buy a computer, you buy an OS for it. OEM license expires with the computer you cannot transfer it to another device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I can hardly be expected to purchase windows a third time. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, actually you have not paid twice, you paid once, upgraded free and are trying to use that one license on two machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you need to either upgrade a valid, activated qualifying version or buy a (new) license for the new machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Who can I get a product key?</strong></p>
<p>You can get a valid product key from <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msuk/en_GB/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.320418600?s_kwcid=AL!4249!10!2648770192!84033306704&amp;ef_id=VfMkhQAABe8B58sL:20150920102513:s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here </a>or from numerous retail outlets.</p>
<p>

            <p>That's the way MS licenses work when you buy them as part of a PC. If you want to be able to transfer it between computers you must buy a retail version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As already stated upgrade you new machine to Windows 10 and then look to install your programs or apps.</p>

            The very reason a bought a PC again is that I wouldn't have to reinstall my programs. Otherwise I can equally switch to Mac. I can't believe the this is Microsoft's intention.

            <p>complicated system -&nbsp;maybe, stupid system - far from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OEM software is the easiest and cheapest way to get software licenses and they expire with the pc, software is preinstalled so that you don't have to install it, all the relevant drivers are installed and working so that you don't have to do any messing
 around&nbsp;before using the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I'm the same person!&nbsp;</strong> if it were you that had the windows&nbsp;license (as opposed to the pc) you could not have other users because they would need their own license (and install their own copy?) - impossible to police, a very stupid system!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>as Neil has pointed out, retail versions can be transferred to other systems (and must be removed from the previous system), they cost a little more that OEM and, more often than not, &nbsp;you would need to install it yourself (or pay somebody to install it
 for you) you will need to install&nbsp;all the drivers etc. and the equipment manufacturer misses out on the opportunity to add a load of bloatware&nbsp;and so lose out on the revenue that brings in and would need to increase the cost of a pc</p>
<p>
</p><p>then it gets really complicated (and really expensive) with the likes of enterprise and volume&nbsp;licenses for multiple PCs and multiple users, which have always been difficult to manage both for the businesses that use them and for the software suppliers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which ever package you purchase you are bound by (and accept when you install) the license agreement, which makes it clear what you can and cannot do, if you break those rules then the license will be revoked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>apple have similar rules in their software licenses, read them before making the switch.</p>

            <p>Yes, but my new machine does have a OEM licence. So all I want is to prevent having to spend a few days reinstalling everything from scratch. That's why I took my old harddisk over to the new computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result is, I have two choices: reinstall everything from scratch or pay £189. And that's not really a consume friendly product.</p>

            <p>ZigZag, I have an idea that I would try if it were mine but I am not sure of the legality so I don't want to put it here (and get it marked as abuse)</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there any way I can run it by you as community moderator before posting?</p>
