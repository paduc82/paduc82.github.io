<h2>            how to share windows live calendar</h2>
                    I am unable to share my Windows 7 Live mail calendar with my wife's computer who also has Windows 7. When I get to the "add people" button and click it I get two windows which are overlapping. The one behind has this statement:<span> Add people to share
 with
<div><span style="font-weight: bold">Enter a name or email address, or use the checkboxes below</span><br />
<br />
When I try to enter an email address, the box will only accept 9 characters so cannot complete that.<br />
<br />
The window that is on top, overlapping the previous one, has this info:<br />
<br />
"People and a Favorites" tab... I'm unable to open the "Favorites" tab.<br />
On the People tab, there is a check box that says "Select all"<br />
<br />
There is an icon which seems to be accessing something but just keeps on running....never access anything. I've watched this icon for over twenty minutes running.<br />
<br />
There is a box besides the "Select All" where you can type something and a search&nbsp; icon.<br />
<br />
I get no error statement anywhere....<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />

<p>After looking at your screenshot. I see you are you using FireFox I tried the same steps as you and it seems to be a Silverlight issue with Firefox. I did use Internet Explorer and where you see the box below people and favorites tab all my contacts appeared
 instanly compared to just a loading icon for FireFox. So try using Internet Explorer it should work fine in there. Let us know how it turns out.</p>

<p>Greetings, Dokker! Very sorry to hear that you're having trouble downloading Call of Duty - Modern Warfare 2 in English. I have a few clarifying questions that will help us get to the bottom of the issue. Do you currently reside in or is your account registered
 to a country where French is the primary language? If so, you may have trouble downloading the game in English. Let me know if you think this might be the case. I'm here if you have any further questions!

<p>Hi Mister Darcy. Thanks for answering so quickly.</p>
<p>I live in Belgium where Dutch and French are the national &nbsp;languages. However my account is set to Dutch speaking. (Hence the NL/be mark) I've never had any problems like this in the past with donloading games. They all showed up in English like all games
 (i assumed).</p>
<p>Been checking it out and it seems that the game is only offered in French to download... Unfortunately its a small text that tells us, didn't even notice it.</p>
<p>Any way i can change this to english?</p>
<p>grts</p>

<p>no if the english content is not on the belgium marketplace you must purchase the correct language disk for your region and match it with the dlc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as blackops is language restricted and must match with the DLC</p>

<p>Hello again, Dokker! Thank you for explaining the situation in more detail. If the DLC is only available in French on your marketplace I'm afraid you won't be able to play it in English. I apologize for the inconvenience. However, I would encourage you to
 phone support. They may be able to assist you further and help you avoid situations like this in the future. Thank you for your understanding.

<h2>            my plug and play battery does not want to recharge at all</h2>
                    one of my two plug and play batteries will not charge at all. when i connect it to the USB cord it will switch on but the red light on the cord will not turn on and when i press the Xbox home button the battery sign disappears but as soon as i remove the
 cord it says i have one bar and the control switches off. I've swapped the batteries to see if it is the control but it is just that one battery. I've only had it for 3 months now and it happens on all the ports and if i connect it to the PC nothing happens.
 HELP!!!

<p>This sometimes happens is it was a faulty battery that just cant seem to hold a charge anymore.<br />
One thing you can try is removing the battery and see if there is any residue on the 6 gold bars, inside the battery pack.<br />
There is a high chance that you will need to get a new battery. Hopefully you can still exchange it like I had to do before.<br />
<br />
I've had 1 battery do that to me. I bought the Red controller / Plug and Play kit bundle. I charged the battery once, Used that charge for 4 weeks, when I tried to charge it again, nothing would happen. The light would go from red to off and the controller
 would work as if it was wired. The moment you unplug the cable, the controller would shut off.</p>

<p>It seems like you have a faulty battery pack. The only thing I can suggest is purchasing a new OFFICIAL charge and play kit.

<p>Hi there SeasickCube829,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear this is going on but how long exactly have you owned this play and charge kit? I ask this because all accessories come with a 90 day warranty and it might still barely fit in to that warranty period. Did this battery pack ever seem to work
 properly? Let us know. Thanks!</p>

    <title>Roller Coaster Tycoon for Vista problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dan3the1man1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Roller Coaster Tycoon for Vista problems</h2>
                    I have tried to play the original Roller Coaster Tycoon on my laptop which has Vista. I can install it but not run it. I have searched for solutions and everything seems to lead to running the game in compatibility mode which makes sense since the game
 is designed for windows 95/98. I have tried this as well as running as administrator and nothing seems to work. I keep seeing an error message that reads "Exception Raised - Access Violation" followed by 8 sets of 0. I have read other posts with users having
 the exact same problem and seeing the exact same message. Some have claimed that they have had no trouble playing this game on Vista and others are in the same boat as me. Can you offer a solution for this problem that works? I see no other current alternatives.
 Thank you.

<p>I am also having trouble.&nbsp; Any time I click anything in the main menu, it simply flashes and then returns to the main menu.&nbsp; I have tried downloading the game .ISO as a torrent and opening it with software designed for .ISO files, I have tried mounting it
 to a clone drive, I have tried using the cd in the cd drive, I have tried downloads that were supposed to be specifically for Vista, and with all of these I have tried every possible compatibility mode, and I have run everything as an administrator.&nbsp; I tried
 re-installing, re-booting...&nbsp;I just can't seem to get it to work.&nbsp; I either get stuck in a never ending loop in the main menu screen where I just get to see the main menu over and over again, or the "Exception Raised - Access Violation" followed by a bunch
 of zeros message appears.&nbsp; I am at a total loss.&nbsp; I don't want to give up on this game, but it has been a very unfortunate and dissappointing venture so far.&nbsp; If anyone as any ideas, please share... and the more detailed the steps for fixing the problem, the
 better.&nbsp; Thank you very much.</p>

<div>
<p>Blue screens are caused by faulty hardware or faulty hardware drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To See if&nbsp;a Fix is Available</strong></p>
<p>In <i>Control Panel</i> (and select <i>Classic view</i> in the left hand pane) choose
<i>Problem Reports and Solutions</i> (type problem in Start's search box), go to <i>
Problem History</i>, right click your error and choose <i>Check For Solution</i>. You may also right click and choose
<i>Details</i> for more info. Post those details here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To See if a Recent System Change Caused It</strong></p>
<p>In <i>Control Panel</i> (and select <i>Classic view</i> in the left hand pane) choose
<i>Administrative Tools</i> then choose <i>Reliability and Performance Monitor</i> and choose
<i>Monitoring Tools</i> then <i>Reliability Monitor</i> (type Reliability in search on Start) . This list is a chart of software installs, uninstalls, Windows updates, and crashes by date (scroll left to see earlier dates). See if your crashes started happening
 after you installed or uninstalled something.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Standard Hardware Troubleshooting</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>First lets test what hardware we can. Hardware faults can appear as many software faults, therefore we need to test hardware first..</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Please do the following in order. Memory faults can cause disk corruption, disk faults can cause disk corruption. Disk corruption causes corrupted files (which SFC may be able to fix). If you get an hardware error stop and post back.
<strong>Do not run chkdsk with faulty memory</strong>.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Memory Diagnostic</strong></div>
<div>If you haven't run a memory diagnostic then please do so. Click <em>Start</em> -
<em>Control Panel</em> - choose <em>Classic View</em> in left hand pane - choose <em>
Administrative Tools</em> -&nbsp; then<em>&nbsp;Memory Diagnostics Tool</em>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>S.M.A.R.T</strong></div>
<div><em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;(or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disk drives in Windows monitor themselves for impending failure.&nbsp;The feature is&nbsp;called S.M.A.R.T. It will detect impending&nbsp;failure&nbsp;30% of the time.&nbsp;In an elevated command prompt type (it's one line)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><em>wmic /namespace:\\root\wmi PATH MSStorageDriver_FailurePredictStatus get active,predictfailure,reason /format:List</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it's on Active will be true, if not on turn it on in the computer's BIOS.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Predict Failure should be False if everything's ok.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In Vista and later if SMART predicts failure Windows prompts the user to run Backup.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Run Chkdsk</strong></div>
<div>In <em>Computer</em> right click all your drives and choose <em>Properties</em>, then
<em>Tools</em> tab, then click <em>Check Now</em>. Tick <strong>BOTH</strong> checkboxes then Start. Reboot. This will take overnight.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Sfc</strong></div>
<div>Check for file corruption by clicking <em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click
<em>Command Prompt</em> and choose <em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;(or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>sfc /scannow</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>For Memory Diagnostic Results</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Click <em>Start</em> - <em>Control Panel</em> (and select <em>Classic</em> view in the left hand pane) choose
<em>Administrative Tools</em> then <em>Event Viewer </em>then look at <em>Event Viewer (Local) - Applications and Services - Microsoft - Windows - MemoryDiagnostic-Results</em> for entries.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>1201</strong>&nbsp;or <strong>1101</strong> and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is
<strong>MemoryDiagnostic-Results</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>Double click the entry for details on that entry.</div>
<br />
<strong>For Chkdsk Results</strong></div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Click <em>Start</em> - <em>Control Panel</em> (and select <em>Classic</em> view in the left hand pane) choose
<em>Administrative Tools</em> then <em>Event Viewer </em>then look at both the <em>
Application</em> and <em>System</em> logs (under <em>Windows Logs)</em> for entries.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Look for <em>EventID</em> is <strong>7</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>
Disk</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>11</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>Disk</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>51</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>Disk</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>52</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>Disk</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>55</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>NTFS</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>130</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>
NTFS</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>1001</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>
Autochk</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>1001</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>
Winlogon</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>1001</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>
WinInit</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>1001</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>
Chkdsk</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>26212</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>
Chkdsk</strong><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Double click the entry for details on that entry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>P.S. <strong>7</strong> and <strong>55</strong> are the auto repair codes where windows repairs&nbsp;disk errors silently on the fly.
<strong>52 </strong>is the SMART warning.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>For SFC Results</strong></div>
<div><em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;(or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>findstr /c:"[SR] Cannot" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log|more</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This will see which files are corrupted. We may be able to copy them from another computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<hr />
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Dump Files</strong></div>
<div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Dump files are files containing the state of the machine when it crashed. We can analyse the file to identify the driver (or program) causing the crash.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Analyse Dump Files</strong></div>
<div>If you want to analyse your own dump files. See further down to upload them for analysis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You need to start Explorer as Administrator to access the files in <strong>C:\windows\Minidump</strong>. Right click Explorer and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>.</div>
<div><br />
Download and install Debugging Tools for Windows<br />
<div>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852363<br />
<div>Install theWindows SDK but just choose the debugging tools.<br />
<br />
Create a folder called <strong>Symbols</strong> in C:\<br />
<br />
Start <em>Windbg</em>. <em>File</em> menu - <em>Symbol File Path</em> and enter</div>
<div><br />
<em>srv*C:\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Close and reopen WinDbg. <em>File</em> menu - <em>Open Crash Dump</em><br />
<br />
This will analyse the crash dump. You need to close and reopen WinDbg for each dump file analysed. Because you are downloading symbols from the internet WinDbg will appear to be doing nothing. But it's downloading. Be patient.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You are looking for a driver or system library that the crash occurred in at the end of the listing. Find the file, right click then
<em>Properties</em> - <em>Details</em> tab. If it shows a driver you'll need to update the driver identified. Most drivers are in c:\windows\system32\drivers. If it shows a system file see if you can get a program from analyze -v.<br />
<br />
Type in theWinDbg command prompt</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><em>!analyze -v</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-v stands for Verbose and if&nbsp;the crash was originated by a program, as opposed to hardware or a driver,&nbsp;it will appear in the middle of the listing.<br />
<div>
<hr />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Upload Them for Analysis</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Or upload the minidump files to your Public folder on Skydrive and copy the link from the address bar and I'll analyse them.</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Skydrive is Microsoft's Windows Live file upload site at 
https://skydrive.live.com/.&nbsp; Read about it at 
http://explore.live.com/skydrive.<br />
<br />
If you have downloaded any of the Live applications or have a web based Live mail account you already have access to your Skydrive.<br />
<br />
Put your&nbsp;event list in the <em>Public</em> folder and copy the link from the address bar.<br />

            Hi GUINNESS78,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Forums.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Turn off the computer completely and check whether the lights are completely off<br />
To turn off the computer completely click start click on the arrow next to the lock button and then choose turn off the computer.<br />
Check with the computer manufacturer or refer the manual.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope it helps<br />

<p>after that I installed skype 8 (actually 8.13.0.3) I cannot make/join group video calls anymore.</p>
<p>Is this normal?</p>
<p>Why the previous functionality has been removed and when will it be re-introduced?</p>

<h2>            Camcorder not recognized via Firewire.</h2>
                    My dell precision 370 running xp sp2 worked perfectly to capture video from my sony vx2100 via ieee 1394 firewire then one day it just wouldn't work. When I now plug in my camera no beep, nothing in device manager, nothing. I know it is not the camera
 because i have a Panasonic camcorder that also is not being found in device manager.&nbsp; I have since replaced the firewire cable and firewire port, but no luck. Could someone please help!

                    <p>Can photos albums with music created in Photos be burned to a DVD? (I'm recalling the Windows 7 DVD Maker.)</p>
<p>If not, could they be burned to a disk and then copied to friends' pcs?</p>
<p>Also, is the background music only available from my hard drive?</p>

            Hi Grandpa.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Yes, you can create custom slideshows with music called Story Remix in the Photos app.  See how it'd done here:

<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks for the links. However, I suspect that they are already out of date. I spent a fortune on Ed Botts'
<em>Windows 10 Inside/Out</em>, which has been rendered almost useless by the many subsequent "updates" to the os.<br />
Case in point:<br />
"Open Photos. Click the Create button in the top-right corner. Click the Video remix option. Select the image and videos you want to use in the project. Click the Add button in the top-right corner."<br />
There is no Create button (or Video remix option) in the top-right corner of my Photos App.<br />
I had also wondered whether a video slide show created with Photos could be saved as a DVD that could be given to friends.</p>
<p>Regards, Grandpa</p>

            Do you have the latest Version 1803 of Windows 10?  Check at Settings &gt; System &gt; About.  
<br />
<br />If so the Story Remix tutorials I linked should still apply.
<br />
<br />If not there are some other alternatives that are popular here:

<p>I have Version 1803 and Build 17134.345.</p>
<p>In Photos I have no Create button. There is a New Video button, and when I click on that I see "Automatic video with music" and "Custom video with music."<br />
There are no Video remix or Video project options (as described in the article you linked me to).<br />
I chose Automatic Video with music, selected a group of photos, and clicked Add. I even added two music files from My Computer.<br />
Now I have a "project" that shows a "Story Line" at the bottom, with 10 photo thumbnails displayed, and a small window on the side that displays each photo for a second or so. I see no way to make the passing pictures display full-screen. Or any way to redo
 or edit the whole "project."<br />
What displays when I click the Play button is not very impressive. And I have no idea how to "share" it with anyone. I am not on Facebook or Twitter. Can this file be e-mailed as an attachment--or, better yet, burned to a DVD?<br />
I must be missing something.<br />
I fondly remember creating some very nice slide shows with music on Windows 7 DVD Maker. Can Photos do that?</p>

                    <p>Hi&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have installed Windows 10 Student edition on my newly build desktop, using the Product key my university provided me. Looked like the installation went fine and it directed to "Other User" login screen. I am not sure what credentials to pass here, I have
 tried everything, my university login, my personal microsoft login but nothing seems to work. I can't even cancel or skip this. I am stuck with login screen for more than day now, please help.<br />
<br />
*Btw I have installed via usb created using Window media creation tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Edit: This is a CLEAN installation on a newly built PC, not an upgrade.</p>

<h3> xd0pexbr0x  say:</h3>
<h2>            ONLINE STATUS UNKNOWN</h2>
                    <p>my xbox one live online status has been showing "Online status unknown" for a few months now, i can still play online and accept friend invitations to party and games but i can't send them, add new friends, send messages or view my content.</p>
<p>I've had a search round the forums and stuff and the two solutions I've seen, hard-reset then unplug the power cable and disconnect and unplug my router, have both done nothing, and its getting very frustrating now as i can't find a solution. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>please if you have any advice, or know if i need to contact xbox live support personally please let me know as its much appreciated :)</p>

<p>Hello Bro,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When doing the soft factory reset as mentioned by Nestor, when you come across the message of "<strong>We were unable to remove this console's home Xbox associations</strong>" you should see an option of "<strong>Continue anyway</strong>."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose this and the soft reset will progress and perform how it is supposed to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try this and let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

            are you sure? because after where it says "please check your connection and try again" it says "if you continue anyway, the contents of this console will still be erased, but the associated home xbox info for anyone who set this xbox as their home console
 will remain" does this mean i will lose my saved game files for example my progress on fallout saves skyrim minecraft etc?

Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />

1. What is the format of the Videos you are trying to import?<br />
2. From Which device are you importing the Videos?<br />
3. Which application are you using to open the Videos?<br />
4. What is the exact and complete error message you get?</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />

The information you have provided will not be enough to answer your question. Please provide more information by answering the above questions.</span>

            <p>MP4 and MOV Files from a Contour ROAM2 and Nikon D5200. I only get it in all the Windows video apps such as Windows Live Movie Maker, Movies and TV, and Windows Media Player, My Sony Editing Software works just fine (although I really don't like using it).
 Here are some of the messages that pop-up. "Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file." " This item is in a format we don't support, please choose
 something else." And of course WLMM says the same thing or acts like the file is corrupted. Also sometimes Movies and TV will play just the audio and it will play a few videos (note they are all just MP4 and MOV)

<p>Microsoft do not control advertisement on YouTube, Google does. As I will explain to you Google own YouTube and control the adverts seen on YouTube. You can activate these settings in the YouTube settings page.</p>
<p>To find more about Google Adsence and advertising on YouTube just simply search "Google Adsence"</p>

<p>BUMP!!! Still no solution to this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have repeatedly reported that I am unable to utilize ATMOS for Home Theatre. I'm at my wits end on this. I can see that in the Microsoft App store "DOLBY ATMOS" is listed but is unable to download and it returns this error "Code: 0x803FB005". I have tried
 clearing cache, uninstalling, resetting and logging out. It won't let me download it, that would explain why its not appearing in device manager?! So this fault relates to the app store. Is there any way I can install ATMOS by bypassing the app store? Dolby
 access and headphones are both listed as current and installed.<br />
<br />
This is ridiculous.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to change target and start in settings so pinned web page can open - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to change target and start in settings so pinned web page can open with your default browser&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So here is what going on?</p>
<p>I recently got Windows 10 Pro laptop.</p>
<p>On Windows 7 PC I was able to pin IE-11 shortcut to taskbar, but Windows 10 gives no such option.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/317d071f-e68f-4de5-a26d-3a61b08eec3d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/317d071f-e68f-4de5-a26d-3a61b08eec3d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Steps I tried as workaround is I opened same website in MS Edge and pinned it to the taskbar, but everytime I open the pinned shortcut it opens via MS Edge. I created desktop shortcut of same website via Chrome and then pinned it to taskbar, same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8afd7ab7-a475-410c-9f6b-78938e862d2c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8afd7ab7-a475-410c-9f6b-78938e862d2c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Right now the pinned shortcut target and starts in paths are:</p>
<p>Target:&nbsp; "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome_proxy.exe" --profile-directory=Default --app-id=nglmfpkackccfmkjpfmjhfebabbfoflm</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start in: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried playing around with it and tried to give target: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"</p>
<p>Start in:&nbsp;"C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\"</p>
<p>It did not help any help how can I make my pinned website to start using IE-11.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 11 is my default browser I wanna use.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            Hi jackin 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I just created a shortcut from IE by dragging the icon which appears first in the address bar of IE. Then I was able to drag it to the Taskbar to pin it to Taskbar.
<br />
<br />Can you confirm that you are not able to drag IE shortcuts to Taskbar?

<p>If I open IE browser and go to this webpage, I can grab the icon left of the page address on the address bar - and drag/drop it on the desktop - it makes a desktop shortcut.</p>
<p>Then right click that desktop shortcut and Pin it to the taskbar is one of the options.</p>

                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 537s desktop which came with Windows 7 installed.&nbsp; I foolishly allowed Windows 10 to install and now I cannot "Go Back".&nbsp; I have learned that Dell is not supporting my model for Windows 10.</p>
<p>So many things are not working right, including my disk drive, that I just want to get rid of Windows 10 entirely and reload my Windows 7 from the original installation disk.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me how to do this?&nbsp; My files are backed up and I am willing to
 start over.</p>

C</span> drive), and then click <strong><span>Next</span></strong>. (Do not select your external USB hard drive.)</p>
</li><li>
<p>You will receive the following warning: <em>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in

<strong>OK</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the instructions to finish installing Windows&nbsp;7, which include naming your computer and setting up an initial user account. You can use the same names that you used in Windows&nbsp;Vista, or choose new ones.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Once you done with installation, ensure to check for <strong>Windows Updates</strong>. Also install all drivers for your device from Manufacturer website&nbsp;to make your PC up and running.</p>

            Since Windows 10 will not recognize the DVD drive on the Inspiron 537s desktop, I cannot reload Windows 7 from my re-installation disk.&nbsp; I also have a Dell laptop Studio 15 Notebook running Windows 7.&nbsp; Is it possible for me to connect the laptop to the
 desktop via USB and use the laptop DVD drive to read the desktop installation disk?

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to us with an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do it, but the procedure is too complicated. Sometime you might require addition hardware and software support to accomplish this. Instead I suggest you to make a bootable USB for windows 7 and use the same to install it on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have Windows 7 installation disk, make use of it to create a bootable USB media. Refer the article
