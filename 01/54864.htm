Win10 Store apps  / Metro / Modern / UWA / UWP
In Windows 8.1, Microsoft introduced Universal Windows Apps (UWA), colloquially known as “Metro apps” or “Modern apps.” In Windows 10, Microsoft took the idea even further and ended up with the Universal Windows Platform (UWP).
Based on my own experience, and the reports of many others it appears that the store and it’s associated “environment” is rather fragile, causing various problems with the store itself and store applications. 
2018 01 13- MICROSOFT OFFICE FOR CHROMEBOOKS IS NOW AVAILABLE
https://www.groovypost.com/news/microsoft-office-chromebooks-available/ 
Android app support for Chromebooks has been under development for a couple of years now. With the latest Chrome OS update, apps from the Play Store have finally hit the mainstream for Chromebooks. If you have a Chromebook that supports Android apps, you can install apps from the Play Store just like you would on an Android tablet or smartphone. It’s confirmed that this now includes the Microsoft Office applications for Android. 
In the Play Store search for the (individual) Microsoft Office app you’re looking for. There’s Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft OneNote.
HOW TO FIX WIN10 STORE APP / METRO / UNIVERSAL APPLICATIONS – WINDOWS STORE RESET
2016 07 19- 5 TIPS TO FIX WINDOWS STORE AND APP ISSUES IN WINDOWS 10
https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-tips-fix-windows-store-app-issues-windows-10/ 
..0. Restart the computer
  1. Win Store Trouble Shooter
  2. Clear store Cache (WSReset.exe)
  3. Reset Windows update (use the tool in the following link)
  4. Reg hack for Connection errors
  5. Re-Register the Store
Here are some additional instructions for the 5 tips defined in the article above 
Remember to test the problem applet between each of the steps.
#0 RESTART THE COMPUTER
Simply restarting the computer is one of the simplest trouble fixes we have. But it is all too often forgotten or skipped.  Too often programs get “confused”. While restarting the program may clear the confusion, sometimes they have an unseen compenent constantly running in the background.  The easiest way to reset them is to restart the computer. 
#1 MS DOWNLOADABLE WIN10 STORE APP TROUBLE SHOOTER
http://aka.ms/diag_apps10 
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-run-the-trouble shooter-for-windows-apps 
Note: both of these links above should take you to download the same diagnosis “CAB” file. 
Use the built in Trouble shooter
Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot 
Scroll down to the bottom 
Click Windows Store Apps
#2 WSRESET.EXE – CLEAR AND RESET STORE CACHE
http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-clear-reset-windows-store-cache-in-windows-10/ 
Run as Admin.
Be sure to run the WSReset (Windows Store Reset) program AT LEAST 5 times. It appears to fix one problem per run, SLOWLY working thorough multiple problems in subsequent runs. Unfortunately the tool is poorly written so it gives the user no indication of what it is doing or if it was successful or not. All you can do is run it several times in the hope that you run it often enough for it to clear all of the problems.
#3 MANUAL RESET WINDOWS UPDATE SUBSYSTEM
the problems remain, you have to revert to a manual process to reset Windows Update
Check that System Restore is turned on and configured 
https://www.pcworld.com/article/2955023/windows/how-to-turn-on-system-restore-in-windows-10-to-protect-against-bad-updates.html 
https://www.tekrevue.com/how-to-enable-system-restore-windows-10/ 
Create a System restore point. (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point )
Use the following process to effectively delete the folders used by Windows Update:
Follow the instructions in this page: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components - How do I reset Windows Update components? (Win7-Win10)
The first paragraph in the above process includes a link to the Windows update troubleshooter. Make sure to run through it also.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6eHDtylDYo How to Fix Win Update Errors
This is a Video of manual process very similar process to the one described in the link to KB971058 (above)
After doing the process in the above link, including restarting the computer Check for outstanding updates:
. – in start menu search for Windows Update
. - click on “Check for Updates”
. – updates are often sequention, they require an earlier one to be present before being installed. So you should repeat checking for updates until you get no more updates

******************************************
****************************
RE-INSTALL ALL STORE APPS USING POWERSHELL
…*  In the Start Menu, search for PowerShell 
…*  right click and select "Run as Administrator" option.
…*  Enter the following commands one by one in the PowerShell window:
………  reg delete “HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\TileDataModel\Migration\TileStore” /va /f
………  get-appxpackage -packageType bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + "\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml")}
………  $bundlefamilies = (get-appxpackage -packagetype Bundle).packagefamilyname
………  get-appxpackage -packagetype main |? {-not ($bundlefamilies -contains $_.packagefamilyname)} |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + "\appxmanifest.xml")}
RESET ALL STORE APPS / REREGISTER / APPS MISSING FROM WIN START MENU
Re-register all store apps, so they appear again in start menu.  For that, open a PowerShell window as Administrator. Copy and paste the following line into the PowerShell window and press Enter: 
Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose } 
Note:	if you re-register all applications, all your apps are back, however all your pinned apps will be reset (the right panel will be empty) so you need to re-pin everything that you want. Personnaly I did a screen capture before, to remember what I pinned and where (use the “snipping tool” in startmenu/windows accessories, with a delay to be able to open the start menu before the capture)

<h2>            Repeatedly being asked to Sign In. How to stop this</h2>
                    <p>Using Windows Live Mail (I have it for 2 years) with Windows 10.</p>
<p>Every time I open it I am asked to Sign In. I click the option to sign me in automatically. But this makes no difference. How to stop this annoying request to sign in?&nbsp; (Sometimes I do sign in. Other times I click on cancel. This makes no difference either
 way. The program operates perfectly whether I sign in or cancel).</p>

            <p>Just had this issue myself the other day. It actually is pretty simple to take care of if you know where to look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply go to File -&gt; Options -&gt; Mail and then go to the Connection tab and click on "Stop signing in."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Presto! No more prompting for sign-in when launching Mail. Hope this helps!</p>

<p><em>Log on</em>? Or <em>Sign in</em>, as you wrote earlier?</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I do not want to continually have to log on when I am the only person that uses the computer.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't really have anything at all to do with it. Two weeks ago, I wrote this in response to another user:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">It sounds as if you don't really understand the purpose of signing in.
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you <em>do</em> sign in, the contacts list and calendar you see are the ones belonging to the Microsoft Account you sign in with.
<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>If you <em>don't</em> sign in, you see a completely different contacts list and calendar, the
<em>default</em> ones.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">By selecting <em>Stop signing in</em>, you will always be using the default contacts list and calendar - until you sign in again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I&nbsp;have never had to log on before and I cannot see why it is necessary now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It still depends whether you're being asked to log on or to sign in. They are two quite different things. It's not at all necessary to sign in, but you won't be able to send and receive mail unless you log on to the mail server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You didn't tell us what <em>it didn't work</em> means after clicking the <em>Stop signing in</em> button.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>When I setup Server 2016 essentials, everything worked fine. Was able to integrate with Office 265 and Azure pretty much flawlessly. But now, it just stopped working and I'm not sure why. I've installed all updates, but it still isn't working. It just comes
 back and says an unknown error occurred when I try to import Office 365 accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what's going on. I was told there was an option update that would fix it but it doesn't show up as me having ANY updates to install on my system.</p>

    <title>Having problems with WiFi after windows 10 update. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Having problems with WiFi after windows 10 update.</h2>
                    Hello, I've been having a problem with my laptop (Asus ROG GL553VD) recently. It started as an error with windows updates, I had a problem where the update wouldn't complete and it went through a seemingly endless boot cycle. I was able to fix it by downloading
 a toolkit to repair my windows updates, after that I was able to install the update perfectly fine. Now the problem I am having is that I cannot connect to WiFi in any shape or form even after plugging directly into the router! it doesn't give me the option
 to do so. I checked my device manager and wireless driver&nbsp; (Intel dual band wireless - ac 7265) has an error code of 56. to fix it I have tried changing the power management settings, updating all my drivers via downloading them on another laptop and moving
 them over through a USB flash Drive. I tried checking for any VPN software that might be installed but I did not find any, I have tried disabling the device and re-enabling the device. I have tried uninstalling the dev

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What I'd do is the vastly superior Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709/1803 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709/1803, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709/1803 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

<p>2)Run Driver Verifer, It pointed towards KSECDD.SYS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3)I Also run Memtest ,everything is good there also.</p>
<p>4)Delete all software's which might cause problem and Updated all driver's up to date.</p>
<p>5)After Installing Bluescreen View, and seeing latest crash dump. Get an idea that "KSECDD.SYS+NTOSKRNL.EXE" causing the whole problem.</p>

    <title>Cloud Speicherung&#47; Kragenplatzer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nellsta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cloud Speicherung&#47; Kragenplatzer</h2>
                    Ich frage mich gerade wozu es einen Cloud Speicher gibt, wenn man damit an einer anderen Konsole sowieso nicht spielen kann? Habe bei mir zu Hause Darksider 2 gespielt und weil ich bei meinem Freund weiter zocken wollte den Spielstand auf der Cloud gespeichert.
 Nun funktioniert das aber nicht ohne vorher den Pass nochmal runterzuladen, der aber 1600 MP kostet! Eine Frechheit, wozu wird einem suggeriert auf der Cloud "problemlos" Speichern zu können wenn's dann in Wahrheit ohne Geld auszugeben, sowieso nicht klappt?
 Ich meine, wenn man für eine Goldmitgliedschaft und das Game zahlt, sollte das kein Problem darstellen- einfach nur Abzocke! Bin echt sauer....

<p>Logisch musst du den Pass nochmal runterladen auf die andere Konsole denn es werden nur Spielstände und keine DLC oder sonstige Inhalte dort gespeichert.</p>
<p>Wenn du ihn gekauft hast erscheint er auch einwandfrei auf dem Marktplatz als gekaufter Inhalt und kann jederzeit wieder geladen werden von dir ohne nochmal die 1600 MP zu bezahlen.</p>

<p>Das war mir schon klar, gekaufte Inhalte sollten nochmal downgeloadet werden können. Ich hab aber nur den Pass eingegeben der beim Game selbst dabei war. Und jetzt kann ich den Spielstand deshalb nicht abrufen und weiterspielen ohne 1600 MP auszugeben. Das
 ist der Witz dabei und für mich reine Abzocke... &nbsp;</p>

<p>Für mich war bisher irgendwie immer irgendwie selbstverständlich, das im Cloud nur Spielstände, aber sonst nichts gespeichert wird, eben weil in der Vergangenheit Stimmen laut wurden, dass Leute ihre Spielstände mit zu Freunden nehmen wollten.</p>
<p>Gamertags und heruntergeladene Sachen (wie z.B. Onlinepässe) waren ja eh schon immer überall abrufbar.</p>

<h2>            If you could choose a game to come to xbox, what game would it be and why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've all seen many games on PC and Playstation that we've all wanted to play. Maybe an old backwards compatible game or some sort of retro game. So if you could choose for one of these games to be xbox, what would it be, and what's your reason why?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you don't have a PC but would love to play a certain MMO, like World of Warcraft for instance? You're Xbox could be your ticket to play some of these games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I'd choose the complete destroy all human series, they were great as a kid and I loved playing each and everyone of them. I have my fingers crossed that they'll make an appearance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Here is the solution:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1st: Download&nbsp;Auto Runs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Here:</p>
<p><a href="http://download.sysinternals.com/files/Autoruns.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.sysinternals.com/files/Autoruns.zip</a></p>

http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2nd: Find the&nbsp;yellow highlighted Image Paths that ends&nbsp;with sysmenu.dll. Usually you can locate those image paths from Scheduled Task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3rd: Right click then delete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4th: Try to find all yellow highlighted Image Paths that ends with sysmenu.dll from "Everything tabs, delete them.
</p>
<p>NOTE: Carefully choose image paths that ends sysmenu.dll only, if you deleted paths that are not high lightened then it might cause some trouble booting your PC.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5th: Reboot Computer </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6th: Wait&nbsp;at least&nbsp;5 minutes to confirm that the issue has been resolved. (sysmenu.dll usually appears within&nbsp;a minute from rebooting the computer. )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps :)</p>

<p>Your bluetooth's microphone isn't always-listening like the microphone inside a PC is.&nbsp; If it was, the Bluetooth battery would die almost immediately.&nbsp; Instead,&nbsp;you'll have to push a button on your headset to start the voice recognition to begin listening.&nbsp;
 And even then, that only works if the receiving program knows how to interact with the Bluetooth headset's capabilities.</p>

            There's no way to lock-on the microphone of any Bluetooth headset that I know of.&nbsp; You'd need to contact the manufacturer to see if they provide that option.&nbsp; Nothing on the receiving end (computer or phone) can force the microphone of the headset to lock
 on, the headset itself needs to have that ability.

<p>Hello</p>
<p>I have connected my Bluetooth earpiece (headset) to both my pc (windows 10). But when I say Hey Cortana with my headset, cortona does not respond. My headset is working and I can use it to listen to music on the pc. How to fix that please ?</p>

<p>I have this same problem.&nbsp; Brand new Bluetooth Dongle, Brand new stereo headset with mic (BH-M20), and everything has been checked multiple times and everything is setup correctly.&nbsp; I even rebooted the system and waited for several minutes just in case there
 was a program lagging and ALWAYS the same results.&nbsp; Cortana can not hear my mic nor can she speak to the headset.&nbsp; The other&nbsp;programs on my PC are communicating just fine with the headset.&nbsp; This is somewhat annoying because one of the main reasons for upgrading
 to Bluetooth is for this function.&nbsp; I am running Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; </p>

            Windows 10 Pro Desktop "Hey Cortana" Bluetooth command worked perfect until I put Office 2016 Pro Plus on? I went through the various applications just to check them out and realized that the "Hey Cortana" command Stopped. I think everything stopped when
 I checked out skype? The switch to turn "Hey Cortana" on is locked off. It says "Hey Cortana" is off while you're using&nbsp;a Bluetooth microphone. I have tried everything from various boards and cannot get it to work. My only thought is to start all over with
 fresh install and uninstall skype immediately. I know I won't be able to use&nbsp;Skype, but I like the "Hey Cortana" feature more. Any advice&nbsp;would&nbsp;be appreciated.

<p>Hi, Bruce,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried going to Device Manager &gt; Audio Controller</p>
<p>Right click on the driver and select one of the two options below:</p>
<p>Update Driver</p>
<p>Rollback Driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if that works for you. If it does not work, Right Click and Uninstall the driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reboot the system and see if it works once Windows installs driver.</p>

    <title>Need to Merge old Skype account with new Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leslieweldon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need to Merge old Skype account with new Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>I would love to just be able to call someone at Microsoft or Skype to fix this, but apparently decent customer service is not an option, so here we are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOW DO I MERGE MY OLD SKYPE ACCOUNT WITH MY MICROSOFT ACCOUNT?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to "Account Settings" in Skype it has a link to "Connect Microsoft Account for a better Skype experience", but when I click on it and login to my Microsoft Account it just takes me to account.microsoft.com and doesn't provide any direction from
 there on how to link it to my Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like when I created the Microsoft account it also created a new Skype account for that MS account as I can login to Skype with the MS account&nbsp;<em>or
</em>the Skype account, but I can't merge the two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is infuriating and terrible programming and if I don't get some help I'm gonna blow a gasket, but there's no simple Chat or Call option for support and instead I'm forced to come
<em>here</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. I'm losing my mind.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 battery not detected - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 battery not detected</h2>
                    Hi so I'm having the surface pro 3 battery problem. &nbsp;It all started yesterday, when my surface pro 3 battery stopped being detected. &nbsp;I've had this problem in the past and have always been able to resolve it but this time no. &nbsp;Prior to this happening yesterday
 I had no problems with my battery whatsoever, it would charge and last for a long time. &nbsp;Now the battery is not being detected. &nbsp;My surface works great while plugged but it's annoying have to keep it plugged. &nbsp;I've looked online for solutions and have done
 all of them. &nbsp;I've restarted my computer (using all the methods), I just did a windows refresh hoping that'd fix it but unfortunately it did not. &nbsp;I've installed all the updates. &nbsp;Unfortunately my warranty is up for the surface and I don't really want to pay
 $29, unless microsoft can truly fix it. &nbsp;I don't think the battery is broken, because it was working great prior to this. &nbsp;I've also tried chargers from other surfaces,

            One thing you could try is upgrading to Windows 10, if you're not already using it. &nbsp;When I first spoke to microsoft about this they offered for me to upgrade to Windows 10 free of charge. &nbsp;I downloaded Windows 10 and tried installing it but it wouldn't
 go past 99% unfortunately. &nbsp;The woman told me that Windows 10 doesn't have the battery glitch as much as Windows 8 does. &nbsp;If you want to bypass the $29 fee of speaking to surface support if you're out of warranty, go to general customer support and demand
 to speak to a surface agent. &nbsp;They'll connect you. &nbsp;That's how I did it and they connected me. &nbsp;

<p>Guys, you can read about lots of people who have issues with the SP3 battery in this forum and elsewhere. If you've done a complete reimage from a downloadable recovery image
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage</a> and you see the no battery icon, you are pretty much hosed. Microsoft issued two separate fixes - for SP3's that actually were fixable for battery depletion,
 but you needed a 40% charged battery to apply them (and again, it didn't work for everyone).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft ENGINEERING &nbsp;seems to have stopped looking at SP3 battery issues. Last time I checked an out of warranty exchange was $450. Don't pay the $29 to talk to support (if they charge you, dispute with your credit card company - explain that you have
 the well known and documented SP3 battery issues and a completely dead battery). Contact support at

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Do you have ZoneAlarm or any 3rd party firewall installed? If so that could be the cause.<br />
Other antivirus/security programs could be at least partially responsible.<br />
<br />
This Hotfix "Might" apply however do not use unless you are fairly sure.</p>
<p>Using two Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) drivers causes a computer to crash when the<br />
computer is running Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2008<br />

<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 7f&nbsp;0x0000007f&nbsp;with the 00000008 parameter usually means a hardware issue.</strong></p>
<p><br />
Have you added hardware or updated drivers recently? Check Control Panel - Windows<br />
Updates to see if any drivers have been updated there just before this started happening.</p>
<p>For 7f - this could be a hardware issue such as poorly seated cards or memory, though there are<br />
other causes. Weak powersupply could also lead to this. Use the troubleshooters above and below<br />
and when you get to the&nbsp; drivers and memory sections refer to my next message below and then<br />
return to the troubleshooters if needed</p>
<p>If a PC remove ALL power. Open case, remove and reseat ALL cards, memory chips, and ALL<br />
cables (do not just try to snug) on both ends if they can be reached and on the device ends if not<br />
(removing the cables and reseating them helps to eliminate minor corrosion).</p>
<p>Notice the 08 (double fault) as 1st parameter means the are likely two causes. Be sure to Update<br />
your drivers manually as using Windows Updates only finds certified drivers and Microsoft and<br />
the Device makers are far behind in that proces. Update NIC, WiFi, BIOS and Video/Display and<br />
other major drivers</p>
<p>If a Laptop or a PC you might have to take to a shop (not BestBuy or other BigBox Stores) or your<br />
System maker's Support.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 7F&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000007F&nbsp; which is the same as 0x1000007F</strong></p>
<p>The UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP bug check has a value of 0x0000007F. This bug check indicates that the Intel CPU generated a trap and the kernel failed to catch this trap.</p>
<p>This trap could be a <em>bound trap </em>(a trap the kernel is not permitted to catch) or a<em>double fault</em>(a fault that occurred while processing an earlier fault, which always results in a system failure).</p>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong></p>
<p>The first parameter that appears on the blue screen specifies the trap number.</p>
<p>The most common trap codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>0x00000000, or Divide by Zero Error, indicates that a DIV instruction is executed and the divisor is zero. Memory corruption, other hardware problems, or software failures can cause this error.
</li><li>0x00000004, or Overflow, occurs when the processor executes a call to an interrupt handler when the overflow (OF) flag is set.
</li><li>0x00000005, or Bounds Check Fault, indicates that the processor, while executing a BOUND instruction, finds that the operand exceeds the specified limits. A BOUND instruction ensures that a signed array index is within a certain range.
</li><li>0x00000006, or Invalid Opcode, indicates that the processor tries to execute an invalid instruction. This error typically occurs when the instruction pointer has become corrupted and is pointing to the wrong location. The most common cause of this error
 is hardware memory corruption. </li><li>0x00000008, or Double Fault, indicates that an exception occurs during a call to the handler for a prior exception. Typically, the two exceptions are handled serially. However, there are several exceptions that cannot be handled serially, and in this situation
 the processor signals a double fault. There are two common causes of a double fault</li></ul>
<strong><br />
CAUSE </strong>
<p>Bug check 0x7F typically occurs after you install a faulty or mismatched hardware (especially memory) or if installed hardware fails.</p>
<p>A double fault can occur when the kernel stack overflows. This overflow occurs if multiple drivers are attached to the same stack. For example, if two file system filter drivers are attached to the same stack and then the file system recurses back in, the
 stack overflows.</p>
<p><strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p><em>Troubleshooting: </em>If you recently added hardware to the computer, remove it to see if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty component. Run hardware diagnostics that the system manufacturer supplies to determine
 which hardware component failed.</p>
<p>The memory scanner is especially important. Faulty or mismatched memory can cause this bug check. For more informaiton about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer. Check that all adapter cards in the computer are properly seated. Use
 an ink eraser or an electrical contact treatment, available at electronics supply stores, to ensure adapter card contacts are clean.</p>
<p>If the error appears on a newly installed system, check the availability of updates for the BIOS, the SCSI controller, or network cards. These kind of updates are typically available on the Web site or BBS of the hardware manufacturer.</p>
<p>Confirm that all hard disk drives, hard disk controllers, and SCSI adapters are listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.</p>
<p>If the error occurred after the installation of a new or updated device driver, you should remove or replace the driver. If, under this circumstance, the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS, you might
 be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you have to start the computer by using the Recovery Console in order to access the file.</p>
<p>Also restart your computer, and then press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices. At the<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, select the<strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option. This option is most effective
 when you add only one driver or service at a time.</p>
<p>Overclocking (setting the CPU to run at speeds above the rated specification) can cause this error. If you have overclocked the computer that is experiencing the error, return the CPU to the default clock speed setting.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing the error. You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS to try to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>If you encountered this error while upgrading to a new version of the Windows operating system, the error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version. If possible, remove
 all third-party device drivers and system services and disable any virus scanners before you upgrade. Contact the software manufacturer to obtain updates of these tools. Also make sure that you have installed the latest Windows Service Pack.</p>
<p>Finally, if all the above steps do not resolve the error, take the system motherboard to a repair facility for diagnostic testing. A crack, a scratched trace, or a defective component on the motherboard can also cause this error.<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.<br />

    <title>Playing voice chat sound through TV instead of headset - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Playing voice chat sound through TV instead of headset</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I'd like to know if it is possible to have chat voice/sound through my TV like I could on my Xbox 360. I'm a bit heard of hearing so I need to turn up my TV a lot to hear it. The problem is, my TV drowns out the headset sound even with the headset
 at max volume. I'd use the kinect, but I am unable to mute it. Voice commands aren't supported in my country yet sadly. Thanks guys!</p>

<p>I don't think it is possible unless you use a Kinect. But some games such as Destiny has this option in their setting to bypass audio from headset to TV speakers, however this only works for party chat &amp; not game chat.
