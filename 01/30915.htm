<h2>            Updating Graphics Driver for Surface Pro 3 so I can play games like Total War&#58; Warhammer</h2>
                    I have a surface pro 3 i7 256 GB device. I want to be able to play Total War: Warhammer at higher than the minimum settings. I see a lot of YouTube videos of people downloading drivers from Intel to try and improve their graphics but I wanted to check
 here to see if that is even worth messing with my computer.

            SP3 wasn't designed as a gaming machine. Installing the non customized Intel drivers might adversely impact other functionality. Intel customized the Surface drivers. You would not be able to increase the video resolution by using other drivers.

            Hi  garden54, yes that would be the best option, you would then have room for a couple of years of updates . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Backup your data before proceeding . . .
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

</span></span>are you saying that to do all this <strong><em>rather</em></strong> than formatting the 32gb micro card and downloading Windows 10 updates to the card??...or is that not an option?

            Hi garden54, I thought this was the case, that is the reasoning behind my solution above, which would be the best option, you would then have room for a couple of years of updates . . . 
<br /> 
<br />Any other solution will not work, since you physically do not have the space to apply the update, even if you download the update onto an SD card - it still has to be installed onto your 32GB Flash Drive . . .
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB

<h2>            Windows 10 programs stop responding after a few minutes...</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,<br />
<br />
Basic details: I've just installed Windows 10, upgraded from Windows 7 64-bit. It starts, works for around five minutes, and then all programs will stop responding. I can still move the mouse, click on icons, etc., but the best I can get is 'this program is
 not responding' style errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried downgrading then reinstalling Windows 10 a few times over the last months, to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In safe mode, the issue doesn't seem to arise - so does that suggest I have a driver/ start-up program issue? If so, what do I do to ferret it out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be grand - and I apologise if I've put this question in the wrong place, or left out a detail that is highly important.<br />
<br />
p.s. Active time of my installation disk was about 98-100% in Task Manager - any link?</p>
<p>p.p.s I can still open new tabs in an open Chrome browser, though I can't navigate within them. Odd.</p>

            I think it's fixed! To be honest, I just kept uninstalling odd programs I had until it didn't go wrong any more - but it was definitely an issue with a program I had! Thank you!

Examples of partitioning layout include MBR (BIOS) and GPT (UEFI). In this article, we show you several ways to create a bootable copy of Windows 10 from an ISO file.

            Hi Jack.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Reset Photos and Microsoft Store apps in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Photos &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Reset.
<br />
<br />If that's not enough the re-register them from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try re-registering those apps. Perform these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command for Photos app and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.Windows.Photos | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />And type this command for Store app and press Enter:
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Let the commands complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell.
<br />
<br />Let me know if this helps!

            It could be a compatibility issue with the new Skype and your web cam.
<br />
<br />I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report,then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            You should not have to pay or upgrade Skype to use your web cam. Please becareful ,since that might be a scam. Also, Skype to Skype calls over the Internet are free. If you have to call landlines or mobile phones, you to purchase credit.

<h2>            How to allow ftp.exe through Windows 8 firewall&#63;</h2>
                    I had it running on Windows 7 and it worked just fine. But I can't seem to get it to work on Windows 8.<br />
<br />
I allowed an inbound and outbound rule for ftp.exe on _all_ ports.<br />
<br />
The connection itself is established but once I try to send an ASCII file, it goes:<br />
<br />
<br />
ftp&gt; lcd d:\temp<br />
Local directory now D:\temp.<br />
ftp&gt; send test.txt<br />
200 PORT command successful<br />
425 Unable to build data connection: Connection timed out<br />
ftp&gt; send test.txt<br />
200 PORT command successful<br />
425 Unable to build data connection: Connection timed out<br />
<br />
Once I disable the Firewall for public networks, it works immediately. :-(<br />

 on my list of installed programs in Control Panel. It seems to work fine and says the game has been successfully uninstalled but it still appears in my list of installed programs. I have already tried using the 'CCleaner' program to get rid of it...

 helps you to uninstall software and remove unwanted programs installed on your computer even if you have problems uninstalling and cannot uninstall them from "Windows Add or Remove Programs" control panel applet.<br />
<br />
Revo Uninstaller is a much faster and more powerful alternative to "Windows Add or Remove Programs" applet!<br />
<br />
With its advanced and fast algorithm, Revo Uninstaller analyzes an application's data before uninstall and scans after you uninstall an application. After the program's regular uninstaller runs, you can remove additional unnecessary files, folders and registry
 keys that are usually left”<br />
<br />

<h2>            Emails not sync in win10 Mail app in subfolders through Rules</h2>
                    <p>Emails in subfolders that are setup for receiving emails through email Rules can not sync in my win10&nbsp;Mail app&nbsp;as well as lumia 650 wp10 mail. I've tried deleting the exchange account and setup again, but it doesn't work. For other emails in Inbox and Sent
 Box sync well. Can anyone help?</p>

<p>
</p><p>In Mail app, the trouble shooting is also valid for win 10 mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Key: you must right click the folders you want to sync and choose Add to fav. before syncing, make them visible in the Folders list, then sync again. all emails will be successfully synced.
