<h2>            Using XP professional with SP3. Reoccuring problem wmic.exe</h2>
                    Keep getting application error. Memory could not be written. I select cancel which is the debug option but during course of day it pops up again. Does not appear tied to any specific action.

            I do not have this error message in my notes (that means I have never seen it before), but it also appears you might not have sent us the complete and exact error message you are seeing.<br />
<br />
So I don't know if this will help you or not.<br />
<br />
However, if I wanted to rebuild the Windows Repository, I would never do it the way suggested - I would do it this way (which successfully resolves other WMI issues I
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
services.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Services applet.<br />
<br />
Locate the Windows Management Instrumentation Service.&nbsp; If the Status column says the WMI Service is Started (running), right click the WMI Service and choose to Stop The WMI Service.
<br />
<br />
Respond in the affirmative if asked to stop the Security Center and Windows Firewall Services (with those services stopped your system is vulnerable to attack from the Internet so do not get on the Internet again until you restart your system).<br />
<br />
Now would be a good time to also check the Properties of the WMI Service to be sure the Startup type is set to Automatic so the WMI Service will start automatically the next time the system is rebooted.<br />
<br />
Using Explorer, navigate to the following folder (assuming your boot drive is C):<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\System32\Wbem\<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Locate and then rename the "Repository" folder to something you can remember, such as:<br />
<br />
Repository.old<br />
<br />
Restart the computer and then check to be sure that the WMI service has restarted automatically and that a new Repository folder has been created to replace the one that was renamed.&nbsp; It may take some time to completely rebuild the Repository folder (several
 seconds or minutes) so wait for it to complete.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
After rebooting, you will notice the wmiprvse.exe Service running in Task Manager and it will keep running until it finishes rebuilding the Repository (this could take a little while).
<br />
<br />
This rebuilding process could take several minutes depending on your system but eventually the wmiprvse.exe Service will complete and disappear from Task Manager.<br />
<br />
If you then look in the Event Viewer Application log, there may be some error messages like this:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WinMgmt<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4<br />
Description:<br />
Failed to load MOF C:\WINDOWS\MICROSOFT.NET\FRAMEWORK\V4.0.30319\MOF\SERVICEMODEL.MOF while recovering repository file.<br />
<br />
This is normal because when the system restarts, the wmiprvse.exe process must rebuild those parts of the repository as well. It is a sequencing error as indicated below. You should not see these errors again after the system has been rebooted and catches up
 with itself and finishes rebuilding the WMI Repository.<br />
<br />
Explanations for the errors seen in the Event Viewer Application log while the WMI repository is rebuilt:<br />
<br />
Explanation<br />
Windows Management Instrumentation might have tried to compile (mofcomp) a .mof file marked for autorecover, but the compilation failed. This failure is probably caused by a sequencing issue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
User Action<br />
To correct the problem, try to compile the .mof file again. If this does not correct the problem, contact the support provider for the program in question.<br />
<br />
You should not have to do anything about these error messages and should not see them again after XP has finished rebuilding the WMI Repository.<br />
<br />
I cannot say how long this rebuilding will take, maybe 10-15 minutes until it settles down completely.<br />

<p>Some computer makers, including Dell and HP,&nbsp;put a recovery partition on the hard disk of new computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;By pressing a special key combination when the computer starts, you can use the recovery partition to restore the computer to the way it was when it
 was new.</p>
<p>If your computer doesn't have that, contact the computer maker and ask for an installation disk.</p>
<p>After you re-install Windows 7, make a system image backup, which you can use to restore the system quickly and easily if needed.</p>

    <title>SHA-1 values of Win 10 version 1511 Single Language English - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardsavio  say:</h3>
<h2>            SHA-1 values of Win 10 version 1511 Single Language English International ISO</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I downloaded a copy of Windows 10 version 1511 <strong>Single Language English International</strong> ISO. I downloaded it directly from the Microsoft site on a Linux machine. I tried googling for the checksum values but could not find any. Also the msdn
 downloads do not have the Single Language version. So I am out of luck there as well. So I would like to ask the community if some who has the same version could please post a SHA-1 checksum?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not know how to calculate it, download a nifty utility from Nirsoft called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/hash_my_files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HashMyFiles</a>. The download links are at the very bottom of the page. Or use
 a direct&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/hashmyfiles.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">official download link</a>. Just extract the zip and run the exe file. The UI is straightforward enough I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My checksum values are:</p>
<p>MD5: &nbsp; &nbsp;548e82f78f1ec7c7c9456aa16aa16254</p>
<p>SHA-1:&nbsp;c2bfaeb3c5e980b6047e8628b88f59bf6f6e67c9</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note it is the <strong>Single Language</strong> version, not the standard Win 10 version. Also it is
<strong>English International</strong> and not the English version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I bought a Gateway NV53A&nbsp;AMD Phenom II x3 N830 computer about 1.5 years ago. It has been working great until a couple of days ago. I was browsing through&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;and then all of a sudden i got this virus called "Security Scan" and it started scanning
 my computer and I&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;stop it. I deleted this virus with the help of a&nbsp;YouTube&nbsp;video but ever since I have gotten that virus my computer is unable to connect to the internet. I have other computers connected to this internet. All of them are working fine.
 In the lower right hand corner, I have the internet bars and it says that I'm connected to "2wire400" but the "2wire400"&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;connected to the internet. Also, on the symbol of the internet i have a triangle that is yellow with an "!". I have tried turning
 off the modem about 14 times. I have done cmd ipfigure or w.e nothing is working.</div>

<h2>            Merging Two accounts</h2>
                    
<p>Is it possible to merge my two xbox accounts? I have some dlc that I got with this old gamertag that is account specific for some reason, such as the Lost and Damned xpac for GTA 4 and the preorder bonuses for Red Dead Redemption. It's just really stupid
 to have to use the old account whenever I want to use these things. I've read on some forums, people say you can pay to have your gamertag changed to your current one, but I have found no way to do that so far. can anybody help me out? thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Dear Mr. Kumar.</p>
<p>I did not get you.</p>
<p>I am trying to read your response "while using Windows live mail. If you are using Internet Explorer"</p>
<p>and can not understand it.</p>
<p>I use Windows Live Mail. You know that I am using Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>So, why do you ask, am I using Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>As you could have read, it is NOT a WEBsite. It is a POP3 server. Therefore the popup is different and does not provide other options than "yes/no".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you mean the POP3 server DNS record can be marked as "safe" in the "Internet Options"?</p>
<p>I did not try that, but please let me note, that this option disables any certificate check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing I am trying to achieve is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>accepting
</strong></span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>our corporate certificate as trusted</strong></span>, and
<strong>no other certificate</strong> or <strong>unsigned </strong>connection.</p>

    <title>Unable to download Media Package &#38; Play video games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to download Media Package &#38; Play video games &#40;Fifa16&#47;17&#41; or Edit videos -- HELP&#33; &#40;pics and links inside&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am attempting to download media package:</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=48231</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49919</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I download the 64bit version it comes up with an error 'Windows update standalone installer - The update is not applicable to your computer'. In the past I was able to download these media packs but as of a few months ago I have not been able
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4abf3681-7be5-4d67-9393-9709f3038c82" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4abf3681-7be5-4d67-9393-9709f3038c82" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the reason why I want to download these media packs is because I wanted to download Windows Movie maker, Hitfilm Express and play Fifa and the reason I am now resulting to write this support question is because I wanted to do some video editing with
 Hitfilm Express and an error occurred when I opened it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>'The code execution cannot proceed because WMVCore.DLL was not found. Reinstalling the program may fix this problem'.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/529f92b7-1615-460f-919e-791d144d3b7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/529f92b7-1615-460f-919e-791d144d3b7d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried re-installing and repairing the programme, I then went to Google to see if there was a resolve for it and one suggestion was to
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">download the media packs</span> (above), hence now I am here asking for help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me with this please?&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
When you say DVD do you mean that it's a game your trying to play or a movie?<br />
<br />
Do you actually have a storage device in your console? If so, can you check if your storage device is being detected by the console? Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage. If it's being detected it will show up there, if it's showing up as being "formatted"
 you will need to format it and try to play the game or dvd again.<br />
<br />
See if that works out for you.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Meik, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            What is meant by Adobe - Is it Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Acrobat? Adobe Acrobat can not open JPEG files. Answer depends upon which is the Adobe product.

<p>The volume toggle switch suddenly stopped working and instead opens to the task manager.&nbsp; This happens whether the screen is attached or not.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I tried using the Windows button after reading similar problems but it didn't fix the issue; I also powered down and back up without luck.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Check to see if the &nbsp;light in the upper right corner of the (Fn) Function Key is lit. &nbsp;This is a new feature of the Surface Book keyboard and acts as a toggle for the upper row of keys. &nbsp;If the light is lit, the upper row keys are standard F1 thru F12 function
 keys. &nbsp;If the light is not lit the upper row is now what the pictures on the keys show. &nbsp;This is really very handy once you see what they have done!</p>

            <p>Well for what ever the reason the issue is gone.&nbsp; The toggle switch is now back to doing what it was intended&nbsp; to do which is controlling&nbsp; the volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While not a huge issue to begin with I did want it fixed and it looks like it did by itself.</p>

<h2>            Cortina&#47;&#34;Type here to search&#34; task bar problems</h2>
                    <p><span>I have Windows 10 PRO upgraded from Win 7 Pro. on a Desktop</span></p>
<p><span>Up to which I think was just yesterday I could do a search with Cortina or type into the task bar and my search would come up.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Well it does but it does not</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>I am going camping and have a word.doc called â€œCampingâ€ which is a list of items to take camping.</span></p>
<p><span>I spoke â€œcampingâ€ into Cortina. If youâ€™re the doc but have a look at the bellow pictures. Picture 1) does not have an icon next to the document. Well it would not open so I typed â€œcampingâ€ same thing.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f8524f36-23bd-472e-b347-96274befce8b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f8524f36-23bd-472e-b347-96274befce8b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Next, I went to my laptop it worked see picture 2. It has a wor.doc Icon which I clicked on and it opened</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d18684ef-0661-4985-9340-4b755113b669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d18684ef-0661-4985-9340-4b755113b669" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Picture 3) I then tried the same thing on my desktop again but did a search verbally and by typing an Excel and PowerPoint files. They worked! It appears only MS Word 2016 in Cortina/"Type here to
 search" task bar will not come up.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d9d51c37-ac6f-48eb-beca-b65b2879d0dc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d9d51c37-ac6f-48eb-beca-b65b2879d0dc" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Picture 4) Started typing in Microsoft and then the â€œcamping document and other items appeard!!!! What is going on?</span></p>
<p><span>I have restarted the Cortina Search Service and no success.</span></p>
<p><span>Does anyone have a solution?</span></p>

</p><p>Hi Kirk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that software conflicts is affecting Cortana. We suggest that you perform a
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot</a> to help us determine the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue remains, we suggest that you update Office using the link below:</p>

<p>My system way current already but I did Office updates just to be sure.&nbsp; I am at the latest version so I'm good to go as far as update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">My problem is not fixed.</span></p>

</p><p>The only difference is I now have a Icon that have nothing on it next to my search word and it still will not open when I double click. See Pic below.</p>

<p>My system is a stand alone PC with a C, D and F drive. I am the administrator. All Microsoft product I have are up to the latest version. The F: Drive has many old Microsoft File saved. Now the file "Camping" I was looking for was in a .doc format. I did
 save as to .docx format. I still can not open "camping.docx"&nbsp; from the Cortana search.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now what's even weirder is I was looking for another named file Lliving Will", it also was a .doc It would not work as a search so I found it in my folders opened it then saved it as a .docx file. Did a Cortina/Type search and the document appears as it
 should with the Microsoft word icon next to the Living Will.docx . I click on it and it opens. Under it is the same old .doc format and I can't open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more suggestions?</p>

    <title>Xbox Mic issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shakezi1la  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Mic issues</h2>
                    
<p>i have read through many of these forums discussing the issue of xbox mics being able to only listen and not being able to talk. I have tried every solution posted and refuse to buy a new controller or mic because mine are currently brand new. So I was wondering
 if anyone has any idea if this is a problem that's being worked on and if so a time table? I recently purchased Gears remastered and Madden 16 and would love to play them with my friends soon. Thanks!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 PC wakes spontaneuously shortly after going into sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathaniel mishkin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 PC wakes spontaneuously shortly after going into sleep state--behavior started after the November 2015 update</h2>
                    <p>Before I installed the November 2015 Windows 10 update the sleep/wake behavior I saw on my PC was as expected/desired: I pressed the power button and the PC went into sleep state and when later I tapped the keyboard or mouse the PC came out of sleep state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I installed the update, the power button still puts the PC into sleep state but later (often as soon as just a minute later) the PC spontaneously (i.e., not as a result of any action on my part) comes out of sleep state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"powercfg -lastwake" is unhelpful:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;<strong><em>powercfg -lastwake</em></strong><br />
Wake History Count - 1<br />
Wake History [0]<br />
&nbsp; Wake Source Count - 0</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the PC puts itself to sleep due to sufficient idle time, it also self-wakes shortly after. E.g., when I left for work, I pressed the power button, the PC went to sleep. When I came home in the evening, the PC was awake and the Event Log showed a stream
 of sleep/wake pairs all during the day.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Your comment about the magic packet induced me to do something I should have known to do from the outset: check the wake-up settings of the network adapter. I actually&nbsp;<em>do</em> want to be able to wake up the PC remotely using an app that send a magic
 packet. However, I don't want <em>any</em> packet to wake the PC--just a magic packet.<br />
</p>
<p>When I went to look at the adapter properties I saw that "Allow this device to wake the computer" checkbox was checked (as I expect/want) but the "Only allow a magic packet to wake the computer" sub-checkbox was cleared (which is&nbsp;<em>not</em> what I want).
 I'm pretty sure I went through these settings months back when I got the whole sleep/remote-wake thing working in the first place. I'm tempted to believe that the upgrade cleared the "Only allow a magic packet ..." checkbox. (After all, the upgrade changed
 my default browser setting back to Edge when it had been Chrome.)<br />
</p>
<p>Anyway, I set that second checkbox and hopefully things will behave better now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your post. I am having the same issue with my pc waking up randomly after the same update. So I checked my lan adapter setting and noticed that my magic packet was cleared as well.&nbsp;This value was checked since&nbsp;before upgrading&nbsp;to windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
 hadn't noticed the default browser switch back to Edge until reading your post. I wonder if there are any other changes that weren't reported, such as, default email client etc.</p>
<p>Is there a way to see a report of what changed after each update. And what justification is there to change my default browser.</p>

<p>Not that I know of, but FWIW, I did upvote an existing item about upgrade resetting the magic packet setting that I found in the&nbsp;<em>Windows Feedback</em> app. (Search for "magic packet" and you'll find several items on the topic.)</p>

<h2>            scanner setup</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to install the Driver for an Epson V550 scanner using Epson18546.exe downloaded from the Epson site.&nbsp; The setup runs 3/4th of the way and dies with the message" An error has occurred during setup.&nbsp; Restart your computer an run setup again"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say I have repeated this process countless times, including using safe mode start and closing anti-virus and firewall programs.&nbsp; All with the same results.&nbsp; After several hours on the phone, Epson support concluded that it is not a problem of
 their setup program. ( I was able to install it on another Win10 PC).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell's answer was that if it is not a hardware problem, which I don't think it is, then they will charge for diagnostic services.&nbsp; By the way scanning works fine with my Brother 3in1 printer/scanner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since found the setup log file which ends as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>&nbsp; Failed to import driver package into Driver Store. Error = 0x8E5E0158</em><br />
<em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sto:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {Stage Driver Package: exit(0x8e5e0158)} 15:28:35.213</em><br />
<em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sto: {Setup Import Driver Package - exit (0x8e5e0158)} 15:28:35.229</em><br />
<em>!!!&nbsp; inf: Failed to import driver package into driver store</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any one can expalin and suggest a solution?</p>

            Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the Dell computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. What, if any, third-party anti-virus application is installed and when does your current subscription, if any, expire?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />â€¢  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.

<p>Thanks for the suggestions.&nbsp; I have seen these exchanges before and tried several of the solutions, without success.&nbsp; Actually my situation is different, it is not an upgrade from win 8 ot 7 but a factory installed windows, so is the anti-virus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one information that I have omitted which might be significant.&nbsp; The instruction for installing the Epson V550 requires installing the driver first before connecting the scanner via USB.&nbsp; I also tried the reverse, plugging in the scanner first.&nbsp;
 The result was that the Device Manager would show the Brother 3 in 1 as an Imaging Device, but the Epson as Other Device.&nbsp; Of course installing the driver resulted in the same failure.</p>
<p>

<h2>            How to open a command line prompt in any folder in Windows XP&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you are well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this was Windows 7, I would just hold down the shift key and right click the mouse, and then I'll get the "Open command window here", but that doesn't work for Windows 7. &nbsp;I don't want to use the cmd from the start button because we have a really long
 directory names. &nbsp;MS used to have an add on but that seems to have gone missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to do this is so I can create a file showing the contents of the folder via "dir &gt; print.txt"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't suppose there is anyway to have it do it automatically?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Did this start failing after a Windows Update? Do you know which update? 
<br />
<br />You have to attach it to a Monitor/TV and get info from the remote screen. 
<br />
<br />Can you open a cmd prompt and run
<br />
<br />netsh wlan sho d 
<br />
<br />and copy the whole output and paste the text into a reply here?

<p>The display adapter is connected to the TV and the only info I can even get is just what it says on screen which is MSDisplayAdapter_1F</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i go to either project or connect in the action center and try to connect they look like they are communicating and it sees that I push connect but they never actually connect. As far as whether there was an update...I have no earthly idea. I just know
 it was working and then it stopped and never worked again</p>

<p>
</p><p>You said this was working before?&nbsp; Make sure that you remove the previous instances of it, both video and audio before retrying.&nbsp; There is a link at the bottom of the Connect dialog to help you open the Bluetooth and Other devices settings page which is
 where they would be.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a Network troubleshooter which was recently added that might do something to help.&nbsp; The adapter you would specifically want to be looked at would be called Local Area Connection* ...&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know if it would spare us from having to remove
 the old connections from the other settings page or not.&nbsp; That would be a good thing if it did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use PowerShell to get another perspective on these adapters.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Get-NetAdapter&nbsp; -IncludeHidden</strong></p>
<p>The specific Local Area Connection* that you would want to look at would be one described as "Wi-Fi Direct" but I suggest looking at them all in case there is a discrepancy in MAC Address that it&nbsp;might be worth looking at.</p>

<h2>            How can I repair disk drive partitions&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an external hard drive for backups formatted with Windows XP that I now use with my laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium. Recently my son connected it to his Apple PC and tried to create a partition to back up his files. Apparently this corrupted
 the partition table. I can no longer access any data on the hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked at the drive using:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Windows 7 Disk Management</p>
<p>2. Acronis Disk Director 11</p>
<p>3. EASEUS Partition Recovery (latest version)</p>
<p>4. Partition Wizard 5.2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of them could do anything except delete or format the partitions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partitions on my external drive are still there but Acronis Disk Director shows the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disk 1 (GPT)</p>
<p>VOLUME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAPACITY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FREE SPACE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TYPE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FILE SYSTEM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STATUS</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyway to repair the partition table and possibly access the data?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I cannot run CHKDSK because the drive is not visible in Windows or DOS except in Device Manager and Disk Management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to give up and just wipe the drive clean and re-format.&nbsp; Thanks for your efforts to help.</p>
