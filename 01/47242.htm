<h2>            Still Being Charged After Cancellation</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I cancelled Xbox Live Gold (via my Xbox) on my account back around October and did not receive the service after that which is what I intended. I even tried to use it about a month after I cancelled to be sure it had gone through. Sure enough, I was not
 able to use any Gold features.</p>
<p>However, my father continued to be charged on his credit card even though we were not receiving that service. When I looked on my account today after my father received yet another charge on his bill from Xbox Live, transactions were still being made in
 spite of this. I've cancelled the auto renewal which will hopefully stop the transactions once and for all. Needless to say, this was definitely a confusing and rather annoying period of time for us. Is there anything we can do to be sure it doesn't happen
 again if we ever decide to renew the service?</p>

<h2>            Can I use my old achievements as part of the Xbox Live rewards&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;I&nbsp;have been playing the&nbsp;Xbox for a few years, I started an new account and I have Xbox live. I have just started aiming for achievements, because I like achieving things. I was just looking at some new updates for Xbox Live and then I saw that there is a new system called Xbox live rewards, I like the sounds of it so I decided to be part of it, after reading the rules and things you can do to get reward (getting achievements, purchasing things) I&nbsp;unfortunately remembered I have exactly 30275 Gamerscore points and those we earned before I joined the Xbox Live Rewards, I`d like to know if they can count and or if I&nbsp;can transfer them towards Xbox live Rewards?<br /><br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />

    <title>Un-bootable Windows Vista Home Premium 32bit. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mackellam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Un-bootable Windows Vista Home Premium 32bit.</h2>
                    Hello, everyone. I've been struggling since the 26th of December with an un-bootable PC. I've seemingly exhausted all methods of repair, but I'd like to go over the problem, and what I've done, just to make sure. Hopefully someone here can provide a solution!
 I am desperate.&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Upon turning on the PC, it gets to the Windows Vista loading screen, then Blue Screens, auto-rebooting. When I disable auto-reboot, the stop code it gives is:
<b>0x0000007B (0x80399BB0, 0xC0000034, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)</b> Apparently this code supposed to signify a hardware failure. The only thing that I did before I powered off my PC was update my onboard graphics drivers.
<b>NVIDIA GeForce 6150SE nForce 430</b> (it's ****). Now, this issue has happened before a couple years ago, and I believe it was from updating them then. Something was just incompatible, and seems they still are. The only difference then is that I had restore
 points to use. This time, <b>I have no restore points to try</b>, surprisingly, because I had at least one before the issue. Using the Recovery Console, I gave all the options a try
<i>aside</i> from System Recovery or any other destructive, formatting method. <b>
Startup Repair</b> doesn't solve the problem and has presented me with this report, as well as finding no errors other than "A change in system configuration may have caused the problem" or something of that nature. Note that I have run Startup Repair from
 the system, <i>and</i> from a <b>Vista disc</b>.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;Problem Event Name: StartupRepairV2&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Problem Signature 01: ExternalMedia (and WAS SystemDisk)&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Problem Signature 02: 6.0.6000.16386.6.0.6001.18000&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Problem Signature 03: 6&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Problem Signature 04: 196610 (and also gave 327684, 393221, and 458758)&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Problem Signature 05: NoRootCause&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Problem Signature 06: NoRootCause&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Problem Signature 07: 0&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Problem Signature 08: 2&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Problem Signature 09: WrpRepair&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Problem Signature 10: 0&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;OS Ver: 6.0.6000.2.0.0.256.1 Locale ID: 1033&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;Booting with F8 into the Safe Mode menu, no Safe Mode works, always hanging at
<b>Classpnp.sys</b> (I also tried fixing <b>AGP440.sys</b> with no luck.) <b>Last Known Good Config does not work</b>. Debugging mode does not work. Nothing in that menu works. I also ran
<b>Chkdsk.exe</b> from a Vista install disc's recovery menu, along with <b>/r and /f</b>, to no avail. With no errors found. I also tried
<b>BootRec.exe /fixmbr and /fixboot</b> with no success. Suspecting it might be the registry, I tried
<b>c:\windows\system32\config\regback</b>, replacing the files in RegBack, into config, with no luck. In addition to that, I've tried
<b>resetting the BIOS</b> and such, with no luck either.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I've been using Hiren's BootCD and its MiniXP bootable OS to work with the files on disk. The Hard Drive seems fine as it has passed every Chkdsk, Startup Repair, and Hardware Diagnostic test that I've ran (and every can be seen with browsed through the
 bootable OS). I also tried updating the drivers for my graphics card again, but you can't exactly do that while in MiniXP (or uninstall them, that I know of). I also tried overwriting nvidia files with previous versions stored, but that made no difference.
 I also swapped out AGP440.sys as well as Classpnp.sys as mentioned, yet it still hangs at Classpnp.sys in Safe Mode. Furthermore,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I purchased a graphics card to try to bypass the onboard graphics and the drivers that might be hindering the booting process, but when attached, boot is delayed by a few seconds when trying to load the graphics card, and it switches back to onboard graphics,
 with no way of installing the drivers for the new card, and disabling the onboard graphics on C: and in my main Vista installation (that I know of), that trick is most likely out.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I will update this thread with my attempt details and other information as necessary to try to solve this issue. Note that I am unable to perform a repair install/in-place upgrade of Vista with the disc because it requires one to be inside the OS. There
 has got to be a way to boot into the OS somehow. I appreciate any attention and assistance I get. Thanks much!</div>

Bug Check 0x7B: INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE
<p>The INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE bug check has a value of 0x0000007B. This bug check indicates that the Microsoft Windows operating system has lost access to the system partition during startup.</p>
Parameters
<p>The following parameters appear in the message.</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>1</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The address of a UNICODE_STRING structure, or the address of the device object that could not be mounted</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>2</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>0</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>3</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>0</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>4</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>0</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To determine the meaning of Parameter 1, look at the data that it points to. If the first word (USHORT) at this address is even, Parameter 1 is the beginning of a Unicode string. If the first word (USHORT) at this address is 0x3, Parameter 1 is the first
 field (Type) of a device object.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If this parameter points to a device object, the file system that was supposed to read the boot device failed to initialize or simply did not recognize the data on the boot device as a file system structure. In this situation, the specified device object
 is the object that could not be mounted.</p>
</li><li>If this parameter points to a Unicode string, you must read the first 8 bytes at this address. These bytes form the UNICODE_STRING structure, which is defined as follows:
<div>
<pre><code>USHORT Length;
USHORT MaximumLength;
PWSTR Buffer;</code></pre>
<p>The <b>Length</b> field gives the actual length of the string. The <b>Buffer</b> field points to the beginning of the string (<b>Buffer</b> is always be at least 0x80000000.)</p>
<p>The actual string contains the Advanced RISC Computing (ARC) specification name of the device that the boot was being attempted from. ARC names are a generic way to identify devices in the ARC environment.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>//<br />
// MessageId: STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND<br />
//<br />

// Object Name not found.<br />

#define STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ((NTSTATUS)0xC0000034L)<br />
</p>
<p>is the blue screen error code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So nothing to do with your video card at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try to analyse a dump file but I think your disk or motherboard is faulty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do as much as possible from the repair console. You sound cluey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><font>
<div><font>
<div>
<p>Blue screens are caused by faulty hardware or faulty hardware drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To See if&nbsp;a Fix is Available</strong></p>
<p>In <i>Control Panel</i> (and select <i>Classic view</i> in the left hand pane) choose
<i>Problem Reports and Solutions</i> (type problem in Start's search box), go to <i>
Problem History</i>, right click your error and choose <i>Check For Solution</i>. You may also right click and choose
<i>Details</i> for more info. <strong>Post those details here.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To See if a Recent System Change Caused It</strong></p>
<p>In <i>Control Panel</i> (and select <i>Classic view</i> in the left hand pane) choose
<i>Administrative Tools</i> then choose <i>Reliability and Performance Monitor</i> and choose
<i>Monitoring Tools</i> then <i>Reliability Monitor</i> (type Reliability in search on Start) . This list is a chart of software installs, uninstalls, Windows updates, and crashes by date (scroll left to see earlier dates). See if your crashes started happening

<div><strong>Standard Hardware Troubleshooting</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</font>
<div>
<div>First lets test what hardware we can. Hardware faults can appear as many software faults, therefore we need to test hardware first..</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Please do the following in order. Memory faults can cause disk corruption, disk faults can cause disk corruption. Disk corruption causes corrupted files (which SFC may be able to fix). If you get an hardware error stop and post back.
<strong>Do not run chkdsk with faulty memory</strong>.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Memory Diagnostic</strong></div>
<div>If you haven't run a memory diagnostic then please do so. Click <em>Start</em> -
<em>Control Panel</em> - choose <em>Classic View</em> in left hand pane - choose <em>
Administrative Tools</em> -&nbsp; then<em>&nbsp;Memory Diagnostics Tool</em>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</font></div>
<div><strong>S.M.A.R.T</strong></div>
<div><em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;(or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disk drives in Windows monitor themselves for impending failure.&nbsp;The feature is&nbsp;called S.M.A.R.T. It will detect impending&nbsp;failure&nbsp;30% of the time.&nbsp;In an elevated command prompt type (it's one line)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div><em>wmic /namespace:\\root\wmi PATH MSStorageDriver_FailurePredictStatus get active,predictfailure,reason /format:List</em></div>
</blockquote>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it's on Active will be true, if not on turn it on in the computer's BIOS.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Predict Failure should be False if everything's ok.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In Vista and later if SMART predicts failure Windows prompts the user to run Backup.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>

<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Dump files are files containing the state of the machine when it crashed. We can analyse the file to identify the driver (or program) causing the crash. See the last section on how to get them analysed by a volunteer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Analyse Dump Files</strong></div>
<div>If you want to analyse your own dump files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You need to start Explorer as Administrator to access the files in <strong>C:\windows\Minidump</strong>. Right click Explorer and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>.</div>
<div><br />
Download and install Debugging Tools for Windows<br />
<div><font color="#0072c6">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852363</font><br />
<div>Install theWindows SDK but just choose the debugging tools.<br />
<br />
Create a folder called <strong>Symbols</strong> in C:\<br />
<br />
Start <em>Windbg</em>. <em>File</em> menu - <em>Symbol File Path</em> and enter</div>
<blockquote>
<div><br />
<em>srv*C:\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols</em></div>
</blockquote>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Close and reopen WinDbg. <em>File</em> menu - <em>Open Crash Dump</em><br />
<br />
This will analyse the crash dump. You need to close and reopen WinDbg for each dump file analysed. Because you are downloading symbols from the internet WinDbg will appear to be doing nothing. But it's downloading. Be patient.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You are looking for a driver or system library that the crash occurred in at the end of the listing. Find the file, right click then
<em>Properties</em> - <em>Details</em> tab. If it shows a driver you'll need to update the driver identified. Most drivers are in c:\windows\system32\drivers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Search the Drive for a File.</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Click <em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;replacing <em><strong>drivername.sys </strong>
</em>with the name of the file being searched (or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>dir c:\<strong>drivername.sys</strong> /a /s</em></p>
</blockquote>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it shows a system file see if you can get a program from analyze -v.<br />
<br />
Type in theWinDbg command prompt</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div><em>!analyze -v</em></div>
</blockquote>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-v stands for Verbose and if&nbsp;the crash was originated by a program, as opposed to hardware or a driver,&nbsp;it will appear in the middle of the listing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>eg</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>PROCESS_NAME:&nbsp; java.exe</font></div>
<div><font>IMAGE_NAME:&nbsp; ntkrnlmp.exe</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>PROCESS_NAME only appears in the analyze -v output and only if a program originated the call that faulted.<br />
<div>
<hr />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Upload Them for Analysis</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Or upload the minidump files to your Public folder on Skydrive and copy the link from the address bar and I'll analyse them.</div>

            Hey, thanks for the reply! First off, I have to stress that I cannot boot into Windows Vista at all, and while the MiniXP bootable OS allows me to manipulate files on the HD, I cant completely troubleshoot from within it. So I'm afraid I can't do most
 of what you shared. As for my hard disk, it has passed every diagnostic I've ran plus it's file system is completely intact, so I'm pretty sure it's fine, just the booting portion. What could prevent it from being booted properly, what file would be corrupted
 and/or could be replaced? Would it be a boot.ini file? In Vista, it's my understanding that "BCD" has replaced that? Maybe editing them could point to a solution?
<div><br />
<div>Also, a similar problem happened before years ago, like I stated. Only difference was, I had restore points to help me get in then, if I was lucky. Turned out that it was a registry problem from what I can remember, and I also needed to rollback my graphics
 drivers. (really wish I would have documented my findings) - The only thing hardware related that I changed recently was updating the graphics driver, that has to have some connection. Since the drivers need to be loaded upon boot anyway, and since it's technically
 hardware, I still think it could be part of the issue. But I am not limiting myself to just focusing on that. If it could be something else, chances are it is. I will try almost anything at this point.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Going to try what I can from your post, but more help from anyone is still appreciated! Shoot anything my way, I'll try it if I can!</div>

<p>Do&nbsp;a Startup Repair&nbsp;and / or a&nbsp;System Restore using a Microsoft Vista DVD</p>
<p>Manufacturers Recovery Disks do not normally have Repair Options; thay are normally&nbsp;a reinstall to Factory Settings option&nbsp;only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the guide to using the Repair Options while using a Microsoft Vista DVD.</p>
<p>If a friend or work acquantance of yours&nbsp;has one, you may borrow and use it for Repairs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/repair-windows-with-windows-startup-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/repair-windows-with-windows-startup-repair/</font></a></p>

<li>Overview of the Windows Vista Repair options </li><li>How to perform an automatic repair of Windows Vista using Startup Repair </li><li>Advanced Tools overview </li><li>Conclusion</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have or can not borrow a Microsoft DVD there is&nbsp;a download of a Vista&nbsp;Startup Repair ISO file available&nbsp;which you can make into a Bootable disk to do the above&nbsp;Startup Repair and&nbsp;that&nbsp;method&nbsp;is recommended by a lot of posters in these Forums.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you have to buy it.</p>
<p>Here is a link to it:</p>

            As you can see, I have ran Startup Repair many times, and as for System Restore, I stated that there are no restore points available, which is odd, because there should always be at least one at any given time.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>In the repair process, I am pretty much beyond running basic repair tactics. I've exhausted all methods from the recovery console and safe mode menu (F8), except for destructive formatting or otherwise factory default methods.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Keep the suggestions coming! Keep in mind my initial post for what I have and haven't tried yet.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'd also really like to know how to run sfc /scannow without running into the "Windows Resource Protection could not start the repair service." which prohibits the process.</div>

            Oh, I see. I've updated my original post to reflect that I've been using a Vista disc in conjunction with the system's menu.
<div><br />
<div>As for that link, I found that one too recently. Thing is, I can't access Vista to edit it properly. So right now I am trying to find a way to edit the registry outside the OS, or in the Command Prompt from the Vista disc. If I can get sfc /scannow to
 work, it may lead to a solution. Here's hoping!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any more suggestions in the meantime are, of course, welcome.</div>

            I am currently researching how to disable TrustedInstaller from the registry. I'm using Registry Editor PE from Hiren's BootCD. I found a site that told me how, but I have since lost it. Once I disable it and give sfc /scannow a go, hopefully having it
 work, I will report back.
<div><br />
<div>I also am going to attempt fixing the Hard Drive Controller, since it was stated it could be an issue with the hard drive. If anyone could give any tips on why I should or shouldn't do that, that'd be cool. Also if it deletes any files on the disk. I doubt
 it does, but just being cautious.</div>

            <u>UPDATE</u>
<div><br />
<div>Okay, got back to working on the PC today. I was able to find the method of disabling or enabling the TrustedInstaller module via a registry editor. I have not tried that&nbsp;<i>yet</i>, because I found ways to seemingly bypass WRP in the command prompt. Those
 ways are to type "<b>net stop (or start) TrustedInstaller</b>". Simple, no? Well, tried that and it reported back "<b>System error 1067 has occured</b>". After that, I tried another string which seems to have worked. That is "<b>sfc /scannow /OFFBOOTDIR=C:\
 /OFFWINDIR=C:\Windows</b>"</div>
<div><br />
<div>I ran the scan from the Vista disc, from&nbsp;<b>C:\</b>&nbsp;and from&nbsp;<b>X:\sources\</b>, the scan completed, stating it found errors and corrected them, both times. I did another Startup Repair afterwords, it reported no problems. In spite of all that, it&nbsp;<i>still&nbsp;</i>gives
 me a BSOD<i>.&nbsp;</i>It's just flat out ridiculous<i>.&nbsp;</i>But I refuse to quit on this. I'll be trying the other method of getting TrustedInstaller to allow just the plain sfc /scannow, and I will also fix the HDC.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If anyone has any other ideas, please don't hesitate to share them! Thanks!</div>

<h2>            Vista and Dell optiplex GX60</h2>
                    I have loaded Vista Business on a Dell Optiplex GX60 and it has no appropriate video, onboard nic, sound, or controller drivers. What can I do?

            You should go to&nbsp;Dell's website, put in your Serial Number&nbsp;and download the latest Vista&nbsp;Drivers for your Model number computer, if available.<br />
<br />
Or check at the Motherboard Manufacturer's website.<br />

<h2>            Windows Hello Feature Not Available</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have a Dell Inspiron 15 (5000 Series) laptop, which I would not consider to be an old laptop, and I have had Windows 10 installed on it for some time now. I have been looking to set up the Windows Hello feature, but it doesn't seem to be available. When
 I go into sign in options (settings), it gives me the options of: 'Require sign-in', 'Password', 'PIN', 'Picture password' and 'Related settings'. Apparently there should be another option that enables you to set up Windows Hello that I do not have.</p>
<p>Is this fixable or is this feature not available on my laptop?</p>
<p>Help is appreciated :)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Windows Hello is the hardware based Biometric component in Windows 10. It requires either a compatible Fingerprint Reader or a front facing Intel RealSense camera for the Facial recognition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jim is correct when he says that if you don't see the sign in options, then your system does not support Windows Hello.</p>

<h2>            How do I file a complaint against Microsoft corporate</h2>
                    I have had it with Microsoft. I have been given nothing but garbage customer support. I can't even get a refund on a bugged DLC. Their refund policy is still terrible. This is how Microsoft wants to start the new years? Well either I get a response or
 I am just done with Xbox. 10 years of their <strong>[mod removed-profanity</strong>] is too much for me.&nbsp;

<p>Hello VXXXX,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. The only way to appeal the refund decision is to reply to the email of the denial of the refund. If you contact support to complain or try for refund they will tell you to submit the form again or reply to the email. If you
 do want to file a complaint as most companies there is no direct place to do so. You can write to them and send it to the corporate office.</p>

<p>Surprisingly they do not have a complaints department which is hard to believe. There isn't really much you can do. You can fight getting your refund but that's not the same as filing a complaint.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Desmond. I am a fellow community Member. My Lock screen no longer asks this question either. I do not think that there is a way to change that. I had figured that this feature was simply removed. However, I am not 100% certain. I can only verify that all 5 PC's in my home act the same as yours

            Just check if it might be disabled or Windows Spotlight not be selected. 
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Lock screen
<br />
<br />Make sure Windows Spotlight is selected in the Background listbox. 
<br />
<br />Toggle on 'Get fun facts, tips, and more from WIndows and Cortana on your lock screen.
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Are you connected to the Internet? Because they are dynamic images sourced from Bing.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; File Explore &gt; This PC
<br />Select the View tab then check Hidden Items
<br />
<br />Copy and paste the following into the address bar
<br />
<br />%USERPROFILE%/AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Assets

<br />Right click settings.dat and roaming.lock each,
<br />Rename each respectively settings.dat.bak and roaming.lock.bak
<br />
<br />Restart your computer
<br />
<br />Open Settings App &gt; Personalisation &gt; Lock screen &gt; click in the 'Background', list box then choose Windows Spotlight.
<br />
<br />Other things you can try.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: regedit 
<br />Right click Regedit

            I concur with Dad of 5.  My Lock screen no longer asks this question.  I found an article on where to go and manually delete some files that would help in this.  In attempting the suggested "fixes", file locations were no longer there.
<br />
<br />Unless another one of our advisors finds one, it might be safe to assume this was deprecated.

<div>Full Screen Mode for Turbo c on Vista</div>
<div>—by Puneet (one of my friend)</div>
<div>This is a big question for those who are still using Turbo C++ Version 3.0 in Windows Vista or 7. As everyone knows that full screen is not supported with the version 3.0 in Vista,7; it is ridiculous to work in the small screen where I think no one can
 ever imagine writing a program there! This solution will help all the C, C++ learners using TC++ 3.0 in Vista.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is a simple technique. Just follow the simple 4 steps given below and get a big screen in few seconds. There is no need of any additional softwares or drivers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Step 1: Open TC++ (normally C:\TC\BIN\TC.EXE). In the startup it will show a dialogue box that it doesn’t support full screen mode as seen in the picture below. Just select ignore option. Then it will open the small screen mode.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Note: Please Click on the images to enlarge</div>
<div><br />
<div>Step 2: Go to the top left of the window and click. It will show a menu as shown in the figure. Then select properties from the menu.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Step 3: Now it will show the properties window, in which you select the Font tab. There you can see two font options as Raster and Lucida Console. The default will be Raster. You select Lucida Console and select the size from the size list as 28.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Step 4: After selecting the fonts, now you have to select the layout tab where you can see screen buffer size, window size, and window position options. First unselect the “Let system position window” option from window position options. Now make the following
 changes:</div>
<div><br />
<div>* Screen Buffer Size: Width: 82 Height: 28</div>
<div><br />
<div>* Window Size: Width: 80 Height: 26</div>
<div><br />
<div>* Window Position: Left: -4 Top: -4</div>
<div><br />
<div>After making the changes select OK.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now you will see a larger window and very crisp font size in which you can work perfectly fine. This technique actually doesn’t provide full screen in Vista but you will find it much better.</div>
<div><br />
<div>NB: The given sizes will work fine for 1280 by 800 screens, but there is no compulsion that you have to use them as specified. You can always use your own options according to your need.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you're trying to recover the data from an unallocated partition. I can understand how inconvenient this must be on your end.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft does not have any tools to get back or recover data from unallocated space on your hard drive. However, y</span><span>ou may try to search internet using your favorite search engine for any third party application to recover the data from
 unallocated space.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note: </strong>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software
 can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

    <title>Keep getting blue screens &#40;system_service_execution, irql - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crescentmage  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keep getting blue screens &#40;system_service_execution, irql errors&#41; after using my Windows 7 computer for games and freezes even just web browsing.</h2>
                    I've been mostly playing Starcraft 2 lately, and my computer tends to freeze. Sometimes I get a bluescreen (variety of errors, mainly irql or system_service_execution), sometimes SC2 just crashes. Tried reinstalling SC2 and graphics drivers, but it hasn't
 helped. I've run memory checks, but that doesn't seem to be the problem either.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've also noticed that I&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;get freezes just web browsing. Strangely, it seems to be happening when I press the middle mouse button, but it is not regular enough to reproduce.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've posted my minidumps at&nbsp;https://skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?cid=f6f3447538891ff3&amp;resid=F6F3447538891FF3!123. Any help is appreciated, thanks!</div>

==========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>
</p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so. <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p>Have you tried disabling AVG while trying to update Windows Update?</p>
<p>Also you stated you used Norton in the past. Did you use the Norton uninstaller tool to fully uninstall Norton from your PC?</p>

            No, I never formatted the hard drive or done an install of Windows. Not sure I'd know how to. I've had the PC since mid 2009. This problem only started a few months ago. Do you still think&nbsp;I may need to do what you suggested? Thanks.

<p>Hi Dufferon3,</p>
<p><br />
•&nbsp;When was the last time it was working fine?<br />
•&nbsp;What is the complete error message you receive?</p>
<p><br />
This usually happens if there corrupted printer drivers available on the computer.<br />
I would suggest that you uninstall all the printer related drivers and software.</p>
<p>Solution:&nbsp; Completely uninstall and reinstall your Printer and force vista to see new drivers:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Disconnect the printer from the PC <br />
<strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the <strong>Control Panel</strong> and click on <strong>
Programs and featurers</strong>.&nbsp; Highlight any Printer Software that is listed here.&nbsp; Select
<strong>Remove</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Step 3</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; From the <strong>Control Panel</strong>, click on <strong>
Hardware and sound</strong>.&nbsp; Right click the <strong>printer</strong> in question and select
<strong>Delete</strong> <br />
<strong>Step 4</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the <strong>Toolbar</strong>. Select <strong>File</strong>, then
<strong>Server Properties</strong>.&nbsp; Look in the <strong>Drivers</strong> tab.&nbsp; Highlight the printers drivers listed here and click on
<strong>Remove</strong> for each one. <br />
<strong>Step 5</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reboot the PC.&nbsp; <strong>Do NOT reconnect the printer! <br />
Step 6</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the <strong>website</strong> of your printer manufacturer.&nbsp; Look for new Windows vista drivers for your model.&nbsp; Download the correct software.&nbsp;
<br />
<strong>Step 7</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Run the <strong>exe</strong> file you just downloaded.&nbsp; It should auto-start the installation program
<br />
<strong>Step 8</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The software will tell you when to connect the printer.
<br />
<strong>Step 9</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the software is installed and the printer connected,
<strong>try a test page</strong></p>
<p>If the above step fails then run the fixit tool available in the below link and check if it works.<br />

            Hi LINGARAJ, that will require you to backup your data and clean install Windows 7
<br />
<br />Was Windows 7 previously installed and activated on your PC?
<br />
<br />If so:
<br />
<br />The Windows 7 product key should be o a Sticker on the bottom casing of your PC/Laptop If it is a laptop, or it might be under the battery - you will need it! 
<br />
<br />Backup all your files 
<br />
<br />Click this link to download the Windows 7 ISO file 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Click this link to download a small Microsoft utility (Windows USB/DVD Download Tool) to create bootable Installation Media from the ISO 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br />
<br />Create the bootable Installation media on a DVD or USB Flash Drive 
<br />
<br />Insert the bootable media into the PC 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, on the manufacturers logo screen press the appropriate button to get into BIOS Setup (Usually F2 or Del key) 
<br />
<br />Move the drive with the bootable media to the to of the Boot order list 
<br />
<br />Press F10 to save settings and restart 
<br />
<br />Windows 7 will begin installing 
<br />
<br />When your system reboots, go into BIOS and set your hard drive as top of the Boot Order 
<br />
<br />Do not remove the Installation media until you reach the Desktop 
<br />
<br />That's It!       
        </p>

                    <p>hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have synced about 100Gig of my music using the windows phone app for desktop - from W10 PC to W10 Lumia 950 (music stored on SD card)</p>
<p>
</p><p>but certain playlists and files it refuses to sync and gives 80070141 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it refuses every time to copy these, but happily copies other files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not aware my playlists have any copyright against them stopping them, and the names don't contain any special charachters either.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>all my playlists are created using windows media player and have the same extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>unfortunately, as they are playlists and they need re-coding from pc to phone version of groove, i cannot simply copy them to the phone storage (they would not reference the songs they were meant to play as the locations would be completely different once
 on my phone, from my pc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>as i say, i have copied across many hundreds of other playlists, created in the same way, without issues, but not these ones (yet! it seems to copy some it had trouble with before after some time - random :S)</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>john</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>that's not really that simple :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>all my music is stored under my account. so i have had to change permissions and then set the new account to be able to see the folders etc in my profile (via windows phone app for desktop) then wait for it to find everything.</p>
<p>when i plugged my phone into this new account, it tells me that it will now sync with this computer / account (not my original one)</p>
<p>i have re-ticked the playlists that did not work originally and hit sync, but it wants to re-sync 7000 odd files to my phone and is sat on file number 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>so i will let you know the results when i finish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as i say, not really a most helpful thing to suggest that i try.</p>

            <p>Trying with the other user was not working at all, and my normal user was still spuriously deciding if it was going to copy playlists to the phone, so I have deleted all the songs from groove on the phone, and all the files from the music directory where
 it stores everything and tried to sync all my playlists again, as this second user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it now gave even more than it would not copy - it sucessfully copied 10 of the 430 that I had marked to sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what appears to happen is that it gets 'stuck' with a playlist, saying it is syncing it for about 5 minutes then just flies throug the rest and gives the original error for all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it has however copied the majority of the songs, so it looks like it is just the playlists that it has trouble converting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope this helps you diagnose the issue</p>
