            Hi Rhonda_M
<br />
<br />That red X, if it is in the bottom left corner of the Documents Icon, means OneDrive has not been successful in syncing that folder, there may be just one file in that folder which OneDrive cannot sync . . 
<br />
<br />The documents folder contains a lot of application data that is specific to each user. your best option is to have a folder inside the documents folder for all your files
<br />
<br />Then in OneDrive Settings remove the documents folder form the list of synced items and add that folder winch contains only your files . . .

<h2>            I&#39;m trying to install .NET Framework 4.0 but it says it can&#39;t install because of&#58; HRESULT 0xc8000222&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm trying to play The Sims Medieval on my computer but it requires .NET Framework 4.0. So I googled where to get that and I've found the install exe but it fails to install because of HRESULT&nbsp;0xc8000222. It basically just sits at "installing" for five
 minutes and then it fails.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't get how it can fail, I had to reinstall windows recently (less than three weeks ago) so I've done literally nothing to this machine, it should be working as intended. Since this seems to be a Microsoft product I don't get how it won't work with
 its own machine. I'm running Windows Vista 64 bit.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I read some other people asking this question but none of the results or fixes have made any sense and the few answers I could understand didn't help me at all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I get this to work?</div>
                </div>

            <p><span>Hi Artie,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Where did you download the .Netframework update from?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to repair the existing .Net framework on the computer and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on Start and click on Control panel.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Go to Program and Features.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Scroll down to Microsoft.Net Framework 4 Client Profile, click on it and select Uninstall/Change.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Now follow the on-screen instructions to repair the program.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2:</span></p>
<p><span>You can also refer to the following article and try Method 2 and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/KB976982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">You receive error 0x80070643, error code 0x643 or updates may be re-offered when you try to install .NET Framework updates when using Windows Update or Microsoft Updates</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to install .Net framework in cleanboot mode and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer the following KB article to put the computer in clean boot:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>After the trouble shooting steps please refer to clean boot link to put the computer back to normal start up mode.</span></p>
<p><span>You can refer to the following link to download the update:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft .NET Framework 4 (Standalone Installer)</a>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

    <title>USB 3.0 on Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> soultsukino  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB 3.0 on Windows 7</h2>
                    I bought and put together a computer about a year ago. It comes with both USB 2 and USB 3 plug ins, however the USB 3 plug in do not seem to recognize anything I plug into it (all my current devices are USB 2) I was told those plug ins are all backwards
 compatible, so wondering if it's something I need to change in windows, update some drivers, or basically does this mean half the plug ins on my computer are useless to me?

            <p>You can ignore the Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter" error, at least for now.&nbsp; That's used for IPv6 communications.&nbsp; Unless you have an Internet service that uses IPv6 or you want to use the "Homegroup" feature for setting up your local network, you don't
 need IPv6 -- yet.&nbsp; See <a href="http://appuals.com/microsoft-teredo-tunneling-adapter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>A date of 2012 for USB 3.0 drivers isn't particularly unusual or troubling.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with the SM Bus Controller is a problem.&nbsp; The SM Bus Controller driver is included in the chipset driver package along with the USB drivers.&nbsp; The "unknown devices" are also a bit troubling.&nbsp; Are you able to find out anything about them by looking
 at the "Properties" of these entries?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should download and install the chipset driver that's appropriate for your version of Windows.&nbsp; At the link you gave earlier, there are chipset drivers for XP, Vista, and 7/8.&nbsp; If you can make a system image first do so, but installing chipset drivers
 should not be a particularly dangerous project.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would, however, hold off on updating the system BIOS.&nbsp; Although it's not that difficult to update a BIOS, it has a higher risk of causing a problem than simply updating drivers.&nbsp; I suggest that you read the motherboard manuals carefully first; I also noticed
 that there is a "BIOS Update Utility" on that download page which you probably should use to update the BIOS -- if you decide to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you're looking at the motherboard manuals (there are two in the zip file at the download page), look at the section on USB and make sure that your USB 3.0 ports are enabled in the BIOS configuration utility.</p>

<p><span>Hello Shubham,</span></p>
<p><span>Check if you are able to connect to the Network in Safe mode with Networking:
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Restart your computer if it is powered on.<br />
2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tap the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.<br />
3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.<br />
4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Use the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.<br />
5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Select Safe Mode with Networking and press Enter.<br />
6. .Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If you have no issues in connecting in ‘Safe Mode with Networking’, you should try to disable the Firewalls and the Antivirus Program
 on your computer and check if you have the same issue: </span></p>
<p><span><strong><em><span>Note:</span></em></strong><span> Please make sure that you enable the antivirus
 software and the firewalls after performing the test to keep your computer protected.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If this does not work, check if you are able to get the IP address on your computer.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Start, type CMD in the search Field.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on Command prompt and Run as Administrator.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>At the Command prompt type IPCONFIG /All</span></p>
<p><span>If you have incorrect IP address, follow the below link and run the Fix it:

</span></p>
<p><span>I see that you have tried to update and reinstall the drivers. If you have not tried to uninstall the Network Adapter drivers, you can
 try that that.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start. In the Start Search box type "devmgmt.msc" and press Enter.<br />
2. Expand "Network Adapters", double-click on the entry of the wireless network device.|<br />
3. Click the tab "Driver", click "Uninstall".<br />
4. Click Start. In the Start Search box type "appwiz.cpl" and press Enter. <br />
5. Remove the entries related to the wireless network adapter.<br />
<br />
Then reinstall the driver with your driver CD. After installing, re-create the connection.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, you can try to uninstall the driver from the Device Manager, then go to the computer or the device Manufactures website
 download the latest driver for your Network Adapter and install it.</span></p>

<p>I have a Dell Optiplex 760 running Win XP. This pc and others were cloned using Ghost with no problems or issues however this one pc will often boot to this Blue Screen with Black horizontal bars.</p>

            The Dell diagnostics are not particularly useful with video problems, which is what it sounds like you have. I'm pretty sure that Opti has onboard video but you might try putting in a discrete video card, even a PCI one, to see if that solves the issue.

            Yes but you will have to do complete reinstallation. It doesn't require a new license though.

            Hi Terry,
<br />
<br />An upgrade is not possible, you would need to backup your data and clean install Windows 10 64bit, that is the only route. Your Windows licence covers both versions, so it will not cost anything . . ..  but time !
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues

<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it sho

            <p>The 'N' versions are only available in European countries and minus media features such as Windows Media Player and Windows Media Center. You will have to manually install it yourself if you live in Europe due to a consent decree.
</p>
<p>The best edition of Windows 7 is debatable since this depends on your needs and what you plan to do with your PC. If you want to know the most complete edition of Windows 7 that contains all features, that is Windows 7 Ultimate.
</p>
<p>Each edition of Windows 7 is a subset of the other. So the higher you go the more features and better functionality you get.
</p>
<p>Windows 7 Starter &gt; Home Basic &gt; Home Premium &gt; Professional &gt; Ultimate/Enterprise</p>
<p>Home Premium - best for Entertainment, this edition provides full functionality on the latest hardware, easy ways to network and share media using HomeGroups. You can watch shows for fee when and where you want with Internet TV on Windows Media Center.

 PCs or servers. </p>
<p>Ultimate - Has all the features of Windows 7 Home Premium and Professional in addition to that, you get features unique to if you are working in a large Enterprise environment that is running Windows Server 2008 R2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft BitLocker and BitLocker To Go drive encryption and data protection on internal and external drivers and storage devices.</li><li>Direct Access - which helps give you more secure connection to your corporate network over the Internet.</li><li>Microsoft BranchCache - which helps provide faster access to content from remote file and Web Servers at branch locations.</li><li>Microsoft AppLocker - which helps prevent unauthorized software from running on worker's PCs.</li><li>Enterprise Search Scopes - which make it easy to discover and search content on intranet portals</li><li>Multilingual user interface packs - which let you work in any of the available 35 languages.

<p>32 vs 64 bit</p>

</p>
<p>Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit</a></p>

<p>Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers. Also, if
 you decide to move to Windows 7 64 bit in the future, there is no upgrade path from 32 bit Windows, clean install only.

    <title>KMS Woes&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greg hardin vge  say:</h3>
<h2>            KMS Woes&#33;</h2>
                    Good afternoon everyone,<br />
<br />
I have what I hope to be a simple answer to a problem I've overcomplicated. In past employments I've worked with KMS servers and KMS keys. We had a server on the domain, Clients would talk to that server and activate automatically. I've never had any trouble
 before. Now here's my dilemma:<br />
<br />
I've recently started a new job and they were looking to get KMS for Windows 7 / 8 keys. We've taken care of that and we now have the keys under our volume license agreement. I have the KMS server up and running. It's Windows 2008 standard, and I activated
 it using our Windows 2008 KMS key from our volume license website. But from here I seem to be stuck. If I put the windows 7 KMS key I see in our volume licensing area into a windows client, it activates, but does so as a KMS host. It does NOT talk back to
 our 2008 KMS Server. If I use the KMS client key from Microsoft <strong>removed product key</strong>, I get error code 0XC004F074 when trying to activate. Everything I can find about that error indicates it can't talk to the KMS Server. Well I've verified
 KMS is running on the 2008 server, and it's published in DNS. There are no firewalls and the computers are all on the same subnet in the same building. I spent almost 2 hours being transferred around by Microsoft. Is there something I'm forgetting here? I
 sure don't remember it being this hard. Thanks!<br />

<h2>            How do I know when I am in test mode&#63;</h2>
                    Hi guys,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've done what is necessary to get into Test Mode i.e. bcdedit commands to disable integrity check and enable testsigning.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, I do not get the 'Test Mode' watermark just above my clock? Why not?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using Windows 8 Pro Build 9200.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
<div>Z</div>
                </div>

            <p>Windows + X does not open Programs and Features but opens a menu with Programs and Features as the top option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the list that is generated the 3rd column should give the install date, clicking on the column header will rearrange the list in date order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you right click any entry in the software list, mouse over (don't click) Sort by and select More in the submenu. You can then add Location in the view of installed programs. This is useful because it is not that uncommon for uninstallers not to clean
 up completely and leave the program directory.</p>

            There is no such announcement. Generally previews are released for more popular OSes. So, you will have continued support for this on Linux.

    <title>Photo import from Nikon D3300 scan disk finding entire PC photo - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garyross3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photo import from Nikon D3300 scan disk finding entire PC photo collection instead of only the photos on the disk.</h2>
                    When I insert the scan disk from my camera into my HP PC the Photo window opens and automatically starts "Looking for new photos and videos".&nbsp; When it finally finishes the search it comes back with not only the new photos from my camera but all the photos
 in my entire PC photo collection.&nbsp; This takes a considerable time when all I wanted to do was import the pictures from the disk?&nbsp; Any idea why this is happening and what I can do to only import from the disk?

<p>Since this is my wife's computer she believes this started happening last summer and she is just now telling me about it.&nbsp; So far I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleting all but one picture on the scan disk while in the camera to ensure the photo library wasn't being transferred from the PC to the disk.&nbsp; I encountered the same problem on the PC.&nbsp; I then put the disk back into the camera and verified there was still
 only one picture on the disk.&nbsp; </li><li>I attached my iphone and the pictures on my phone import just fine without adding in the PC's photo library.</li><li>As you suggested I performed a clean boot and still have the same problem while in that mode.</li></ul>

    <title>Connecting Xbox 360 to PC monitor with HDMI getting no sound&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lees gnasher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting Xbox 360 to PC monitor with HDMI getting no sound&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased a new monitor to use my computer and xbox on because my old tv broke however I'm unable to get sound through on my xbox despite being able to access the xbox visually on HDMI. I have my xbox connected to this monitor via a HDMI cable
 connected from the monitor directly to the xbox which works when outputting picture however I can't hear anything on the screen (because there are no speakers on the monitor unlike my old HDTV). To counteract this issue I purchased the "Microsoft XBOX 360
 HDMI AV Cable &amp; Audio Adapter" to get sound from a pair of speakers that I use on my PC.</p>
<p>I realised I also needed these following components in order to connect the speakers successfully to the Xbox: A 3.5mm Female to Female Stereo Coupler Plug and a male 3.5mm jack to white/red RCA adapter to end up with something like this:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Phono-3-5mm-Female-Audio-Cable/dp/B003WQ11I4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Phono-3-5mm-Female-Audio-Cable/dp/B003WQ11I4</a>.
 When I plugged in my speakers into the vacant 3.5mm jack and an unused xbox USB, I started to experience problems. Whenever I tried to plug in the Microsoft&nbsp;XBOX 360 HDMI AV Cable &amp; Audio Adapter into my xbox; all I could hear was the xbox loading up and the
 console would not connect to the monitor until I took it out again.</p>
<p>I am now stuck in a dilemma which is disallowing me to use my xbox on my monitor with both sound and picture without having to sacrifice one or the other depending on whether I have my Microsoft XBOX 360 HDMI AV Cable &amp; Audio Adapter plugged into my xbox
 or not. I have seen people use their speakers when playing on a monitor using HDMI on youtube before (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8be4T-mkhUY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8be4T-mkhUY</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/8be4T-mkhUY?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/8be4T-mkhUY?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>) so I'm unsure why I'm unable to. Can anyone help a gamer

<p>On the dashboard, press the big Xbox button in the middle of your controller and go to the "Settings" tab and choose "Profile". Choose "Game Defaults" and you'll see "General", "Action" and "Racing". Check the configuration for "Action" and the camera was
 most likely changed to what you are experiancing. Try switching it the other way around and save and try Skyrim again.</p>

<p>Very first thing is to see how much memory you have left on your hard drive or thumb drive. &nbsp;I think this game saves multiple times without overwriting previous saves. If your running low on space try deleting some non essentials on the drive. &nbsp;Or here is
 another solution:</p>
<p>Hopefully you didn't turn your xbox off during a save... this may have corupted the last save file ( the continue save). &nbsp;Try the big xbox box button and navigate to the right until you get to system settings/ storage devices/games. &nbsp;scroll until you find
 skyrim and look at the save data. &nbsp;You may have to delete the first save file in the list, and then the next save should load as the "continue". &nbsp;NOTE: &nbsp;this will lose your last save point and go to the next save point on the list, and you may lose a lot of
 stuff. &nbsp;This game only auto saves when you enter buildings/ areas so use this as a last resort!!!</p>

    <title>No Sound via Optical Audio Cable in menus, some games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> digicrat  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Sound via Optical Audio Cable in menus, some games</h2>
                    
<p>I have the original Xbox360 connected to an HDTV via HDMI, and a 5.1 receiver via an Optical Cable using the adapter that came with the Xbox. &nbsp;I've never had audio problems in the past. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the last update (within the past few weeks), I noticed that I was no longer getting any sound on the menus. &nbsp;Games and Netflix movies (but not menus) have sound as normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just got a Kinect, and discovered that I get absolutely no sound in the Kinect menus or bundle games ... until I unmuted my TVs internal sound. &nbsp;Doing so, Netflix and the normal Xbox menu sounds also work as usual through the TVs speakers - and game/movie
 sound gets a nice echo coming through both.. &nbsp;Note: The Kinect mic setup sounds did play properly via the sound system.</p>
<p>I suspect that the Xbox is directing all 5.1 signals through the Optical cable as usual, but any Stereo-only sounds (ie:menus, arcade games) are getting lost.</p>

<p>Has anybody else seen this behavior? &nbsp;Any ideas? &nbsp;Or is this a wait for MS to re-patch it issue?</p>
