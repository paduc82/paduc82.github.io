<h2>            &#34;show more tiles&#34; option switches off automatically</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 Fall Creators Update from scratch.</p>
<p>Activated, went to the personalize tab, chose the option to show more tiles on the start menu and it does not happen.</p>
<p>When I checked back again - the option was automatically switch back to off.</p>
<p>Also the full screen menu option does not work.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue is often caused by a corrupted or missing data file. We'd like to know more information so we could provide an accurate resolution to fix this issue. Kindly answer the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you ever encountered this issue even before updating to the Fall Creators Update?
</li><li>Have you installed any programs that could trigger this issue? </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we would suggest that you try to toggle the same option from a different user profile. A corrupted user profile doesn't function normally. In such cases creating a new one will help us to identify if the issue is specific to a corrupted
 user profile. You can refer to this article for the steps on how to: <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17197/windows-10-set-up-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set up accounts</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we would suggest that you perform a clean boot to start Windows by using a limited number of startup programs and drivers. This eliminates any software conflicts and it will also help us isolate where the problem is coming from. You
 can refer to this article for the steps on: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            I can&#39;t update Rise Of Legends&#58; Can&#39;t access the update server</h2>
                    Hello, Rise Of Legends can't update. It always says the server is down after pressing OK about 5 times to see if there is a patch. It gives me the same error overall, even if I try to get into the Multiplayer. Note that it is a fresh install of Rise Of
 Legends. <br />
<br />
How can I solve this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

Edit: It says "Unable to communicate with the patch server."<br />

<br />
First of all, it's not a problem with Rise Of Nations, but rather Rise Of Legends. Second, it's not an invalid Patch File Error, but rather the server being sort of unavailable, which is a very different kind of error. I'm afraid to say your answer won't even
 help me since it's a different error and a different game. <br />
<br />
ShadesEdge<br />
<br />
Edit: I just remarked that I said it was a fresh install of Rise Of Nations by error while it was Rise Of Legends. Got kind of confused when I sent that. Sorry.

<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers

            I tried what you sent to me but it didn't changed. The game doesn't crash, I can even start a quick match, but I can't patch the game. It doesn't state that my computer's processor doesn't meet the requirements neither it does crash. I can't simply auto-update
 with the tool provided with the game. I have read somewhere that Big Huge Games, the ones that made the game, closed their server because they went bankrupt. It is probably the reason their servers are closed. Even their website is dead. I probably will never
 be able to update that game. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the quick answers. <br />

            <p>I think you're right about the patch server being shut down. I suppose our only hope to get a patched version is for a site like gog.com to pick up support for it. There was a post on some other fan site from someone who uploaded the patch and a set of instructions,
 but I chose not to go that route.</p>

            I've just run across the same problem as you did ShadesEdge. It's unfortunate, but you should be able to manually update the patches you require. The same thing happened to LOTR: Battle For Middle Earth, and so manual patches were required to balance out
 the game. This was a helpful post, even if I'm months behind in the uptake.<br />

<h2>            Icons disappearing Folder Redirection</h2>
                    <p>Good Day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are experiencing a problem with Users running Windows 10 Pro that are connected to a domain enviroment&nbsp; where Folder Redirection is Setup (Desktop and My Documents redirected to server)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the users turn on their notebooks and try and work from home all their Icons are Missing and they are prompted for Windows Credentials, we have entered the users credentials correctly and the credential popup still appears</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Issue started in December 2017 after windows Updates, not sure if Microsoft Changed anything but before the Update everything was working perfectly</p>
<p>
</p><p>All servers are running Server 2012 R2 and 2016</p>
<p>No IP v6 enabled</p>
<p>Direct Access also not enabled</p>
<p>Offline Folders Enabled yes<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem seems to happen when computer starts up with internet connection, if it starts up with no internet connection it works</p>
<p>Computers also don't seem to be saving Credentials in the credential Manager, If credentials are entered manually in Credential manager Problem seems to be fixed for a day and then Windows removes the credentials again</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if i'm missing anything but if anyone can help would really appreciate it&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#34;The installation failed in the SECOND_BOOT phase with an error during MIGRATE_DATA operation&#34; and the code &#34;Error 0x8007002C - 0x4000D&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I had recently upgraded from win 8.1 to 10. I had encountered this error from early builds even to the final release build, I could not upgrade. Finally I was able to upgrade to build&nbsp; 11082.1000, a release preview. I have tried upgrading to every build
 after, but now the error msg is back when I try to install a new preview build. As previously done I had uninstalled antivirus and removed all unneeded periperhals. Homebuilt computer, motherboard is asus m5a99fx pro rev 2. cpu is amd fx 6850. Nvidia 770 graphics
 card. I have run chkdsk /f numerous times and tried scanning for and repairing system files. attached is the setuperr. log info:</p>
<p>Not sure if anyone can make sense of and give any suggestions?</p>

            Hi David,
<br />
<br />There are many tools in Windows 10 - what specific Menu are you looking for?
<br />
<br />Control Panel - click your Start Button, type control panel and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Settings App - click the gear icon on your Start
<br />
<br />Windows Tools - scroll down the alphabetical list on your Start Menu and choose Windows Administrative Tools       
        </p>

<h2>            Programs featured Event ID1530 aren&#39;t loading properly.</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a problem with my Windows 8.1 Pro install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several programs seem to be experiencing problems when I load up my PC and often fail to load properly even after a reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started to notice it with Plex media Server. Recently, I would boot up my PC to find that Plex, which was due to load up on boot, and notice that it wasn't functioning as usual. When I try to open the program using the desktop icon or the icon on the taskbar
 my browser would open up a tab (since it uses a web based client) but it would fail to connect to it and/or timeout.
</p>
<p>Sometimes a reboot would fix it and it would load up correctly but often it would take a few reboots to get it to load up correctly.
</p>
<p>I could get Plex to behave properly if I repaired the install and rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I noticed that Steam (steam.exe gaming client) was acting the similar to Plex. It was appearing in the taskmanager like Plex, but unlike Plex it was not appearing in the taskbar.
</p>
<p>Plex servers forum couldn't figure it out. I have already ran a CHKDSK on the C Drive (SSD) and my main (2TB HD).
</p>
<p>I decided to look into the event viewer to see if both Steam and/or Plex was featured in there and there was an Event ID 1530 from the last time it was Shutdown (last night) with this text</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>After doing a bit of research on here, I see that it might be due to a corrupt user profile. After running a SFC scan it came back with the message
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This scan was done after I rebooted the computer twice. The first time the programs (Steam and Plex) failed to load properly again.</p>
<p>The second time everything loaded up correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how to solve it? Or what is even causing it?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, the SFC scan and the CHKDSK haven't found any violations/corruption etc and have performed a couple of the scan over the last day or so and got the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The antivirus program I'm using is Avast free, which can be seen in the registry keys that are accessed in the Event id 1530 I've copied and pasted above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No changes to hardware have been made at all. Not since I set up my PC over a year and a half ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you explain what the point of performing a Clean Boot would be? Surely that means that I'll be booting Windows 8 up with just Microsoft processes running, no? But the programs that are causing a problem (Steam/Plex) aren't microsoft ones so there is
 no way for me to find out what's causing it. Unless I'm completely missing something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Should I be performing SFC scan and CHKDSK from within Safe mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

</p><p>On booting up after this event, and other events like this which feature Steam.exe and Plex, these programs fail to load properly the next time the PC loads up. They appear to start up on boot and are present in the Taskmanager but cannot be opened at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just think that there's too much of a coincidence that they appear in the Event just before I shut down and when I boot up next, they fail to load.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Freezes and then locks everything out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> imdabaum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Freezes and then locks everything out</h2>
                    
<ol>
<li>I cannot access documents. Yep no way to do it unless I reboot in safe mode. If I click on the Windows Explorer button in my task bar it glows for about 10 seconds like it's thinking about opening and then it stops and does nothing.
</li><li>Every time I hit Alt+tab, the switch screen sticks on top of everything. Generally I can still work on the applications that are open and running, but I cannot open any more applications. And if I hit Windows+Tab, then the whole system locks up.
</li><li>There are still intermittent freezes when I do nothing, but that's just my windows experience guys. No offense. But I'm use to the random freezes. It's when I'm doing something that I know the OS is capable of that I get frustrated.
</li></ol>
Anyone have any suggestions?<br />
I'm running the following specs:<br />
Dell Inspiron 1750<br />
Intel Core2 Duo processor- 2.20Ghz<br />
4GB Ram<br />
64-bit operating system<br />
<br />
Thanks for any assistance.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to do a clean boot and check if it fixes the program.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows 7:</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click Start, type
<strong>msconfig</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. (If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type the password, or click Continue.)</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>2. On the
<strong>General tab</strong>, click <strong>Selective Startup</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>3. Under <strong>Selective Startup</strong>, click to clear the <strong>
Load Startup</strong> Items check box.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>4. Click the <strong>Services</strong> tab, click to select the <strong>
Hide All Microsoft Services</strong> check box, and then <strong>click Disable All.</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>5. Click <strong>
OK.</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>6. When you are prompted, click
<strong>Restart.</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>7. Log back into your Account.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not return while your computer is in clean boot mode, a background program is likely causing interference.
 You can try to determine <br />
which background program is causing the problem while the computer is in clean boot mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;To find the process or program at cause follow the steps starting at
<strong>enable half of the Services items</strong>, from the following article:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;Refer this link for more information:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a>
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;To restore your
<strong>Normal </strong>startup:</span></p>
<p><span>1 .Click
<strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press ENTER. (If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type the password, or click <strong>Continue</strong>.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;2. On the
<strong>General</strong> tab, click<strong> Normal Startup</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;3. When you are prompted, click
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Well I'm having problems with Kernel-Error already 3years. Every time when windows starts, 2 Kernel-Errors hits me, and also don't even need to mention&nbsp;enormous spam of Windows Search errors, that hits me every day, about 50+ times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well it's seems like problem from other dimension, since "Microsoft "experts" here can't give 1 normal answer or suggestion how to fix, except giving full random official link about Windows ect ..</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyway, don't even care for that anymore, can't do nothing about it ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm here asking for help, of someone that can describe me several files, that Autoruns find on my PC right now.</p>
<p>Yes I already google them, and I'm even more confused now .... Tons of scan files sites, every site saying some other version of story, everyone differently describing files, so please if someone here can official tell me more about those several files:</p>

<br />
<div>On many laptops the numeric keypad is overlaid on top of the letter-part of the keyboard. While NumLock is on, the letter i becomes 7, o becomes 8 and p becomes 9. This will have a drastic effect on the password you type . . .</div>

    <title>Can&#39;t turn off computer speakers when headphones are in use - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike8353  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t turn off computer speakers when headphones are in use</h2>
                    <p>Hello. &nbsp;I've seen some other posts about this problem that I just started having as a result of a Windows 10 update. &nbsp;However, I have not seen any answers. &nbsp;With a recent Windows 10 update, I now have sound coming out of both my headphones and computer speakers
 at the same time. &nbsp;The way sound used to work is that when I used my headphones, no sound would come out of the computer speakers. &nbsp;Now, sound comes out of both at the same time, and there is no way to turn off one or the other. &nbsp;When I go to settings - sound,
 I have a single Sound Playback entry that says "Speakers / Headphones". &nbsp;Now I can only either turn sound off in both or turn sound on in both. &nbsp;This is extremely frustrating and inconvenient. &nbsp;Thanks for any input. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Depending on your system configuration you may have options to set such things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I would check is whether the headphones are set as a Communications Device or as Default.&nbsp;&nbsp; While you are in the Playback device panel, check the properties and see what the jack information is as far as which jacks are assigned to do what.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyond that, you may have some type of audio mixer panel.&nbsp; There may be settings there&nbsp;which could help. &nbsp;I have a Realtek audio device and can open the Audio Manger from the hidden icons on the Task Bar.&nbsp; If you don't see an option there you might open
 the Control Panel and check for a Audio Mixer or perhaps you need to load drivers for your particular system.&nbsp; Does that system have OEM Windows 10 drivers available?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice having AC97 or HD Audio Front Panel will effect whether both outputs or just one will work.</p>

    <title>Chat Banned For Saying One Cuss Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fps baal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chat Banned For Saying One Cuss Word</h2>
                    <p>I really don't understand why I get communication banned for eight days for saying 1&nbsp;cuss word. Most of the games I play like Call of Duty literally curse everyone I kill someone. It seriously doesn't make sense to me. On the Xbox 360, I could have said a full sentence of cuss words and not even get a 1 day suspension. There is no way Microsoft can stop people from cursing. So why suspend people for doing it. I'm obviously going to say something again. But I'm just saying that 8 days is a little to much for just one word that I hear everyday. I'm really about to switch to PC where I can say anything freely.</p>

            <p>Suspensions get longer the more times you're deemed to have broken the rules. Have you had any other suspensions in the past?</p><p><br /></p><p>As for the code of conduct, I don't find it to be a well-written document as it's so vague. When it comes to swearing, it does mention "profane words and phrases", but in the context of "content that could harm or harass a person, including yourself, or an animal". Even after being a Live member for 10 years or so, I'm still not clear what the rules actually are. Obviously if you're swearing at another player and abusing them, that's against the rules, but what if you just say "oh s--t!" when you get shot in COD, for example? Can that get you a ban? I really don't know, so I just stick to using party chat with friends and avoid open voice chat altogether.</p><p><br /></p><p>But yeah, chances are your suspension is that long because it's not a first offence.</p>

            <p>I swear on my life it was ONE WORD. This is my second time though. But 8 days for the b word? I reported that guy too. But he didn't get banned. He constantly called me trash and said to stop playing the game, which I was playing Rocket League (Best game ever by the way). And I already do play on steam, but I don't have many of the bigger games. I only have gmod, csgo, css, and cod. But it just blows my mind on that 1 word. I don't think microsoft understands that a plethora of people curse and banning them for over a week isn't going to fix the problem. But I still do have a green reputation. That's good right?</p>

            Hi, Taffy087
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Perform the procedure to repair the system files:
<br />Follow these instructions: press the Windows + X keys and select Command Prompt (Administrator) or Windows PowerShell (Administrator), in the window that will open, you must type the commands in their respective order:
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />• DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•  sfc /scannow 
<br />
<br />Each of these actions can take a few minutes, so it is important to execute one at a time. When finished, you must restart the PC.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

                    <p>Original Title: screen display effects</p>
<p>using Vista----problem----when I want to drag a window say Yahoo to another corner of the screen I click the mouse on yahoo's outer margin and instead of the entire window moving just the outer frame moves to the new position --when I release the mouse the
 contents follow very quickly and you have a normal lookink window, when I was using XP software it was easy to correct this by clicking show window contents while dragging(there is a display properties for the sceen). How do you do this with Vista so the entire
 window moves together?</p>

                    <p>My Xbox One shares an account between itself and my Xbox 360, this account has Xbox Live, which is the reason it is shared between the two. I no longer use the 360, it is used by my 5 year old nephew and my father, but to use xbox live, they have to use the shared account.</p><p><br /></p><p>When I receive messages on the Xbox One, they appear both&nbsp;in the inbox on the Xbox One,&nbsp;&amp; the 360.

            <p>Hey there, unfortunately, not. The share functions of Home console are not compatible with the Xbox 360, so they would need to directly access your account in order to gain its benefits. Your only option to keep them from your messages is to have them sign up for their own account and subscription.</p>

            <p>Patrick, see if "Autoruns" detects this module. If it does, disable, but don't delete it until we can find out if it is safe to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: After hiding all Microsoft entries, search under each "tab" for it. Look under the drivers tab first.</p>
