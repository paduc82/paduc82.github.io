    <title>Allow Gamertag reversing for free of charge like PSN - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Allow Gamertag reversing for free of charge like PSN</h2>
                    <div>You can change your Xbox One and PSN name as many times as you want (if you're willing to pay, of course).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>You can change your PSN ID back to a previous ID by contacting PlayStation Support. This doesn't cost anything. Your previous PSN IDs can't be claimed by someone else.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Xbox One should be providing the same offer to change gamertags to an old one free of charge.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Free change to a new gamertag especially when users upgrade consoles (e.g. Xbox One Orginial to Xbox X).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Fellow gamers, what are your opinions on this matter?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Few years back, I made an embarassing Gamertag and changing for $8 is like a $1000 to a University student. Just read PSN offers free ID reversing and thought Xbox would too... Support chat told me "no" when I asked.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Upgrading Xbox 360 to Xbox One Orginial gave me a second chance to change my gamertag for free but nothing with upgrading Xbox One Orginial to Xbox One X.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Why do I care so much? Gamertag is embarassing, includes my personal names, and everyone picks me for it...</div>
                </div>

            It's not Free of Charge on PSN, it's free only for first time. This feature has been on Xbox Live for ages, and you can change your GT for first time for free. PSN just introduced it and as there were no means to change PSN ID before, everyone will be
 changing it for the first time, and that's why they are offering for free. For all subsequent changed there are fees.

<p>Actually, the OP is correct; PlayStation is allowing users to revert to a previous online ID at no charge, provided it's available. Yes, ID changes are charged after the first one (US$9.99, or $4.99 if the user subscribes to PlayStation Plus), but reverts
 are free. That said, there are other issues involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Xbox gamertag is part of a larger account system. Microsoft accounts cover a LOT of things, not just Xbox. Microsoft accounts work on Office, Hotmail, Skype ... you name it. Also, gamertags that are desirable may well be claimed by another user when
 they are made available, so it would not be possible to revert back to it since someone else may already have it.<br />
<br />
The larger overall problem, in my opinion, will be online safety. There's a reason that name changes are paywalled or not permitted - users really shouldn't change them often. Honestly, it's a little scary for a player to use their freebie name change (or pay
 for one) to disappear behind a new name, cause some havoc, then revert to the old name with no "penalty" per se. It's a little too "good hand, bad hand" for me, and I think that will wind up biting them just as the share play idea did (players allowed others
 to take over their controls, wound up getting stuff bought, characters deleted, etc.).</p>

<p>The Playstation Network handling of name changes is very different.&nbsp; They just released it to the public because it is a very complicated process that does break some games for them.&nbsp; They are allowing users to "revert back" because that origianl name doesn't
 ever really go away, that original name remains the primary key name, database wise, for the account and is still tied to how they handle some licenses and save games.&nbsp; When you change your Gamertag on Xbox One, it relinquishes that old name and allows others
 to pick that name up, since it's no longer in use.&nbsp; So being allowed to revert back is not always an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Grain of salt, because I have not actually worked on the PSN name change service, but reading up on the technical aspects, that's what I understand so far.&nbsp; Could be wrong.</p>

            The reason why the revert is free is because it has the potential to break game saves. Which xbox does not and has never had that problem.

            Sorry don't agree. If you change your gamertag to something else then it should free up for anyone else to use. It should block that name from everyone else, so you could potentially build up a big list of previous names you are keeping only for yourself,
 then to change to when ever you want.

<h2>            Xbox One restarting by itself</h2>
                    
<p>Just wondering if anyone else has come across this problem.</p>
<p><br />
Last couple of nights been playing Diablo 3 UEE &amp; about 10 minutes after stopping playing the Xbox decides to reboot. Once it's back up it works fine again until after playing Diablo, then reboot again after coming out of the game.</p>
<p>Doesn't sound like the console is overheating, and the only other change has been the August update.</p>
<p>Anyone else experiencing this with Diablo or any other games.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, there are no issues with the console during gameplay, only after I come out of the game, so I don't think there is any overheating issues.</p>
<p>If it happens again over the weekend I will reset the console and see if that has any effect but was curious if anyone else has seen this problem.</p>

<p>Same here. Only for me , the &nbsp;xbox resets after a few minutes of gameplay. Been happening &nbsp;only with diablo 3: UEE &nbsp;since the update downloaded for the dashboard beta program. I tried the digital and physical copies of diablo, btw. Happened to both. I also
 went as far as to do a factory reset on the xbox one. Still didn't work. I'm crazy depressed.

<p>Same Here, almost every night after 4 or so hours of playing Diablo. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't believe it's hardware issue, since console would reboot it self randomly. Sounds more like software issue.</p>
<p>Do &nbsp;you guys have a hard copy of diablo? maybe the issue is a memory leak in the game, so console reboots to clean memory?
</p>
<p>Anyhow, I have Hard copy of the game and it is installed on external USB drive.</p>

<p>Same issue here, and it just started over the&nbsp;last week or so.&nbsp;I play D3 UEE for a couple of hours, then switch to TV, and within a few minutes the video locks up as the sound stutters. After another minute or so, the Xbox One reboots, and all is well.</p>

<p>After playing and returning to dash, highlight D3 UUE, menu -&gt; quit.</p>
<p>I have a feeling it's the D3 UUE title screen video playing that, when in the background, causes the reboot.</p>

<h2>            How can I connect an external &#40;legacy&#41; CD&#47;DVD player to Windows 10 PC&#47;laptop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've just been given a new non-branded external DVD/CD player that I can't get either of my W10 machines to recognise, either in File Explorer or Device Manager.</p>
<p>It's a new player, ordered on ebay I suspect from China, and came with a single page instructions for Windows 98 installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to use Add Legacy Hardware from Device Manager, but can't find a DVD/CD ROM hardware type in the list.&nbsp; Of course the player didn't come with any software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Try these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Open the Command Prompt with administrative privileges.
<br />
<br />2. Type the following command and hit Enter key:
<br />
<br />reg.exe add â€œHKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\atapi\Controller0â€ /f /v EnumDevice1 /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000001
<br />
<br />3. Exit the Command Prompt and reboot. Insert a disk to test and the optical or DVD drive should be visible now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<p>Thank you but no luck unfortunately - no new drive visible&nbsp; :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can however see an "Unknown Device" in my device manager with an exclamation yellow triangle, which may be new (don't recall if I noticed it before the reg add).&nbsp; W10 can't find any drivers for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This particular DVD/CD player (USB2.0) has 2 USB cable, one looks like a USB power cable and the other is a Type A to Type B.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the reply.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Plug in the DVD/CD player using the USB cable and run the troubleshooter to check if that helps. You may also plug in the USB cable to a different port
 on the PC to check if that makes any difference. </span></p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the reply.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I agree with you when you say â€˜Maybe this type of DVD player is just too old, or too dodgy for windows 10â€™.</span></p>
<p><span>However, we can try to uninstall and reinstall the USB drivers on the PC to check if that helps. Refer to the steps provided by â€˜Ratandeepâ€™ from this
 thread to <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/usb-driver-for-windows-10/e9ead873-734b-42fb-9d6b-b98167fb876f">
<p><span>After uninstalling the drivers, remember to restart the computer so that the drivers would get installed automatically. Once this is done, you may connect
 the laptop to the existing network to check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps.

<p style="text-align: left">- Alt + Tab OR windows + tab is not working</p>

<p style="text-align: left">1- Restarting the system</p>

            Hi, VaneBarboza
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try entering Safe Mode to repair
<br />
<br />Turn off your computer; then, turn it on. 
<br />As soon as you see the Windows logo with the spinning dots, press and hold the power button until your computer turns off. Do this process twice.
<br />.-Turn on your computer for the third time, and let it load.
<br />.-You should get this message: Preparing Automatic Repair.
<br />.-On the next screen that would appear, click on Advanced Options.
<br />.-Select Troubleshoot.
<br />.-Go to Advanced Options.
<br />.-Click on Startup Repair.
<br />.-Wait for the repair to finish.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro &#40;1803&#41; problem with strange characters in password field</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>on a Dell Precision M2800 Notebook I have a strange problem.</p>
<p>After a clean Windows 10 Pro (1803) installation from the MediaCreationTool USB (no lan or wan access) stick I have a problem with password fields (Login, Run As...) Sometimes I have strange characters in the field and not the character that I have pushed
 on the keyboard. The keyboard is working well.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Even with all updates (OS Build 17134.137) still the same behavior.</p>
<br />
<p>https://youtu.be/vKxbmj5oe0Q</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/1T4UBrA3dWk</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no other language installed.</p>
<p>With Windows 10 Pro 1709 I don't had this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx !</p>

<p>Hi Freddy68,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It could be possible that some system drivers needs updating, or it could also be the drivers for your hardware that needs to be updated as some of the possible factors that we can consider. As a suggestion, I recommend that you perform these following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your keyboard, press the <strong>Windows button + I</strong> to open the <strong>
Settings</strong> window.</li><li>Next, click on <strong>Time &amp; Language</strong>.</li><li>On the left pane, click on <strong>Region &amp; Language</strong>.</li><li>Click on the language under the <strong>Language</strong> section.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Options</strong> button.</li><li>Look for the <strong>Keyboards</strong> section.
<ul>
<li>If what's added is the <strong>QWERTY keyboard layout</strong>, add an <strong>
AZERTY keyboard layout</strong>.</li><li>If what's added is the <strong>AZERTY keyboard layout</strong>, add a <strong>
QWERTY layout</strong>.</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>Afterwards, check the keyboard layout that is used by opening the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10762/windows-use-on-screen-keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">On-Screen keyboard</a></strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if the issue is still happening when entering your password using the On-Screen keyboard.</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't hesitate to keep me posted on the results, for me to assist you further.</p>

<h2>            My Xbox One X doesn t start. Blackscreen and Error E102</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my xbox one X was working well until this afternoon. Then i turned it on and didn t appear the normal screen. It turned into a black screen and after 5 or 10 minutes appear the Erorr E102. I tried to restore the console to factory settings but it went
 black screen again and after 5 or 10 minutes more, appear the Erorr E102 again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>EspaÃ±ol: Estuve utlizando mi xbox one x normalmente hasta esta tarde. Despues volvi a encender la consola y al principio la television no me reconocia la seÃ±al de la consola, pero despues de 5 o 10 minutos se pone la pantalla negra y luego de 5 o 10 minutos
 mas, me aparece en la pantalla el Erorr E102. Trate de restablecer a valores de fabrica borrando todo, juegos y partidas, pero la pantalla se vuelve a poner negra y despues de un rato, vuelve a la misma pantalla de Error E102. No encuentro la manera de hacer
 que la consola arranque.</p>

<p>Try performing a hard reset EXACTLY like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.&nbsp; Unplug the power cord
 from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If that doesn't help try a different HDMI cable, different ports on the TV and possibly a different TV.</span></p>

<p>Hey there Mauricio, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to get your console to load up correctly.
</p>
<p>For this kind of situation the best thing for you to do would be for you to try the steps outlined in
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/startup-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot Xbox One startup errors</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, if the steps there don't resolve the issue, it might be a sign of a hardware issue afflicting your console. If that is the case, then you can get a repair order created either at
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
device support </a>or by contacting <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
customer support </a>directly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<h2>            Minidump &#43; blue screen &#43; shut down error</h2>
                    dear wise man and woman of the computerworld.<br />
<br />
I am having unexpected shut downs and a blue screen error report after reboot. <br />
mostly after watching a video or a movie on vlc player. so i suspect it has to do with the driver for my display adapter which is a :NVIDIA GeForce 7150M / nForce 630M. So I updated to the latest version directly from the NVIDIA website as the Windows update
 doesnt find this update as the latest version. but still no luck, as the laptop shuts down unexpected.<br />
<br />
I am running Vista home premium on a HP Pavillion dv9815nr. 1 year old. and 2 month ago OS reinstalled, but the problem is new.<br />
<br />
I hope there is anybody out there who is willing to help me. I really appreciate the time you spend to look into this.
<br />
<br />
attached is the blue screen error message and the whole dump file. i know <br />
<br />
thank you soo much in advance<br />

    <title>screen blinks when connected to power adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fruitc  say:</h3>
<h2>            screen blinks when connected to power adapter</h2>
                    I have checked everything points to the fact that the screen starts blinking when i connect the power adapter.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>the computer works fine when it is powered by battery.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>but when it working simultaneously between battery and power adapter then the screen starts blinking.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i have tried changing the power adapter and the blinking behaviour has not stopped.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>so the problem is not with the power adapter.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>the problem is therefore with windows 7.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
                </div>

            The screen switches on and off at alternating intervals all by itself. Sometimes it is fast, sometimes it is slow. but it is extremely irritating, and it is sort of like hearing a loud voice right in your except this is in your eye. so even when the power
 adapter is not connected and it just on battery it is like the screen is still shouting right in your eye and you just know that the battery is going to go bad eventually.

 have one light button on my pc ... not two buttons for brightness and contrast .... please help ....<br />

            Try changing the brightness while on battery power.&nbsp; I don't think that will be causing it, but try it, you never know.<br />

            I think I got the answer, I believe the power plan needs to be updated from Dell and Power Saver to Balanced. Please do try this and let me know if this works for some one else. Thanks, Sreeram<br />

            <p>Hi fruitc,</p>
<p>Were you able to resolve the issue by updating the power plan as you mentioned in your last post? The issue may be caused by a short in the AC power adapter.

            <p>If you upgraded to Windows 10 and now for whatever reason need to re-install Windows 10 you can do so as your computer's hardware signature has been saved by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Re-install as follows:</strong></p>
<span>
<p>When you upgrade a Windows 7 or 8.1 system to Windows 10, the installer confirms that you have a "genuine Windows" system installed and activates your computer for use with Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong> that you donâ€™t actually get a Windows 10 product key&nbsp;- instead, your computerâ€™s hardware is registered with Microsoftâ€™s servers. When you install Windows 10 on that PC again in the future, it will check in with Microsoftâ€™s servers,
 confirm itâ€™s installed on a registered PC, and automatically activate itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you donâ€™t take advantage of the upgrade process first, this registration will never happen. Thereâ€™s no way to enter a Windows 7 or 8.1 key into the Windows 10 installer, nor is there some sort of web form that will give you a Windows 10 key if you provide
 your Windows 7 or 8.1 key. Sorry â€” youâ€™ll have to upgrade to Windows 10 before you can perform a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to upgrade, you can download Microsoftâ€™s Windows 10 media creation tool and tell it to "Upgrade this PC now." It will automatically upgrade you to Windows 10 if your PC is running a genuine version of Windows 7 or Windows 8.1."</p>
<p>
</p><p>====================== Media Creation Tool ============================</p>
<p>ã€€</p>
</span>
<p><span>Using the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool: </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<span><span>
<p>ã€€</p>
<p>Read the instructions carefully.</p>
<p>ã€€</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I suggest you make an Image Backup (to an external USB drive) of your current version of Windows before you attempt the upgrade. Should anything go wrong during or after the upgrade you can use the backup to restore your previous version.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 7 hotspot feature is for sharing your computers internet connection with other devices. You need to check if your network card has the latest driver to support
 the feature. Go to the Device Manager and look for the Network Adapter and check whether you have installed latest driver or not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Put the following commands into a .bat-file for simpler and faster usage:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open an elevated command prompt (Type â€œCMD.EXEâ€ in the start menu search bar, then right click the cmd.exe link and select â€œRun as Administratorâ€).</span></li><li><span>In the command window, type: netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=MyNet key=MyPassword keyUsage=persistent.</span></li><li><span>Replace â€œMyNetâ€ with the name you want to use for the wireless network and replace â€œMyPasswordâ€ with your chosen password for accessing it).</span></li><li><span>Press Enter.</span></li><li><span>Now type: netsh wlan start hostednetwork.</span></li><li><span>Press Enter.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Follow the below Methods to make your Windows 7 a hotspot:</span></p>
<p><span>1. In the Start Menu Open Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the Control Panel Menu, click on Network and Internet.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Open the Network and Sharing Center.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click on Setup a new connection or network in the Network and Sharing Center window.</span></p>
<p><span>5. In the â€œSetup a Connection or Networkâ€ window, under the â€œChoose a Connectionâ€ option, select Set up a wireless ad hoc (computer-to-computer) network, and click
 Next.</span></p>
<p><span>6. The Next window displays some instructions for setting up a wireless ad hoc network, Click â€œNextâ€.</span></p>
<p><span>7. It will now ask you to enter the network name and security keys. Click â€œNextâ€ when done.</span></p>
<p><span>8. It will display the â€œNetwork Nameâ€ and â€œKeyâ€ of the newly formed wireless network.</span></p>
<p><span>9. The newly formed Wireless connection now appears under the â€œWireless Network Connectionâ€ and is ready for users to connect. In order to enable the users to use
 it as a hotspot, you need to share your Internet Connection with them.</span></p>
<p><span>10. To share your internet connection, go to Control Panel -&gt; Network and Internet -&gt; Network and Sharing Center and click on â€œChange Adapter Settingsâ€.</span></p>
<p><span>11. Now right click on the connection that enables you internet access and select â€œPropertiesâ€.</span></p>
<p><span>12. In the â€œConnection Propertiesâ€ window, open the â€œSharingâ€ tab and check the Allow other network users to connect through this computerâ€™s internet connection.
 Click Ok when done.</span></p>
<p><span>At this point, you should be able to connect any wireless device to your new ad hoc network and access the internet or even share files directly with your laptop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Hope the information helps.</span></strong><span>
</span><strong><span>Keep us posted if you face any issues on windows in future. We will be glad to help you.</span></strong></p>

    <title>Trying to instal HP D5360 Photosmart Printer software on recent - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jameswford  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to instal HP D5360 Photosmart Printer software on recent upgrade to Windows7</h2>
                    Recently upgraded to Windows 7 from Vista and the only remaining issue is the HP D5360 Printer full feature software. &nbsp; Install proceeds normally until the last portion and crashes with the message.&nbsp; Non Supported Operating System.&nbsp; Cancel and restart.
 &nbsp; The HP software thinks that I have Windows 7 but is looking for XP.&nbsp; I have double checked the version I Downloaded and it is for the Windows 7 version.&nbsp; Not sure what is going on here but suspect some prior setting is still stored in a left over folder
 for this package. &nbsp; <br />
<br />
Anyone have an idea on how to fix this short of reinstalling Windows 7.&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Did you uninstall any HP printer software via programs and features, prior to download/install from HP?</p>
<p>Did you select the win7 32 or 64 bit file to download?</p>

            No -&nbsp; But my computer is an HP A6700y 64 bit machine and came with a lot of HP stuff on it. The Printer worked well with the HP full install software which came with it for VISTA.&nbsp; When I upgraded to Windows 7 the printer lost some features and HP website
 suggested upgrading the HP software.&nbsp; I downloaded the package for for Windows 7, 64 bit.&nbsp;&nbsp; For some reason when I am installing the software thinks it needs Windows XP and won't proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Then you need to call/mail HP printer support

            Guess so,&nbsp; however they are difficult to get a hold of since its out of warranty.&nbsp; Thought someone here might have run into this issue.<br />
