            <p><span>Hi Abhay,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above issue might occur due to the corrupted or missing app or update components on the computer. The issue might also occur if the Time, Date &amp; Region settings are not set appropriately
 on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we assist further, I would like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Since when are you facing the above issue? Did you make any recent changes to the computer?</span></li><li><span>Did you check if Date, Time and Region settings are set appropriately on the computer?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try connecting to Windows store after sometime and check if the issue is resolved, the issue might be due to sever down from our end. If the issue persists, check if the computer Time, Date &amp;
 Region settings are set appropriately. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Running the troubleshooter will help in detecting and identifying the issue and in certain cases will fix the same to enhance the performance of the system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Windows apps
 troubleshooter</span></strong></a><span>&nbsp;to check if the any of the app files and folders are missing or corrupted. Also run

 check for the corrupted/missing updates components on the computer. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In many cases, the
<strong>Windows Store</strong> and <strong>Windows Updates</strong> will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app or update and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, this tool can automatically identify
 and fix some problems with apps and the Store or updates.</span></p>

            I have not been able to download any updates in Windows Store since I upgraded to Windows 10 even though I have been notified that there are updates nor can I download apps from the store and each time receive the same error. The download attempts show

    <title>MS Ergonomic keyboard 4000 - Right shift&#47;X does not work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hunterdust  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Ergonomic keyboard 4000 - Right shift&#47;X does not work</h2>
                    I don't know how long this has been going on since capital X is not exactly a common letter needed but I noticed the other day that when I try pressing the left shift and x, nothing happens. Left shift + x works fine, but of course, you don't use the left
 shift when you are pressing the x key.<br />
<br />
I also just now noticed that NEITHER shift key works with the 0 key to get the right parentheses, which means I am unable to get that at all. The top right set of keys over the numpad also won't give me either parentheses or the =<br />
<br />
I have done all the troubleshooting steps. Changed USB ports, etc. Nothing works. The keyboard is just over a year old. IT HAS already started giving me some other issues. The space bar wasn't working well for awhile, and I noticed it was because how stupidly
 this keyboard is bade with the rubber button for the keyboard being all on its own. And on my keyboard, it has slipped off its pegs and had slid partly away from the circuit board and wasn't always making a connection. But I have no idea why a shift would
 work on every key but two. OR why one key would work fine normally, but not with either shift, as the 0 does.

<p>Hi hunterdust,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An unknown background program is possibly conflicting with the key input of your Microsoft keyboard. That being said, I will need more information about your Windows 10 device. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the issue isolated when using a specific program?</li><li>Are you experiencing the same issue when you connect the keyboard to a different computer?</li><li>To avoid repeats, can you tell me troubleshooting steps you have performed so far?</li><li>What is the current <strong>OS Build</strong> of your Windows 10 device? You can find this information by clicking the
About your PC</span>, press <span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span>, and then scroll down to
<p>
</p><p>For isolation of the input issue, I suggest performing a clean boot. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you use your computer. Follow
 the steps under the section: <em>How to perform a clean boot</em> &gt; <em>Windows 10</em> from this

            IT is happening with all programs. I don't have a second computer to try it out on. But I did do the reverse and other keyboards work fine on my computer. Including the wireless version of the MS Ergonomic keyboard...which has other keys giving issues
 so I can't use that...but the two problem keys are working OK on that one. So far, I have verified that all drivers are up to date, I've switched USB ports, literally trying all 10 I have. And I am using the April 2018 version of Windows, 17134

<p>Thank you for the quick response. Were you able to perform a clean boot? Can you tell me the results? I highly recommend performing a clean boot to determine if an unknown software is causing the input issue when using your wired Microsoft keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While waiting for your response, I suggest running the troubleshooter for hardware and devices while the Microsoft keyboard is connected. This diagnostic tool will scan and fix your computer for any issues detected with your device drivers. Make sure that
 you're signed in as the administrator to perform this operation.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Click the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span>
 button, go to </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Settings</span><span>

</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Hardware and Devices</span><span> under
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Find and fix other problems</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Run the troubleshooter</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>If prompted, click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Yes</span><span> or enter the administrator password.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure that the issue isn't due to a user profile, you can create a new user account and see if the same issue occurs. Check this article for the steps on how to

    <title>Windows &#40;10 and Server 2016&#41; having issues with static IPs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew_barzyk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows &#40;10 and Server 2016&#41; having issues with static IPs</h2>
                    <p>I have repeatedly encountered a strange behavior on both Windows 10 and Server 2016. On systems with a static IP, after a reboot, sometime the adapter comes up with a self-assigned IPv4 address (169.254.x.x). When you check the adapter's properties, the
 static is still set, but when you do an IPCONFIG, it is using the self-assigned address -- sometimes with the proper statically-assigned gateway.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix it I must either disable and re-enable the port or reboot the system. It happens randomly to servers and workstations with static IPs across all of our subnets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this happening to anyone else?</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue you've raised regarding computers getting a self-assigned IP address regardless if it's&nbsp; already configured for static IP address needs advance network troubleshooting which is beyond the scope of support of this community forum. I've searched

<p>un adaptateur wifi serai selon moi une solution mais 80 € quand meme ! sinon pensez vous que se serai reparable ?</p>

<p>Salut,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Il est possible que la carte réseau de la console soit grillée, c'est réparable via le SAV mais, si la console est hors garantie, je n'ai aucune idée du prix (je suppose que cela va chercher dans les 80 €).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>L'idéal serait de te faire prêter un adaptateur Wifi Xbox pour pouvoir confirmer le diag.</p>

<p>oui pour le clé ce n'est pas un problème de plus, l'iphone de mon pote arrive à se connecter en wifi donc il me semble impossible que ce soit un problème avec ma neufbox. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Est-ce qu'il est possible que l'origine de ce problème soit &nbsp;un paramètre effectuer à partir de la neufbox (par le biais d'un ordi) qui consisterais à refuser l'accès internet à certains accessoires que l'on peut connecter ?</p>

<p>Had the same problem last month with two other updates.&nbsp; I thought OneCare was supposed to do this without my help...why is this so difficult????&nbsp; Windows Update should not require so much of my time and energy.&nbsp; Are KB976884 (update for Microsoft Office
 Outlook 2007 Junk E-mail Filter)&nbsp;and KB976416 (Update for Microsoft Office Info Path 2007) really that necessary???&nbsp;</p>

<br />
For just two troublesome updates, why didn't you just manually download and install the same?<br />
<br />
That's the workaround for the Office updates that are causing error 646.<br />
<br />
If you want to spend some more time -<br />
<br />
<p>How do you fix the code 646?</p>
<p>Possibility: Windows Update agent file Wups2.dll is registered incorrectly and registry files that relate to the Wups2.dll file are missing.</p>
Method 1: Register the Windows Update files
<p>1. Click Start and then type notepad in the Start Search box. <br />
2. Click Notepad in the Programs list. <br />

REGSVR32 WUWEBV.DLL /S<br />
REGSVR32 JSCRIPT.DLL /S<br />
REGSVR32 MSXML3.DLL /S<br />
4. In Notepad, on the File menu, click Save As. <br />
5. In the Save as type list, click All Files. <br />
6. In the File name box, type register.bat.<br />

<h3> dragos mcraciun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 not starting after I upgraded bios on MSi B250M Bazooka&#33;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I upgraded my WD blue to an Samasung 850 Evo then a 960 Evo. I first cloned the Hard Disk to the SATA SSD &amp; it worked, then I cloned it to the M.2 NVME SSD &amp; it was starting from the SATA SSD. I had to format both the SATA SSD and Hard Disk to make
 it work on the M.2 NVME. I did that by going into Disk Management &amp; I had to get the drives hot swappable in the bios beforehand. I had my SATA data &amp; power cables off on both Hard Disk &amp; SSD. The NVME M.2 960 Evo worked I got the drives online &amp; I formatted
 them, otherwise it was booting of SATA drives instead of my NVME M.2 no matter how much I fiddled with it in the bios trying to set 960 Evo as the first drive to boot. I recently did a bios update to my MSi B250M&nbsp; Bazooka.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; All the drives were installed I did not think to get them offline while I was updating the bios. The only bootable one being 960 Evo M.2 NVME the other 2 formatted. I have looked for a way to do this my self but I didn't make much progress. I managed
 to reinstall Windows on the Sata 850 Evo.</p>
<p>My Computer is a CyberPowerPC ET8282-2162 Model C Series. I upgraded the processor to a i7 7700K from a i5 7400 &amp; changed the video card to a 1080 Ti. I tried to figure out a way of creating a system restore on the 850 Evo &amp; move the file to the 960 Evo
 because it does not see a system restore file created. I tried all the troubleshooting ways possible. I am currently trying to get Windows media creation tool &amp; run that off an USB see if that gives me any other options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to go to diskpart and listed the volumes &amp; see if I can copy the recovery or system to the 960 Evo NVME M.2 drive but I don't know if it will work or it will still tell me I have no recovery file saved. I should of had 1 when I upgraded to
 fall creators update but it's telling me I don't have one, I don't have other drives where I have Windows 10 clones because I deleted them if 960 Evo got corrupted somehow. Good thing is that I can still see the drive &amp; I haven't lost any files. I have steam
 games bitdefender installed &amp; I still have another 7 months or so out of the subscription. I am afraid with a new install it will see it as a new computer. Is there a way to port over the Apps installed on the 960 Evo to the 850 Evo &amp; then I can clone the
 960 Evo with the fresh install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I did the same thing on a CyberPowerPC ET8260-5322 I upgraded the CPU to a 1700X changed the ram to 3200 Mhz the videocard stayed the same 580 4Gb. I have the same 960 Evo &amp; Hard Disk in it &amp; I haven't have a problem with it. The Bios update on the
 AMD setup was fine while the Intel suffered. On the AMD I have like 15 days of Kaspersky so I wouldn't of had a problem reinstalling Windows on that anyway + other apps as usual, which will take a while to install. I'd rather not do that if I can.</p>
<p>Thank you for your Help!</p>

            Hi Dragos.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You would save time and be much better off to plug in the target hard drive and do the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Then save a System Image backup externally to use in place of future reinstalls in 20 minutes.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> sb.tiger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 Test Mode Water Mark Issue</h2>
                    <p class="contentCodeblock">I bought a new laptop and it came with 'Activated Win10 Home'. I upgraded to Win10 Pro using some kind of a demo/temp key. So I have been afflicted with this 'Test Mode' watermark now. I do not have the upgrade now logo in the
 bottom right corner - I only have the (very annoying) Test Mode watermark).</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">I tried disabling from the Admin cmd window using the (I am Administrator - I double checked that)</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><pre>bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING off</pre>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">I reboot it goes away but comes back again later (have tried many times). Also when I run the command I actually get an error:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">C:\Windows\system32&gt;bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING off<br />
<strong>An error has occurred setting the element data.</strong><br />
The value is protected by Secure Boot policy and cannot be modified or deleted.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">So How do I solve this problem- to get rid of the watermark, Or can I just use a OEM Pro key to upgrade (OEM keys seem to be much cheaper than the Retail keys).</p>

            <p>Don't buy any licenses from the amazon market place. You need to purchase a genuine Windows 10 Pro license, whether thats an OEM system builder license or retail license.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Purchasing the license and entering it is not a problem, this will validate your installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you buy the key and receive it, do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click <strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security
</strong>&gt;<strong> Activation</strong> &gt; <strong>Change the product key</strong> then enter the new product key then click

<h2>            Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I bought a new Dell Inspiron 15-7567, I set up the PC and while I was browsing through the internet, the screen went blue and said "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart." That message stayed on the screen for about a couple of seconds
 and then my computer restarted. The only program that I had manually installed was steam. After the first one, I thought that would be the end of the crashing. But it happened again, and it stayed for a bit longer time. I couldn't go through all of the message
 but it kept happening and now the message reads</p>
<p>Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you.</p>
<p>Stop code: DRIVER IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL</p>
<p>What failed: Netwtw04.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reset my computer today hoping that won't happen after that, but as soon as I saw the desktop on the screen, it said the same. It has happened so many times by now, and it happened twice while I was writing this post.</p>
<p>What should I do? Should I exchange this laptop?</p>

<h2>            Cortina answers me then I ask a question but doesn&#39;t respond to &#34;Hey Cortina&#34; on my Win 10 PC</h2>

<p>
</p><p>If set Cortina to respond at the Win+C keyboard prompt, the app does come up when they keys are pressed and what I say is heard, and heard correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet, if I say 'Hey Cortina' nothing happens.&nbsp; I have run through the troubleshooting and it reports hearing my voice, giving me a green "fixed" message when I read the sentence offered to test it. But it just doesn't respond to voice activation.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>After upgrading to W10 I only now have one option at logon for an account. Before the upgrade I had two. Unfortunately the one I want is not there. It still exists as a folder in the users folder as does the one option now available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent a lot of time looking through posts and tried the options. Most of the time the options suggested aren't there. Please help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Upgrade will not remove any of your user accounts on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, try to login to the available account and then try to visit the following location, and check if you are able to find a folder with t he missing user account name:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>C:\Users </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to find the folder, check if your data is available, if the data is available, create a new account and then transfer the data to your new account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know more about creating a new user account, refer to the below link:</p>

            I am replying to my own error report because it may be of help to others. I have solved this problem now but I am not sure why it worked today and not yesterday. It's possible it is because I did not follow the instructions correctly for running wmutil
 15.1 that clears a corrupted windows Mail database. When I first ran it, I did not delete the email account first. This time, I did, I ran the utility and set up the email account again. I had to edit many times to get the correct port numbers in with secure
 connection (SSL), but then it worked. &nbsp;

            Thanks for your reply. I tried your steps but I can't edit permissions in the security tab like in other files or dirs because I don't have permissions. I'm administrator. It only occurs in that drive after upgrade to Windows 10.

<p>FWIW, Scale and Layout were set to 250%, the "recommended" setting and the resolution was at the highest. In a way, it fixed it, I can now read the labels for the various settings...if I use a magnifying glass (see screenshot below.) Naturally, it's intolerable
 on 13" laptop display, and I've gone back to 250%.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, did you change the Scale and Layout, Resolution, or both? If you only changed the Scale and Layout, what is the percent option did you choose? If you chose 100%, have you checked if the issue will also on other percent options other than
 250%? You can also adjust the Resolution so that you can set it up to where you're most comfortable with. It seems that the Scale and Layout, and Resolution is affecting on how the document properties is being displayed. Kindly mix and match the Scale and
 Layout, and Resolution to resolve the issue.</p>

                    <p>Hi, My Surface Pro 4 used to let me know when it is low on power but now it doesn't. Instead, it just cuts out completely. Does anyone else have this problem or know how to fix it?</p>

<p>Hi Sammie,</p>

            I have tried all that, I even reset it back to the default but still I got no alert, It just when into hibernation. A while back I unchecked something in the registry to max performance but put it back. Apart from that I'm at a loss but it's really annoying
 when it cuts out with no warning.

<h2>            My laptop randomly disconnects me from the internet then freezes.</h2>
                    I use a Dell Inspiron 1415.<br />
This has only started happening the other day when my girlfriend said it BSoD'd (I wasn't in the room)<br />
Since, it hasn't BSoD'd, but the problem keeps happening. I've tried waiting for the system to respond, and it doesn't seem it wants to.<br />
I've done a system restore, scanned with AVG, installed all recommended updates and still, it happens.<br />
<br />
What happens:<br />
Sometimes when I turn it on, it gets as far as getting past the login screen, right in between loading the desktop and the 'Welcome' screen disappearing.<br />
When it does this, I power it off and restart, then sometimes it lets me on and I can do everything I need to do, but after a while (can be minutes or hours), it disconnects me from the internet (my router is fine, all my other laptops can connect). It says
 the connections are still in range, but I can't connect. When I run the diagnostics tool, it says to make sure I'm in range of the router (which I am).<br />
About 5 minutes after this happens, it freezes in the same manner of which happens as mentioned previously after the login screen.<br />
If a tone is playing, like the login tune, it just stops where it is and buzzes that part of the tune. I can't move the cursor, no keys work, the only thing available to do is to restart.<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading this, any help will be appreciated.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Nvidia Driver</h2>
                    <p>My NVIDIA GeForce Experience told me to update to Windows 10 driver, which I did, I have never had problems before. Now my laptop is no longer registering my graphics card, and trying to use integrated graphics.
</p>
<p>This means I cannot do anything more challenging than wordprocessing and using the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried rolling back the driver but that did nothing and I can't install old driver from the website because it doesn't recognise Windows 10. Please help, I don't want to have to rollback to Windows 8.1 but might have to.</p>

<p>This was the first thing I tried. </p>
<p>The driver that is installed is the driver from the website for windows 10 but it makes my computer forget it has a graphics card.
</p>
<p>The most previous driver, which I was using before and which&nbsp;worked perfectly,&nbsp;I have also downloaded from the website, but it cannot be installed since I have upgraded to windows 10,&nbsp;because it does not recognise windows 10 as an OS that it can install
 to.</p>

<h3> i solid cobra i  say:</h3>
<h2>            xbox one profile and achievements not appearing</h2>
                    
<p>My console is a Xbox One and the problem I'm experiencing is for the past 2 months my profile picture doesn't show in the upper left hand corner and none of the achievements I have unlocked in the games I've played since then are still appearing as locked.
 &nbsp;The reason I know that they should be unlocked is that they show up on the game websites. &nbsp;(ex. &nbsp;The Division achievements show up on the Ubisoft site but not in my Xbox achievements.) &nbsp;As of 3 weeks ago the upper left hand corner&nbsp;says sign in instead with
 the blank gamer pic. &nbsp;However, I am still able to play games like The Division, Neverwinter, and Fallout 4 using my profile even though it says to sign in in the upper left corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far I have tried the following to fix this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have deleted and re-added my account. </li><li>I have tried<span> clearing the cache</span>&nbsp;hard reseting
</li><li>I have tried deleting and re-adding almost all of the games I have installed on my Xbox One. &nbsp;(Still have 3 more to go)
</li></ul>
<p>The above attempts have had no effect.</p>
<p>If there is something that I can do to fix this then please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

Show, hide, or resize desktop icons
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The icons on the desktop give you quick access to shortcuts. You can show them, or hide them if you prefer a clean desktop. You can also resize them</p>
<p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Right-click the desktop, point to <span>View</span>, and then click <span>Show Desktop Icons</span>.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Do System Restore in Safe Mode, if unable to do it in Normal Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />
<br />
Click Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; pick a different time &gt; Next &gt; etc</span></p>
