<h2>            Windows auto-locks after 10 minutes of inactivity.</h2>
                    Can anyone help me solve this problem? Windows Vista sends me back the the login screen after 10 minutes of inactivity, which gets annoying when it happens 5-10 times per day. First of all, it's NOT related to the screensaver, I have the "On resume, display
 login" unchecked, as well as my screensaver is disabled. It is also not related to the sleep option in the Advanced Power Settings, I have my computer set to never sleep. Vista is not Sleeping, Hibernating ot Logging Off, it's Locking. Basically it's just
 sending me back the login screen after 10 minutes of inactivity, and when I log back in all my stuff is still there. Any webpages or applications I had open are all still there, but it's still a pain in the the ____ because if I have any programs set to run
 automatically (like virus scans etc.) in the middle of the night, the programs won't start up if the system is locked.<br />
<br />
I searched online for quite a while and couldn't find any help. It seems like anyone else who has this problem just gets told to check their screensaver and power settings but this problem is unrelated to those.

            <div>Hi, I wanted to give my solution to this problem because the above didn't quite solve it for me. I hope this helps some poor soul with their laptops burning their chests, silencing everything in the house, forgoing crunchy snacks... even turning on the
 CC.<br />
<br />
The First thing you should do is check all your levels - this includes your TV/amp (if your PC is connected to such devices, you should check these first). You've probably done that, but here's 3 quick steps to check off in the PC before I get to mysolution:<br />
<br />
1. There is a Volume control located on the Netflix video itself. Click on it - turn it up.<br />
<br />
2. Go to the task bar, near the clock, and find a similar icon. Right click on that and select 'Open Volume Mixer'. Make sure all of the slide bars are all the way up.
<br />
<br />
3. If the Icon is not there for whatever reason, left click to open the start button and type 'volume' and hit enter. This will open the option to display the icon on the task bar, then go back and do #2.<br />
<br />
Now that we know your volume levels are all up, lets try the solution that worked for me:<br />
<br />
1. Right click again on the speaker icon, this time select 'Playback Devices'.<br />
<br />
2. Click your default device, aka what your playing the sound through, then click on 'Properties'.<br />
<br />
3. Select the 'Enhancements' tab and make sure you check 'Loudness Equalization', just as&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c12ea602-0a15-428e-949e-98641c0f71d5">Sandeep Ghatuary</a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;has
 suggested.</span><br />
<br />
4. From the list of options also check 'Equalizer' or 'Enable Sound Equalizer'. Then click on 'More Settings'.&nbsp;This should bring up a bunch of slide bars. move them all to the top, but don't close the menu.<br />
<br />
5. Play your Netflix video - be careful it may be very loud. I recommend for the sake of your speakers and nerves you turn the volume in Netflix down a third or so. From here, adjust the sliders in the Equalizer and in the Netflix video itself to find a good
 level. It may prove that having all those at their max settings works best for you, but be cautious.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Enjoy the show.<br />
<br />
---<br />
TIP<br />
---<br />
<br />
You may notice that since this affects all sounds coming our of your playback device/speakers other things are abnormally loud. You'll have to go back into the settings and uncheck 'Equalizer' - this will re-enable the default levels. Go back and recheck the
 setting whenever you need a volume boost.</div>

            Nvidia - ATI. Both equal, but different. <br />
Regular AA does not work with GTA4 and GTA4 <span style="font-style: italic">needs</span> anti-aliasing, so<br />
for GTA4 I prefer Nvidia's&nbsp; FXAA (a new type of anti-aliasing) to the ATI alternative.
<br />
<br />
Read reviews for the cards in your budget. The two below should do med/high settings with GTA4 -<br />
( 120 GBP = about 180 AUD atm).<br />

 I believe the GTX650ti is about equal to my GTX560ti which comes close to running<br />
GTA4 on max settings.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=193_1343&amp;products_id=19729" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ATI HD7770</a>&nbsp; 1GB<br />

<br />
I am showing Gigabyte because Gigabyte are one of the mfg's with good - quiet, coolers.
<br />
I have both ATI and Nvidia Gigabyte cards atm.<br />
As you are running a dual core cpu and only 2GB RAM I think a 1GB VRAM graphics card will
<br />
be adequate. The rest of the system is not likely to make good use of 2GB VRAM.<br />
<br />
-First you have to verify the machine has an adequate power supply for the card you choose.<br />
OEM mfg's ( Acer. DELL, etc) always use a minimum power supply for the original configuration of<br />
the machine.<br />
The GTX 650 and 650ti both require a 400W minimum power supply - A good quality psu is necessary<br />
with gaming machines as the system gets stressed a lot.<br />
The ATI HD 7770 and HD 7850 require a 450W psu.<br />
<br />
Then comes the possibility that ACER has done something with their motherboard and drivers to
<br />
make upgrading graphics with a non-ACER product problematic.<br />
You need to get confirmation from ACER to verify that you can add a PCIe graphics card from another<br />
mfg.<br />
<br />

                    Since upgrading yesterday, I am unable to make a video call lasting more than a few&nbsp;seconds, when an orange circle whizzes round. I had 3 minutes with my previous Skype version. I have Windows 7. Can this be rectified please? Thank you in anticipation.

            Step 1: Removing the driver/software.
<br />
<br />To remove the driver and software go to start and type “control” this should be enough to come up with the Control Panel. Now go to “programs and Features” And delete the “MFL pro suite”
<br />
<br />Step 2: Download the driver.
<br />
<br />go to <a href="http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public/Model_list.aspx?reg=us&amp;c=us&amp;lang=en&amp;titleid=35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public...</a> and search for your model. When you found your model download the ”  Full Driver &amp; Software Package”
<br />
<br />Step 3: Installing the driver.
<br />
<br />After your download is complete just follow the steps on your screen. not really an explanation worth. if everything goes well your printer should again be fully functioning.
<br />
<br />To see if your product is supported in windows 8.1 look here: <a href="http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/os/windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public...</a>

<br />          
<br />Check with Brother Support, their on-line documentation, and drivers. As OEM Brother is responsible for the proper operation of both the printer/scanner and their supplied drivers.
<br />
<br />Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.

            To expand on Andre's suggestion, go into Update History to see if you can identify any updates that were installed around the time the problem started.
<br />
<br />Google for their KB numbers to see if there are any reported similar or known issues with them
<br />
<br />Uninstall them one at a time to see if any of them are causing the problem. Restart the computer after each update uninstall (just to be sure).

<br />Windows Updates work flawlessly every time and never cause problems, right? Unfortunately, no. Despite all of the testing that goes into updates that are eventually pushed out to Microsoft’s public update infrastructure, some updates occasionally break things and have to be uninstalled until an updated version can be made available. When an update breaks something, what do you do?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel -
<br />
Device Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver - then
<br />
Right Click on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
Another method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode) is
<br />
to CTRL + ALT + DEL and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe . Safe Mode is reached<br />
by repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up.<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.<br />
<br />
<span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a</span><br />
<br />
Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss basis.<br />
That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just adds to the<br />
difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect. You can try a
<br />
google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these cover a wide<br />
field of efforts.<br />
<br />
Here is a video of one fix.<br />
<br />

</span><br />
Here is another fix<br />
<span>http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2008/12/the_mysterious_black_screen_of.php</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Do you have a Vista Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the disks your
<br />
system maker will sell them cheap. Or try from Safe Mode if you can get there.<br />
<br />
How to Do a System Restore in Vista<br />
<span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76905-system-restore-how.html</span><br />
<br />
You can create a Recovery Disk or use someone else same version (to do the System Restore it
<br />
only has to be bootable).<br />
<br />
How to Create a Vista Recovery Disc<br />
<span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/141820-create-recovery-disc.html</span><br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
These require the correct Vista Disks since you can't boot to Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair -<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />
<span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span><br />

<br />
Here&nbsp;are&nbsp;Google searches where several have found different solutions :<br />
<br />

-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.<br />
<br />
You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data)&nbsp;or a repair installation
<br />
(hopefully saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or
<br />
three.<br />
<br />
You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own
<br />
Product Key.<br />
<br />
In-Place Upgrade<br />
<span>http://vistasupport.mvps.org/repair_a_vista_installation_using_the_upgrade_option_of_the_vista_dvd.htm</span><br />
<br />
<br />
If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have to
<br />
reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions. You will<br />
need to know your Product Code.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />
<span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span><br />

<span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span><br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Vista boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - <strong>
do not type <br />
parenthesis or BOLD</strong>)<br />
<br />
c:<br />
<br />
cd\<br />
<br />
cd c:\Windows\System32\winevt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(there is a space between cd and C: )<br />
</strong><br />
ren Logs&nbsp;LogsOLD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(there are spaces between&nbsp;ren&nbsp;and Logs and&nbsp;Logsold)</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
REBOOT to Windows<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

    <title>Larger Battles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simpsonater x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Larger Battles</h2>
                    
<p>Why are most game modes limited to 12 people? I only play ground war since there is an extra 6 people playing. When a game is 6 on 6, there is always a person on each team dropping in and out and 1-2 people sniping or hiding in a bush or spinning in circles,
 basically not playing. A lot of games end up 3-3 or 4-4 by the end. CoD 3 allowed 24 players in a match. That game came out 4 years ago. Has the technology somehow regressed - i doubt it!</p>
<p>Anyone else want larger battles?</p>

<p>The technology hasnt "degressed" (sp?), but has gotten WAY better and so much is included on a disc, that the CONSOLE is &nbsp;maxed out and is pushing the threshold of its limitations, especially on CODs and 60fps games. Why did the Xbox console come with so

<h2>            Kindle app</h2>
                    Why can I not find the Kindle app in the app store? My tablet has Windows 8 on it. Until 2 days ago I had the Kindle app installed and it was accidentally uninstalled. I live in the United States and this has never been a problem before. This is very frustrating
 as I had slot of books downloaded to the app and now I don't have access to them. Any help would be appreciated.

            Kindle is owned by Amazon. You will have to find the Kindle app via Amazon since Microsoft does not won it, they did not put it in their store.

            Yes, I would think you would get interference since both devices run at a Frequency band of 2.4Ghz and have a Wireless range of 15 meters
<br />
<br />The frequency channel cannot be changed on that model, so there would be no way around this  . . .

Thanks for your answer. The solution is then buy a wired keyboard and mouse.

<p>
</p><p>Okay, i was thinking that the logitech keyboard has the same problem, they work also in the 2.4 gHz range, my first search was this set: Wireless Combo MK520.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But i can't find how to change the channels.</p>

            It is about my rights. If I log on as Administrator no errors occurs, but if I use my usual account
<span>which </span>has administrator rights all the errors occur. I can delete my account and create a new but have to recreate the database in Lightroom. Sigh!

            <p>No... the Firewire connection is required to transfer the video. For mini-DV cameras that have a USB connection, it is only for downloading photos, so you must use the Firewire (IEEE1394 connector and corresponding cable).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firewire (IEEE1394) PCI cards with several Firewireports are relatively cheap and easy to install.&nbsp; Here's an
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16815265002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">example of such a card</a> for a desktop. Be sure to also get a matching cable (either 6-pin to 4-pin, or 4-pin to 4-pin, depending on the port(s) on the card.)</p>

Press Windows button. Search for regedit. Open it</p>

<p>These kinds of issues WERE present on 8.1 for months but they mostly all cleared after several driver updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that particular router is not one known to exhibit slow wifi. I'm suggesting you trade it because it is SP new and you can now get one with 10 pre-installed and not have to go through an upgrade AND because you have this issue. Getting it swapped will
 rule out a hardware issue and would be a step forward. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what *I* would do if in this situation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it's worth - Microsoft needs to fix the driver and any underlying Win 10 OS issues. It took them 9 months to get a "good" Windows 8.1 wireless driver. For now, consider an external USB wireless adapter. I carry around a

<p>So far i haven't been able to find a solution to this.</p>

<h3> bbprthead  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP PSC 2510 Printer Driver for Network for Windows 7</h2>
                    I am currently running Windows 7 32-bit Pro, and I cannot get the Full Network Feature Software for a HP PSC Photosmart 2510 to install.&nbsp; The weird thing is that if I plug in the Printer directly to my Laptop via USB, Windows 7 recognizes it, installs
 all drivers, and all the features work.&nbsp; However, my printer is a Networked Printer and is connected to my Router.&nbsp; Plus this is a Laptop, so plugging in my printer to the laptop is not going to work.&nbsp; I have tried installing the Printer that way, and then
 going in and changing the Port for that Printer to a IP one, and that works but only for printing, not for scanning, faxing, etc.
<br />
<br />
HP has not released the Network Software for Windows 7 yet, so has anyone been able to get this to install on Windows 7?&nbsp; I have tried a Run this program in Compatibility mode but that did not work.&nbsp; Anyone got any ideas?<br />
<br />
Or will Windows 7 eventually be able to recognize this printer via the Network Connection as opposed to the USB?&nbsp; PLEASE.
<br />
<br />
BTW - this is the ONLY issue I have with Windows 7 everything else "just works".

<p><span><span>You will need to wait until the HP releases the driver for Windows 7 as all features would only work
 if the printer driver is installed on the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Contact the printer manufacturer to know if it’s Windows 7 compatible and driver availability.</span></span></p>
