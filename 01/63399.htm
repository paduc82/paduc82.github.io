<h2>            Problems creating a system repair disk - 1. says finished but drive still clicking&#59; 2. desktop.ini waiting but not written</h2>
                    <p>Made a W7 System repair disk, just in case original disk unusable. Started from the standard inquiry after making a system image (using Windows, rather than my proprietary back-up program, and which finished successfully), and process went smoothly. However
 after Windows reported that the repair disk had been created successfully, I clicked "Finish" (or "Close" or whatever it was), and opened the disk to check what was there.&nbsp; Two problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The disk does not just sit there, but clicks furiously and the lights flash for this drive and for my hard disk drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The list of what is currently onthe disk is: </p>
<p>
</p><p>boot - filefolder (with 3 files: bcd 256KB, boot.sdi&nbsp; 3,096KB and bootfix.bin 1KB))</p>
<p>sources - file folder (1 file: boot.wim&nbsp; 142,948KB)</p>
<p>bootmgr - file 375KB</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLUS - a note saying: </p>
<p>Files Ready to Be Written to the Disc (1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>desktop.ini modified 12apr12 configuration settings&nbsp; 1KB</p>
<p>
</p><p>- the contents of this is, as you would expect:<br />
[.ShellClassInfo]<br />
LocalizedResourceName=@%SystemRoot%\system32\shell32.dll,-21815<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover every time I click on something on this new disk, the Explorer searchbar takes ages to check what's there and fill up - and the search bar in the Computer frame which I also have open also fills up once theDVD RW Drive bar has filled - and only
 after both have finished and several minutes does the folder open or the display go back to the previous display (if I have clicked the back arrow at top left)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on please ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps, while waiting, I just clicked on Control Panel - Backup &amp; Restore, to receive the response: X an internal error has occurred. The paramter is incorrect (0x80070057) - so presumably the virtual memory is still being hogged by the image I created
 earlier or by this damned repair disk - still clicking 40 minutes later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can tell me what Windows is or I am doing wrong, I would be most grateful - Andrew Duncan-Jones</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background: W7 Ultimate on Asus M4N78-AM with nVidia GeForce 8200, AMD Phenom ll x4 810, 4096 MB ram, 2x ST3320418AS (2x 320GB). Bit behind-hand on Windows updates - normally do as go, but for various reasons had not used this machine for a while (and update
 error codes are another kettle of offal, but I won't go into that here)</p>

<div><span><br />
Startup Repair 
</span>
<div>Startup Repair automatically fixes certain problems, such as <br />
missing or damaged system files, that might prevent Windows from starting <br />
correctly. Startup Repair can only fix certain problems, such as missing or <br />
damaged system files. It cannot fix hardware failures, such as a failing hard <br />
disk or incompatible memory, and it does not protect against virus attacks. </div>
<div>If a startup problem is detected, Startup Repair starts <br />
automatically and tries to fix the problem. If the problem is severe enough that <br />
Startup Repair does not start on its own, run Startup Repair by using the system <br />
repair disc.</div>
<div>To run Startup Repair, click <strong>Startup Repair</strong> . If problems
<br />
are found, Windows fixes them automatically. Your computer might restart several <br />
times during the process. This process might take several minutes. </div>
<div><span><br />
System Restore 
</span>
<div>System Restore restores system files to an earlier point in time
<br />
without affecting your personal files, such as e‑mail, documents, or photos. </div>
<div>If you use System Restore from the System Recovery Options menu,
<br />
you cannot undo the restore operation. However, you can run System Restore again <br />
and choose a different restore point, if one exists. </div>
<div>For help with System Restore, see the HP support document, 
Restoring <br />
Windows to a Previous Point (Windows 7) .</div>
<div><span><br />
System Image Recovery 
</span>
<div>A system image is a personalized backup of the partition that
<br />
contains Windows, and includes programs and personal data, like documents, <br />
pictures, and music. System Image Recovery replaces all data on a drive <br />
partition with another image of the drive partition. You must have created a <br />
system image beforehand to use this option.</div>
<div>For help <br />
with System Image Recovery, see the HP support document, 
Creating and <br />
Using a System Image to Restore Your Computer .</div>
<div><span><br />
Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool 
</span>
<div>Use the Memory Diagnostic tool to scan the computer memory for
<br />
errors. You can choose to run the test immediately or wait and run the test the <br />
next time that Windows starts. If you choose to restart your computer and run <br />
the test immediately, make sure to save your work and close all running <br />
programs. It might take several minutes for the test to finish checking the <br />
computer memory. When the test is completed, Windows restarts <br />
automatically.</div>
<div>If you have recently installed memory, make sure that the new
<br />
memory type matches the memory requirements for your motherboard. If the memory <br />
matches the memory requirements for the motherboard or the memory was previously <br />
working correctly and the test fails, use the following steps:</div>
<div><br />
<ol>
<li>
<div>Remove a memory module and then reinsert the memory <br />
into the socket to see if a connection was the problem. </div>
</li><li>
<div>Remove each memory module, and replace the one that <br />
was previously removed.</div>
</li><li>
<div>After removing and reseating the DIMMS, run the <br />
memory diagnostic again. </div>
</li><li>
<div>If the test fails again, replace the bad memory. </div>
</li></ol>
<div>For help <br />
replacing memory, see 
HP Desktop PCs <br />
- Upgrading Memory (RAM) or 
HP Notebook <br />
PCs - Upgrading Memory (RAM) .</div>
<div><span><br />
Command Prompt 
</span>
<div>Advanced consumers can use the Command Prompt in a WinRE <br />
environment to enter command lines for diagnosing and troubleshooting problems. <br />
Click <strong>Command Prompt</strong> to open a command prompt window. There are many
<br />
command lines that can be entered. Make sure you fully understand the command <br />
and the risks before typing the command. For a list of available commands and <br />
their descriptions, type <span>help</span> at the command <br />
prompt.</div>
<div><span><br />
Recovery Manager
</span>
<div>With HP Recovery Manager, you can reinstall software programs
<br />
and hardware drivers that were originally installed on the computer at the <br />
factory. </div>
<div>
<p>For help <br />
with System Image Recovery, see the HP support document,

            <p>When you say "clicking" in conjunction with the drive failing to make forward progress, that sounds ominous to me. Have you tried to run a hardware diagnostic test on that hard disk drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is a Seagate drive...no? Please run a drive stress test, using Seatools for windows. Before you do, see if you can back&nbsp; your important file, i.e pictures etc, to an external drive.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I may not have made it clear that it is the CD drive, where the repair CD I have just created is sitting, that is doing this clicking - and in fact clearly not finishing although Windows claims to have completed making the repair disk. Trying other CDs in
 that drive shows no problems. Thanks, though.<br />

</p><p>Note: Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.

            <p>Thank you, Ratandeep, for a germane response. Unfortunately the decimal point is already coded as that, a dot : '.', on my pc, so that cannot be the issue as far as the error code is concerned.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In general I would note that my post seems to have been badly phrased, since the first two attempts to answer, though kindly meant, were off the point (in response to xcheing009, however, I would note that there are at least two other perfectly "correct"
 ways of creating a repair disk, through executing recdisc or through the Maintenance program; and the author seems to be seriously confused between a repair disc and a system image). Perhaps I might rephrase the points which are concerning me - and the Microsoft
 error code, I suspect, is probably not very relevant. (I have rarely had any joy in trying to pursue error codes as a way of removing problems: better, I have found, to look at the overall system.)<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. What files are supposed to be on the Repair Disc ? In other words, are the files I listed in the initial presentation of this post the correct ones ? And why does it say that desktop.ini is waiting to be written to the disk ? (Does it mean that it is
 ready to be written to the hard disk when one is doing a repair, for instance ?)&nbsp; Is there a hash code tocheck that the files have downloaded correctly or does one&nbsp; have to suck it and see ?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Why does my DVD drive go on clicking after the Repair Disk has been created ? This is not its usual behaviour when I burn a disk.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks to anyone who can help, adj<br />

</p><p>Do you have Windows 7 installation disk?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try these steps to create repair disk and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Boot the system by inserting Windows 7 installation disc.</p>
<p>b. When it gets to the main setup window, click on Repair from the lower left corner.</p>
<p>c. Select Command Prompt from the main Repair menu. </p>
<p>d. At the command prompt, type recdisc and then press Enter.</p>
<p>e. You'll get the popup to choose which drive letter to create the Recovery disc to.</p>
<p>f. Have a clean DVD in the DVD drive and select start.</p>

<p><span>Screen resolution refers to the clarity of the text and images on your screen. At higher resolutions, items appear sharper. They also appear smaller, so more items fit

            Hi philky144
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

                    <p>Greetings All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just upgraded to Windows 10 Pro ver. 1703 (Creators Edition). I noticed that under MSCONFIG that the default setting under the General Tab is set to Select Start Up. When I attempt to choose the Normal Start Up radio button, Apply is greyed out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would Microsoft tell me the logical reasoning behind this change???</p>

<p>Hi Jonathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here's are some methods we can do to resolve the issue. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Boot your PC in safe mode.</strong></p>
<p>There can be settings or drivers causing the issue. You can eliminate this by starting up in safe mode. Follow this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> for instructions. In the safe mode environment, check if you can change to Normal start up in the MSConfig.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Make sure that your account is an Administrator.</strong></p>
<p>The issue can also be because of the current account you're logged in to is not an Admin. You can check this information by following these instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + I</strong> on your keyboard, then click <strong>Accounts</strong>.</li><li>Check if you have Administrator under your account name.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Create another local Admin account.</strong></p>
<p>It may be possible that your current user account got corrupted. Create another local Admin account by following this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/5de907f1-f8ba-4fd9-a89d-efd23fee918c/create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your updates.</p>
        </p>

</p><p>Let's mark the post accordingly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we get a screenshot of what it looks like? We tried it in one of our computers here and found out that double-clicking the
<strong>Load system services </strong>box will bring the bullet to <strong>Normal startup</strong>. Give it a try. We include the screenshot below. If the issue persists, let's see if the issue reoccurs on a different user.</p>

<p>Netflix is crashing my One. Sometimes it's after watching for a while and sometimes it's a few seconds after starting a video. The images freezes but the audio continues for a moment before distortion sets in then cuts off entirely. The screen goes black
 then the Xbox shuts down. Even the power pack turns off. This has happened multiple times now.</p>

<p>Having the same issue with a friends consol here. Swapped out for a new one at game stop and the problem persists. Netflix usually but sometimes other games and apps randomly shutdown the console with no warning or a generic "something went wrong" message
 from netflix.</p>

<p>I also am having this problem as first posters explains to a tee. Netflix plays for a few seconds, image freezes, audio continues and then distorts &gt; crash. I also noticed skipping during gameplay as well. I never had this problem before the most recent
 updates between xb1 and netflix. If someone could please address this, that would be awesome so I dont have to send in my whole system.</p>

<p>Having this very same problem. Very aggravating and *** off. It has been a common issue or Netflix errors since I got The Xbox one. Seems like Microsoft just can't get a console to be reliable. I used to have a 360 got the ring of death twice and gave up
 and got a ps3 bad no problems with PlayStation. Decided to give Microsoft another chance thinking they would get it right this time. Now I'm dealing with my Xbox one shutting down unexpectedly every time I try to watch Netflix within 5 min same goes with NFL
 network. This problem needs to be addressed asap! Seems every month there is a new update for the console there is different problem that persists. Now if this continues I have to send it in to have it looked at by Microsoft and wait a long time to receive
 my system back. Already called about this problem last month. Obviously didn't get fixed. Might be that time to spread the news to everyone thinking about getting the one. Even though I don't like the ps4 controllers at all I might have to ditch theXbox one
 and get the ps4</p>

<p>Like I said in my statement above I was having trouble with Netflix along with NFL app on my Xbox one. Well it was also my Blu Ray app that had this problem so I called Microsoft support and they suggested that I take it to a Microsoft store and it just
 so happens I had one near by. Made an appointment took it in and they just gave me a brand new Xbox one! I couldn't believe it. The manufacturer warranty is one year from the previous date that you bought it. I am totally satisfied that I got a brand new Xbox
 one seems like Microsoft is serious about making their customers satisfied this time around and is sure that their system is reliable. I have zero problems with this new system. I suggest you guys do the same because when I told support and people in the Microsoft
 store no one heard of this issue, go figure I get a defective system just my luck. Take it in to the Microsoft story your problems will get resolved a lot faster then sending your system and waiting 3 weeks. Thank you Microsoft for taking us seriously and
 actually caring about gamers this year. Especially for not having to pay to use Netflix with gold and adding free monthly games about time. Satisfied customer</p>

    <title>xbox one controller jammed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robrulesall2  say:</h3>
<h2>            xbox one controller jammed</h2>
                    
<p>I bought my titanfall edition controller when it came out (so the 15-day&nbsp;warranty has been expired) and now it is giving me issues. when it comes to my controller, the left trigger seems like it is jammed? I am not exactly sure but the left trigger is not
 responding completely when I move it upwards and sometimes when I move it upwards, even though I am no longer moving the left stick, the character (in game) is stuck moving forward. anyone know how to fix this issue? any recommendations would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I have had this similar problem. Have you updated your controller to the latest firmware with the april system update? When this happened with me I would have to remove my batteries and restart the controller to fix the issue. Since the latest firmware has
 been released I have not had this problem.</p>

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>Building on Andre's post, you should try out VLC media player. It is a highly trusted free software that many users use since it has a wide variety format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give it a try and its free as well, simply google VLC media player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            locked out of computer</h2>
                    I am currently locked out of the main household computer.yesterday my mother took a rag and cleaned the keyboard of the household computer while the computer was still on. somehow she changed the password and now we can't get in. I've tried using a password
 reset program &amp; ophcrack but ran into probelms with that. can a password reset program work if it's gotten from another computer with the same OS(windows vista)? any suggestions on a program to get the password back? whenever someone enters the old password
 it says that password isn't right but when I go to boot setup and put a password for the computer to start up with that seems to work fine as well so we came the conculsion that the password had to be changed. theres only 1 admin account and we can't access
 it cause it says the password that we enter is wrong.&nbsp; <br />

You create the Password reset disk when you create your Password on THAT computer, NOT on a different Computer.<br />

<p>Hiya!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from the Xbox Forums Team here to assist with the issue, it looks like you're trying to play GTA IV on PC but you're experiencing an error when launching it. What I recommend doing is making sure all your drivers on the PC are up to date. As well please
 make sure you're signed into the correct Microsoft account. Once all that is complete the game should work. If you are still experiencing trouble with the game after troubleshooting please feel free to let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Gaming!</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*UPDATE*: I figured out the problem. I had a corrupt hard drive. I was able to fix this by running the "CHKDSK /f /r /x" command on the command prompt. Thank you for helping!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Before I explain my current problem, here's some information about an earlier situation that most likely has something to do with the blue screen : A few hours before the error appeared, I attempted to attach second hard drive (a 1000GB Seagate) to the CPU
 tower. However upon booting the computer, it had displayed something like "error (hexadecimal number) applying update (number) of (number)" I don't remember the exact details of it. I removed the drive and it booted normally. However, I later reset the computer
 and this screen appeared. <span>I've tried booting into WindowsRE, but it brings me to the Auto Repair bootup (the one that asks for your keyboard layout before starting), and about half the options didn't work and the other half didn't help. I</span>&nbsp;haven't
 seen another person post about my situation specifically.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi 1DMC1
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />How to Boot from a USB Flash Drive in Windows 10 - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<h3> levi bullen  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Audio Output Device is installed</h2>
                    This audio problem started 48 hours ago, the bug has changed over and over and currently this is the current problem. I've followed 2 different troubleshooting guides one for drivers and one for stopping and restarting the windows audio service. The error
 is 1052 when I try to stop the windows audio endpoint builder and the windows audio gets stuck at "starting" and won't start, restart, stop, or pause. I've done everything I can, please help. I have no sound coming from my HP Envy laptop and am using windows
 10.

            Hi Levi.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />1) For sound problems first try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows 10 -- Connected to WiFi but No Internet...</h2>
                    <p>I now have two machines that can connect to the Wi-Fi, but no browsers can connect to the Internet. I have tried both cold and warm reboots. I have other machines&nbsp;that are working fine! I highly doubt it's the router. I know the Internet connection is working
 since the other machines are working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do the ipconfig/all I do have an IP address but the Media State&nbsp;shows as 'Media disconnected'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine I am more concerned about is an HP Pavilion. I tried Edge, Chrome and FireFox; none can connect to any sites. From a command prompt all pings and tracerts fail.

<p>
</p><p>Couple of thoughts.&nbsp; You mentioned it is getting an IP address - is it in the DHCP range expected for your router?&nbsp; Also, you mentioned you have tried pings - have you just tried a URL or an IP as well?&nbsp; Eg: 8.8.8.8 or www.google.com.&nbsp; Have you tried to
 flush the DNS cache as well (<code>ipconfig /flushdns)?</code></p>
