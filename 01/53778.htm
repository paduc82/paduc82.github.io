 the problem started while trying to install applications, the applications were installed incompletely or partly installed, so I decided to take ownership of the whole drive "C:". I think this occurred because of Sharing rules, anyway I took ownership of the
 entire drive except some sys files such as: hiberfil.sys etc. Before doing this the whole operating system was working properly but after doing so, my above mentioned problems solved, but after that, my lock screen image has gone "Blue"! and I guessed that
 ownership causes the problem, so I tried so many solutions, including reinstalling a fresh copy of windows or trying to change lock screen through&nbsp;registry&nbsp;editor</span></span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">, but nothing changed&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.eightforums.com%2fimages%2fsmilies%2f010.png" /><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">.

<p>That looks very much like a 'translucent selection rectangle' - which is the correct terminology. It shows you that the icon has been selected for whatever command you want to apply to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if you were to press the Delete key, the icon would be deleted. If you were to press F2, you could rename the icon. To remove the translucent selection rectangle,
<strong>just click on any unoccupied place on your desktop.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To create a translucent selection rectangle, click your left mouse button on an unoccupied place on your desktop and hold the button down; now drag the mouse and you'll see the rectangle form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A translucent selection rectangle is handy when you want to apply the same action to several icons on your desktop as a group. For example, say you want to move a group of icons from the left side of your monitor to the right side: Just enclose them all
 in a translucent selection triangle so they're all selected. Now you can drag any one of the icons and they'll all move together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it's hard to see the rectangle, especially if the image on your monitor is a light color. You can select a whole bunch of icons and not even realize it! That's why Windows lets you make the rectangle darker, so it will be easier to see. Here's
 how to do that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel &gt; System &gt; Advanced system settings &gt; enter the Administators password &gt; Advanced tab &gt; Performance settings button &gt; Visual effects &gt; Show translucent selection rectangle</p>

            Hi,
<br />Method 1 – Use the TAB Key
<br />This seems to work fairly well. Just press the Tab key once or a couple of times and the dotted line will go away. You should be able to select the icon again with your mouse and it should not show the dotted border.
<br />
<br />Method 2 – Refresh the Dekstop
<br />If you right-click on the Desktop, you’ll see an option called Refresh. Click on that and the dotted line will go away.
<br />
<br />refresh desktop
<br />
<br />Method 3 – Double-click to Open
<br />One thing that worked for me was just double-clicking the icon on the desktop and opening the app/file or whatever. Once you go back to the desktop, it goes back to the box with the color fill instead of the dotted line.
<br />
<br />Method 4 – Change Icon Size
<br />Apparently, changing the icon size from one size back to the normal size also fixes the issue. You can right-click, choose View and then change it to Large, for example and then back to Medium.

            <p>Hi Gails,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with automatic restarts on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only time windows will reboot by design is if a windows update had been install that needs a reboot.&nbsp; It allows you 24 hours to do it at a time of your choosing before then but if you do not it will reboot for you.&nbsp; It should give you a pop up giving
 a minute to save your work, but thats it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You should be able to schedule a restart if you have windows update installed which is pending a restart. Unless you have specific policies or triggered some sort of deadline such like WSUS. Under settings-&gt;update &amp; security-&gt;Windows update-&gt;Advanced
 options-&gt;choose how updates are installed, chose notify to schedule restart.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You could schedule them at a day and time that would be most convenient. And please note that you won't see the option(s) until an update is installed that is pending a reboot .</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<h2>            Internal Mic stops working when I plug in speakers</h2>
                    My speakers have to be plugged into a USP port (For power) and the audio jack (like for headphones), and when I'm on Skype with someone, my microphone doesn't work. I can't figure out why this is happening... Help?

                    So I went to test my microphone to see if it was working. I went in the settings tab and clicked system. Then I clicked Sound. I clicked the microphone button to test it, and it works. But now it wont turn off. I tried clicking the button again, but it
 just wont stop testing for voice input. Does anyone know how to turn it off, or if it can be?

    <title>Microsoft Edge &#34;Find on page&#34; panel bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aleksey zinkovskiy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Edge &#34;Find on page&#34; panel bug</h2>
                    The "Find on page" panel keeps popping up on its&nbsp;own&nbsp;whenever it wants (probably in some pre-determined intervals but I never measured it) and just stays there with no chance&nbsp;of inputting text or closing the panel until you press Ctrl+F and replace it
 with a functioning instance that would allow to close it. The panel itself is grey and all fields and control elements are displayed as inaccessible whenever it pops under the address bar.<br />
<br />
I have no idea why this happens&nbsp;or how to fix it, help?<br />
<br />
P.S. I couldn't find a category for Microsoft Edge. Posting in Internet Explorer thread probably isn't the best idea so I post it here instead, sorry =\

<p>Thanks for the answer!<br />
Well, Troubleshooting couldn't identify any problems so I guess it's something uncommon...&nbsp;It is quite annoying when it pops up randomly and wastes screen space but it doesn't break anything too badly.</p>
<p>I guess unless someone else already encountered the issue and found a solution I'll just have to wait a few patches and hope it gets fixed =)</p>

You are not alone. Have been searching for solution for over a year. Have tried by sending computer to manufacturer to be repaired, reset OS, different antiviruses- antimalware-registry fixes,&nbsp;buy new disc and clean install multiple times, remove cpu battery,
 upgrade bios, replace hard-drive and clean install again, scannow, registry resets,&nbsp;upgrade to windows 10 and still no luck. It would be nice for Microsoft to address this issue.&nbsp;It would appear to be an error with the search function but is most noticeable
 with the find on page function due to using the web.&nbsp;I haven't&nbsp;gone to the point to buy a new computer to rule out other possible hardware issues.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Rose,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for prompt reply. I did the windows troubleshooter apps, and it says windows store apps may have corrupt&nbsp;cache&nbsp;and license.&nbsp; I did fix that, but still not help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The apps I used was Microsoft Photos. What I did is:</p>
<p>1. Open the video(*.mp4) by Movie&amp;TV.</p>
<p>2. Select edit in Photo with "create slow motion video"</p>
<p>3. Edits the slow motion.</p>
<p>4. Click Save a copy</p>
<p>5. Something went wrong windows pop out.</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c865ae6-5cac-43ee-8c1e-d3186d7a2401?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c865ae6-5cac-43ee-8c1e-d3186d7a2401?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Recent updates, after I open the photos directly and import this video, I can now save my slow-motion edits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Windows Update stuck forever in checking for updates. Win7 Ultimate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d.e.g.t  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update stuck forever in checking for updates. Win7 Ultimate x64 SP1</h2>
                    <p><strong>Background Information</strong></p>
<p>I had a working system with Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bits. This was a development and simulation rig that costed weeks of configuration and installs to be in operational mode. It was installed in 2012 after my old motherboard got damaged (I had to get a new
 license... not fair).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Months ago I opted for the Windows 10 but since I was not ready I postponed. Suddenly it just kept nagging on and on like an infant (not the most friendly approach Microsoft!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week it suddenly put a pistol on my head and simply gave me no choice to postpone, just install. Luckily I had made an Image backup the day before so with the gun on my head I let it proceed with the Windows 10 "upgrade".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Upgrade seemed to go wrong at 83% or so with a screen saying it had gone wrong that it would try again. So it did and this time it APPEARED to go. I was then brought to the Windows 10 for final configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reboot the development &amp; simulation PC was totally inoperable! It would not boot into Windows 10, nor it could repair itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering the "wonderful" experience I really didn't feel the System Image Restore that would reformat my OS drive was something I could give my vote of confidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... I went out an bought a new hard disk and monitor and installed my trusted Windows&nbsp;7 Ultimate x64 SP1 on it with the intention of NEVER attempting to "upgrade" to Windows 10 as it was more "free troubles" than "free upgrade".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The Issue</strong></p>
<p>So after being set back a couple hundred dollars and having lost several days of development work I had my new barebones installation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bits</li><li>Brand new WD Caviar Blue 1TB (no damages or errors on it)</li><li>(re)Activated&nbsp;my copy of windows</li><li>Installed all motherboard drivers</li></ul>
<p>The problem is... when&nbsp;I go to Windows Update it shows me 16 installed updates but it gets stuck FOREVER on "<em><strong>Checking for Updates</strong></em>" with "<em>Most recent check for updates: Never</em>" and "<em>Updates were installed: Never</em>"
 and "<em>You receive updates: For Windows and other products from Microsoft Update</em>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is set to Automatic updates but all other settings give the same problem, no updates are being installed anymore than the 16 that are already there:</p>
<ul>
<li>KB2888049</li><li>KB2882822</li><li>KB2834140</li><li>KB2786081</li><li>KB2731771</li><li>KB2729094</li><li>KB2639308</li><li>KB2533623</li><li>KB2670838</li><li>Internet Explorer 11 (manually downloaded)</li><li>English Spelling Package</li><li>English Hyphenation Package</li><li>KB2534111</li><li>KB976902</li><li>KB2565063 (Visual C++ 2010 x86 redist)</li><li>KB2565063 (Visual C++ 2010 x64 redist)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Since the check for updates is hanging (<em>these were not there prior to the problem</em>)&nbsp;I manually downloaded and installed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kaspersky Antivirus 2016 </li><li>Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile &amp; Extended (needed for antivirus)</li></ul>
<p><em>So, how can I get Windows Update to work again??? I have lost about 4 days of work thanks to this "upgrade".</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>For what I could see the Windows Update is the latest version of wuauserv.dll. This is a significant part of WindowsUpdate.log of today. Do note however that in the beginning I had intentionally disconnected the network cable, reconnected afterwards but
 the problem persists. Also note there are many DatStor warnings about adding a URL that failed.:</p>

<p>É também acho que vai ser isso ai que o LatestCone637 disse,Marvel Ultimate Alliance com outro nome,quando eu tinha meu PS2 eu curti muito o Marvel Ultimate Alliance,era um jogo bem legal de jogar tanto sozinho quanto com um amigo,porém era um jogo bem Arcade
 mesmo,os gráficos eram bem ruizinhos porém te traziam diversão...Acho que nessa ERA &nbsp;de super tecnologias e avanços nas areas dos games,um jogo como esse dos AVENGERS deveria ser preparado com mais capricho,e seguir o exemplo do Batman,tanto o Arkham Asylum
 quanto o Arkham City que são simplesmente os melhores games de heróis da história...Portanto se a Ubisoft vai ter 20 heróis,e dentre eles o Homem de Ferro,Capitão América,Hulk e etc,deve ser feito algo respeitável,um jogo que seja do tamanho da grandeza de
 tais super heróis.</p>

<p>LatestCone637, Marvel Ultimate Aliance, tem uma história diferente do THE AVENGERS: Battle for Earth</p>
<p>Secret Invaion é de 2008 e o Marvel Ultimate Aliance é de 2006! E não dá para comparar um jogo que nem é do ano passado com um que foi confirmado em 10/05/2012. Além de ainda não terem dado muitas informações sobre o novo THE AVENGERS</p>

<h2>            How does a laptop get traced&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong><u>Original Title: This may be a question that has never been asked</u></strong></p>
<p>I have recently purchased a refurbished Dell laptop with Explorer 11 and Windows 7. After 20 years of living in **** in an abusive and dangerous relationship, I am hitting the road. I hate to leave my new laptop behind, but if this man finds me, he will
 kill me. (I know things about him that he can't let me report) My question is this - is it the laptop itself or the hard drive that makes my laptop traceable? I know that every pc has a unique IP address, but where does that address come from? I obviously
 need a response as soon as possible...thank you!</p>

            This is a question that has been asked numerous times.<br />
<br />
First of all, there is no reason to air your dirty laundry in a public forum. In any case, the laptop is not traceable unless some special tracking software has been installed.<br />

            <p>The IP address is assign by whichever service you connect to. So if in an internet café or a restaurant it will be their IP your laptop receives.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In most cases these will be in one of the private address ranges and normally begins with the values 192.168.<em>X.Y</em>. These types of addresses are unroutable from the internet so cannot be found externally. X is normally 0, 1, 100 and there will thousands
 of networks using the same values, Y will be in the range 1-254 and again thousands of computers have the same value. So in fact every PC does NOT have a unique IP address because in reality there will be hundreds around the world with the same address.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is one value that is exclusive to your laptop and that is the MAC address. This however is only used to connect your laptop to the router and is not traceable.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The main exception is if you use a 3G/4G dongle to get internet access but in this case the address is assigned by your network provider and will vary for each connection.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Forensically speaking the main potential break is email. However if you use a web based mail system such as Outlook.com or GMail the mail message actually originates from their mailserver not from you.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So unless your ex partner has the resources of the likes of the NSA your laptop is untraceable.</p>

            <p>I'm sorry to bother you again, but I want to be sure that I understand your reference to email. If I have email accounts with Yahoo and AOL, and have had them for many years, and really don't want to close them, are you telling me that my actual physical
 location cannot be traced through standard emails, like those sent to my family?</p>
<p>What about accounts that I have set up with my email address, like Ancestry.com, for instance?</p>
<p>Please let me know at your earliest convenience - thank you!</p>

            <p>All email messages have a unseen header attached. This contains the route taken by the email to get to the recipient. For example I received an email supposedly from my mobile company which originated from a WiMax provider in Lagos, Nigeria.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However it only has the route of the email so it only exists as such when transmitted. If you use a webmail service you construct the email on their web site and the source is the providers webmail server.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you were to use a mail client such as Outlook the source is the mail system your PC connects to, this still is not you're PC but is one step closer. My example did not tell me the address of the actual sender but at least indicated the region it came
 from. In fact the method used to send the mail gave me more information than most.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In reality to get more detailed information is difficult, no provider would give it unless requested by legal order.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In your original post you were under the impression that your PC can be specifically identified by its IP, in practice this is not possible without the resources of the authorities and the approval of the courts. Even if you were to set up home and subscribe
 to an ISP it would not be a simple process to trace the connection.</p>

<br />
I don't mean to frighten RunningLady, but this answer is not quite correct.<br />
<br />
Any computer connected to the Internet will have a unique public IP address.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you connect directly (for example using a cable modem with no router), your computer itself has the public IP address.<br />
<br />
If a computer is connected through a router (either at home or in an Internet cafe, library, or a wifi hotspot), your computer will be assigned a private IP address by the router (and many, many computers will have the same
<b>private</b> IP address), but the router's public IP address will be available to any website to which you connect.&nbsp; And the general location of that IP address can easily be obtained.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
That's how you can communicate with a website:&nbsp; you connect to a website, it responds to your
<b>public </b>IP address, and the router cleverly forwards the response to the <b>
private </b>IP address that the router had assigned to your computer.&nbsp; When several computers are connected to a single router, the router has to keep track of which computer is communicating with which website so that it can properly direct (route) the responses
 from the websites.<br />
<br />
To test this from any computer, do the following:<br />
<ol>
<li>Open a Command Prompt window (in Windows 7, type cmd.exe in the Start &gt; search box and then press Enter)</li><li>In the black Command Prompt window, type<br />
ipconfig<br />
and press Enter</li><li>In one of the sections of the output will be a line similar to this:<br />
&nbsp;IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.101<br />
That's the IP address assigned by your router</li><li>Now open any web browser and go to this location:<br />
http://www.whatismyip.com/</li><li>You'll see a page with your public IP address and your general physical location</li></ol>
<p>All that said, that information is typically only available to websites that you connect to (notwithstanding shows like NCIS and others where they "trace the IP" of the bad guy).&nbsp; So unless you connect to a website operated by the person you're attempting
 to avoid, it's highly unlikely that your IP address will be exposed.&nbsp; Although ancestry.com (for example) will likely have logs that show the public IP address associated with logons by your userid, that information is not available outside ancestry.com unless
 you (a) hack into the company's servers or (b) are a law enforcement agency who can obtain that information from the company either by asking (sometimes) or by obtaining a warrant.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For extra security, you can connect to the Internet using a <a href="http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/readerpicks/tp/Reasons-to-Use-a-VPN-Service.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
VPN service</a> such as <br />
</p>
<a href="http://www.strongvpn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.strongvpn.com/</a> or <a href="http://www.hidemyass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.hidemyass.com/ </a>.&nbsp; These are readily available and not very expensive.
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With respect to email, any <b>received </b>email includes information that shows where it came from.&nbsp; So unless RL sends email directly to her ex or he has access to a computer of someone else to whom she has sent email, he won't have that information.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Depending on how the computer is connected to the Internet and what sort of email service is used, the IP address information in the email may or may not reveal a physical location that is at least geographically near the actual sender.&nbsp; If the email is
 sent using a web-based service like gmail, the address will belong to the service (e.g., Google).&nbsp; A "web-based service" means that you connect to a website to send and receive email using a browser rather than using an email program installed on your computer.<br />

            <p>The point is the connection in most cases is transient and unless the other party has direct access to the service making the connection for her computer at the time the connection is being made they cannot find her access. WhatMyIP works because the enquiry
 is made FROM the connecting computer i.e. hers and only shows it for the duration of the connection. Even then the result is the web side interface of the connection so if from a restaurant or similar it will show that locations external address. However in
 the majority of cases this value will change on a routine basis depending on the service providers policy.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The email header includes the path that the email has made as an email. Using a web based email service it will not include the connection from the client computer to the web interface of the service provider. Their logs probably will show where the connection
 was made from ( with the same caveats above) but these are not publicly accessible and would only be released by them (Google, Yahoo) under the appropriate order.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The main vulnerable position would be the use of a Mobile internet dongle where the ISP issues an IP to that device which is directly connected to the internet. However again that address will probably change each time the connection is made, will be controlled
 by the Mobile service provider and would not be made available to anybody without authority.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In most cases using WiFi or cabled LAN behind a router means that your PC is issued a Private IP beginning 192.168. (there are others). These are classified as unroutable addresses and if a connection was attempted would be rejected automatically by every
 router on the internet.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The OP was under the impression that her IP address was exclusive to her and permanently assigned. The fact is for private use personal computers it is not and so cannot be used to trace her.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
Only large corporate entities can have permanently assigned IP addresses to individual users and even that is rare.

            <p>Your "find feature" is not what I am talking about at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Start</p>
<p>Type appwiz.cpl and hit enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should get something like this</p>

<p>
</p><p>That is what I am talking about. Is Silverlight listed there? If it is click to highlight it and then click Uninstall. Once uninstalled hide it from Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the same as opening Control Panel from the Start menu and navigating to the Programs and Features option. The instructions to get to appwiz.cpl&nbsp;via Control Panel will vary from PC to PC depending on how that PC is set up, the instructions above&nbsp;should
 work on any Windows 7 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said all that, what you describe as the "find feature" should find Silverlight if it is installed but it would be worth double checking with Programs and Features.</p>

<h2>            Audio Audio microfono registrare registrazione</h2>
                    <p>Buonasera. Ho installato Windows 8 64 bit sul mio portatile TOSHIBA Satellite L505 13N e, da allora, non funziona più la scheda audio Realteh High Definition. Ho cercato i driver in rete, ma non ho trovato nulla al riguardo.</p>
<p>Vi prego di volermi indicare la soluzione</p>

    <title>Why does cursor not stay set on my scroll bar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sjbarrientos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does cursor not stay set on my scroll bar</h2>
                    My windows 7 worked great. When I place my cursor on the far right scroll arrow down, my cursor stays there. Every computer that has Windows 10 will not do this. Every time I scroll a few lines and stop to read, I have to reset my cursor back on the down
 arrow, even when I am not touching the mouse pad or anything that might make it react sensitively. Every time I mean, the cursor seems to slightly move off of the down arrow all by itself. This is such a nuisance. Any one have any ideas or suggestions?&nbsp;

<p>Yeah, I'm on Iberians, too. I liked this one too, that's all. Easier having it all in one place.</p>
<p>I agree with Assassinator. I doubt it will ever be up. Killing the old forums was likely a marketing ploy some VP thought up:</p>
<p>"Hey, we need people to buy more games. There's too many people talking about old games. Lets put a stop to that, and make sure they're only allowed to talk about new games - (whether they like them or not). Gotta sell more Kinectimals!"</p>
