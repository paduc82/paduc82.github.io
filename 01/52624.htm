            Do you perhaps use two-factor authentication on that Outlook account?&nbsp; This is the type of system where, after typing your normal password, you receive a text message or have to type a code from your phone to login.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the very latest Windows 10 - 17763.1 - freshly installed last night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have the latest available version of Your Phone app - 3.3.2_50563 mmx-3.3.0-001 - installed an hour ago on Samsung Galaxy S8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On PC:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Logged into my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- Now I am on this screen: We need your permission to connect and access data on your phone. Please check your phone and tap Allow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Phone:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Logged into my Microsoft account (same account, naturally).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- Now I am on this screen: Your phone and PC are linked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I click on "Send notification" button on PC, and wait to receive something on phone in order to tap Allow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Feature update 1709 win10  Second Question</h2>
                    <p>This was my first question and the answer.</p>
<div>
<div>
<span>Feature update to Windows 10 version 1709&nbsp;<span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fanswers.microsoft.com%2fstatic%2fimages%2frsp-content-status-subscribed.png%3fver%3d18.1.5.3" /></span></span>

<div>I managed to get this update installed on my laptop after the automatic download and install failed 4 times. Must have been a fluke to get it installed because now it will not install
 on my desktop even repeating my laptop install actions. These were. Ran wu troubleshooter several times. Disabled start up apps for a clean boot. Disabled my Norton firewall after download but before restart. Checked BIOS for first boot on hard drive. Now
 the update on the desktop gets to the stage where it says "Configuring update for Windows 10. 100% complete. Do not turn off your computer". And it freezes. The mouse and keypad are unresponsive. This has happened three times. Even after leaving it for 5 hours
 the last time, Only way to go forward is to turn off the computer and then turn it on again. This re-activates the install which them starts working on the updates and goes through to 100%. But then gives a message "reverting to previous version". And WU in
 settings then indicates that the computer is up to date. But next time I turn it on the feature update starts to download again. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. I am chewing up my data allowance on repeat downloads. NOT GOOD. What I want to know is how do I turn off
 the automatic download of this feature update because I do not want it or need it because the desktop does not even have a touch screen for the features. PLEASE MICROSOFT is there a way to deactivate the automatic download of this feature.</div>

<p>Thanks for the help Nick, but:.</p>
<p>The stand alone installer from the link that you provided also failed to complete the install.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c85026b7-1002-46ff-a6b8-a238c9e8d16f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c85026b7-1002-46ff-a6b8-a238c9e8d16f" /></a></p>
<p>The error code indicates a software or driver conflict. But I have not installed any new apps for 9 months so there should be no app conflicts. Unless apps updating has caused it. In which case I would have no idea which one. And anyway the clean
 boot should take care of that.</p>
<p>I have checked every driver and some did update, but the problem remains the same.</p>
<p>I have since run chkdsk/f and DSIM.exe/ Online/ Cleanup-image/ Restorehealth. Both gave a clean bill of health with no problems found or fixed. Also ran sfc /scannow which found no integrity violations.</p>
<p>I think that the problem is in the startup/restart files. The installs/computer were freezing (as I mentioned) whenever a restart /reboot was being run by the install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I have test run restart from the start menu several times and the same freeze happens. The re-start is not happening and the only way to reactivate the computer (and any running processes) is to turn it off and then turn it on again manually.</p>
<p>This restart problem has only happened sine the 1709 download came into the computer so it could be that the update is the conflict. Judging by the number of complaints in the community pages this is very likely.</p>
<p>I have the sleep setting on "never" because the updates take so long to process.</p>
<p>I have the power setting for the hard drive on 60 minutes.</p>
<p>I have fast startup off.</p>
<p>I have hibernate off.</p>
<p>Now, I can not even change any setting in the computer, or do a clean boot because the restart has to be used for any changes to take effect and it does not work. So the computer is virtually useless. Lucky that I also have a laptop on which this
 is being typed.</p>
<p>I hope that you have some suggestions because I have run out of ideas and am thinking of a complete reinstall of win10. But reluctant because of all the download data that this will entail ( I only get 25gb per month on my plan). Also I have no
 hard media and only have the product key because my machine was previously running vista.</p>
<p>And. If the restart does not work, then even a complete reinstall will fail.</p>
<p>So questions.</p>
<p>1. What version and build of windows will download from the https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/software-download/windows10 create media download.<br />
2. Because I do not have hard media, can I use my product key to obtain the download.</p>
<p>3. Will an install from hard media require a restart for the media to work.</p>
<p>And for the record my computer is an Acer i5-2310 CPU@ 2.9GHz . 64 bit O/S<br />
6.00 GB ram 1TB HD so should be OK for this update.<br />

<p>Thank you Nick and thank you Jefferson</p>
<p>All of the suggestions have failed including a reset with personal files, apps, and settings retained. All failing because the restart function on the computer is not working. Computer shuts down to restart and stays shut down. Frozen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because the restart has completely stopped working, I can not do any repair work on my desktop computer. So I can not change any start up settings and can not install updates that require a restart, or repair windows which requires restarts.
 I am using my laptop for this message. So I have downloaded windows onto a USB. But the reset requires restarts and so the reset fails. I thought that I could do a complete FRESH install of windows using the USB download but my product key for the version
 that I have in the computer (1703 Build 15063.850) will not activate the install and the program will not override my current installed version. Which is obviously corrupted. So I am forced to a last resort of trying to do a reset with all of my personal setting,
 apps, data deleted. This is a disgrace that microsoft has released an update that is causing so many problems. I will post whether this latest attempt works after the several hours that it wastes every time.</p>

            Another update. The USB install worked ,but all of my personal stuff needs to be copied back in. However, the install is not version 1709, which needs to be installed as an update. I have run out of data allowance and will run the download and install
 after 14/01. New data month. I will post back whether this works and whether all of the glitches with the restart function are fixed.

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2 USB not recognizing my iphone</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am pretty desperate as I had this issue over a year and I tried everything from youtube and it didn't work. I have surface pro 2 running on fully updated windows 10. The usb port alows simple usb sticks with say a movie or pdf to be read but won't allow
 for any connection with my iphone5 and it didnt allow iphone4s before either. It happened about a year or even two ago when I downloaded and then deleted itunes. I even did system restore and it didnt help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what drivers are missing if any. All I know when I connect my iphone nothing happens. No "allow this phone" alert pops out, no data shows up in my computer. I used to be able to access my photos from iphone there. cant do this any more. As if
 i never connected anything. Of course I tried 10000 cables. It is not the cable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me, I am so exhausted with this, it hinders my work and leisure activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nina</p>

            <div>All I can suggest since you've had this issue for over a year is to consider a</div>
<div>complete wipe and then a reinstall using a downloadable recovery image, and then</div>
<div>updating to the current build of Windows 10. This will rule out software issues.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (with a</div>
<div>different Windows computer if yours is not working properly)&nbsp; and download a</div>
<div>recovery image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick formatted FAT32.</div>
<div>Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</div>
<div>Step 1:&nbsp; &nbsp; Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power</div>
<div>button for 30 seconds).</div>
<div>Step 2:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 3:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the</div>
<div>power button on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 4:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.</div>
<div>Step 5:&nbsp; &nbsp; When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</div>
<div>Step 6:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of</div>
<div>the screen.</div>
<div>Step 7:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This</div>
<div>refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 8:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.</div>
<div>Step 9:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Choose Just remove my files.</div>
<div>Step 10:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Reset.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process</div>
<div>continues (this can take a while).</div>

<p>I think I need a correct driver rather than a wipe out...especially when the simple USB sticks are are working correctly. And I do not own USB recovery drive. I appreciate your kindness and hope someone else had a similar problem and could share a solution?</p>

</p><p>Coincidentally I am currently trying to solve a related problem with both a phone and a camera (both are really primitive devices but both supposedly have USB transfer capability).&nbsp; The symptom that I saw is that the USB micro to USB cable could be used
 for charging but nothing else.<span>&nbsp; I found this set of suggestions about that.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>(BING search for</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;micro USB cable charging windows&nbsp; 10 DCIM<br />
)</p>
<p><span>The simplest one would be installing an MTP driver.&nbsp; Ideally I would like it to work through a USB hub port.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, the phone has Bluetooth so if nothing else I know I could use that and transfer files wirelessly.&nbsp; Supposedly the phone even supports BTPAN so then that would be even closer to the real objective from using the USB with it.&nbsp; That still doesn't
 help me with the camera device though.</p>

            <span>Hi</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>
<div>it can mean you have more than about 70 entries in the two Start Menu &gt; Programs folders.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Try clicking the Windows Orb (Start), right-click All Programs and click Open. Right-click All Programs again and click Open All Users. Right-click the Taskbar and click Show windows side by side. Have a look in both the Programs folders and if there are
 more than 70 entries, combine some of them or create a sub folder, e.g. Start Menu\Programs\Miscellaneous and drag other folders/program shortcuts to it until there are less than 70 entries. Right-click the Taskbar and click Undo Show side by side. Lastly,
 using Task Manager, end and restart Explorer or restart the computer to refresh the list.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            Mine did the same thing. Click the start orb then all programs. Right click on whatever programs you want to be in what is now blank and then click pin to start menu. Click pin to taskbar, if you want an icon there.

            Have you tried all three programs I mentioned? With regards to your error, it would be helpful to know what you are trying to do. Activating Windows? Reinstalling Windows? Adding Media Center?

<h3> big pipper  say:</h3>
<h2>            Games have disappeared</h2>
                    
<p>I am really hoping for some help here...... For some reason no games are showing in my game library. The only thing that appears there are demos and videos that I have downloaded. Both the "Full Games" and the "360 Games" libraries are empty, yet when I
 go to memory under settings, the programs are present on the hard drive. Whenever I play a game, it shows in the library as it should as long as I keep playing that particular game, but if I switch games, it disappears and then only the current game that I
 am playing appears in the library, nothing else. I called support, they had me clear the cache, delete my profile, and then recover it, (it was all a No\Go) then I was told that they had tried everything that they knew, and that they had never seen this problem
 before. They gave me an incident number and that was it. But the problem remains.
</p>
<p>Is there anyone who has seen this happen? If so, how do I fix this?</p>

<h2>            How to simplify the list of folders in the left pane of Windows Explorer&#63;</h2>
                    I am new to Windows 10 and struggling with learning the features. There seems to be a lot of folders listed in the left pane, and a lot of them are the same folders accessible in different ways, I think. It is very confusing to see Documents at least 5
 times! Can someone point me to a Dummies level instructional on what all of this is and how to organize it. I frequently have trouble locating a device plugged into a usb port!

<h2>            Windows 8.1 update problem - error 0xc06d007f</h2>
                    When attempting to update windows 8.0 to 8.1 via the app store, I receive the error that the app could not be installed. &nbsp;The error code is 0xc06d007f. &nbsp;My computer is a new Acer Aspire ZS00, Intel i3.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The one suggestion I found on the internet with problems updating to 8.1 was due to antivirus issues. &nbsp;I had previously installed Avast. &nbsp;This time I completely removed the program, ran CCcleaner scan and registry scan, then restarted my computer and attempted
 the update again.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Still no luck and I receive the same error each time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any advice?</div>
                </div>

Check out 'will my devices be compatible' and try the upgrade assistant from here:
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8</a><br />
<br />
&nbsp;It is possible that incorrect configurations, corrupt or broken-missing files in your version of windows could cause updating issues, if it has nothing to do with any installed software clashing with or preventing the update, such as a third party antivirus
 or firewall, which you may want to temporarily switch off whilst updating. <br />
<br />
Try running the command prompt tool as administrator (in windows 8's metro screen, after right clicking and selecting the 'all apps' screen, it should be listed on the far right), and then use the system file checker function by entering<br />
'sfc /scannow'<br />
into the black box and hitting ENTER.<br />
<br />
If some files cannot be fixed, try running the command prompt tool as admin again, with the Deployment Image Servicing and Management function, which can restore system configurations, by entering<br />
<br />
'dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth'<br />
and then ENTER<br />
(this will scan for issues)<br />
<br />
'dism /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth'<br />
and then ENTER<br />
(this will scan for corruption)<br />
<br />
and again with<br />
'dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth'<br />
and ENTER. <br />
(fix corruption)<br />
<br />
Note the spaces after certain text above for the functions to work. <br />
You may also want to try a hard drive diagnostic tool to check your drives health before attempting another update.
<br />
<br />
If none of that helps then you may want to attempt an update to 8.1 after using windows System Restore, to take your installation back to a time when the update may possibly show no software exception error (depending on the size of your drive a restore can
 literally take hours), or if you have a windows 8 restoration disc, attempt an update to 8.1 after a fresh windows 8.0 install.<br />
<br />
Make sure you always back up all of your important data before attempting any system update or restoration.

<br />Sounds like your adaptive brightness configuration needs to be adjusted.  Try adjusting the settings according to the following link.

            Adaptive Brightness does not usually show a box when the brightness changes. I believe it's a monitor thing. I have had some monitors that show some "eco" bars when the ambient brightness changes. Could you describe the box? Does it look like the one in
 Windows? Or does it look different?<br />

            Thanks for answering.&nbsp; My computer tech is taking care of it.&nbsp; It is an old monitor and the issue is not a Windows one, but a setting on the monitor.&nbsp; Thanks for trying to solve my problem.&nbsp;

<h2>            Vista Home Prem. x64 OEM Discs</h2>
                    I bought an Acer about 8 months ago, and it's time for me to clean install (as I tend to make a regular practice to keep everything clean and organized) I do not want to use the Acer restore discs because it loads a bunch of bloatware i do not need, nor
 do i want to have to suffer the ordeal of uninstalling it all (about 40 gigs worth) which falls under the category of things like the Acer arcade, launch manager, NTI backup, and other things of that nature that i simply will not use.&nbsp; I would like to know
 if there is a way I can get the DVD for installing the operating system, since Acer will not give it to me, they would rather supply me with the 3 dvd waste they like to push as their "Recovery Discs" I don't wish to recover their bloatware. If i knew someone
 with the discs for the 64 bit version, i would use it since i still have my cd key sticker, and the cd key copied down as a backup (laptop stickers wear off :( i don't even have my service tag number anymore) I highly appreciate any solutions that can be provided.
 I went so far as searching torrent sites for an ISO image of the disc, but all i get is the 32 bit version. Is there a way i can just downgrade to a 32 bit version? that doesn't result in me paying for the full version of the OS? With windows 7 on the way,
 i don't want to buy a new copy of vista.<br />

            To be completely and totally honest with you, the ONLY real way to downgrade to a 32 bit Windows Vista is to either purchase it, or torrent it. You can use 32 bit linux if what you need has a linux client.

<h2>            Can&#39;t set Windows Defender options.</h2>
                    When I turn on Defender Options like auto scan or change a default option and then click Save, I get "No such interface supported (Error Code: 0x80024002)"<br />

So I'm left with the default settings including no automatic scanning.<br />

Then - when done - let everyone here know if it worked for you - or if<br />
you have more issues.<br />

            There's a lot of turmoil with Windows Updates right now.   So unless it's interfering with performance I'd give it a few weeks to sort itself out. <br /><br />If it is interfering or you don't want to wait then there is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.<br /><br />You can try installing Updates manually from Microsoft Update catalog by searching for them here:   <a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=Windows%2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search....</a><br /><br />If Updates cause problems you can find out which one by checking at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History and uninstall

            I tried the troubleshooter download in the guide and the result is the same.&nbsp; Also, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the latest KB update before today using the Update Catalog and now I have another error.&nbsp; The KB is KB4090913 and the error is 0x8E5E0147.&nbsp;
 Also, I can not install KB4090914 because the update is already installed and I can not uninstall the update.&nbsp; The event logs do show Event ID 447 for database corruption for bad page link in catdb.

            I was referring to the very first step I gave in my first post, for the new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  I said to try running that first.  Did you?
<br />
<br />Did you do any of the steps I gave or absorb any of the information?  The reason I ask is you responded back with other information about some "guide" you followed that I don't think was in my steps.  
<br />
<br />Would you want to go back and go over them now, as they're helping everyone else.

    <title>Deleted Frames Returning After Rendering - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Deleted Frames Returning After Rendering</h2>
                    <p>Alright, so I've been making music videos for a TV show on WMM. I understand the splitting and trimming thing completely, I use them all the time and never have an issue. But now I've started a new video and I'm having problems with frames, that I've already
 removed, showing back up after its been rendered. I'll have the project open, everything will look great, and I'll render it. After it's rendering I'll view it and there's frames I've removed showing up everywhere. I go back to the project, and they're not
 there. I've even slowed the playback down to 0.125X and the frames are not there. Again, it's only after rendering. The project I'm currently on I've rendered, found the extra frames, and went in to edit the rendered version, taking out all the frames, and
 rendering again, only to see the frames back. I'm at a loss. Everywhere I look with questions on removing frames shows the simple split or trim fix, I've done that already. Those frames were gone, until it rendered. I recently had problems with clips that
 were doing fine suddenly going green on me. That has since stopped, that's not the issue here, it's just these extra frames all of a sudden.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rendering specs are as follows (if it matters): 1920 X 1080, Bitrate: 24,000 kbps, 29.97 frames per second.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the default specs for the HD Display option when rendering. I&nbsp;<em>have</em> done a custom setting adjusting the bitrate (I have no idea if that'll do anything with the problem it was just to check and see, and of course, the frames are still there).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: Had a friend asking question, so I made a quick video of what the issue is. I already explained it all here, but just in case this helps, the video can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/DJmsIod2DpY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here.</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/DJmsIod2DpY?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/DJmsIod2DpY?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>

<h2>            Initialized Xbox One external hard drive</h2>
                    
<p>I bought a 2 GB Seagate external hard drive for my Xbox One.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I formatted it using the Xbox One and played a couple games and the games were installed on the external.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to look at how the information was being stored, so I plugged it into my PC and in Disk Management I selected initialize (I don't know why).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when plugging it back into my Xbox One, it wants to reformat and erase everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to fix this and get my data back or am I ***?</p>

<p>Hi BubbaChili, </p>
<p>Once a drive is in use via Xbox you cannot use it with Windows, so you will need to re-format it. That said it's only games that you have to reinstall. Your game saves are stored in the cloud.</p>
