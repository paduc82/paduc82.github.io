<h2>            Skype for Android 8.29.0.41 on Lenovo Tab4 8 - louspeaker only available in video calls&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've installed/updated to Skype version 8.29.0.41 on my Lenovo Tab4 8 from the Google Play store. The problem is that the loudspeaker only works at reasonable volume for a video call.&nbsp; If there is no video the loudspeaker is off and there is a text annunciation
 panel saying speaker off. The loudspeaker symbol is visible, but clicking it has no effect, the loudspeaker will NOT turn on.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>AS the loudspeaker works fine on video calls and other apps this is clearly a problem within this version of Skype. I could dial using the video and then switch the video off, but this work around won't work for 'land lines' and other dialled numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been tempted to look for an older version of Skype on one of the many APK sites, but I'm reluctant to do that. Sadly I can't find a way to revert to the previous version (whatever it was).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone got this problem and found a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, R</p>

            Hey Roger<br />I would recommend following these steps first:<br />Go to your phone's settings and look for Applications or Application Manager.<br />Look for Skype, and then select Force Stop &gt; Clear cache &gt; Clear Data &gt; Uninstall.<br />After uninstalling, kindly reboot your device.<br />Once it is up, please install Skype using Google Play Store.<br />After installing Skype, please restart your device again before signing in.<br />If this doesn't work I know you said you're reluctant to do it but downloading an older APK can help solve the problem. I used this website and trust it just don't click on ads <a href="https://www.androidapksfree.com/apk/skype-apk-latest-version-download-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.androidapksfree.com/apk/skype-apk-l...</a><br />Hope this helps

</p><p>What the heck is going on with MS, in relation to Skype. why can't they just leave it alone. apply this to there thinking. if its not broken leave it as it is.</p>
<p>I updated to the new Skype did not like it so I reverted back to classic, the following day it would not start up, reload Skype classic again, and then this morning I get another version of Skype which I did not like so I having to search for the link yet
 again that will allow me to use Skype 7.04.0. classic. </p>
<p>Please do not mess-about with Skype, Classic is the best one since to original owners sold Skype off.&nbsp;

<h2>            Start menu no longer works &#38; Slow log in - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of this morning (27/5/2017) My start menu no longer works, and my system is quick to boot, but slow to log in after entering password.<br />
<br />
I have ran the start menu diagnostic tool download from the Microsoft website, and I get there errors.<br />
<br />
"Required applications are not installed correctly"<br />
"Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperienceHost" and "Microsoft.Windows.Cortana" applications need to be installed correctly.<br />
<br />
I have tried to repair the OS via the Administrator Powerkernal, which does not fix the issue.<br />
<br />
I have also tried a startup repair using my Windows 10 USB, which does not fix the issue.<br />
<br />
I am really reluctant to re install my OS for this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is;</p>
<p>&gt; Windows 10 Home 64Bit</p>
<p>&gt; Version 1703</p>
<p>&gt; Build 15063.332<br />
<br />
Everything was fine after the 'creators' update, issue only arose today...no updates were installed on my part.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system components may not be working as expected. Since you have shared adequate information for us to understand what is taking place, please run the System File Checker tool to fix possible issues regarding missing or corrupted system files. This tool
 will correct the issues it comes across. Restart your computer once the scan is done and see if there will be changes. To know how you can use the suggested tool, open

<p>Tried this already, does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also refreshed and healed the image via command prompt. Also did not work.</p>
<p>i even restarted the windows explorer process via task manager, which gave no results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>between using my PC yesterday, and turning it on today, i have not changed anything, no updates, no new installation and no rollbacks or uninstallations of any sort. This issue has just come out of the blue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i can right click the start menu to bring up that pop up. But thats it.</p>
<p>also the action centre does not display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>log in time also has been affected.</p>
<p>OS is installed on an SSD, boot time hasnt changed, less than 2 seconds from power on to log in screen. Log in used to take a split seconds also...now it takes 20 or so seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive updated windows with te latest updates, and updated all driver to see if that resolves anything...again, no fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really do not want to re install windows, having to re install all my other software is a job i dont want to undertake again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's clear the contents of the <strong>Prefetch </strong>folder to speed up the boot process. The folder mentioned stores all the files that the system uses for startup. The folder will be refreshed as you restart the computer and succeeding restarts will
 be faster. Here's how you can perform the suggestion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the <strong>Windows icon</strong> on your home screen.</li><li>Choose<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Run</strong>.</li><li>Type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>prefetch<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>then press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Once you have the folder up, press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Ctrl<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>+<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>A</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>on your keyboard.</li><li>Press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Shift +</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Delete</strong>.</li><li>Click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Yes</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Like what's stated above, the initial restart will take longer than usual but will be faster for the next restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also recommend disabling your security software as you restart the PC to check if the Start menu will come up. You can enable it again after seeing if there will be a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be looking forward to your updates.</p>

<h2>            Getting banned for doing nothing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was already banned from voice communication because someone decided to bully me on the game and then message me non stop until I answered and when I defended myself he reports me. Then messages me from a different profile a minute after and makes fun of me saying try to message me now. That was in the beginning of the week and now today I try to play and it says I cannot play multiplayer because I was reported for harassing someone at 7 pm at night when I work at 4 pm and I didn't even play that since Tuesday. My wife watched Netflix at night while i worked so how did I do harassment? Is it the same guy reporting for different things because this seems unfair that I was banned from voice and somehow they said I was harassing someone when I can't even talk or message anyone and I didn't even play the day they said I did at all. What is going on Xbox because I've had xbox live for almost 8 years and not until recently have I had this problem, and there's not even a way to contact or tal

<h3> tiamats eve  say:</h3>
<h2>            Elite Dangerous not downloading</h2>
                    <p>Good morning!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I logged onto my X-box to play some games. I received a message saying that the installation of an update for Elite Dangerous had stopped. I tried to restart the download several times and it would not. I recycled the power on the X-box to see
 if that would clear the problem, but again the download would not continue. I continued to restarting the download throughout the day to see if maybe it was a connection speed issue (my X-box internet connection is wired to prevent those kinds of issues) but
 nothing worked. This morning I noticed that the game was no longer in my games. It is as if it uninstalled itself without my input. Honestly uninstalling/reinstalling was the next step anyway so it saved me some time. I attempted to download and reinstall
 the game but it doesn't. I get a message saying that one of the add ons was not able to be downloaded. I am now at the same spot I was yesterday. The game will not finish downloading and it will not play. I am not sure whether this is a game issue or an X-box
 issue so I decided to post on both community forums to see what happens. I really need an assist on this as I am stumped as to what to do to get the game to reinstall. Thank you for any assistance.</p>

<h2>            0xc00d36c4 error after &#34;upgrading&#34; to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>0xc00d36c4 error popped up after possible behind the scenes upgrade to Windows 10? I BOUGHT a season from Microsoft of Fear The Walking Dead and watched a couple episodes just fine. Suddenly, when it came to the season finale, I try to watch the episode
 that I paid for and I get this nonsense. It says the file may be corrupted, unsupported (weird, since I purchased it from Microsoft), or the file extension may be incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way that anyone can help me out?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Here are the possible reasons why you're having a sound issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Corrupted/incompatible hardware drivers<br />
</li><li>Corrupted/incomplete Windows updates<br />
</li><li>Hardware failure<br />
</li><li>Incorrect sound settings<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Since the previous troubleshooting steps (such System Restore, reinstalling drivers, used other drivers) didn't resolve the issue, you may this

<h2>            Reinstalling Windows 10 after a tablet repair</h2>
                    <p>I bought a NextBook with Windows 8.1, and did the free upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; Then I dropped the tablet and the screen broke.&nbsp; It was under warranty, so I sent it back for repair, and it came back with the factory install of Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that the free upgrade period has expired, is there any way I can get Windows 10 re-installed?</p>

<h2>            Taskbar search icon and start menu search not working</h2>
                    <p>Pressing the taskbar SEARCH icon (no drop down), or searching by typing after selecting the START menu (automated search), no longer works on our Windows 10 system.&nbsp; We upgraded recently from Windows 7 and the search features initially appeared to function.&nbsp;
 However, the features are now non-responsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many people are experiencing similar problems and many of the solutions don't seem to be working, including the 'Search and Indexing' troubleshooter.&nbsp; We did activate the menus one time by HIDING the search icon on the taskbar and then turning it ON.&nbsp; It
 seemed to refresh the feature, but only worked for a few hours before behaving badly again.</p>

I would also suggest you to Run DISM or System Update Readiness tool</span></p>

Windows corruption errors may prevent Windows updates from installing. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The DISM or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors. (Refer to Windows 8/8.1

            <p>We are responding to&nbsp;our own post.&nbsp; The only solution we have found so far&nbsp;was recommended by Jean Simeoni in reply to the Microsoft Community thread:&nbsp; "Cortana/Windows Search Not Working: Windows 10" ( quoted below from page 6 of all replies in our browser&nbsp;).&nbsp;
 In addition to his suggestions, we had to DISABLE and reboot, not merely STOP, the 'Windows Search' service, before we could delete the 'Data' folder.&nbsp; Our only hesitation at this point, in recommending the fix, is simply not knowing if it is a permanent fix
 or a short-lived fix.&nbsp; Either way, it's effectiveness is definitely a clue to the overall problem.</p>

<p>I'm running Windows 10 upgraded from Windows 8.1 on my desktop and upgraded from Windows 7 on my Notebook, both were presenting the same problem. What helped me was deleting the "Search Data" Folder. I believe it contains the search indexes and for some
 unknown reason those indexes were corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are the steps I used (Sorry, I'm running the Brazilian Portuguese version so some items may be labeled different in English):</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Configuration/Settings</strong></li><li>Type <em>Services</em> in the search bar</li><li>Click on <strong>Show Local Services</strong></li><li>On the <strong>Services </strong>window, look for the <em>Windows Search service and stop it</em></li><li>Open <strong>Windows Explorer</strong></li><li>Navigate to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Search
<ul>
<li>Note that you may need Administrator credentials</li><li>Note also that <em>ProgramData is a hidden folder</em></li></ul>
</li><li>Delete the <strong>Data</strong> folder</li><li>Restart the PC</li></ol>
<p>Let me known if this solves your problems. ;)</p>

    <title>Recovering my Skype Password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alisagarshowitz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovering my Skype Password</h2>
                    <p>I have tried for three hours today to sign into skype but I have forgotten my password, and my email address has changed since I was last on skype ... I answered every question, over and over again ... Killed my eyes on the silly continuous numbers and letters
 ... gave my name, new email address and phone number ... mentioned 3 contacts on my skype account ... That was not good enough for you ... three different times I went through this horrendous experience ... I can't get help anywhere, from anyone until I sign
 up with a microsoft account, that I will probably never use ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I please get my skype password and reset it ... and once I do so, must I keep this microsoft account ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did everything I asked ... skype would not recognise any of my personal information ... what more can I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate an answer as soon as possible, and I don't even know where I will get the answer from? Email, some public chat here, that I am resentful of ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help possible.</p>

            Yes, I have tried this three times unsuccessfully ... I am getting nowhere ... I have given you my name, account name, day of birth and friends ... and it still isn't good enough~&nbsp; What can I do to recover and rest my password ... I don't think I am asking
 for too much in this case ... I don't want to create a new skype account, and resent that I had to created a microsoft account to get someone to help me, which is a 24 hour process!

<p>We understand how important this is to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I know how frustrating it is to fill out the form multiple times and still not able to recover the account. But please be reminded that such form is established in the interest of data and account
 security. This means that the system will only grant access to the person who will be able to pass the verification process.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Even if your original information has changed, be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Kindly consider below tips when answering the said form. This has helped my previous customers:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Fill out the form from a computer and from a location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where the previous successful sign-in occurred.</span></li><li>
<span>Make sure that you use an alternate email address that you have access with in order to receive the security code and not the email address of the account you want to recover.</span></li><li>
<span>The 4 basic information (First Name, Last Name, Birthdate and Current/Old Passwords are the best and easiest way to prove your Online Identity)
</span></li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Please be reminded that you just need to fill out information that you are just 100% sure and in the best of your knowledge. You don't need to fill out everything but make sure that you
 have provided enough for you to pass this validation. The 4 basic information is more than enough to prove your identity - as long as it matches the system's record.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope this information helps! Let us know if you need further assistance.</span></p>

<p>Do you think its likely that your disk was destroyed? If the grinding sound occurred when it try to read (or spin) your disk than it was probably very damaged. I doubt someone said "FREE GAME SWEET!" and then just kept it.&nbsp;<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>A grinding noise coming from the disk tray is never good news regarding the disk.</p>

<h3> e1234567890e1234567890  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unwanted Skype account created with Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my cellphone recently and when logging into Skype for the first time on the new phone, the first option I got was to log in with my Microsoft account (using Hotmail as login name). Since my original Skype account was created with my Hotmail address,
 I assumed that was that, and signed in with my Hotmail credentials. However, this created a second Skype account, so I now have my old Skype account with all my connections and conversations, and this new Skype account which I don't want but don't know how
 to close down. Both have the same Hotmail address as part of my credentials. Please help.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>My Computer Rolled Itself Back Nearly A year. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My Computer Rolled Itself Back Nearly A year.</h2>
                    My computer rolled itself back nearly a year for seemingly no reason. Is there some way to prevent this from ever happening again, and possibly revert it back?

<p>Hi Amin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you clarify further on what was rolled back? Were your files missing? Did it rollback to a previous OS build? Or did it rollback to a previous Windows version? Getting clarity to this will allow us to give you the troubleshooting steps in resolving the
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll be waiting for your updates.</p>

                    Hello,<br />
I have a Dell Inspiron 1525, running vista. Turned it on yesterday and get a error message 'NTLDR is missing, press any key to restart'<br />
<br />
Then when you press a key, the error message keeps coming up<br />
<br />
Anyone know how I fix it?<br />

<p><span><span><span>Hi
<span>&nbsp;</span>Lee,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Do you have XP installed on a different partition?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may try these methods to resolve the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span><span>Method 1</span></span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Step 1</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Try to boot to safe mode.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Step 2</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If you are able to boot to safe mode, you may try to perform a system restore.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/What-is-System-Restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/What-is-System-Restore</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span><span>Method 2</span></span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Startup Repair is a Windows&nbsp;Vista recovery tool that can fix certain problems, such as missing or damaged system files, that might prevent Windows from
 starting correctly. When you run Startup Repair, it scans your computer for the problem and then tries to fix it so your computer can start correctly.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Insert the installation disc.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Restart your computer.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Start</strong> button, click the arrow next to the <strong>Lock</strong> button, and then click
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS
 settings. For more information, see </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>BIOS: frequently asked questions</span></a><span><span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Choose your language settings, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click
<strong>Repair your computer</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>7.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>On the System Recovery Options menu, click
<strong>Startup Repair</strong>. Startup Repair might prompt you to make choices as it tries to fix the problem, and if necessary, it might restart your computer as it makes repairs.</span></span></span></p>

                    I have three Epson Scanners (Artisan 835, Epson Perfection V500 Photo, and Epson Perfection V600 Photo) and I receive the same message when trying to scan now--"Cannot communicate with scanner.&nbsp; Make sure the scanner is on, correctly set up and connected
 with no errors indicated."&nbsp; I spent hours with Epson on phone.&nbsp; They were unable to solve.&nbsp; They suggested I contact Microsoft.&nbsp; Can you help resolve this issue for me?&nbsp; They worked fine for at least 8 months and within the last 2 weeks, none of them work
 as before.&nbsp; This issue seemed to start after the recent update to the existing Windows 10.&nbsp; I would really appreciate some help as soon as possible since I use the scanners a lot.&nbsp; Thank you.

<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

<p>Andre--thanks for the information.&nbsp;I am using Windows 10 Home, version 1709, OS Build 16299.248 (at least that is what is shows right now).&nbsp; I called Microsoft technical support and they ended up checking for corrupted files and/or other Windows issues.&nbsp;
 Those tests were completed and then the update was reinstalled.&nbsp; I did not stay on the phone with them until the reinstallation was complete.&nbsp; It appeared as though it did not resolve the problem, but it is possible that it was key to resolving the issue.&nbsp;
 I called my local computer shop (Pure Computer Solutions) and one of the owners recommended I plug the USB into a different port.&nbsp; Therefore, I shutdown the computer, moved all my printers and scanners to different USB ports and then restarted.&nbsp; Thankfully,
 all 3 EPSON scanners can communicate with the computer and are working.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to respond and try to help.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 will not see 5ghz Netgear WNHDE111</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 4. In the office we have a Netgear WNHDE111 5ghz access point. This does not show up in my available wireless list, but other 5ghz points do. I can access the Netgear with multiple other devices, it is only the SP4 that cannot see it.
 Device driver for Marvel Avastar is latest&nbsp;15.68.9037.59. The Netgear has most up to date firmware installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All suggestions welcome.</p>

<div>device before, but they have not responded. I have to be honest and say it is</div>
<div>unlikely that they will look at it. You probably need to get an external USB</div>
<div>wifi dongle if you need to connect to it if yesterday's CoSar driver update (supposed to help with 5GHz issues/performance) does not help.</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview Domain Join</h2>
                    My Pro Insider Preview was treated as a Windows Home version&nbsp;when I used the new Server Essentials connector to join a domain. An administrator account on the server was needed and now the server folders don't show up in File Explorer. I only can access
 the&nbsp; server through network. Any thoughts?
