    <title>Side-By-Side configuration error - Error ID 33 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Side-By-Side configuration error - Error ID 33</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having this issue each time my windows updates, where I basically can't open a lot of .exe programs. I saw that it could've been something to do with C++ packages not being installed but I'm certain I have them all. Sxstrace tool doesn't even open,
 and sfc /scannow gives me an error saying 'Windows Resource Protection could not start the repair service'. Here is the information from the event log:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Activation context generation failed for "System Default Context". Dependent Assembly Microsoft.Windows.IsolationAutomation,language="&amp;#x2a;",processorArchitecture="x86",publicKeyToken="6595b64144ccf1df",type="win32",version="1.0.17134.471" could not be
 found. Please use sxstrace.exe for detailed diagnosis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help. I'd hate to go back to a restore point before the update (this is what fixed it last time) as it takes a very long time.</p>
<p />

            Hi.
<br />
<br />What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

            You can also create a Windows USB bootable, to enter and recover your files and then make a new installation.

<p>You didn't upgrade from Win10 32-bit to Win10 64-bit, you did a clean install of Win10 64-bit. As such, you'll need to do a clean install of Win10 32-bit. Whether you'll be able to do so &amp; activate remains to be seen.</p>

<h2>            Creators Update&#58; What about those who made clean install. Bugs and Errors.</h2>
                    <p>hi;<br />
After reading that creators update would be available as an ISO before the schedule&nbsp;11th April update; i created a bootable usb pen drive of windows 10 pro x64 (the same version i was running before clean install) using media creation tool on the 9th April;
 and then made the clean install. the version 1703 was installed; then i installed the updates. After recent Tuesday update version is 1703 build 15063.296.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am from India, using Compaq CQ62 tu103; 4gb ram; intel(R) HD graphics; processor i3 m330 @ 2.13 GHz. Computer is almost 6years old. BIOS version Hewlett-Packard F.37.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read that microsoft later issued an advisory not to update manually. they did that when they found many specially with old PCs are facing problems after updating their system from the website; rather then waiting for updates being offered to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though it was microsoft enthusiasm that in its blog they invited to those who do not want to wait till 11th April to&nbsp;use media creation tool website for either manually update or make clean install. Well nothing wrong in such enthusiasm; but users cannot
 not be blamed if they did accepted the invitation to use that website. As far those who manually updated; i think they can still roll back to older version. But what about those who made clean install; and had no backup; and are facing problems in running
 their system. I think to those microsoft should offer another media creation tool; by which they can make another clean install and go back to the version before creators update; and then wait for the creator update being offered to them via windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though I am not facing any such problem in running my system; but still would like to bring to notice the few errors and bugs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp;Just after clean install before activation; i used sfc /scannow; it found no integrity violations; but DISM failed at 98+% on source file not found. the position remains same even after Tuesday update. sfc /scannow ok; Dism fail at 98+% on source file
 not found.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp;Just after clean install before activation; i used Chkdsk; it runs smooth; but chkdsk /f&nbsp; did not initiate on restart.&nbsp; the position remains same even after Tuesday update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)&nbsp;Just after clean install before activation; i found this error in event viewer : event id 7000‚Äúservice control manager" The CldFlt service failed to start due to the following error: The&nbsp;&nbsp; request is not supported. the position remains same even after
 Tuesday update.</p>
<p>in fact on start there is always the set of three errors on power on the laptop:<br />
first two showing same error event id 37 "appmodel-runtime" and showing same details: App Container profile failed with error 0x800700B7 because it was unable to register the&nbsp; AppContainer SID.<br />
and the third one is the above said event id 7000.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) when i began updating after clean install; i clicked "check for updates" in settings&gt; "Update &amp; Security" , but&nbsp; before any updates could be found lot of data already started flowing in.&nbsp; In fact in few minutes 4 drivers already installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; these are:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Synaptics driver update for Synaptics PS/2 Port TouchPad.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intel Corporation driver update for Intel(R) HD Graphics<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intel - Other hardware - Intel(R) Management Engine Interface<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Realtek Semiconductor Corp. - Audio Device, Other hardware - Realtek High&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition Audio.<br />
and then the "check for updates" when completed finding the new updates; these 4 drivers updates were again in the list along with other updates. &nbsp;so after updates the "update history" in settings showed 8 drivers installed; all 4 above said drivers shown installed
 twice.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) under group policy "gpedit" i made the choice of disabling automatic updates of store apps. but whenever i use "check updates", in the store app.; instead of&nbsp;providing the list of updates found; if it found any update it starts automatically downloading
 the updates.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>6) whenever i update any apps offered in store; the data downloaded on a app update is always about 30% to 60% more then the size of that app shown being installed. I have&nbsp; only pre installed apps; no new apps installed. i am noticing this discrepancy since
 anniversary update; not sure whether that behaviour existed before that. earlier also brought this point to the forum notice; but no satisfactory reply received.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) storage option for "offline Maps" in system settings under storage; "choose where new content is saved"&nbsp; is always C: drive; even when usb pen drive is active. for other options like media etc. usb pen drive option is shown.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>8)<strong> in Bluetooth options though the option "Allow other Bluetooth devices to find this PC", is unchecked; meaning the pc should not be found by other devices. but my phones do find my pc's Bluetooth and are able to send and receive files without pairing.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>9) after use of "night light" option" is switched off; the display turns back is snowy; have to again reset display by going into "graphic properties" of intel graphics.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>10) 4 sets of Event ID 10016 "DistributedCom" occurs once in a while; probably after 30 to 90 minutes of switching on the computer.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>11) when "signs off" the account; above said event id 37 occurs one time immediately.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>12) when "sigs in" into other account, above said event id 10016 occurs twice immediately.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>13) in control panel under &gt; "internet options"&gt;&gt; "general"&gt;&gt;&gt;"settings"&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"temporary Internet files"&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "check for newer version of stored pages", i select "Never"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and then ok. when i exit internet options and click back internet options and go back
 to same settings i found my option turned back to "Automatically", from&nbsp;"Never", by itself. though in internet options under
<strong>internet explorer</strong> the option "never" still remains selected. same behaviour existed before anniversary update; now it is back after creators update.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>14) when I use my 4g phone or some other mifi device as dongle via usb tethering; in the device manger it is shown as "Remote NDIS based Internet Sharing Device" using the driver by default "Remote NDIS based Internet Sharing Device" provided by the D-Link
 company; though similar named driver is also proved by "microsoft", but it is not choosen by default; it is D-Link driver. the whole system and internet connection begans to lag and jerk. even choosing the driver "Remote NDIS based Internet Sharing Device"
 provided by microsoft does not solve the problem; it is only when the driver is changed to "Remote NDIS Compatiable Device" provided by the Microsoft; the system becomes stable and data begans to flow smoothly.</p>
<p><br />
I only use Excel in office 2013 home edition; and do simple internet surfing and email check. i finding no difficulty in there. i don't use store apps or any thing else; so can not comment on functionality of store&nbsp;apps and other programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if on going above errors and bugs, it is felt that these would not have arisen if i had waited for updates rather then doing "clean install"; then i request for providing an iso of "pre creator update version"; so that i can make another clean install to
 the &nbsp;old version, and thereafter install the creator updates when offered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p>Hi NAWABDERA NAWAB IKRAMULLAH KHAN, <br />

    <title>blue circle on network icon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bigfattyplus  say:</h3>
<h2>            blue circle on network icon</h2>
                    <p>Since yesterday, I have been having issues with a blue circle on my network icon. &nbsp;I can access the internet, but it preventing some services from activating, such as Sony Vegas and Kaspersky. &nbsp;I check what services are stuck and the only one is Belkin Network
 USB Helper. &nbsp;I can't stop it as it says access is denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure how to fix this as I am not very computer savvy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: &nbsp;When I retstart in safe mode with network options, I am able to see anything wrong. &nbsp;I restart the computer and there is no issue. &nbsp;Is safe mode making something happen that should happen normally?</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can access the internet except for those two sites, the issue might be on the sites mentioned. We would like to know more about the issue, please answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When you try to access those sites, did you encounter any error message? If yes, please send a screenshot.</li><li>Were there any changes made before this issue happened?</li><li>When you started in Safe Mode, were you able to access those sites?</li></ul>
<p>To answer your question, starting in Safe Mode will let Windows start in a basic state, it will only use a limited set of drivers and files. Allowing you to troubleshoot your PC. Kindly check this

<p>No, those aren't sites. &nbsp;The SERVICES are my Kaspersky anti virus software and my Sony Vegas video editor. &nbsp;Like I said, internet runs fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I mistyped about safe mode (I posted when tired). &nbsp;I meant that when I am in SAFE MODE, I CAN'T see anything wrong. &nbsp;I check my router settings and find nothing wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it seems today, the problem has fixed itself. &nbsp;When I booted my pc up, I checked task manager's services tab to watch and see if the&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Belkin Network USB Helper would hang again, but
 everything went through as normal. &nbsp;But I would like to know how to prevent or fix this in the future.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As for when it started, it happen a few days ago when I updated Internet Explorer. &nbsp;After it was done updating, it asked if I would like to restart now or later, and I selected later because
 I was just gonna shut down and head to bed.</span></span></p>

<p>Sorry for the double post, but I think I have found the issue. &nbsp;The issue came back this morning, so I booted safe mode and looked around again. &nbsp;It seems that sxuptp driver was having an issue (this driver seems to be related to the Belkin Network USB Helper)
 so I disabled it while in safe mode and then restarted. &nbsp;Now the problem (for the moment) is gone (though I did get a popup on start-up from Belkin Network USB Center saying a network error has occurred). &nbsp;And I don't really need the helper, because I don't
 have any wireless printers and such (and if I did, I would use a wired connection, anyway) and all my other devices can still use the internet wifi normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, just in case this issue returns, how can I fix it? &nbsp;Is there normally an issue with this driver?</p>

            UPDATE: &nbsp;The issue came back today when I powered on my computer. &nbsp;So, I booted into safe mode and UNINSTALLED the Belkin Printer and Storage Center and rebooted normally. &nbsp;And I can't find any trace of the service in the task manager, so hopefully, I
 will not see it again.

            Hi Zeljko,<br />probably the program is not fully compatible with latest Windows version. Please contact program developer's support. Or try to run a program in compatibility mode - see settings in program file's properties.

            Hi  Sanazaki
<br />
<br />When you connect that flash drive do you get any error or does Windows simply not see that drive?
<br />
<br />Do you have access to a non-Windows 10 PC, if so, connect that drive and check to see if the flash drive works on that PC?

<p>While I do agree flash should be supported, pretty much all of the other platforms out there also do not support flash. &nbsp;It could have something to do with the access to free content with flash, in that for whatever reason none of the companies want you
 spending time on games that are not made for the consoles themselves...</p>
<p><br />
Also, I would assume there may be a license cost in order to allow flash to run on the consoles, where as on PC it seems to be free. (though, probably paid, through the cost of windows).</p>

<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can't play flash content on the Xbox browser and it is unlikely there will be an update for it's inclusion.</p>
<p>Flash is being replaced for newer web technologies, namely HTML5 (which is supported by the Xbox so you can view things such as YouTube). This will take a few years however to become the standard.</p>
<p>Also, this is more of a suggestion than something supports help would be needed for. There is a forum for suggestion located
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_feedback/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> if you wish to post more suggestions</p>

<p>That's the whole point, kinda rolled up in one ball, Microsoft doesn't want anyone playing FB games on the 360, when they could be playing, or accessing 360 content. Also, even if they implemented flash FB games would be the last thing on earth they would
 ever support. FB games are coded like garbage, they are constantly crashing, they're memory hogs, and for friends of friends who play such games it's annoying, (all the invite, and game content, posting crap). Plus, the exact same scenario would be played
 out a million times a day: crappy FB game would crash constantly, like usual, and even though FB gamers would swear otherwise, guess who would be *** @ Microsoft all day, and night; even though it has nothing 2 do with them. Then the 360, etc, would start
 getting a bad name, which in turn would severely impact sales, and all for an issue that is not even their problem.
</p>
<p>The best part would be the fact that FB games would crash the 360, etc. (just like they do to computers), and once again Microsoft would get named, and the system would be called crap. That is exactly why FB, Twitter, even YouTube, etc. are so scaled down,
 and barely like the computer versions, because Microsoft doesn't need, or want the hassle of having to deal with other companies problems, (and I believe it was also already pointed out, licensing deals would also be a pain in the ***).
</p>
<p>I actually have a perfect, personal experience that speaks to what I'm saying. I use YouTube a lot on my 360, and almost like clock work, YouTube crashes my 360 40% of the time that I use YouTube.
</p>
<p>The same kind of thing is the reason why it took so long for the 360 to get a browser, (even though everyone else had it right out of the box). It's a pain in the ***, then you need to worry about security, (which would be out of control if the browser was
 flash enabled, because flash is notorious for their security issues. But @the end of the day it's just not worth it, look @ IE as it is now, it runs like garbage, looks like crap, and the functionality is pathedic, (IMO, I believe pressure is the only reason
 Microsoft implemented IE, because they new better, but the people got what the people wanted).

<p>It has nothing to do with facebook, it has to do with Flash itself being unstable and far too easy to hack.</p>
<p>Give it a few years and no one will be using flash anymore.</p>

<p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query at Microsoft community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>BITS is also known as Background Intelligent Transfer Service. It is used by Windows update as Windows automatically installs updates without the users input. When
 ever there is any Windows update it will install in the background and sometimes it may take some bandwidth. You may make some changes to Windows update settings and check if it helps. Click on Settings&gt;Update and Recovery&gt;Advanced Options&gt;Change the option
 to Slow.<br />
Please let us know the results.</span></span></p>

            Thanks for replying but i cant find the slow option i only see Notify to schedule restart and etc. Is it possible to use the task manager to lower priority of the said process like on windows old versions. Also I ended the BITS is there a possibility that
 it will come back automatically to install and download new updates.

Many of these devices such as HP Stream came in a variety of colors with a full copy of Windows 8.1. Attractive qualities include an affordable price and a 11 or 13 inch display. Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations. This makes it difficult to install Windows 10 the conventional way.

            <p>you didn't specify when posting this what operating system you're using, so</p>
<p>If you're using xp, click start, select control panel, then in the new window, click add or remove programs. From there, find flyff, and select it, then hit uninstall.</p>
<p>If you're using vista or 7, in the start menu, simply search "add or remove programs" and click it when it pops up, then do the same as above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is what you're doing and you get that error message, try selecting flyff and see if there's a repair option. That might get that missing/broken file that gives that message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, this probably should have been posted in the gaming section.</p>

            <p>Hi, Lukeshindle,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; You can try reinstalling flyff v.18 to ensure files are intact then uninstall through Control Panel &gt; Uninstall Programs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Download CCleaner . (free utility) and&nbsp;Use the uninstaller.</p>

            <p>Hi, Roblippert,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found this workaround which&nbsp;may be hard to decipher but most of it isin English</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Step 1: Uninstall flyff v18</div>
<div>Step 2: Install flyff v18</div>
<div>Step 3: Open flyff folder then right click neuz.exe, create shortcut sa desktop.
(take note wag muna irurun ang flyff.)</div>
<div>Step 4: Go to desktop, right click neuz.exe click properties.</div>
<div>Step 5: Under the target itype ang word na "sunkist" bale idudugtong nyo lang ung word na sunkist wala kayo idedelete.</div>
<div>Ex: C:/Program Files/Flyff/Neuz.exe sunkist</div>
<div>with space po yan.</div>
<div>Step 6: Run Neuz.exe sa desktop :</div>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<div>Ang purpose po nito para hindi nya ipatch ung bagong patch which is may error.</div>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<div>Happy Leveling :)</div>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<div>Edit: Don't forget to delete neuz.ini under flyff folder para hindi sya mag Wrong I.D</div>

<div>1. Go to the start menu and go to 'All Programs'</div>
<div>2. Locate the Flyff Folder. You will notice only Flyff is in here.</div>
<div>3. Drag the Flyff Folder (folder and file) to your Recycle Bin.</div>
<div>4. Empty Recycle Bin.</div>
<div>5. Go to Uninstall a Program, and uninstall Flyff. It will say it has already been Uninstalled.</div>
<div>6. Enjoy not having a game that doesn't work!</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Introducing CCleaner
<div>
<p>This section provides background information on CCleaner. You'll discover what it is and what you can use it for. You'll also find out how it supports every current version of Windows, and the few things it can't do.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.piriform.com/docs/ccleaner/introducing-ccleaner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/docs/ccleaner/introducing-ccleaner</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CCleaner can uninstall programs just like the Add/Remove Programs part of Windows' Control Panel.<br />
CCleaner is better, though, because once you've installed a lot of programs, the Add/Remove Programs applet takes a long time to start. CCleaner lets you see a list of all your programs right away.</p>
<p>Another reason CCleaner is better is that you can simply delete an entry in the Programs to Remove list. Why would you do this? Say you uninstalled the program before, but it didn't quite uninstall itself correctly and it's still listed as an installed program.
 Or say you deleted the program folder manually without running the installer.</p>
<p>Either way, you can delete the entry in the installed programs list. Note that deleting the entry doesn't uninstall the program. It's like taking an item off a restaurant menu - doing so doesn't delete the dish from the kitchen!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over time, the Registry can become cluttered with missing or broken items as you install, upgrade, and uninstall software and updates. CCleaner can help you clean out the Registry so you'll have fewer errors. The Registry will run faster, too.</p>

<h2>            Power Surge on USB port</h2>
                    <p>I have surface pro 2017, i7, 1TB for my personal use. I bought this in 2017. At the same time I also bought a WD My Passport Wireless 2 TB external drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I generally used to connect WD My Passport external drive with my surface pro 2017 via the My Passport's own wireless connection. In office I connect My Passport with my office HP or Lenovo laptops via the USB connection of the My Passport. Today I connected
 My Passport with my surface pro 2017 via the USB connection and after a minute when the WD My Passport tried to recharge itself, Surface pro suddenly gave an error "Power surge on the USB port" and the My Passport external drive became inaccessible. The message
 kept on appearing. Initially I thought that maybe the surface pro is on battery and therefore cannot supply enough power to the My Passport, however the message again appeared after I had connected the surface pro to power. Considering that such a message
 doesn't appear when I connect the My passport to other laptops like Lenovo and HP, I have reached the conclusion that the problem is with surface pro and not with WD My Passport external drive. Please help me to trouble shoot as it is very important and urgent
 for me because my office forced a bitlocker encryption on the WD My Passport and because of that I can no longer connect any device with my Passport external drive via the My Passport's own wireless. I can only connect via the USB ports.</p>

            <p>Surface devices do not have enough power over USB to power many peripherals. You<br />can use a POWERED USB hub between the drive and your Surface. (This is the case<br />for all Surface devices and has been all along.)</p>

<p>As they say, there is always a first time, this is probably the first time that my surface pro has let me down :(</p>
<p>Microsoft should consider increasing the power in the USB port.</p>
