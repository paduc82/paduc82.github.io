<h2>            what does it mean if a folder is grayed out&#63;</h2>
                    I have a few folders like the common folders that are grayed out. I didn't cut them out of their place to move to another area of my harddrive. And then I had a folder that had weird numbers in the color blue. I managed to find an answer for the second
 problem and there was something about compressed files? I can't remember.<br />
<br />
I've never seen this happen! It's really scaring me. Especially since these folders - there's no way I could have gotten them on there and to have to allow myself to enter the folders (the grayed out one) only to find more folders that have numbers on them
 and when I go back out, it's locked. I want to just delete them but I'm also trying to figure out if someone's trying to get on my laptop? Um... I don't know a person named william or whatever it was. I found that name in a title in one of the folders. More
 stuff is being added to these folders - things I have never seen as time goes.<br />

            <p>Hi Martha,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your issue description I understand that you have found a folder which is grayed out and different folder that had weird numbers
 in the color blue. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In order to provide you with a quick resolution, please reply to these questions:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the exact location of these folders?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>From where did you find it?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A grayed-out folder usually appears when a folder is "hidden" and you have enabled the option to show hidden files
 and folders in Folder Options.<span>&nbsp; </span>Not being able to view the contents of this folder is more likely a permissions problem.</span></p>

            Hi Stacey.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />1) For sound problems first try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Go into Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, find the Headset device, on Driver tab choose Update Driver, then Automatic.  If that fails try Roll Back button, if available.  If not try Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall driver.  If these all fail from Driver tab choose Update Driver, then Browse, then Let me Pick, try all previous drivers. 
<br />
<br />3) Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Screen going crazy</h2>
                    After the last 2 windows update my computer touch screen has gone crazy. Some dots appear as if someone is randomly touching my screen and then new pages open. Seems as if the computer is possessed. Has anyone faced this issue and knows how to fix it?

<p>Sorry everyone, the xbox forum seems to have cut off the majority of my post!</p>
<p>Bit random but www.placeforgamers.co.uk (a UK based gaming community I am with) are putting on an informal community night on Gears 2 this evening.</p>
<p>If you want an evening of stable multiplayer either hop on the forum or send me a FR. Playing doesnt mean you are obligated to join or anything, just nice to get some friendly and full private games going.</p>
<p>It will be from around 8:30pm UK time. Just hop in and out whenever it suits you though
</p>
<p>Hope to be chainsawed by some of you later tonight!</p>

<p>Hi Kamesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first imported the names and mobile numbers from a CSV file by following the below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Search--&gt; Contacts--&gt; Import --&gt; Choose the CSV file; this will convert the CSV file to windows contact format.</p>
<p>2. Contacts--&gt;export--&gt; &nbsp;VCF --&gt; will convert the windows contact to VCF file. This step gives an error message "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Error Exporting contacts".</span></p>

<h2>            A corrected hardware error has occurred</h2>
                    <p>Recently, within the past week or so, my computer has been locking up to a point to where I have to hard reboot the PC. The mouse still moves around however, I am unable to open task manager, remote in via Team Viewer, Remote Desktop, or UltraVNC.</p>

 one. I came across this error when its sitting idle, or just pushing content to the PS3 via PS3 Media server. I did build it as a gaming machine, however I mainly use it for running virtual machines and normal every day stuff. I built this computer about 2
 years ago.</p>

            Thank you for your response. My boss did suggest to me to update the bios as well. I will do the update for the processor and see how that goes.

            I have completed the firmware update for the Bios. I will run the computer like normal for a week and I will let you know how it goes. If that does not solve the problem, then I will attempt an update for the processor. Not sure how to do that exactly,
 but I will see how this goes first

            Looks like the motherboard BIOS update has solved the issue. Have not seen the event pop backup. I think its good now!

<h2>            Delete or move recipient names</h2>
                    How do you delete a contact on your main list of mail recipients??&nbsp; I've tried right clicking on the name.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to select a recipient name and move it to an established group??

What's an "established group"?&nbsp; What mail client are you using?</p>

<h2>            April 2018 update</h2>
                    I'd like to let anyone know that it is not recommended to update to the latest version of windows 10. It's causing system failures just the same way as the anniversary update. Microsoft is not learning from their mistakes. My thinkpad is freezing every
 few minutes and this is something that didn't happen before updating.&nbsp;

            I'll wait and see. I had no issues with the Insider Preview at 1803 on a test machine. I don't think your statement about not testing new builds is correct, that is one reason for the Insider program.

            Well microsoft had the same issues with the anniversary update. Thousands of people were affected by freezing due the update. It looks like many people will be affected on this update too but this doesnt mean anyone is having issues but its still better

            Waiting for the next update will be for the build you are on now. The next major update will be in 6 months time and the chances are if your device doesn't support the 1803 it won't support 1807. Is the device supported by the manufacturer for Windows
 10.

</p><p>what kind of lenovo thinkpad model are you using? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had freezing/hanging problems with an old Dell Inspiron laptop (e1405 model) when the v1703 creators update first came out in April 2017.&nbsp; turned out it was incompatible with some old hardware in that inspiron laptop which took Microsoft several months
 to fix with a cumulative update (an august 2017 update for 1703 resolve the hanging problems) and was later fixed in the next feature update, the 1709 release.</p>

            PS ive found out why its been freezing. Its only when I use google chrome so it seems Microsoft doesn't want us to use chrome anymore. Ive reinstalled chrome and use the latest version and its still freezing. Been now using Microsoft Edge for the day and
 no freezing at all.&nbsp;

            <p>&nbsp;According to your report from SFC, you have corrupt files that it was unable to repair.&nbsp; You need to copy that file CBS.LOG from where it is to another folder and open it to see which files are corrupted.&nbsp; If you unplugged a running laptop while it had
 no battery in it, you can bet that it would've caused problems.&nbsp; You won't know how serious a problem you have nor what action to take until you analyze or post that CBS.LOG though.&nbsp; If only applications are affected, you can just reinstall, but if it's critical
 Windows components, you&nbsp;may need to reinstall Windows.&nbsp; In any event <strong>be sure to back any data you want to keep</strong> and do it ASAP because until we know more, your computer could cease to boot at any time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

<p><span>Why do many people stay in the match for just about the ENTIRE match and when there is &lt;1.00 left on the clock and they are on the losing team they back out? Is the majority of the CoD Community a group
 of sore losers? Seriously you can't expect to win every single match you play. </span>

<p><span>What happened to playing for FUN?</span></p>

</p><p>Have you now or ever had installed a third party defrag utility?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has the system ever been upgraded to Windows 10 and then reverted back to Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if this helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something like this:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Has the system ever been upgraded to Windows 10 and then reverted back to Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you now or have you ever had a third party defragmentation application installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 comes with a Scheduled Task to defragment all volumes every Wednesday at 1:00AM.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have ever upgraded the system to Windows 10 and then reverted back to Windows 7 sometimes that will corrupt every Scheduled Task on your system (sometimes fixable).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have installed some third party application that includes it's own defrag or other kind of maintenance operations it may have disabled the built in Windows 7 task.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have disabled the built in Windows 7 task yourself you will see that message when you attempt to open defrag (non believers try it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the task has been disabled and you click the Remove settings button that should enable the task again and (after a moment) you should see:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Something you have installed could prevent or override that setting though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
Task Scheduler</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose to Run as administrator:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If Task Scheduler opens with lots of complaining about corrupted tasks that is a symptom of a botched Windows 7 to Windows 10 back to Windows 7 reversion and is a different problem (sometimes fixable).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Task Scheduler opens fine check the Defrag task to see if it has been Disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you look in Task Scheduler you should see the task and be sure the Status column says Ready and not Disabled:</p>
<p>

<p>In your message you brought up two points which pretty much identify my problem-&nbsp; 1) I have in the past had an outside defragmenter&nbsp;&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; I have upgraded to windows 10 and reverted back to Windows 7 ( at the time I was using prepaid data using&nbsp; a Dongle,
 it wouldn't work.&nbsp; After reading your message I looked into task scheduler and it appears that every scheduled task has been affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm on Australian NBN and if it's not too costly I'm considering upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp; Hope its worth it.</p>

<p>Yes - the problem is the botched Windows 10 back to Windows 7 process which is well known, happens on some systems and there is no solution from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most folks would notice the problem when their Windows backups began to malfunction (because they run on a Scheduled Task too).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was quite a popular problem last year with the free Windows 10 upgrade offer and some clever person figured out a way to fix all the corrupted Scheduled Tasks</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made some generic instructions you can look at and decide if it is right for you or will you just reinstall the OS of choice:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The problem is probably more than just the backup task - that is just the first thing that folks notice is wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To see the extent of the problem open Task Scheduler and if it complains about lots of corrupted tasks you have a bigger problem than just the backup task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is some summary from an earlier bleak post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that when reverting back to Windows 7 the registry parts of the Scheduled Tasks are restored but the Windows 7 tasks files themselves are not restored (they are still Windows 10) so now there is a conflict and hence the corruption - things
 are not matching up like they should.&nbsp; The problem usually surfaces first when folks try to set their backup schedule up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The chances are very high that <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ALL</span>
</strong>your Scheduled Tasks are corrupted (about 80 of them) and some of them are pretty important if you want your Windows 7 to behave properly.&nbsp; You can open Task Scheduler and poke around in some of the Tasks and see if they are functional or do they also
 report corruption?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
Task Scheduler</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose to Run as administrator:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=15aeb07f-c8c5-4aae-9aad-0483b81960a7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/624f26dd-96f3-4ab8-8be7-c31c6430af43" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>How many tasks are reported as corrupted?&nbsp; Most of them?&nbsp; All of them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think that just fixing the backup task is going to be enough to have a healthy system is all of the other Windows Tasks are corrupted and not working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me assure you with 100% certainty that no advice from any of the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer alleged "experts" is going to fix all those corrupted tasks.&nbsp; You
<em>might </em>fix the backup task, maybe,&nbsp; You would think that as many times as this has come up they would be able to recognize the problem (they are the "experts").</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some nice person named Dijji has already figured out this problem and developed a nifty method/program to straighten out the Scheduled Tasks and people report that this method works pretty well and you can read about it here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://repairtasks.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://repairtasks.codeplex.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It might help to understand the problem better if you to read through the Home and Documentation tabs first so you can walk through the repair process.&nbsp; Note that there is a separate Discussion tab where folks report success, issues, problems and questions.&nbsp;
 The Discussions are helpful too when you read them and see what kinds of things folks like you have run into and how to fix them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Windows 7 community most of the time the CodePlex method works just fine (whew!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-update/task-scheduler-multiple-image-is-corrupt-or-has/6205cb04-a749-4f4f-a5be-632e01989158">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-update/task-scheduler-multiple-image-is-corrupt-or-has/6205cb04-a749-4f4f-a5be-632e01989158</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But if there are any issues or problems consider pursuing them in the Discussion tab on their page first (they know what they are doing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally you have to consider that if reverting back to Windows 7 corrupted all your Scheduled Tasks what other things on your system are now afflicted/broken that you don't know about yet?&nbsp; In the future if you have a problem are you always going to wonder
 if the problem was caused by some Windows 10 leftovers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some frequent contributors in the Windows 7 community feel the only way to be 100% sure your Windows 7 system is whole again is to backup all your personal files and folders, whack your hard drive and do a clean/fresh install of Windows from scratch but
 that is a lot of work.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>It would appear to be incorrect information that you &nbsp;have been given&nbsp;about what Keys to press at Boot&nbsp;to start the Recovery process back to Factory Settings on HP, Dell and Acer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the Keys you use to access the Windows 7&nbsp;Recovery partition in these Brands</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>HP uses F11</u></strong></p>
Recover Windows 7 Operating System Using HP Recovery
<div><span><strong>Restore the PC to its original condition using the f11 key if Windows 7 is not accessible</strong></span>
<div>If the PC cannot launch into Windows, it may still be possible to use the HP Recovery Manager on the hard drive to restore the computer to its original operating condition. The Recovery Manager can be launched during the startup process by following the
 steps below.</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Press the <b>Power button</b> to start the PC, and then press the <span>f11</span> key when the standard BIOS prompts are displayed on the black screen.</div>
<div>

<div><span>NOTE:</span>Pressing the <span>f11</span> key during startup on a computer with an HP factory image will start the system recovery process even if the prompt is not displayed.
<div>
<ul>
<div>
<li>If the HP Recovery Manager can access the recovery partition on the hard drive, a prompt to backup the user files before beginning the recovery is displayed. Follow any on-screen instructions.</li></div>
<div>
<li>If the HP Recovery Manager cannot access the hard drive to fix any system errors, you will need to use the personalized recovery disc that you created to recover the hard drive to its original condition.</li></div>
<div>
<li>
<div>If you have not created the personalized recovery disc, or the discs are corrupted, you can order a replacement recovery disc from HP.</div>
</li></div>
</ul>
</li><li>
<div>When the Recovery Manager starts, follow the <a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01895783&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=uk&amp;dlc=en#RecoverySteps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
step-by-step system recovery instructions</a> shown above.</div>
</li></ol>
<div><strong>Resolving a common recovery issue.</strong></div>
<div>If the Recovery Manager cannot be launched from either the desktop, or by pressing the f11 key on startup, you can use the recovery disc to restore the computer to the original operating condition in Windows 7.</div>

 pop up and my settings aren't opening. It's telling me "this file does not have a program associated with it.....blah blah." I've yet to test the other stuff but it's a bit difficult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            surface pro pen experience compared to ipad pro</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in the middle of taking a decision to buy a tablet and the contenders are Ipad pro and Surface pro. I wanted some feedback from the forum to help me with the decision. My key objective is to take Notes using oneNote and work in the Office 365 connected
 environment. I have come across articles/feedback that taking regular notes using microsoft Pen with Surface Pro is not as smooth and stable as it is with the Apple pen with ipad Pro.&nbsp; Is there some substance to this ? cause if there are issues in this space,
 then taking decision would be very easy :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>for this kind of task, i.e. daily Note taking and regular pc/laptop usage, is i7 an overkill ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>many thanks for your help,</p>
<p>N</p>

<p>So,</p>
<p>I have had my Surface 4 Pro i7 since 2016 the day it was released. It has been a great machine. I have had not problems with the machine, accept when I dropped it and it was fixed under the extended warrantee. They took mine and refurbished it or gave me
 a refurbished machine 4 days later. It has been VERY reliable. I use it daily as I am a doctor and I use if for patient care with every patient I see. I is very stable and works well. The screen is breathtaking with its high resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problems (and this comes to the pen is a second) are that the pen is $100.00 to replace and the pen tips are $20.00 if you can find them. This is a pain. As in the Apple pen there is a AAAA battery in it. I love the pen when it is working. I draw with
 it and take notes on the screen with it for conferences and church. (don't worry there is no patient related information the surface. It is all on a sever) The pen has great response I use a cone shaped tip that allows for thick to thin lines and with more
 pressure increases the intensity of color.&nbsp; I really like this pen. I have used the Apple pen and I do not like it as well as the surface 4 pen. I have not used the lower pens for the surfaces but this works really well and has nice flow and is responsive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing that is annoying with the surface is the chargers. They work really well but where the wire comes out of the brick to the tablet is a weak spot. If you do not take the charger with you there will be no problems. If you are coiling the wire
 a lot or wrapping it around the brick the wires will break in the insulation and make you crazy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last note. GET a case for it. They have made the surface SO thin that it is hard to hold onto (hence the dropping needing to have the machine refurbished/replaced). Kensington Blackbelt 2nd degree. You can not beat this case!!! Simple and grippy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know if the i7 is overkill. I love it and it is fast!! Doing what I do I can not be waiting. Also it works really well with the 3D Paint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps. with your search for a machine to work with.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 64-bit Enterprise experiencing BSOD with widely varied causes increasingly frequent</h2>
                    <ul>
<li>I've had Windows 10 Enterprise 64-bit running on a computer I assembled myself, based on an ASUS B85M-E motherboard with 2GB RAM, for about a year. I’ve experienced a rare BSOD or two until recently, when they have become increasingly frequent. Lately it's
 been happening several times a day. The reasons I find in Event Viewer have been widely varied, but perhaps the most frequent is:<br />
<br />
“The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck.&nbsp; The bugcheck was: 0x0000003b (0x00000000c0000005, 0xfffff800681a940e, 0xfffffb8038ff4f80, 0x0000000000000000). A dump was saved in: C:\WINDOWS\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: c36a3fc4-9b7e-4cbb-8381-3dfa6a941486.”<br />
<br />
I have uploaded a zip file containing the dumpfiles and a text file with the output of msinfo32 to https://1drv.ms/t/s!Au1L33OL0M16ca7lFt5gnxa0E1k
<br />
<br />
another BSOD occurred while I was composing this post (the first time around). Fortunately I had already zipped up the minidump files and uploaded them to OneDrive before it happened. (This last generated an error stating that dumpfile creation had failed.)
 In case it’s relevant the last BSOD also failed a bugcheck: 0x00000109. An additional error generated this time was:
<br />
<br />
Session "EventLog-AirSpaceChannel" stopped due to the following error: 0xC0000188”,
<br />
<br />
and another: <br />
<br />
“The Windows Defender Antivirus Network Inspection System Driver service failed to start due to the following error:
<br />
Windows cannot verify the digital signature for this file. A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source.”<br />
<br />
I’ve tried everything I could find to try to eliminate the problem including: <br />
<br />
- Windows Driver Check – no problems<br />
<br />
- Windows memory check – no problems<br />
<br />
- Chkdsk – no problems<br />
<br />
- Ensured that the video driver is the latest release from Microsoft, which is newer than the one available on the ASUS website.<br />
<br />
- Updated the BIOS to the latest version<br />
<br />
- Ensured that all of the hardware drivers are at the latest revision. <br />
<br />
- Removed hardware that wasn’t being used, specifically a USB three add-on card for which I could find no Windows 10 driver.<br />
<br />
I Run Windows Defender as the only anti-malware protection.<br />
<br />
Although I'm not aware that any of my installed software is causing problems, it may be significant to note that both Firefox and Chrome browsers have become prone to crashing, but to my knowledge neither has caused a BSOD. After either of these browsers crash
 they can only be revived by rebooting the computer. As I was preparing to upload the output of msinfo32 I found that 7zip inexplicably would not start, and when I came back to MS Word it was nowhere to be found. Sensing another BSOD in the making I rebooted
 the computer.<br />
Nothing that I've done so far has helped, and the problem continues to get worse.
<br />
Any and all assistance will be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
JerryG<br />

            Hi Jerry,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />In the link you have shared, I can only see System information file. Can you upload the minidump files again?

</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I'm sorry I assumed that both files would show up with the same link, but obviously I was wrong about that. The dump files are here: https://1drv.ms/u/s!Au1L33OL0M16cAWx_TFmwXEUz6k<br />

            I looked at the dumps and notice there isn't a 3rd party driver that is involved. The Symptomps you say point to Windows corruption.
<br />
<br />Download and run HDTune .
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.hdtune.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hdtune.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Select the Disk where OS is installed.
<br />
<br />Make screenshots of the following
<br />the health
<br />the error scan
<br />the benchmark
<br />Post back the screenshots.

<p>Sumit, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks once again for your reply. I wasn't sure that I would be able to get my computer to boot in order to give you the additional information, but at last I did get it running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the link for the screen captures that you requested: <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Au1L33OL0M16ck9lT8qbW6bqm2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://1drv.ms/u/s!Au1L33OL0M16ck9lT8qbW6bqm2o</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, the error that kept the computer from booting yesterday afternoon was "Thread exception not handled". When the computer rebooted it went into a recursive cycle, but finally attempted an automatic repair, which as usual failed, and then I was given
 the option to troubleshoot or continue trying to boot. Since it worked in the past I tried to continue booting, and I was able to get back to the desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your comments reminded me that I had neglected to mention that I successfully ran the system file checker perhaps two weeks ago, so I tried it again yesterday but it failed. I then ran DISM.exe and it also failed, twice. Both times it stoped at 13% completion
 with the error: designated buffer contains ill formed data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then downloaded an ran hdtune, producing the results that I've posted to One Drive. It was right after this that I got another "thread exception not handled" error which put the system back into a recursive BSOD state that I didn't think I was going to
 be able get out of. When it reached the option to continue the boot process I tried to let it, but for the first time this, too, failed. At last I powered down the machine for the night. This morning I had the same problem but successfully continued the boot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been fearing some sort of bizarre hardware failure, but have yet to encoutered a hardware error, or at least one that I recognize as such. It does appear to me that I'm at the point where I need to re-install Windows 10, but I am unsure how to go about
 this in a way that won't wipe out my data and preserve my installed applications. I realize that this may not be possible at all, but thought I'd mention it in case you know&nbsp; a way :o).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your assistance. I would be happy to provide any additional data that may be required, assuming my computer continues to cooperate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Hello again, Sumit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't yet run out of patience with me, you will be happy to hear that I finally realized that the misunderstanding is all mine. I've evidently been putting in too many hours in my zeal to solve this problem. :o|</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have posted the data on the last two runs of chkdsk <a href="https://1drv.ms/t/s!Au1L33OL0M16c6VG9FGX94nMAB0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here. </a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the first chkdsk ran automatically (and found and corrected some errors). I initiated a system restore from a restore point I had created after uninstalling MS System Diagnostics v2.2 a few days ago. The restore operation reported a failure:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"An unspecified error occurred during System Restore: (Removed Debug Diagnostics 2 Update 2). Additional information: 0x81000204."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had intended to repeat the same restore operation hoping that it would now run, but found my only option was to remove whatever part of it had succeeded. Even so, the system stability is improved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using event viewer with filters as you suggested is a powerful troubleshooting tool. Thanks for bringing it to my attention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding, Sumit. I will be very appreciative of any further guidance you can offer.</p>
<p>

    <title>Remove Windows 10 and go back to Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derekkered  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove Windows 10 and go back to Windows 7</h2>
                    i had Windows 7. Two days ago I got a message update now or tonight. I try to find a no thanks options in but since there was not I had to click tonight and shut down my computer right after it. I tried to start it up but it start to install windows 10.
 Now that it finally install after 2 days of down time since it took that long to install. None of my programs work. I can not get the start menu to open in Windows 10. I power it down by press the power button and reboot. Now it is stuck in some loop trying
 to install updates and fails and reboots. etc etc etc. I can not get anything to work.
<p>How can I break the loop and get my normal Windows 7 back?</p>
<p>Who do I contact at MS to get reimbursed for wasting my time, energy, breaking my internet cap downloading an OS that does not work, making me try to fix a problem caused by them, etc, etc, etc, etc?</p>
<p>The people that created Windows 10 should be lay off ASAP. Or send them to fix my broken computer ASAP.</p>
