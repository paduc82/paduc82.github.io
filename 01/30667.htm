<h2>            File History wont open&#33;</h2>
                    Hey Community,<br />
<br />
My Problem with the File History is that i cant open it at all not, even the Settings.<br />
If i go to the Settings and then to backup it wont show me any settings like adding drive ect.<br />
In the Control panel i can click on the File History button but it wont open at all.<br />
All updates are done and the problem exists since a while now.<br />
<br />
Hope you can help me its horrible to not have a backup of my system!

<p>Hi Ar4S,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue you're experiencing might be due to incorrect settings or corrupted system files. Another factor that we want to consider is that File History might be turned off. Here's how you can check:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Control </strong><strong>Panel</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>System and Security</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>File </strong><strong>History</strong>, and then click <strong>
Turn on</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If File History is already switched on and the issue persists, create a new user, replicate what you're trying to do, and check if the same issue persists. Here is an

<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

            i solved it!<br />
<br />
thank you, but not with your suggestions! You didnt noticed that i was writing that i cant click on File History in the Control Panel!<br />
<br />
I restarted the windows search engine because i heard it can cause problems like this. After rebooting everything was working.

    <title>Xbox One keeps disconnecting from Wifi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ua x nexus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One keeps disconnecting from Wifi</h2>
                    <p>Hello Guys,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Saturday evening my Xbox started disconnectiong from the wifi every 5-10 minutes. By now i can't even log into my Account anymore because I keep getting disconnected. However, I was still able to run a test detailed connection test.<br />
<br />
I've gone through almost every guide on the microsoft website that deals with disconnection issues but nothing is working.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, I was still able to run a test detailed connection test:<br />
<br />
NAT-Type is open, 100% Signal Strength, 38Mbit Upload, 29 Mbit Download, 22ms latency, 0% Package loss and 1480 MTU.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anybody ever had this issue and knows how to resolve it if that is possible at all? Oh, and I already did a full reset on the console as well.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for any advice</p>
                </div>

            I had similar problems, so i got in touch with xbox via online chat and asked for a call back, they then talked me through some procedures and the problem was solved, sorry i cant remember what they said. I wouldnt want to tell you the wrong steps to take,
 so perhaps get a call back?

Again, thanks for the advice. I will do so as soon as i can contact the Chat.

<p>Sorry to hear that you are having this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>there are many causes and therefore possible solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>wired is always best if you can achieve that, if not try wifi extender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>reset modem and router and power cycle xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>distance is a factor.&nbsp; all routers/modems with wifi capabilities have effective ranges and those can be affected by many third party factors.&nbsp; metal objects, fridges, microwaves, large power sources.</p>

<p>Hi <span><strong>UA x NeXuS</strong></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had a similar issue with both my Xbox and controller that kept disconnecting.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>I resolved my issue by removing my Xbox from the 5 Ghz band and connecting it to the 2.4 Ghz band. If you have a dual band router, I would give it a try.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have read on various articles that interference is one of the major causes of this particular issue. Since I have multiple devices connected to my router, I figured this might be my issue. Since I‚Äôve done this, I have not had any controller or Xbox disconnection
 issues.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A possible simple solution‚Ä¶..</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope it resolves your issue</p>

            My Xbox is working fine again. Unfortunately, for any other people having this problem i cannot tell why. I did multiple Router resets, power cycled my console multiple times and even did a factory reset but nothing helped.&nbsp;<br />
Today, I just started my Xbox to try some of the troubleshooting you guys suggested but it was working fine right away, before doing anything.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Still, thank you for your answers!<br />

    <title>How to update Windows 10 Start Menu autocomplete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drew c  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to update Windows 10 Start Menu autocomplete</h2>
                    <p>I am having issues with the Start Menu on my new Windows 10 computer at work.&nbsp; I do not have administrator access, but I do have limited ability to install and uninstall some programs that require administrator permission.&nbsp; When I got my computer it had
 a number of programs installed on it by our IT department, some of which I don't need.&nbsp; Since receiving my computer, I have removed some of the initially installed programs and added some from a list of company approved software, as well as a few from the
 Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Windows 7, pretty much the only way that I use the start menu is to hit the Windows Key followed by typing the first few letters of one of the words in the name the program that I want to run, until the one that I want is at the top of the list.&nbsp; However,
 on this computer, none of the programs that I have installed appear in the list once I start typing.&nbsp; This is true regardless of whether it was installed from a traditional installer package or from the Windows Store.&nbsp; What's more, the programs that I uninstalled
 still appear when I start typing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if I hit windows key and then "F I L", I see "File Explorer" and "FileZilla" (which is no longer installed) but not "7-Zip File Manager" (which I installed.)&nbsp; It seems that there is some sort of cache of installed programs, which is not being
 updated properly, and I cannot find any information about where this is configured.&nbsp; So far I have tried updating my Search Indexer settings multiple times, enough to verify that this autocomplete behavior is not controlled by the search indexer, despite many
 articles suggesting that it is.&nbsp; Also, before anyone suggests repairing the start menu entries, I can see entries for all of these programs in the Start Menu.&nbsp; The problem is not that they don't appear in the Start Menu, only that I cannot quickly navigate
 to them by typing.</p>
<p>

            Well, my suggestion would require administrator privileges. There might be an issue with the Start menu itself. I would recommend you try performing a repair upgrade. But you would need to have Administrator privileges. You might need to contact your System Administrator for assistance since this is a managed system.

            It was Trusteer Rapport - Banking security app from IBM. It asks if it is OK when one does a Print Screen. For Snipping Tool, it simply presents a black/grey screen. One must change the "Block Screen Capturing" setting.<br />

            Hello Duston,
<br />
<br />The BlInitializeLibrary failed 0xc00000bb error is usually related to computer's motherboard BIOS. Better to contact device manufacturer for better assistance. They will be able to check what causes the issue and can help you modify and reset BIOS.
<br />
<br />From Windows side you can try follow the step below:
<br />1/ Create installation media and plug on  device. 
<br />2/ Select Command Prompt and type the following commands, then press Enter: 
<br />
<br />Bootrec / fixmbr
<br />Bootrec / fixboot
<br />Bootrec /rebuildbcd 
<br />
<br />3/ Close the Command Prompt window, then restart your device.
<br />
<br />Some community members reported that  they turned off secure boot from bios menu and this solved the issue.
<br />
<br />Let me know how it goes       
        </p>

            Hi Duston,
<br />
<br />All options in BIOS are different, it depends on your device and BIOS version.
<br />
<br />For this, how it was mentioned before, better to contact your device developer for getting correct steps related to the BIOS. If your device is PC that you should contact your mother board developer.
<br />
<br />Keep us informed how it goes       
        </p>

    <title>How to use a legacy printer from a Windows 7 application - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to use a legacy printer from a Windows 7 application</h2>
                    <p>I wish to print wide-format to an HP Deskjet 9650 from an application running in Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP does offer an XP driver for this printer (which I have used for wide-format in Win XP) but none for Win 7. HP suggests a workaround for using the printer in Win 7, but this is only a partial workaround: it won't do wide-format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a Windows way of getting this printer to print wide-format?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thought is to start by installing the XP printer driver in XP Mode, but is there then a way of printing from the application running in Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching in Microsoft Technet, etc. and in various forums, I get the feeling XP Mode is intended to allow
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">legacy</span> applications to run on Win 7 machines, but I find no mention of allowing legacy
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">printers</span> to be used on Windows 7 machines.</p>

            <p>The&nbsp; procedure I followed in 2013, when this PC was new, is based on <em>HP Printers - Installing an Alternate Print Driver in Windows 7 for a USB Cable Connection</em> to be found
<a href="http://h20565.www2.hp.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?sp4ts.oid=306780&amp;calledBy=Search_Result&amp;docId=emr_na-c01796821&amp;docLocale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>The DJ9650 prints AOK on 8 1/2 x 11 paper, but on 8 1/2 x 14 the print head moves for a few moments as if to print, then shoots the paper out. I have it do this when printing from two applications: Foxit Reader and DraftSight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is from my installation log:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moused to Control Panel | Devices and Printers:<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I clicked on Add a Printer, then on Add a local printer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I chose Use an existing port<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I accepted LPT1:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I clicked on Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Manufacturer, I chose HP<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Printers, I chose Deskjet 9800<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the Print name box, I typed HP Deskjet 9650.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I clicked on Next. "Installing printer" showed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I accepted Share this printer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I unchecked Set as default printer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Finished" showed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I connected the 9650 to my PC via a powered USB hub.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I clicked on Close<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I right-clicked on the 9800, chose Printer properties and clicked on the Ports tab.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;HP said to change from LPT1 to USB or DOT4. Neither was offered.<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I moused Start | Computer | right-clicked | Manage | Device Manager<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I clicked on Other devices to expand it. The 9650 was there.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I right-clicked on 9650 and chose Update driver software.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I clicked on Browse my computer for driver software.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I chose Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer, then clicked on Next. The Add Printer wizard showed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At Select your device's type, I chose Printers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Manufacturer, I chose HP<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Model, I chose Deskjet 9800<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I clicked on Next. An Update Driver Warning showed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I clicked Yes to install. "Successfully updated" showed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I clicked on Close.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Under USB Controllers, USB Printing Support showed.<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Devices and Printers | Printers and Faxes:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Both the 9800 and the 9650 showed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I right-clicked on the 9650 and chose Printing Properties.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At the Ports tab, I changed LPT1 to USB001.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I also changed the Share name to HP Deskjet 9650 (HH)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I printed a test page on the 9650 successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me whether the procedure you suggest is likely to fix the problem with printing wide-format. As you can see from the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>the printer works partially</li><li>HP are aware of the problem, and have offered a work-around.</li></ul>
<p>So is this a compatibility issue? If it is, I would have expected HP to propose the
<em>run in compatibility mode</em> solution -- because it is much simpler than installing the 9800 and then the 9650.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the printer is not working properly with Windows 7, as a work around you may try installing in compatibility mode and check if it helps to fix the issue or not. If not, please try the steps which&nbsp;HP has provided as workaround.</p>

            <p>I have got the DJ9650 working by going to Windows Update and choosing manufacturer HP (not Hewlett Packard) then installing the DJ9800 (HP) driver -- not Hewlett Packard. This is a more recent driver than other DJ9800 drivers. So the DJ is working in Windows
 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found that DraftSight will not print to a 9650/9800 at 11x17. My workaround is to print from True View.</p>

            Hi Reinhold
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Many people have reported the problem but not all. Sometimes, updated do create a problem. 
<br />
<br />You should block it otherwise it will be installed once again.
<br /> 
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi Reinhold,
<br />
<br />You should hide that update, so Windows 10 does not install it on your systems . . 
<br />
<br />Download the tool from the link below, run that, in the list of pending updates, select that update and click 'Hide' that will stop windows from attempting to install it:

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the Problem is that the Systems needed 3 - 5 minutes to boot then they needed maybe 2 minutes at the Windows will be configured screen and then when we were on the desktop the system needed several minutes to work correctly. All in all we needed maybe 10
 - 15 minutes so we could work correctly and after we deinstalled the update everything worked perfectly fine after a 10 second boot period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>(I still evaluating the situation)</p>

<p>This issue is being caused by an incompatibility between certain antivirus applications and the recent Windows Updates to Windows 7, 8.1 and 10. Sophos, Avast, and Avira have all been confirmed and are working with MS for solutions. I'm sure there are others,
 but those three are the ones I could locate info on. Most specifically Avira since that's what I use and they gave me the following response:<br />
<br />
<em>Hello, Our dev. dept. is in contact with Microsoft to find a solution for this issue. Please see this article which we've published some hours ago:
</em></p>
<p><em>https://www.avira.com/en/support-for-home-knowledgebase-detail/kbid/1976<br />
<br />
</em>I'm certain the temporary solution for whatever AV you may have is the same as what Avira has stated. Just uninstall the corresponding Windows Update as mentioned in the article, wait for your AV provider to release an updated version to install, then
 reinstall the Windows Update(s).</p>

<p>I got the fix!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem. Restart your PC and go to the windows startup settings. From there select the option to repair your system. For me when I did that i got to the desktop. Then it froze my system again. Then I pressed my computer case‚Äôs restart button.
 After that the system started working perfectly fine for me. I also checked that the update was installed correctly from the update history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>No, that is not a fix for the majority of people having these problems &amp; if it fixed yours I VERY highly doubt you had the same problem to begin with. It has already been confirmed by both Microsoft and several antivirus vendors, that the combination of
 these Windows Updates and a handful of antivirus apps are causing this problem. There is information supporting this and my previous reply all over the internet. The "fix" has already been given. Myself and plenty of others obviously already tried the "repair
 your system" options to no avail. I do NOT recommend d0ggy's reply as a fix. The actual recommended solution that has been made by several antivirus vendors is the same as what Avira suggested in their reply to me. One only has to look at my last response
 and read the link provided to get the proper answer. That info is literally all over the place. Tons of people having this problem (including Win7 and 8.1 users), and tons of people have offered the fix. Including MS and the av vendors themselves. The solution
 I posted is confirmed, not just some random nonsense that may or may not work.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Bluetooth driver needs to be checked to understand this better. Apart from the earphones, see if the Surface will also have problems recognizing other Bluetooth devices. You can also visit

<p>Hi &nbsp;AmritaBhattacharjee1709</p>
<p>Thank you for showing interest to solve my problem.</p>
<p>Now I will expand my question:</p>
<p><strong>In windows 8 and windows 8.1</strong> I used to restore system image many times to restore my system to earlier dates successfully. During such restoration<strong> ONLY my windows partition [C:\] had been undergone the desired changes</strong>
 leaving the other partitions in the Disk unchanged. In other words restoration of system image only affected windows partition&nbsp;<strong>WITHOUT AFFECTING REMAINING PARTIONS OF THE HARD DISK.</strong></p>
<p>This experience encouraged me to create sytem image in<strong> windows 10 Pro (after availing free upgrade and activated)</strong> also. So I experimented with system image created in windows 10 to test the effectiveness of restoration function
 in windows 10 Pro. I created system image properly and stored it in a portable external hard disk. Then I proceeded with restoration of system image &nbsp;from external portable disk where it had been created and stored. I could successfully restore my system to
 windows 10 Pro to the time it was created. But to my utter surprise and dismay the<strong>&nbsp;existing data in the remaining partitions(six in numbers) on the internal hard disk vanished leaving the partition sizes intact</strong>.
<strong>For the restored Windows 10 only System Volume Information and Recycle Bin folders are available in all the six remaining partitions. The sizes of those partition did not under go any change.</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To
 my understanding these patitions are not formatted. I attached the internal Hard Disk to linux system and found out that data in the remaining partitions are available for recovery using data recovery software such as photorec etc.</span></p>
<p>I am not a technical person .</p>
<p>Is there any chance of getting back data from the other partitions?</p>
<p>Why windows 10 restoration of system Image affected all the existing partitions instead of only C:\.?</p>
<p>I repeat my statement. The same restoration of System Image procedure in earlier versions i.e. Windows 7, windows 8 and Windows 8.1 had been quite successful affecting only the Windows Partition C:\ and there had been no change in the remaing partitions.
 The Data in those partitions were intact. </p>
<p>But in Windows 10 Pro the data in the remaining partitions are not available. Only Sustem Volume Information and Recycle Bin folders are available. Also note the partition sizes did not undergo any changes.</p>
<p>May I get any solution ? Thanks and Regards</p>

    <title>Windows 10 1709 Auto-Hiding of vertical scroll bars - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terryweaver1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1709 Auto-Hiding of vertical scroll bars</h2>
                    <p>I realise that this question may have already been posted, but not (I think) for build 1709 - or at least not with any success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running&nbsp; Windows 10 Build 1709 and encountering such an incredibly stupid design decision that I struggle to understand how it could ever have got through initial design discussions, let alone QA.&nbsp; I am referring, of&nbsp; course, to the auto-hiding of vertical
 (and possibly, who knows?) horizontal scroll-bars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that this "feature" (hmm) could&nbsp; be disabled in earlier builds; obviously recognising how irritating it could be.&nbsp; But, now in the "improved" (sic) build 1709 I cannot find any setting that will rid me of this. &nbsp; So, my question is .... where
 is the setting [hidden that will allow me] to&nbsp; disable this feature&nbsp; across all applications (ideally, irrespective of the application designers preference) and system dialogs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that Microsoft is slowly making Windows 10 unusable for&nbsp; some reason I cannot fathom.&nbsp; Certainly, after many years of using Windows, I am investigating the various Linux and Android alternatives. And, this sort of thing
 hardly helps the case (if any truly still exists) for sticking with Windows.</p>

<p>Hi Terry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we conclude of this situation, we would like to make sure if this issue happens on the majority of users of Windows 10. At this time, we would like to request to recreate the issue you are experiencing regarding this scrollbar. Have this recorded
 using the <strong>Game DVR</strong> of <strong>Windows 10</strong>. To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows + G</strong> to launch the <strong>Game bar</strong>. </li><li>When prompted, click <strong>Yes</strong>, this is a game. </li><li>Prepare the scrollbar and replicate what you are trying to do. </li><li>Click the <strong>Record</strong> button or press <strong>Windows + Alt + R</strong> to start recording.
</li><li>Perform the activity on your screen (Make sure that there are no personal information recorded on your screen).
</li><li>Once done, click <strong>Stop recording</strong>, or press <strong>Windows + Alt + R</strong> again.
</li><li>Press <strong>Windows + E</strong> to open <strong>File Explorer</strong>. </li><li>Locate this folder - <strong>%userprofile%\Videos\Captures</strong>. </li><li>Check the recording if it captured the issue in detail. </li><li>Upload the video recording (.mp4 file) to your <strong>OneDrive</strong> account.
</li><li>Share us the link of the recording, through a private message, so we can review the issue and replicate it on our end for further checking of its validity.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to us if you have successfully performed this request. So we will have an idea of where is this scrollbar is having issues. Then, we will provide you the workaround.</p>
<p>

<p>I am also having this problem on build 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Online instructions and action taken in the past is to open 'ease of access' &gt; 'Display' then toggle the 'hide scrollbars' option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In build 1709 there is no longer a 'display' option in the 'ease of access' panel. Using search of the settings, scroll bar and scrollbar return no (useful) results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would I ever want to hide my scrollbar on my desktop PC? I have a 32" 4k display, the amount of screen space it consumes is negligible</p>

<p>Hi Marcel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few possible reasons can be the cause of this issue including outdated network drivers or a configuration error. To help us identify the cause of this issue, we would like to know the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which build and version of Windows are you currently using? <em>(See: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Which Windows operating system am I running?</a>)</em></li><li>What is the exact warning message that you are getting?<br />
</li><li>Were you able to connect using the same setup <em>(WiFi Direct)</em> in the past?</li><li>Have you made any changes to your computer before experiencing this issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you make sure you have the latest device drivers.
<span>While it's likely you already have the most recent driver, if you're having trouble with a device, you can try fixing it by&nbsp;updating the driver or reinstalling it. See:
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update drivers in Windows 10</a>.
<em>Note: Windows should automatically install the required drivers after connecting your phone.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>We also recommend that you download and install any pending updates that need to be installed through
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12373/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Update</a> and check if it helps resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
        </p>

<p>Thank you for your responce.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The windows version is 1709 and the build is 16299.402</p>
<p>
</p><p>In windows add a device after I click my mobile it starts trying to connect. After a while it stops and ask me to connect</p>
<p>again. It also asks for a pincode. I dont know what I should fill in here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see my laptop also in the wifi direct list of my mobile who is trying to connect also but after a while it disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if windows firewall has got something to do with this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this problem is going to be solved</p>

<p>We appreciate the screenshots, Marcel. Sometimes firewall software might prevent you from getting connected. You can see if the connection issue is caused by a firewall by turning it off temporarily and then trying to connect again. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>Command prompt</strong>, press and hold (or right-click)
<strong>Command prompt</strong>, and then select <strong>Run as administrator</strong> &gt;
<strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>At the command prompt, type <strong>netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off</strong>, and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Try connecting to your device again.<br />
</li><li>To turn on all firewalls you might have installed, at the command prompt, type
<strong>netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on</strong>, and then press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you find a third-party firewall software is causing the connection issues, contact the software manufacturer or visit their website to check and see if updated software is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, a new Windows feature update (<em>Windows 10 April 2018 Update (version 1803)</em>) has been released for the PC. As such, we recommend that you download and install any pending updates through
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12373/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Update</a> and check if it helps resolve the issue.</p>

    <title>Can I Set a different password for my live account, email and in the - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I Set a different password for my live account, email and in the account linked PC.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this is a huge security&nbsp;hole on the windows 8 system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got 3 PCs and all of them are using the same password (my live account password).</p>
<p>My email is also using the same password too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I want to purchase items from windows store, I need to use the same password again.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, I don't want to make any purchases from the Windows App because this is not unsecure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is because if your computer is hacked or something, the hacker is able to get all your information from all accounts linked to your live account (e.g. facebook, email) and all your payment details in the live account. They can also delete your account
 if the computer is a trusted PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that Microsoft is able to allow people to use different password for different purposes.
</p>
<p>i.e.</p>
<p>Email</p>
<p>Windows Store Purchases</p>
<p>Each Windows PC</p>
<p>Manage Live Account</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like the concept for windows 8 but I think it still have a large room to improve. Therefore I hope to contribute to it.<br />
If windows 8&nbsp;store&nbsp;is safe to use, the store will work very well in the future.<br />
</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Simon</p>

            <p>Hi Simon, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Thank you for the post and the feedback on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I looks that you would like to know that whether you can use different password for your live accounts and emails and on linked computers.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to suggest that you cannot use different password for same account on different computer. You have to use same password to purchase anything from Windows Store. Windows Store is a secure store you can go ahead and make purchases from there.</div>

    <title>attached thumbnails wont open. Windows Live Mail Error ID&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonweaving  say:</h3>
<h2>            attached thumbnails wont open. Windows Live Mail Error ID&#58; 0x80070005.</h2>
                    Hi, using Windows 7 - 64 and Windows Live Mail 2011 (Version 2011 Build 15.4.3538.0513).&nbsp; When I receive photos AS A SLIDE SHOW (ie thumbnails attached rather than as embedded photos), I am often only able to open ONE regardless of how many are attached.
<br />
<br />
I know it's possible to "save all" to a folder then open them, but because of the number of emails we get everyday (with multiple photos), doing that is an absolute pain and waste of time when all we really want to do is double click the thumbnails to have
 a quick look at each picture in full size.<br />
<br />
Any help with this would be appreciated.

            <p>I have the same problems in many of my recent emails. I've sent some to myself and to friends using Hotmail as well as to Hotmail from a different account and the attached pictures do not open although we see the thumbnail. My problem exists whether I send
 one picture or five. I usually send them in much reduced size. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE: I have now tried to send the same pics from the stand-alone Hotmail program (rather&nbsp; than from Hotmail in windows live) and the attachments/thumbnails open.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your post, you're unable to open the file attachments on your emails. Allow me to investigate the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide us the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Have you made any changes on your account prior to the issue?</p>
<p>- Does it apply to any file type attached on your emails that you want to open?</p>
<p>- Did you happen to encounter any error message? If so, please post the complete message on your next reply.</p>
<p>- When you said that you have tried sending the same files from a stand-alone program, does it mean that you used an email client?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any questions and clarifications, please let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Version 2012 (Build 16.4.3505.0912) of Live Mail.</p>
<p>Whenever I use my Hotmail account in Live Mail to&nbsp;send either a photo or a simple Word file, the recipient gets the thumbnails but cannot open either file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have made no changes to my Live Mail accounts and this problem has been occurring for the last 3 months or so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when I send the same photo and file from my Hotmail account by using Outlook/Hotmail, there is no such problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, while doing various tests with Live Mail, I have encountered an error message which I never got before. My emails from Hotmail in Live Mail stay in the outbox and I cannot send them and I get the error message: Unable to send or receive messages for
 the Hotmail (paulmario) account.</p>
<p>Subject 'testing'<br />
Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x80070005</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said, this is completely new. Should I try uninstalling/re-installing Live Mail?</p>
<p>Any assistance and suggestions would be appreciated because for the past several years, I have all my email accounts in Live Mail and I like the convenience but it's inconvenient when people tell me my pics don't open and I have the same problem when I send
 them to myself to another account. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Paulmario,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the additional information provided. It's my pleasure on helping you to send emails with attachments in Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you've mentioned that you were able to send emails with attachments via web browser, it is possible there is an issue with photo mail used with SkyDrive and you didn't signed in to your Microsoft account on Mail.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest you to ensure they you logged into Windows Live Mail. Photos may be stripped out and sent as attachments if you aren‚Äôt connected to SkyDrive. Also, we encourage you to disable the service
<span><b>WSearch</b></span> through task manager. Please&nbsp;ensure the you didn‚Äôt recently update the malware software.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, nothing's working. I removed the accounts, closed Live Mail and added them again with no success. I've tried sending from Hotmail and to Hotmail but the attachments never open, even simple word files. It's also strange that if I send a picture from
 Hotmail by using the Album option, it never leaves the Outbox but it does leave if I send the same pic as an attachment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>
