<h2>            IRQL not lesss or equal with BSOD 5-10 times a day - everything is up to date - I even swapped RAM with another identical machine</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 identical DELL XPS 15 (9560) with Core i7, 8Gig of RAM, SSD and they always worked well.&nbsp; One of them started crashing with blue screens of death and IRQL errors about 3 weeks ago.&nbsp; I did a clean install on it with no improvement. Then I updated
 all drivers, BIOS and made sure Windows update was showing that it was up to date. No luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even swapped the RAM from one machine to the other to see if the physical RAM was the problem, and the issue didn't move with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I tried running driver verifyer but when it crashed I still got the regular IRQL not less or equal error so I disabled it as it was slowing down my machine a lot.&nbsp; Not sure if it produced a log that could be useful somewhere...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I lost at least 30 hours of productivity trying to resolve this with no luck so far.&nbsp; I will have to consider throwing this $2500 machine in the garbage if I can't solve this here...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a superhero here who can help?<br />
<br />

            To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes. 
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Hi Eric, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi Eric
<br />
<br />All your minidump files indicate the same cause - storport.sys
<br />
<br />You should look at  the following as a cause of your system crashes:
<br />
<br />SSD firmware - if you have an SSD check the manufacturers website for a firmware update
<br />
<br />BIOS Version Check the Support page on the Dell website for a BIOS update - latest version was released on 29 August
<br />
<br />Chipset Drivers - Check the Support page on the Dell website - there is a lot of devices listed in this section and a lot of new updates released this month, check in Device Manager to see which one is compatible with your system
<br />
<br />Hard disk controller drivers/SATA drivers - again a lot of versions listed,  check in Device Manager to see which one is compatible with your system
<br />
<br />Support page for that laptop on the Dell Website - for each device, change the Category drop down on that page
<br />

<p>Thanks DaveM121 for looking at the minidump and for the quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BIOS is already up to date with Aug 29th version</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, within the page you sent me, there is a tool that is checking for most current current drivers for my specific machine and everything is said to be up to date.&nbsp; I updated everything 2 weeks ago and it's showing as being still up to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read in many places that drivers could be the issue so I made sure I had the latest versions through this tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have an SSD.&nbsp; Could the physical SSD be the problem? I would like to swap it with the other identical machine I have so see if the problem would move with it, but from what I could see when I swapped RAM, it seemed to be built-on the motherboard...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to check health of the SSD if it could be the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again very much for your help.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Eric,
<br />
<br />As far as i can gather, the drive in that model is a NVMe SSD which liiks like a large stick of RAM, and so should be swapable . . .
<br />
<br />If you want to try an older driver, I would go for the Chipset driver, then the Hard disk controller drivers/SATA driver as those two are the most likely cause
<br />
<br />Actually now that I come to think of it, I did have the same issue on a Dell Precision M6800 a couple of years ago, the solution was two fold:
<br />
<br />I went into BIOS and disabled any SATA ports that were not being used and I replaced the Hard disk controller drivers/SATA driver with the basic Microsoft version . . .       
        </p>

<br />
<br />You can do following -
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert.
<br />
<br />2. Download latest driver from <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/27984/Intel-Rapid-Storage-Technology-Intel-RST-User-Interface-and-Driver?v=t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/27984...</a> and install.
<br />
<br />You need to download f6flpy-x64.zip (64-bit Operating System) / f6flpy-x86.zip (32bit Operating System).

<p>We are getting beyond my core competencies of marketing :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll see if I can disable the unused ports in the BIOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Device manager, I see 2 things in Storage controllers:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Intel Chipset SATA RAID Controller&nbsp; (version 15.44.0.1010) which shows a driver date of 2018-02-07)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft Sorage Spaces Controller&nbsp;&nbsp;(version 10.0.17134.137 which shows a driver date of 2006-06-21!!!!)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it normal to have both? Should I uninstall one? or update any of those? I found this that seems more recent but not sure if it's compatible:&nbsp;https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/27984/Intel-Rapid-Storage-Technology-Intel-RST-User-Interface-and-Driver?product=55005&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Clarence wstokes,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have accidently deleted any of the installation file then you may perform system restore to restore the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try to perform system restore which will restore back the computer to the point when it was working fine.</p>

            As you did post any info about which Preview build that you are having issues with, as that is an old game I wouldn't expect it to run on the newest builds of beta Windows 10.&nbsp;

<p>You can't upgrade from XP to Windows 10 you can only do a clean install, as you are looking at two completely different operating systems, as posted by others if that game is important to you do a dual boot system with XP and Win10. not sure if it is a 16
 bit program it won't run on any Win10. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Correction, It is a clean install on a new pc that was pre loaded with windows 10.

</p><p>The game also would not run on the previous computer which was upgraded to 10</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There are several causes why the game is not compatible with Windows 10. A possible reason as to why you're encountering this issue is due to your system's corrupted components. Here are three methods on how to troubleshoot compatibility issue

    <title>Windows network throttling &#33;&#33;Even in Safe Mode&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ricopvz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows network throttling &#33;&#33;Even in Safe Mode&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have a really annoying problem with my windows network.<br />
It is throttled at 12Mbps (1.5mb/s), <strong>even in Safe Mode!!</strong><br />
But it seems it is per connection throttling, which means I can download a file from a http server at 1.5mb/s but if I download it in chunks at the same time, I get full speed (50Mbps or 6.25mb/s). I use Download Ninja for this.<br />
<br />
Another problem that I don't know if it's related, is that I can't do multicast, <strong>
even in Safe Mode!</strong><br />
If I open VLC and broadcast a video/music on any multicast address (224.0.0.50 for example), other computers on the network don't receive the broadcast. But if I do the same thing on another computer, I can receive the broadcast on mine.<br />
<br />
I already disabled the Firewall (in Safe Mode too) and the problems didn't disappear.<br />
<br />
I'm tired of searching the webs and I can't find a solution for this. </p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
<strong>Did you make any hardware or software change on the computer?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I've already made a lot of software changes since the problem started happening.<br />
And I did upgrade my wireless card some time ago (can't remeber if it was before or after the problem started happening), but the tests were conducted through an ethernet cable.</p>
<p><strong>Are you getting any error message? If yes, what is the exact error message?</strong><br />
No, no error message. Not even in the event log.</p>
<p><br />
I already disabled all non-Microsoft services and startup applications, but connections are still throttled.<br />
Also, I didn't have Download Ninja when the problem started, I only installed it to narrow the problem.</p>
<p><br />
I didn't understand your method 2.<br />
Has it anything to do with my second problem? If yes, then I don't really need to stream anything. If I want, I can always stream with http, mms or other protocol. The thing is, I only tried multicast for fun, and noticed it didn't work as I already described.</p>

<h2>            Skype contacts gone</h2>
                    I have just tried to use Skype on my Android tablet to video call someone as I have done many times before. Unfortunately all my call history has gone and the person I tried to call does not appear to have a Skype log on. When he tries to call me I appear
 to be offline - what's going on?

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Make sure that you’re using the correct account, you may sign out and sign back in on Skype with the account that has the contacts. Also, you may try this basic troubleshooting steps below for the meantime and check on it again.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1. Uninstall and reinstall the Skype application with the latest version.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Accidentally deleted Silverlight temp file, now error 1622 comes up&#63;</h2>
                    I have tried multiple things now to no avail but it may be that i have no temp folder. I made a new one, but i have no clue what is supposed to be in it to even fix that problem. Novice at computers, so the most simple terminology would be appreciated.
 Thanks!

<p><span>Hi Omer,</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Is
 it freezing when it tries to play a specific type of file? If so, what is the file format?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Is
 media player freezing while initializing?</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Open media player and start playing the file from the menu.<br />
Press Ctrl+O</span></p>

<p><span>If the troubleshooter doesn’t fix the issue, you may rebuild the Windows Media Player database and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Exit

<p><span><span>C.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 all the files in the folder, and then click&nbsp; <strong>Delete</strong> on the&nbsp;<strong>File</strong> menu.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> You do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.</span></p>
<p><span><span>D.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart

<strong>Note</strong>: Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 3</span></span></strong></p>

<h2>            Surface Studio doesn&#39;t support Nvidia Control panel&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried installing older and newer drivers (downloaded via nvidia website), tried installing the drivers manually via "hard disk..."option in device manager, tried using DDU and other things, without any luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft phone support claims the Geforce 980M in the Surface Studio was designed to not support Nvidia control panel. They say it's been modified to do that. That seems odd to me, especially if you're using the official Nvidia drivers.&nbsp; Is this true? Does
 this even make sense?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The control panel doesn't even install in the Nvidia folder in Program files. The whole Control Panel Client folder is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p />

<h2>            Can&#39;t set .png files to be associated with Photoshop CS3</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: Default Program Rigidity<br />
<br />
Hello. I recently installed Photoshop CS3, and it didn't ask what files to automatically associate with it like in previous versions. I've tried to set it as the default program for most image files in "Start &gt; Default Programs", but three problems come up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Under "Set Your Default Programs," CS3 doesn't show up. </li><li>Under "Associate a File Type or Protocol with a Program," .png (the main file type I use) doesn't show up.</li><li>Under "Set Program Access and Computer Defaults," it doesn't have a category for images.</li><li>Under "Set Your Default Programs," .png is set to MS Paint and can't be unchecked. (It has the box with a faded check in it. and is unclickable)</li></ol>
I'd really like to set photoshop to open .png files, as I really don't us MS Paint at all. Any help on how to fix this would be much appreciated.

<h3> darknerd42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Media Center - Cannot Play Recorded or Live TV</h2>
                    
<p>Windows Media Center reports:</p>
<p>"<span>VIDEO ERROR</span></p>
<p><span>Files needed to display video are not installed or not working correctly. Please restart Windows Media Center or restart the computer."</span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>when trying
 to play recorded TV or watch Live TV. &nbsp;Windows Media Player also will not play recorded television, stating:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>"Windows Media Player encountered a problem while playing the file"</p>
<p>and the Web Help button takes me to a page for error code "C00D11B1".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried uninstalling/reinstalling the latest video and audio drivers for my computer (an Acer Revo 3610), and I've tried removing WMC/WMP from the computer and reinstalling it, both to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know the files are being recorded correctly - I can watch the videos through Homegroup on another computer on the network. &nbsp;This is also a recent problem - I have a feeling one of the Windows Updates broke the playback of recorded and live TV as I had
 been able to watch these videos with no problems up until recently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All other video files play back properly (DIVX format, mostly).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else have any ideas on what I can do?</p>

<p>I had this same problem with the same hardware after i installed the latest ion update.</p>
<p>In the end i was able to fix it by re running the screen and speaker setups again in media center.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            New Laptop crashed twice</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>My daughter has bought a new Windows 10 Laptop but in the past 3 days it has randomly restarted on 2 occasions. I checked in Event Viewer and there are 2 critical errors that match the times when it crashed. They are both Kernel-Power Event ID 41. In Device
 Manager I have checked for the latest driver updates for audio devices but it insists the best drivers for the device are already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do to prevent this please?</p>

            Hi rml123, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br />
<br />ID 41 can be a very serious hardware issue and if that were my own personal this is what I would do. And even though troubleshooting is my expertise I have learned this the hard way. (There are many examples on these forums where I have helped others resolve or at least realize it is hardware. Even so, I would not try to troubleshoot that or even most issues on a new computer.)
<br />
<br />Since the computer is new and still under warranty please contact System Maker's Support and the seller. As OEM they are responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause, it is theirs to resolve. And the unit is under full warranty and may be in need of repairs or replacement. Added that even if you are able to resolve the issue you would want it fully documented just in case there are related problems down the road. Remember the more you do the more they will say it is something you have done. 
<br /> 
<br />Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance.

<p>Hi Rob</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your advice. Certainly if the problem persists I will take it back to the shop. I have read elsewhere that after a Windows Feature Update, some of the device drivers can become a bit unstable and the problems started immediately after i'd installed
 the latest Feature Update. Since posting my message I have now done an 'update driver' on every single device driver in device manager and 3 or 4 drivers required updating including bluetooth and graphics card so fingers crossed this will have helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks ...</p>

            I urge you to contact the maker's support even if updating the driver's seems to help. There could be down the road issues so you want this documented with them. And as I said the ID 41 can be a very serious issue.
<br />
<br />BTW the best way to update drivers is to actually visit the system/motherboard maker's site along with the actual device makers' sites (such as Intel, Nvidia, AMD/ATI, RealTek, Marvel, Qualcomm, and so on). The updates found by Device Manager are not always the latest.

            The laptop crashed for a third time in five days with the same error. In the error log it was the same critical error and i noticed another entry after each crash saying that there was a hardware error with the AMD northbound component. I've taken it back
 to Tesco and got another one. Thanks for your advice...

            Hang on, both her sisters have Kernel-Power 41 critical errors on their laptops as well? One of them has a similar model, the other has an intel processor. What is going on? Does a Kernel-Power 41 critical error occur if you just leave a laptop to run
 out of battery?

<p>I've now got the same problem on my desktop pc that i've had for years (Windows 10 formerly Windows 7). Computer just restarted itself and gave me this error</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>A fatal hardware error has occurred.</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><em>Component: AMD Northbridge</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Error Source: Machine Check Exception</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Error Type: 11</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Processor APIC ID: 0</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><em>The details view of this entry contains further information.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got an AMD Athlon X2 220 Processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone from Microsoft tell me what is going on here? Is the processor / component no longer compatible with Windows 10? Is it something they've put in the updates? Is it the fast start? I have followed all the advice to upgrade to Windows 10 and install
 all the latest updates and now i'm getting a unexpected restart problem, so I would appreciate a solution for this, thanks ....</p>

<h2>            Toshiba mini nb205 &#40;far to slow&#41;</h2>
                    So I have heard upgrading the ram from 1gb to 2gb would help with lagging and freezing and the long boot up. I also only have windows 7 starter edition. 1st would i upgrade to windows ultimate? Or do I just buy the program and install? I have also heard
 using windows 7 ultimate 64bit would allow me to upgrade to 4gb of ram instead of only 2gb. I was also wondering if I would need to buy the 4gb ram or if it was automatically installed with windows 7 ultimate? I really love the feel of this mini notebook but
 I will be using it for school and I can't have it lagging and freezing on me all the time. I was also wondering if doing these upgrades would even help? I don't want to use more money then i need to.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Hold your horses. I'm glad you like your mini notebook, but its going to have severe limitations as to what you can upgrade it to. For what you're talking about you'd be better off buying a refurbished&nbsp; full-fledged notebook that can handle 4 or 8 GB of
 RAM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I doubt the netbook can hold more than 1 or 2 GB RAM, and I'm dubious as to whether the OS could be updated as well. FYI, no version of Windows comes bundled with RAM unless a dealer runs an in-house promo. So you are probably talking about spending a couple
 of hundred dollars for less than what you want. Thank maybe you should rearrange your sites on what you want vs. afford.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just one opinion. Let me know how you want to proceed and I'll help you out further.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            Sorry I don't know much about laptops/notebooks. I did install windows 7 professional edition and I have already seen a bit of change. The start up is a lot quicker although internet still takes a little time but a bit more bearable. And I wasn't sure
 if I needed 4gb or more I just thought the more RAM the better it would work. But I know for sure that I can upgrade to 2gb of RAM. But do you think That extra GB of RAM would help with the lagging on the internet?&nbsp;

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>No question, the more RAM the better, but your notebook is limited by lots of things:&nbsp; 10" screen, relatively small hard drive, slowish processor. It is a netbook after all. One very personal opinion, I bought a refurbished Dell with Win 7 Home Premium with
 2 GB RAM, 75 GB HDD, on board but decent graphics for $210. Check out this link for refurbished notebook deals:&nbsp;

<p>I'm not selling anything, but it seems that for a little more money you can have a full sized notebook. Let me know if there is anything else I can do.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be happy to answer your query: </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows backup:</strong> When you back up your files using Windows Backup, you can let Windows choose what is backed up or you can select the individual folders and drives that you want to back up. Depending on what you select, your backup will contain
 the items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information, visit <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/how-does-windows-choose-which-files-to-back-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How does Windows choose which files to back up?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows/System Image: </strong>A system image is an exact copy of a drive. By default, a system image includes the drives required for Windows to run. It also includes Windows and your system settings, programs, and files. You can use a system image
 to restore the contents of your computer if your hard disk or computer ever stops working. When you restore your computer from a system image, it's a complete restoration—you can't choose individual items to restore, and all of your current programs, system
 settings, and files are replaced with the contents of the system image. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Although this type of backup includes your personal files, we recommend that you back up your files regularly using Windows Backup so that you can restore individual files and folders as needed. When you set up Windows Backup, you can let
 Windows choose what to back up, which will include a system image, or you can select the items that you want to back up and whether you want to include a system image. For more information about setting up Windows Backup, see
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/back-up-your-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Back up your files</span></a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer contains several drives or partitions, you can create a system image that includes all of them by following the steps in
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/back-up-your-programs-system-settings-and-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Back up your programs, system settings, and files</span></a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Acronis backup:</strong> Please refer to complete information here: <strong>

</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<h2>            Cumulative update &#40;KB3156421 x64-based Systems&#41; fails to install error 0x8007000d</h2>
                    <p>The&nbsp;KB3156421 cumulative update fails and rolls back forcing a reboot. &nbsp;Then a few hours later it trys to install it again and with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error first started, so it seems, with the&nbsp;KB3147458 upgrade, which also failed and rolled back every time, never actually completing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the CBS.log, it appears that the&nbsp;KB3156421 upgrade is running into an issue while attempting to upgrade msports.inf - below is the the part of the log surrounding where the error first occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

1. Open Excel program &gt; click the Office button &gt; right column, under Recent Documents, do you see your edited excel file ?</p>
<p>2. In the worst case scenario, go back to the e-mail and start over.</p>

            When you open an attachment without saving it, it will be saved as a temp file. Any changes you make and save to this file will be saved to the temp file. Once the temp files are deleted, your changes will be deleted as well.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>You can try searching for the file name from the Start Search, but chances are good that the file is lost.<br />
<div><br />
<div>In the future, if you know you will be making changes to a file, do Save As and save the file to your computer.</div>

                    <p>After I recently experienced mouse and Display freezes on my system (hdd usage Spikes), I would like to restore the system as every other method of solving this failed. I&nbsp;could use&nbsp;the delete everything option that Windows system restore offers or do a clean

<h3> lynxpilot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Core2 Quad &#40;from Core2 Duo&#41; causes freeze on boot</h2>
                    My Windows 7 Ulitimate 64-bit system runs flawlessly with a Core2 Duo processor.&nbsp; Originally, when I purchased W7 I upgraded motherboard (ASUS P5P43TDPro), processor (Core2 Quad), and memory (Mushkin DDR3) and the install went fine.&nbsp; I eventually installed
 a new video card (HIS HD5770) from my older one (XFX GS7600) and the problems started.&nbsp; Some of the problems could have been masked by others so I don't know the origin, but in any event I finally got the system running flawlessly with the new video card and
 the old Core2 Duo processor.&nbsp; I returned the Core2 Quad to Intel and got the same one back with "OK" on the label.&nbsp; I tried the return processor and W7 would freeze on boot at the first GUI screen (the black screen that shows 'starting windows' or whatever
 and shows the throbbing colored window).&nbsp; Since it failed at this point and failed by freezing, I didn't have a BSOD or minidump to fall back on.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Could the problem still be the processor?<br />
<br />
Are there drivers that need to be installed manually when changing processors? (I would have thought W7 would recognize and install automatically)<br />
<br />

<h2>            My 1920 x 1080 resolution option disappeared&#63;&#33;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I used to use this computer with 1920 x 1080 resolution. (Windows 7 64bit with i5 something cpu and geforce gtx 460)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I moved to the new apartment, turned the computer on, and the computer turned on 1600x1200 resolution.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to use 1920 1080 so I went to screen resolution, but 1600 1200 was the maximum resolution.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I could get the original resolution by using the NVidia Control Panel but it does not change the resolution for the games that use auto resolution detectors...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Clearly something is blocking the computer to detect and realize that this monitor is a 22 inch 1920 1080 hd monitor</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>edit: For some of the resolution (ex. 1600x 1024), the screen shows ' out of range '</div>
<div>I tried uninstalling the device driver and reinstalling the latest one</div>
                </div>

<p><span>Hi,<br />
</span><span>I would suggest you to try updating the latest drivers for the graphic card and check if it helps:</span></p>

<p>I had the same problem. After recent upgrade performed by Windows 10 the resolution for my screen of 1900 x 1080 was no longer available.<br />
So I had to use 1600 x 1200, it wasn't so pretty.</p>
<p>This morning suddenly I found the solution : after performing a roll back of the driver for my video card to the former driver evrything reacted like before. For a few seconds my screen was black and when it reappeared everything functioned like before.
</p>
<p>I thin the windows 10 upgrade replaced the driver by a generic wondows driver, but so I lost the resolution 1900 x 1080.</p>
<p>I hope this will solve your problem also...</p>
