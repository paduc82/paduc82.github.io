<h2>            microsoft points scam</h2>
                    
<p>i contacted support and they informed me that,&nbsp;there is no protection against unauthorized purchases using micro soft points.</p>
<p>they also said there are no refunds for those unauthorized purchases, and no way to password protect against future purchases.</p>
<p>oh and they said have a nice day. &nbsp;%$^#%$^$&nbsp;</p>
<p>just about anything involving real money has massive security, passwords, etc. but not microsoft points.</p>
<p>that is why i call this a scam if it wasnt there would have been password protection from day 1.</p>
<p>specifically my kids got up this morning an seen a picture of a movie they watch, clicked it an purchased it from zune for 1600 points.</p>
<p>the same movie was in the disk drive. the same picture was showing on both tiles. i had bought it at big lots for $4.99 a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>now it just cost another $20 for the same movie have no use for, an no way to down load, or any way for them to watch it on there tv that plays only disks.</p>
<p>i could block everything on xbox but then they couldnt watch cartoons or play games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i wont be buying anything else from microsoft until they fix this, or remove zune from xbox...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you can passcode protect your account</p>

<p>that is the issue. microsoft has NOT implemented a password FOR microsoft points. xbox live (pass code or password) is a separate entity from, ms points (no protection). i have talked with multiple support tech's and its a well known issue. i was told they
 have no plans to fix it untill they have enough complaints to force action to be taken.</p>
<p>not only on xbox console, &nbsp;also on any computer, there is NO protection against anyone making unauthorized microsoft points purchases.</p>
<p>here is a story i hope will help everyone understand the separation of the two better.</p>
<p>say i have a bank card, ill call the bank microsoft points bank. i use this card to make a purchase online at... say xbox games store.</p>
<p>now this example store i call xbox games store required a password, and used secure payment options. one being my example card. transaction completed with no issues. a week later i find out my bank account at microsoft points bank has had a million dollar
 withdrawl to somewhere in another country. i discover my bank has no security in place, so when i made an online purchase anyone could grab my bank account info. i ask the bank, how could this happen? is there not some sort of security,? like a password or
 pin number? an what do i do? they inform me, it is not there problem, and ask if i read there TOS before putting my money in there bank. i said yes an there is no mention of them not providing even the most basic security measures. they in turn say, we know
 that is an issue, sorry, have a nice day.</p>

<p>i forgot to mention in my story it was some guy named zune who made the withdrawl :)</p>
<p>seriously... i do not want anything except they fix this and implement password protection directly to microsoft points purchases. i do love microsoft products an i believe they would never want to lose customers over something this miniscule.</p>

            <p>Xbox is not responsible for how you or your family spend your points. &nbsp;Unless you lost control of your tag to an outside entity somehow there is no way to get those points returned. &nbsp;Because it was your kids who bought the movie you are stuck with the concequences of it.</p>
<p>There is a passcode lockout of your account available for you to set up. &nbsp;This protects not only access to your account but to your MS Points as well because no one can access it without the code. &nbsp;These are the protection measures that Xbox has put into place for you.</p>
<p>As for Zune, that is the Zune marketplace that received the points for the movie purchase.</p>

<p>i dont know how to say it any more clear xbox live and microsoft points are two separate entities. xbox live does have password and or passcode protection. microsoft points has no security measures at all of any kind directly. microsoft knows this but as
 of yet has not implemented any security. it was microsoft support that suggested i post this in forums to get enough people aware of the problem so that changes can be made.
</p>
<p>heres another good example... say you linked your credit card or paypal account to microsoft points. someone breaks in your home and steals your xbox. sure it takes them a short time to decript the password or passcode. but, by the time you get home from
 work and notice youve been robbed, they have allready drained your bank accounts.

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>We would appreciate if you could provide more details about it. Kindly answer the following questions to further isolate the concern:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What kind of clock are you referring to?</li><li>Are you referring to the clock (Date and Time) at the lower-right corner of the desktop screen?</li><li>Can you send us a screenshot of it?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you're referring to the <em>Gadgets</em> feature from the old versions of Windows, this is no longer available on Windows 10 as it is already discontinued. However, you can download an application from the Store where you can add a clock on your desktop
 screen.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your reply about this matter.</p>
        </p>

<p>Clock is there but blacked out -- barely discernible only when I hover over it... like this:</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Yes, very good to have a clock constantly visible again.</p>
<p>Downside, however, is that I am stuck with bigger Taskbar icons -- if I switch back to small icons, the clock disappears again.
</p>
<p>All of Win 10 is so strange -- as if 20+ years of Microsoft tweaking has resulted in an unrecognisable system bearing very little resemblance to the Windows we all learned to use.</p>

    <title>Update stuck at 74&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chase1369  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update stuck at 74&#37;</h2>
                    
<p>My console is stuck at 74%.&nbsp; I started the update when it was released on Friday, it got up to 76% and it hasn't done anything.&nbsp; I have reset my console, unplugged it, left it alone for a few hours and nothing.&nbsp; I finally contacted customer support yesterday
 where I could still use my console offline and the agent said to go into the system and reset to factory settings.&nbsp; So I did that, got all the way back to the update and it stops at 74%....but now I can't even play anything in offline mode.&nbsp; So they switched
 me over to another agent.&nbsp; He had me go through and restart everything and it will start the update...get to about 6%...then blaze right to 74% and stop.&nbsp; Then the agent tells me that my console is out of warranty and it will cost $115 to replace.&nbsp; The update
 is what is wrong.&nbsp; I can still turn on narrator and use the zoom with the controller on the screen, but I can't get the last 256 MB to finish.&nbsp; I have been struggling with this all day today and would love to get it resolved.&nbsp; I have downloaded offline updates
 to see if I can get back to the dashboard, but the console won't recognize anything plugged into the USB ports....because it is stuck at this 74%.<br />
<br />
And just as a vent....if my console worked fine on Thursday and I was still able to play things on it on Friday/Saturday, but Microsoft's Update and Support Agents are the ones that made it useless...why do I have to pay? Just thought I would throw that out
 there.&nbsp; I plan on looking through the Terms and Conditions to see if there is anything that says "If our Update ruins your console, you shouldn't have updated then."&nbsp; Which I will admit that I am responsible.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Anyone having this issue, has it been fixed, how, please help me here.</p>

                    I can't do anything with windows 10 apps on the start menu. The only thing I can do is re-size them and un-pin them I can't move them or arrange them in any way. If I un-pin them and re-pin them, they go to the bottom and I can't move them. Also I can't
 make the app screen bigger. Please Help!

    <title>I need a copy of VB6 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kilvor  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need  a copy of VB6</h2>
                    Can anyone tell me how to purchase a genuine, legal, virus free, version of VB6. I&nbsp;am a retired IT software developer who&nbsp;retired in 1994. Since that date I have written a few small VB projects&nbsp;for my home use using VB5 on a desktop. I have now migrated
 to a laptop running Windows 7 and want to migrate my programs and programming. I have downloaded&nbsp;the free Visual Basic 2008 express but converting VB5 to this seems almost impossible and in any case I apparently needs to go through VB6 first. I don't have
 (can't find) my original&nbsp;VB5 discs and in any case it will not run on Windows 7 apparently. It would appear from my investigations that converting VB5 to VB6 is fairly easy and also, apparently, VB6 will run on Windows 7. So, I would like to forget all about
 VB2008 Express. I don't need it,&nbsp;I am not developing software solutions for a business, just home projects that keep my (old) brain active. But I cannot find VB6 for&nbsp;sale anywhere. There are lots o

    <title>Can&#39;t connect to this network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> min kim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to this network</h2>
                    I am frustrated to death right at this moment solving this never-seen-before and not-a-single-post-about-it problem&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>but for my manners I will not stress any other people who are willing to help me. So I will try to be very brief and mannerful.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Okay, I have a home router with a modem showing perfectly good signals</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Main problem : My laptop can't connect to this router wifi.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>it says : Can't connect to this network&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know this router works because my phone is always connected to this wifi and it has no problem</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>surfing the web fast paced when my 3G is off.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>ANd I know that my laptop isn't the major cause of this problem because, my laptop can connect to my phone's 3G hotspot and&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>any other public wifi or my friend's home wifi and never seen it "can't connect to a network"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I find the wifi title in the wifi list, I try connecting it, it takes few seconds showing : connecting...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and says the message I put above : can't connect to this network</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>but when a working wifi shows, I press connect to network and it connects in one second.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Bizarre problem is, sometimes my laptop connects to this home wifi at a very random unexpected timing</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and I can use that internet for about 10 minutes. Then the wifi disappears from the wifi list disconnecting my internet "while"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>my phone is still connected and perfectly working through that wifi that's deleted from the wifi list on my laptop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And sometimes, I get the same message saying I can't connect to a network and the wifi disapears again from the list</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>First connection, I chose home networking which doesn't seem like it helps.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>I tried windows trouble shooting in every network field but shows no solution, tried uninstalling lan driver and reinstalling the driver,&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>updating the driver, restarting computer, unplugging modem and router for 2 minutes and plugging it back in, resetting router</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>to factory setting, asked my internet provider for help and told them to reset my modem as well, tried cmd -&gt; ipconfig /release and&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>/renew,&nbsp;</b><b>I tried having my laptop on airplane mode for a minute and off.</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There are so much things I tried but nothing seems to solve this unusual problem and yes I am still very very frustrated...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>please... anybody help me or give me any simple tip that I did not do I'll gladly use that help. Thank you for your try !</div>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
It is not unusual for a computer to not be able to connect to a router that other devices<br />
can.&nbsp;Most often it is the either the router's firmware, the network drivers (Wifi in this case),<br />
or both.<br />
<br />
Can that computer connect to other networks? Can other computers&nbsp;with&nbsp;same operating<br />
system connect to that&nbsp;router?<br />
<br />
Why is my Internet connection so slow?<br />

</p>
<p>Note&nbsp;using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run,
<br />
and Settings as needed). <strong>Win Key + D</strong> calls the desktop and the using<br />
<strong>Win Key</strong> toggles Desktop and Start Screen.<br />

Control Panel - Network and Sharing Center - Troubleshoot Problems<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7 and Windows 8.<br />
</strong><br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are <br />
you positioned from the router? Are there obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi<br />
Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated <br />
drivers as Windows&nbsp;8&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />

<br />
Make sure you know the login details for your wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />

You will lose connection when doing this and have to redo your logon.<br />

                    <p>I just purchased Ghost in the Shell (2017) in UHD. I'm trying to watch it on my Xbox One X. It reaches 4:43 and then starts buffering and displays the "Can't play" error (error code 0x0000054b). This is definitely not a bandwidth issue. If I skip forward,
 past the seemingly damaged section of the movie, it continues playing nearly instantaneously. Unfortunately though, it does so without audio.</p>

    <title>Skype accounts switching on Skype app for ios&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arciawebb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype accounts switching on Skype app for ios&#63;</h2>
                    I have multiple Skype/Microsoft accounts and I usually use this one specific account for Skype App for iOS. But if I switched accounts in the app, what happens to a chat history or shared images for the account I'm usually using?

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f05f140c-9241-4d08-b0dc-1714859b3a1a" title="arciawebb">
<p>
</p><p>If you're using the new Skype version, your conversations and the photos you shared to a contact will be stored in the cloud for 2 years so you can access them when you log in to the app again. So even if you switch accounts, your conversations and photos
 on the account you usually use should show up on Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this answers your query.</p>

    <title>The Briefcase Is In Use On Another Computer Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sampap  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Briefcase Is In Use On Another Computer Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I used the software PC Mover to migrate my personal files from the hard drive of my old desk top computer running Windows 7 -&nbsp;64 to my new computer running Windows 10 - 64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently on the new PC, in use with the transferred personal files, when clicking on the various files in My Briefcase I can view the individual files listed but when I go to open them I receive the following error message
<strong>The Briefcase Is In Use On Another Computer, Close the Briefcase on That Computer and Try Again.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I replaced my old PC not because of software issues but because of issues related to aging hardware.&nbsp; I had to remove the actual hard drive from the old PC and use by Black X USB adapter to transfer my files to the new PC.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; I have so far have had
 no other problems accessing and opening other personal file transferred from&nbsp;my old PC&nbsp;to the new PC outside of the problem described herein with&nbsp;My Briefcase folder.&nbsp; Any suggested lay person fixes&nbsp;or trouble shooting thoughts would be appreciated.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with store app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open download/updates page in store app, dots keep spinning all the time. After that they are spinning in all store app pages.</p>
<p>I can still use app normally.</p>
<p>But this bug is super annoying and it´s there even after fresh windows 10 installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even more interesting is that this bug seems to happen only in some regions. When I have region set to Poland or Iceland - it appears.</p>
<p>But when I set United States region - it disapear. Maybe some issue on servers side?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows version - 1709, 16299.19</p>
<p>Newest store update.</p>
<p>This bug was also in version 1703</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried wsreset.exe, reset app etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for help!</p>

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Store app. Run following command in administrative Windows PowerShell: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, reset the software distribution folder:
<br />
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable airplane mode from the Action Center. Press Windows key + A then toggle on airplane more. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.
<br />
<br />2. Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver
<br />
<br />3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />
<br />4. Now, let’s restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Typethe following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                        net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />                        net start cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                        net start bits
<br />
<br />                        net start msiserver
<br />
<br />5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it and then restart the computer. 
<br />
<br />Try browsing the store again.

<p>Unfortunately none of this solutions seems to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can live with that, I can use store app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it is really bad and annoying experience with this app.</p>

                    Hi
<div>I've recently upgraded to 8.1, but now when I right-click on the Desktop it pauses for about 15 seconds before displaying the menu. Any ideas why this is happening? It used to work immediately on Windows 8.</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            <p>The problem could be&nbsp;a problematic&nbsp;third party context menu handler.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The following link has some info and a download to ShellExView which you can use to selectively disable third party context menu handlers to find out a problematic one:</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>You could try disabling all non-Microsoft context menu handlers and then, if the problem resolves, re-enable them one at a time to see which one was the problem</p>

                    I get this message every time I boot up my laptop. I have taken the ask me later option and checked to see if I have the latest driver update (NVIDIA GeForce 8200m) and device manager says I do. I have check with NVIDIA and they want me to delete two files
 I can't find in the registry (ISUSPM startup and ISUSScheduler). Another site says delete the driver and manually install it. NVIDIA recommends using the manufacture of my computer to do the install. What do I do?

            I tried Debleena S's solution but it didn't work. I still got the "finish installing the driver" message. I did some looking online and came across what appears to have solved the problem. Some people think the UAC is the problem and suggested to disable
 it. So I disabled the User Account Control feature and rebooted my computer. The message went away after my computer rebooted. I re-enabled the UAC feature and the problem hasn't come back. I won't update my NVIDIA driver any time soon. According to what I
 found on the net NVIDIA has had this problem with their drivers for a couple of years.

<h3> brayer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Have the monthly security update iso&#39;s been discontinued&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Has Microsoft ceased publishing the monthly security release iso images?&nbsp; If so, is there an alternative available for customers with workstations that can not obtain them via a network connection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has not published a monthly security release iso image since August, meaning that they're now approaching being 4 months out of date.&nbsp; https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/913086 still only shows the August 2016 image as being the most recent
 released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those who are responsible for systems which do not have, and are not allowed, any access to a network or to the 'outside world,' the monthly iso images are an important tool for keeping things secure and up-to-date.&nbsp; When working with government accredited
 workstations, there is a requirement to install all applicable updates within a certain timeframe.&nbsp;&nbsp; For some levels of accreditation, that's 30 days.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the highest levels, it can be as short as 7 days. &nbsp; In the case where there are multiple such systems
 that run different versions of Windows, the iso images are vital.&nbsp; The alternative is to manually download every patch for every Windows version each month, which creates a strong risk that an update might be missed.</p>

            <p>If you look at my previous posts, I did indeed say that.&nbsp; More than once.&nbsp; The first instance was the second paragraph of my original post.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While monthly rollups are useful, they're also somewhat less convenient.&nbsp; Instead of keeping a single DVD as an archive copy for each month, now government and government-supporting users now have to keep three.&nbsp; Actually, if .NET updates aren't included,
 then that's an additional disk.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also disappointing that the August and September iso images were never released.</p>

            <p>With all due respect and not to quibble excessively&nbsp;but in your first post you stated, "Microsoft has not published a monthly security release iso image since August [of 2016]."</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your second post, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">you</span> <em>posited
</em>that Microsoft was "4 months behind in issuing security updates." </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Microsoft isn't "4 months behind in issuing security updates" for Win10, Win8.1, Win7 or Vista.<br />
<br />
</li><li>AFAIK Microsoft never released security ISOs for Win10.<br />
<br />
</li><li><em>Apparently</em> Microsoft is no longer releasing security ISOs for Win8.1 or Win7 since the monthly rollups&nbsp;(beginning&nbsp;in October of 2016) replace them.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Again, you will find appropriate support for Win10 in your environment in <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?category=Windows10ITPro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Cherrypicking in responses pretty much does constitute quibbling. &nbsp; It's being downright nit-picky, actually.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your furst bullet point, especially so. &nbsp; The August Security Release iso image has not been released.&nbsp; That's 4 months behind the current updates. &nbsp;&nbsp; You also mention Vista, which wasn't mentioned in any of my posts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has issued security isos for Windows 7 and 8 for years.&nbsp; Granted, they haven't released any for 10, but only mentioning 10 makes for a weak argument.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your final point, once again, ignores the point that no isos were released for two months before the rollups started being published.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall, your responses come over as glib and give a poor impression.</p>

            <p>I don't have an account to login to to method 1 doesn't work on the first step. Let me rephrase the question. When I click on the 'Add Account' button that is when I get the error.</p>

<p>The app trouble shooter was in 'Detecting problems' mode for some time then it came back with a dialog box "Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem". Then I am basically directed to a forum like I am on.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6d4b902-0a74-47b7-8893-7cf7f8178d07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6d4b902-0a74-47b7-8893-7cf7f8178d07" /></a></p>
