<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Microsoft has *never* sent a virus, neither along with an update nor</div>
<div>by itself. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One of three things happened to you: </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. what you thought was a virus was actually not a virus </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. what you thought came from Microsoft actually came from somewhere</div>
<div>else</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. you did get a virus and you did get a Microsoft update, but they</div>
<div>had nothing to do with each other and arrived at your computer</div>
<div>separately.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One additional question (and point) for you: you say Microsoft "sent</div>
<div>me a update." Was this an e-mail, or did it come as part of the normal</div>
<div>update procedure? If it came as an e-mail, it definitely didn't come</div>
<div>from Microsoft. Microsoft never sends updates (or anything else) to</div>
<div>you by e-mail. Almost certainly, something like that was a malware</div>
<div>infection that came from somebody other than Microsoft.</div>

    <title>Change the Microsoft account registered with my Windows 10 domain - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christianwickham1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change the Microsoft account registered with my Windows 10 domain login</h2>
                    <p>I've been struggling to find a valid answer to this question, so I hope someone can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I log in to my Windows 10 computers with a domain login (i.e. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) - all my Windows 10 computers are Domain-Joined to an Azure AD domain. I use *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to log in to my Windows 10 PCs, and this is also my Office 365 subscription
 and OneDrive etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Part of my Windows 10 profile includes a Microsoft account that is different - it is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - this is an email address I set up with a silly name when I was younger. This is the Microsoft account that is used to sync my settings across
 all my Windows 10 devices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now I want to change this to be a new Microsoft account - *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</li></ul>
<p>One of the reasons I want to do this is that the old account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) keeps on getting associated to work tasks I am doing, not very professional looking.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I do this?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I do not need to change the login of my Windows profile (that is, I still want my login profile to remain as *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) - most help seems to direct to setting up a new profile with a new Microsoft account - that is not my problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also don't need to change settings, names, pictures for my Microsoft account(s) - there are no problems with doing that. I am not trying to add another Microsoft account to my Windows applications like email, I am not trying to change my password for the
 Microsoft account or change the way I log in to Windows, I am really just trying to rid my Windows 10 account of *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just need to change my Settings | Accounts | Your Info - to be a different Microsoft account</p>
<p>How do I do this?</p>

            Due to the scope of your issue which relates to Windows 10 enterprise deployment, you would be best served redirecting this question to the dedicated Windows 10 forums on Technet.

                    <span>My Toshiba Satellite P870-026 came Windows 8.&nbsp; &nbsp;I upgraded to Win 8.1 via Windows updates about a year ago.&nbsp; I've never used WiDi but recently purchased a new TV with screen mirroring capability.

 My Samsung Galaxy 3 phone mirrors its screen without trouble but my laptop cannot find the TV.</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>The process is under the Charms menu and then to select Devices, Project, Add a Wireless Display.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;comes up with the message "No devices found".&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From exploring the web for solutions&nbsp;I've been trying to update the Intel HD Graphics 4000 drivers though it tells me they are up to date.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For some inexplicable reason the&nbsp;"Intel(R) WiDi Update Tool.exe"&nbsp;won't run and displays an&nbsp;error message&nbsp;"Failed to launch due to network connectivity issue". I have no idea what his means
 as I never have trouble with WiFi.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I've had no luck with Toshiba forums while&nbsp;Windows Help and Intel sites seems to take me in circles.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I even exploring the right area?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to check the article below with detailed information on projecting your PC screen to a TV. It also explains how you can connect even devices that are not compatible with Miracast&nbsp;using other Wireless Display Adapter.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you face any issues, you can also try the troubleshooting steps suggested in the ‘<em>Fixing problems</em>’ section.</p>

            <p>Thanks Niranjan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've read the articles but, despite one being a bit too technical, they both suggest that my laptop is functioning correctly (and has Miracast) since I can Add Devices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just discovered something unusual that might help.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the TV is playing TV programs, the laptop DOES find the TV and the TV is listed under Play Devices. But, at soon as the TV is switched to Mirroring, the TV disappears from the laptop's listing. If the TV is set to mirroring first as you are supposed to
 do, the laptop cannot find the TV. There seems to be some incompatibility though the TV is brand new and works with an older Samsung Galaxy phone.</p>

            <p>Hello Hans,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank&nbsp;you for keeping us updated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can solve many problems by installing the latest drivers for your PC and the latest firmware for your wireless display or Miracast adapter. For more info about installing drivers on your PC, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 to download and install that firmware. You can also check the Windows Store to see if there’s an app from the manufacturer of your wireless display or Miracast adapter that updates firmware.</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Niranjan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the documents though I have read these in my previous trawling.&nbsp; I am fairly confident all my drivers are
 up to date (though I understand that files could be corrupt and that update functions will not pick that up).&nbsp; In respect of the Intel HD Graphics 4000 and Realtek RTL8723AE Wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E NIC, (the 2 devices I thought might relate to the problem)
 I updated these from the Device Manager.&nbsp; Yesterday I checked Windows updates - it was Automatic for Important Updates AND Recommended Updates so all should be fine.&nbsp; Though it is probably not relevant but yesterday I also selected the "updates for other Microsoft
 products" (off by default).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have done a little more experimenting with interesting results.&nbsp; Because the TV needs to be switched to mirroring,
 I never tried to Add a Device with the TV in normal running mode.&nbsp; In the TV's normal mode the laptop finds the TV and since that time, the TV remains a device under Projectors (but says Not Connected). Of course it doesn't mirror when the TV is set to mirroring
 as has been the case all along.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, I disconnected my Modem under the laptop's network settings and it all works as it should. When the TV is set
 to mirroring, the laptop projects as all the documents suggest.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The TV is a smart TV and if I disconnect the TV from the modem (whether or not the laptop is connected to the modem),
 I cannot make the connection. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So the TV needs to be connected to the modem but the laptop disconnected. That doesn't make any sense!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In trying to understand this, I tried the phone with the TV disconnected from the modem. The phone will project its screen
 which still suggests something peculiar with the laptop or some networking configuration.&nbsp; Not being able to connect my laptop to the modem when using the mirroring function means I can only project what is on the hard drive - not what was intended I'm sure.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this is enough information for you to guide me down another path.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the brief information on the issue. While we are searching on this one, I would request you to also check with the TV manufacturer about the settings. Let's combine the steps together to work on this issue. Since the manufacturer also has the
 feature to connect the TV&nbsp;with Windows, let's check what does the manufacturer have to say.</p>

            <p>Hi Niranjan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's taken a bit of time to get info from Samsung, not helped by them not answering the question I asked. When I rang their service centre, the person didn't have a particularly strong understanding of mirroring and Wi-Fi direct. In essence, he said there
 aren't any particular settings on the TV to adjust and that "it just works".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have however had a close look at the TV's network setting and have compiled the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SAMSUNG TV NETWORK SETTINGS</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Network Status</em></span></p>

<p><em>2.</em><span>&nbsp;
</span><em>IPS Setting – Automatic or Manual. Set to Automatic</em></p>
<p><em>3.</em><span>&nbsp;
</span><em>DNS Setting – Automatic or Manual. Set to Automatic</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Network Settings</em></span></p>
<p><em>Connect here to wireless</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Wi-Fi Direct</em></span><em> (works with compatible devices without being connected to a router)</em></p>
<p><em>Step 1. Search for devices using Refresh button.</em></p>
<p><em>Step 2. Select the Wi-Fi Direct device to connect to.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Attempted connection to phone: Under Step 1, the TV will find and list the phone, but only if the phone’s screen mirroring is selected but the status displayed on the TV is “Disconnected”.
</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Under step 2, the TV fails to connect.</em><span>&nbsp; </span>
<em>Similarly the phone states “no devices found”.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</span><em>Under Step 2, the TV cannot connect to the laptop. If the laptop is connected to the router, the TV cannot even find the laptop</em><em>.&nbsp;
</em></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Device Name</em></span></p>
<p><em>To change the TV’s name</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a link to the TV's manual. The wireless networking section starts on page 56.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/UM/201403/20140331193420198/%5BENG%5DX14DVBADH-0327.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Samsung TV model UA60H7000AW manual</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I've been trying to understand is the laptop and TV's Wi-Fi capabilities- whether Wi-Fi via the router or Wi-Fi Direct.&nbsp; With my limited understanding of Wi-Fi, it seems the TV's two screen-mirroring options are: 1) via the router (mirroring option)
 and; 2) Wi-Fi Direct which bypasses the router. It is odd then that the only way to get the laptop to mirror its screen is for the TV to be set to mirroring and for the TV to be connected to the router and for the laptop to be disconnected from the router
 (suggesting the laptop is using Wi-Fi Direct). &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Conversely, the phone will mirror its screen to the TV via the TV's and phone's mirroring settings but the TV does not need to be (but may be) connected to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Wi-Fi Direct option on the TV does not work either device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope all this helps in some way. This seems awfully messy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            Hans, did you ever find a solution for your problem? I am having the exact same problem with my brand new Samsung H6350 tv and my Windows 8.1 laptop (though my laptop is an Asus Rog).

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gave up. How much time do you have to spend on such things? I've begrudgingly reverted to a 4m HDMI cable (the cheap ALDI cables work fine).&nbsp; I was disappointed my Microsoft adviser no longer responded to my entries.&nbsp; From the Toshiba forum I got nowhere
 also, although there was a Toshiba newsletter saying Win 8 or 8.1 (can't remember which)&nbsp; no longer supported screen mirroring; odd since no one else is saying that and it does work in peculiar circumstances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For other reasons, I rebuilt my laptop from scratch and it behaves the same so it doesn't seem a laptop configuration or driver problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think there is any else I can do without resorting to 3rd party add on boxes which defeats the purpose of having all this built in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With my android phone working so seamlessly with the TV, I'm not impressed with Microsoft who still haven't got 8.1 right. Guess who won't be taking up the offer for a free Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck</p>
<p>Hans</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new laptop&nbsp;running on&nbsp;windows 8.1. My tv is a new samsung H6400. When i start mirroring it mirrors 30sec-1 minute and then disconnects.
</p>
<p>Dont know if its helpfull to you but i found out the only way it works is if i start the laptop and then restart the laptop. Then the mirroring works fine on the tv but it only works ones, when i stop mirroring and start mirroring again i have the same disconnecting
 issue. I have to restart the laptop again and it works fine again. </p>
<p>Dont know anything about computers so i havent got a clue why this is happening. Really dont think it has anything to do with the tv.</p>
<p>Just found out this restart thing by accident.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must confess I've not experienced drop-outs. My laptop just would never connect unless I disconnected the laptop from the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to run a piece of software from Parrot that would let my laptop mirror to an Apple TV which is connected to my TV via HDMI cable. That used to drop out and I'd have trouble reconnecting and needed to restart.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm quite sick of IT software and hardware that under delivers.&nbsp; Before they sort it out some new and equally buggy comes along.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have most of the files on a separate drive I just plug in to the TV. If I need something from my laptop, or if the TV doesn't have the necessary codec, I use a cheap long HDMI cable from ALDI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Four bars of connection but it says I have no internet access</h2>
                    The router is all the way in the basement and I usually use my laptop in my room which is on the second floor. I have four bars of internet connection. I was working fine for 2 months (that's when we moved in) and now all of a sudden, I started to get
 an exclamation mark/ yellow triangle on the network. After going through many solutions, I ended up doing a factory restore. It still hasn't solved any problem though. I get internet access randomly but it goes on and off every two or three minutes. I have
 uninstalled and&nbsp;re installed&nbsp;the network adapter. I honestly don't have any more things to try. This is my last resort. Please help. Thank you.

            Thank you for replying!<br />
<br />
<div>1. I have not tried connecting my laptop to a wired connection.&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. My laptop is from the company Gateway and the model number Z06</div>
<div>3. I have not made any changes. However, before I did a factory restore, I had a lot of updates. This is probably bad for my laptop because I didn't do any of the Windows Updates for a VERY long time so when I started installing them again, One after one.
 I want to add one more thing which I think could be problem but I'm not sure. I play a game called Combat Arms. My network started to say "No internet access" when I had combat arms installed on my laptop. I uninstalled the game and my internet started to
 work just fine. A few days later, I decided to install the game again to see what would happen. It was lagging really bad so I uninstalled the same day and that's when the internet access problem started again. I tried other solutions but nothing was working
 and finally did a factory restore, which clearly didn't help at all. So I am wondering...could a game really mess up the network connection?</div>
<div>4. There is no error code or any message. On the taskbar, on top of the internet bar thing (dont know what its called), a yellow triangle appears with an exclamation mark and it just says "No internet connection"</div>
<div>5. I have Verizon FiOS</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried almost every one of those methods.&nbsp;</div>
<div>It seems that the internet is working fine for now but I have a feeling the yellow triangle is going to appear any minute now.</div>

</p><ul>
<li>What happens when you try to play CD/DVD?</li></ul>
<p>I would suggest you to try the steps below and check.</p>

<p>Click Hardware and Sound and then click Windows Media Player DVD</p>
<p>Follow the instructions</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Place the computer in clean boot state and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup
 is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow

            I had this problem and others, too. Like cpu at 100% with no apps running, older software wouldn't run, Windows crashed often, etc. I dusted off my Windows 7 disk, installed, and all the problems went away.&nbsp; Every new windows version was an improvement
 up to 7. After than each new windows has been a little worse. I hope the people that wrote DR-DOS will come back and write a PC program that will allow me to continue running a windows type system. Otherwise I guess it's Mac or Linux.<br />

<h2>            System setting- Family- Parental controls. I need to reset the passcode </h2>
                    
<p>I just bought an Xbox 360 recently from a pawn shop and there is a parental control passcode that is needed for many of the apps and many things are blocked. How can I reset it to where I have the option to put in my own code or the ability to turn it off?</p>

<h2>            red triangles above enemies head on mini map and on screen</h2>
                    
<p>I'm wondering if anyone knows EXACTLY when these red triangles appear? (other than when you spot someone)</p>
<p>I have noticed when I get killed, I can see the red triangle on the guy who shot me for a brief second before it goes to the "Where Am I going now cam"...</p>

<h2>            SppExtComObjHook.dll</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community.&nbsp;<br />
Recently i have installed the latest windows 10 update ( ' Creator ' ) and ran a Windows Defender Scan.</p>
<p>When it scanned my whol pc with ' Full Scan ' option, it said ' No threats found ' but, right after that notification, another one pops out, which said ' 2 Files skipped because they were excluded ' or something like this. These are those files.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ee62d0b1-b728-496c-8dc1-3055e10228d9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ee62d0b1-b728-496c-8dc1-3055e10228d9" /></a>What
 am i supposed to do now ? Is a virus in my PC ? I am pretty sure that they came in my PC with the Creators Update.<br />
Before doing that update i ran a few times Windows Defender and no files were skipped. After the update i saw that notification and decided to format my SSD ( the disk where my windows is ) and Installed a clean windows and then updated again to ' Creator Update
 ' and these files are back.&nbsp;<br />
I tried to delete them and then, after a restart, they came back . Over and Over again. What am i supposed to do ?&nbsp;<br />
Please, i need a fast answer.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi AAASE,
<br />
<br />The new Skype app it is being updated constantly to bring it up to the functionality of Skype 7, Microsoft is working very hard in the background . . . 
<br />
<br />In order to improve Skype, please provide feedback to Microsoft regarding any shortcomings or bugs you have found in the new Skype app on this thread
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-128c-40eb-a99b-f3985c925176">https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-1...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are unhappy with the new Skype app, Microsoft have decided to extend the period for which Skype Classic (version 7) will be available, the September deadline, no longer exists
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic:

            Hi,
<br />First: You should verify the computer's audio, Microsoft provide a few steps:

<p>Thanks for the ideas.</p>
<p>In the long run I found that if both parties have the latest version of Skype (App) 12.xx we cannot communicate with video call, although all other functions work fine, including video message.</p>
<p>I switched ONE computer to the "Classic" version 8.30.0.50 everything works fine on BOTH computers.&nbsp; No problems.</p>
<p>Evidently, the 12.xx version doesn't work if both parties have it installed.&nbsp; Really strange.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the ideas.</p>

<br />
<br />Press Enter
<br />
<br />After the install process finishes, you have the Windows 10 Skype app back
<br />
<br />Check if its working, if not...
<br />I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<h2>            How can unfreeze a completely frozen windows 10 desktop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>First of all I'm&nbsp;using my laptop to write this as the computer in question is a desktop that I'm having issues with at the moment.<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Issue 1 (Most Important Issue)</span></strong></p>
<p>I've been trying to install AVG on my computer but this has happened twice when the AVG installation is almost done both my desktop and taskbar would completely&nbsp;freeze up however this time when I this time when trying to unfreeze my computer (which I don't
 know even know how to do) the background wallpaper disappeared and its now just a white screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm tired of turning of the computer by pressing the power button and really don't want to do that anymore. I just want to know is there a way to actually unfreeze a completely frozen computer when you can't when nothing works no keyboard actions work i.e
 ctr alt delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since I'm&nbsp;already here mind as well ask about a different issue&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center">
</p><p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Issue 2
</span></strong></p>
<p>I hardly turn off my computer at all anymore, <span>
cause&nbsp;</span>every time I turn it turn on again it gets stuck on the logo screen meaning it doesn't load up so i have to turn it off&nbsp;and on several times to actually get past the logo screen for it to fully load up. I've tried pressing the f8 button to see
 the "boot menu" when its stuck on the logo screen button the fn buttons don't seem to work and it seems like that aren't even enabled&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this is a desktop we're talking about there is no "fn" button</p>
<p>
</p><p>the buttons are&nbsp;</p>
<p>f1</p>
<p>f2</p>
<p>f3</p>
<p>f4</p>
<p>f5</p>
<p>f6</p>
<p>f7</p>
<p>f8</p>
<p>f9</p>
<p>f10</p>
<p>f11</p>
<p>f12<br />
<br />
I would appreciate if anyone can help me with unfreezing a completely frozen computer where you can't do anything task bar, start menu doesn't work nor even keyboard actions like ctr alt delete. don't even work<br />

<p>Lol at your suggestion of installing Avira its the worst antivirus there is of all time. You can never force stop their so-called Luke Filewalker "virus scanning" even by going to the task manager and trying to "end task" there. The only way to stop the&nbsp;"Luke
 Filewalker" virus scanning" is to log in out and log in back but their Luke Filewalker "virus scanning" still comes up by itself even after disabling it from launching at startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I came here to get help with my computer and not get into an argument&nbsp;about what antivirus is the "worst" or "best". I've had AVG before and have never encountered this issue problem. But your suggestion of installing Avira is ludicrous to me because of
 the issues I've had with Avira and would never in a million years ever again install Avira!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I need the ISO file image of my Windows 7. So I opened microsoft download page and verified the product key and with my big surprise, english was not listed between available languages. Only Korean! This is ridicolous! How is this possible? I need a US image!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, now I can't go forward with the installation on the virtual machine because the product key of the original Win 7 is not valid!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have my windows installation DVD for Vista Home Premium x64 SP1.&nbsp; I booted from the DVD and chose to install windows.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook blocks Scanner&#39;s access</h2>
                    When I scan from my work computer to email (where it is supposed to open Microsoft Outlook and create&nbsp; a new message with the scan as an attachment)&nbsp; Outlook blocks it and i get a message about Another program is trying to access Outlook. How can I stop
 Outlook from blocking the scanner? How do i permanently allow scans to be sent to Outlook?&nbsp; This is only a&nbsp; problem with my computer which has Windows 10.&nbsp; Everyone else has Windows 7 and they do not have this problem.&nbsp; They also have the same version of Outlook
 (outlook 2016).&nbsp;

            This is a flaw in which the send to recipient function is actually broken. You are best off scanning and saving the document/image first, then attach it in Outlook.

<p>Hello SherryLipp,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft answers Forum.</p>
<p>Try to disable the adobe plugin on the browser to open the pdf with the adobe program and not inside of the&nbsp;browser.<br />
Check and see if there are multiple add ons for Adobe and uncheck all of them.&nbsp;It may be&nbsp;Adobe Link Helper and&nbsp;Adobe PDF Reader.</p>
<p>You also may&nbsp;go into Adobe&nbsp;in the accessibility setup assisstant.&nbsp;Set Adobe to not display in the browser under Adobe's internet settings.</p>
<p>If that doesn't help with your issue, you should contact Adobe for support options.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h2>            External hard drive won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t format - please help</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone. I have a WD My Passport X 2TB external hard drive that I can t get working. I spent an hour on the phone with XBOX support with no luck either so this community is my last best hope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My XBOX one won't format the drive for games and apps. After naming the device and selecting "format" it just takes me right back to the storage selection screen leaving my drive unformatted. I've formatted it on a PC. Still no good on the XB1. I can format
 it on my 360 and use it there but nothing on the XB1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done hard resets galore, tried different ports, everything I can think of or research on the web. Even the tech through XBOX support couldn't figure out the issue. Can anyone help? I would greatly appreciate it!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Try these steps. &nbsp;First make sure your external HDD is disconnected. &nbsp;Then do another hard reset like this. &nbsp;Hold the power button on the console for 10 seconds or until the power shuts down completely. &nbsp;Unplug the power cord from the back of the console
 for 5 minutes. &nbsp;Plug the power cord back -</p>
<p>1. Power on your xBox (do not plug in drive yet) </p>
<p>2. Go to the side menu to settings</p>
<p>3. Go to System, then storage</p>
<p>4. Scroll over to Manage storage area. (you will see the internal storage) </p>
<p>5. Plug in the new drive. </p>
<p>6. Select the new drive and it should give the choice to format for games. </p>
<p>7. Follow the prompts for the remaining questions (default storage location, etc.)
</p>
<p>8. You may go back to where you see format the drive for games a second time after answering the questions, chose it and you will hear the system format the drive and shortly the drive will pop up as ready.</p>
<p>Let us know. &nbsp;Good Luck!</p>

<p>Thank you for the rply but unfortunately it didn't work. In fact, it didn't even give me the option to format the drive. It's treating it like a media drive. All I can do is view contents, of which there is none. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I do appreciate the help. Thank you. </p>
<p>Still in need of suggestions.</p>

<p>Have you tried putting it on a PC and removing all partitions then re-partition it and format that partition to NTFS? &nbsp;I have seen where others have had good results with that approach. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you. I figured out the partitions and tried a few different sizes but still no luck. The XBOX 1 simply will not format the drive. As soon as I click "format for games and apps" it loops back to the storage screen showing me an unformatted drive.</p>
<p>It's very frustrating but I seriously appreciate the suggestions. I'm trying everything.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business Notifications Don&#39;t show Message</h2>
                    <p>On my Iphone devices, I will receive a notification of a message on the lock screen. When I touch the notification, the Skype for Business app loads, but the&nbsp; message is not present.&nbsp; This continually happens. Both Iphone 6s+ and Iphone Xs Max.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is the notification of a message from a staff member:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05415394-f5db-4a35-b741-df46b52c508f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05415394-f5db-4a35-b741-df46b52c508f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and below is what I see in the skype client...</p>

<p>Hi Kai Ponte,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my tests, after I touch the new IM notification on my iPhone, the message is displayed under the
<strong>Recent</strong> section. And if you start chatting with the contact from the contacts list, nothing will show in the chat window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you cannot see the message under the recent section, I suggest you try switching to another network and see if the message will be synced to your iPhone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, I’d like to confirm if you’ve read the message on your other devices. As far as I know, the Skype for business conversations are saved in the conversation history folder of Outlook and they won’t be synced to the Skype for business of all your
 devices. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this situation, I suggest you check if the messages are stored in the conversation history folder in Outlook and let us know the results.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Huni</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sometimes it does and other times it doesn't show up. I just did a test and it showed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it will show either on my phones (i have two) or my PC but never on each. Very irritating. (I submitted feedback for that also some weeks ago.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, it asks multiple times per day for a PIN.&nbsp; Don't know why.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Kai Ponte,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the details. As Huni mentioned above,&nbsp;<span>if you’ve read the message on your other devices, the read messages won’t be synced to the Skype for business of all your devices. So it is a normal behavior that&nbsp;</span><span>it
 will show either on your phones or your PC but never on each.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, about the issue that the Skype for Business application&nbsp;</span><span>asks multiple times per day for a PIN, may I confirm if your organization have deployed MAM polices to
</span>allow iOS FaceID for&nbsp;<span>access to Skype for Business application? If so, please try to enable fingerprint login with FaceID to check this issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, to narrow down this issue, we need to confirm following questions:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Do other user in your organization have the same issue? If so, does this issue occur when using Skype for Business in iPhone 6s + or iPhone Xs Max?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Does this issue persist to both your iPhone 6s+ and iPhone Xs Max?</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;</span><span>Also, may I know if&nbsp;</span>you use pure Office 365 cloud-based Lync server or an on-premise Lync server?</p>
<p>4. Please make sure to update your Skype for Business application to the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Jennifer</span></p>

<p>yes, we use InTune. All of our devices are loaded with InTune and apps are deployed using Company Portal. My staff manages the devices for the 150 or so mobile units in my department.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hence, Skype for Business is one of those and access is through the
 company portal app.</p>

<p>Hi Kai Ponte,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the details. About this issue, may I confirm if you have enabled&nbsp;fingerprint login with FaceID and the issus still persists?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, to narrow down this issue, could you please help to check the questions I mentioned in my last reply and share the answer with us?</p>

<p>Apologies: Yes I have Face ID implemented on this device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>1. Do other user in your organization have the same issue? If so, does this issue occur when using Skype for Business in iPhone 6s + or iPhone Xs Max?</span></p>
<p>some of my staff report similar issues. However, being a manager, I am expected to be always connected on my desktop and mobile.&nbsp; Most of them only use desktop.&nbsp; I have an Iphone 6s plus also, which i use for
 Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Does this issue persist to both your iPhone 6s+ and iPhone Xs Max?</span></p>
<p><span>Correct - this seems to occur on either device. I used to have an Iphone X which also had the situation. I do still have a 950xl, but that device is not enrolled in my company
 portal, so can't use it for Skype for Business.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;</span><span>Also, may I know if&nbsp;</span>you use pure Office 365 cloud-based Lync server or an on-premise Lync server?</p>
<p>We are pure hosted Office 365.&nbsp; We have 70,000 users. My staff handle provisioning for the 1500 users in my department and the 150 or so mobile devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Please make sure to update your Skype for Business application to the latest version.</p>
<p>Always is - Currently on 6.22.0.3</p>

<p>Hi Kai Ponte,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the details you provided. To confirm if this issue is related to the&nbsp;InTune, please try to sign in your account in the web Skype for Business app to see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I will send you a test account via private message, you can use the test account to sign in the Skype for Business app that is deployed using your Company Portal and check the result. Here is a link to access the pricate message:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox</a>.</p>
