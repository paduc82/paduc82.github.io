            Did not work. It still goes through the entire process only the fail, and undo changes. When you return to xblGamesave the two items have returned to ready. I have done this twice with no positive result.

            <p>It is also possible to use DISM offline to install the update (which is how I did some installs). &nbsp;After downloading the update, you have to boot with Windows install media or a recovery drive USB and then run DISM from the Command Prompt to patch your Windows
 while it is offline. &nbsp;I have steps to do this in the thread linked below on page 15:</p>

            <p>Thank you Andre. Your suggestion worked. I was getting quite annoyed waiting 25 minutes for my computer to start. The fact that you can not stop the update from installing meant you had wait every time you started your computer.</p>
<p>Again thanks.</p>

    <title>Automatically Get New IP Settings for Network Adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ortnpalms  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatically Get New IP Settings for Network Adapter</h2>
                    I have a home network with two Vista Computers, and I have a Vista Laptop for work.&nbsp; When my work Laptop is home it does not automatically connect to the internet, although I want it to.&nbsp; When I go to the Network and Sharing Center on the laptop it shows
 icons for&nbsp;the laptop, my home network, and the internet.&nbsp; Threre is a red X between the network icon and the internet.&nbsp; If I click on the red X a popup window says that Windows is checking the problem.&nbsp; Then a box pops up with several options, one if which
 is "Automatically get new IP settings for Network Adapter "Wireless Network Connection."&nbsp; When I click on that a window pops up that says Repairing, and after a brief interval it announces that the problem has been fixed, and it has been fixed.<br />
<br />
How can I set things up so that it will do this automatically without this manual intervention.&nbsp; There must be some way because I am never asked for a password or permission to continue.<br />
<br />
If I turn the laptop off and then back on a short time later, the network connection is still there.&nbsp; The problem occurs when I try again a few days later.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
P.S.&nbsp; I tried to submit this a couple of days ago, but it doesn't show up under my threads, so I don't know what happened to it.&nbsp; If the earlier post is there without me being able to find it I apologize.&nbsp; I don't enjoy retyping things, that's for sure.

            Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I did that.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure that this would fix the problem though because the problem occurs after powering down one day and powering back up several days later.&nbsp; So presumably the power to the nework adapter has been turning off during those powered down intervals.<br />
<br />
Something else occurred tonight when I powered up.&nbsp; I was asked to confirm something about the network (unfortunately I can't remember what) and after that I was connected to the internet - without having to go through the manual process described with my problem.&nbsp;
 So maybe something has been reconfigured that will fix the problem.

    <title>Does downloading and installing games on an external hard drive slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> condemned sage  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does downloading and installing games on an external hard drive slow down the games&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone. So I bought Gears Of War Ultimate Edition and whenever it played a cuts scene, the cut scene would skip a lot. This happened with the opening cut scene and the ones in the campaign but the rest of the game ran fine. So I uninstalled it and reinstalled
 it but it did the same thing. I thought I would see if it ran better if I moved the data to the internal hard drive and it did. The opening cut scene did not skip at all. Haven't played campaign since I made the move with the data so I don't know if the campaign
 cut scenes will have stopped skipping yet.</p>

<p>Now I also had the cut scene skipping problem on Far Cry 4, which I am now going to have moved to my internal hard drive so hopefully that won't happen again. I wanted to know though, is this a common problem? Is there any way to make sure a game plays correctly
 on an external hard drive or does the Xbox One have problems correctly transferring data to an external hard drive? Or I guess just have problems playing cut scenes from an external hard drive. Also I am using a Toshiba Canvio Basics1 TB hard drive, if that
 makes any difference.</p>

<p>Hi Condemned Sage,</p>
<p>No it shouldn't affect gameplay but maybe have a slower launch, I have an 4tb harddrive and all the games have been running without any problems. the games themselves could be the problem, you should get into contact with the developers of the games to see
 if they have any known problems with using harddrive or any bugs/glitches in the game currently.</p>
<p>I hope you get your answer soon.</p>
<p>Happy Gaming!.</p>
<p>p.s if using external drives affected gameplay/experience I don't think xbox would made it prossble to use external harddrives.</p>

<p>I noticed that once I started using an external hd (3TB), every game I install always just stops randomly during the installation. It will say "installation stopped" so I have to hit start and try again, and it will continue where it left off.</p>
<p>For example, I started installing GoW UE about 2 hours ago and I am on 32%. I've had to restart the install at 15%, 26%, and 31%. I don't like having to monitor the progress all night and I'd like to get started before I have to go to bed lol</p>

<p>This is happening with me. We bought a Toshiba Canvio 2TB drive a little over a year ago. As far as I can recall it seemed to do the job just fine. More recently though and more often than not, games like Destiny (The Taken King), Farcry 4, The Witcher 3
 and many more... all seemed to skip every few seconds mainly during cut scenes. </p>
<p>This is the first and only other post Ive managed to find mentioning this problem and I'm not sure what I can do about it. I've had to resort to uninstalling lesser played games just to keep current games on the internal drive... which obviously defeats
 the purpose of having extra storage :-(</p>
<p>If anyone has any solutions or ideas I'd appreciate it.</p>

<p>I have an external hard drive and I had no problem with the cut scenes in gears of war ultimate edition. Two things you should check is the speed of the drive (RPM) and the transfer speed of the drive. Compare this to a high quality drive brand (Seagate)
 and this should determine if your hard drive is good or not. If it has similar stats, then try the hard drive on a different xbox one, this will see if it is the hard drive, or your xbox one.</p>

<p><span>Hi Lorenzo,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A factory reset can remove or retain files depends on the options you selected. You need to determine which personal files and programs installed on your computer will be removed or remain before
 you perform this operation. </span><span>To make sure that we can provide the appropriate resolution to your concerns with factory reset, we’d like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Which version or build of Windows device are you using? To know, press
<strong>Windows + R</strong> to open the <strong>Run</strong> window. Type <em><span style="color: rgba(0, 176, 80, 1)">winver</span>
</em>and press <strong>Enter</strong>. A new window will open showing the version and build number of your Windows device.</span></li><li><span>What are the workarounds you have done so far?</span></li><li><span>Do you have any important programs on your computer?</span></li><li><span>When you attempt a factory reset, did you select an option to refresh your PC without affecting your files?</span></li><li><span>Can we have a screenshot of your settings you are trying to navigate?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>In addition, you can read this article:

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Regarding the issue, I would like to let you know that controlling Windows updates is somewhat difficult in Windows 10, but you can see the options here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />If you have Windows 10 Pro , Methods 4 and 5 are the best way to resolve this as Windows would always ask you to before downloading updates.
<br />Another way would be to use a 3rd party app like Stop Updates10. which allows you to disable Windows 10 Updates with a single click.

            Please note, Microsoft's approach to updates is very different than earlier releases. They are basically mandatory because of Microsoft's past history with customers sometimes failing to install important updates.
<br />
<br />See options for managing how and when Windows Updates are installed.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Set your Internet connection as metered:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Use Active Hours and Restart options:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windows-update-behavior-using-active-hours-and-restart-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 3: 
<br />
<br />Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:
<br />
<br />Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.
<br />
<br />Option 4: - Please be advised, you are blocking Windows Updates when you choose this option. This can potentially weaken your system and make it vulnerable to attacks. Use with precaution.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to DIsabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Option 5:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver 
<br />
<br />
<br />Option 6: I am not saying you should upgrade, this is only a suggestion. 
<br />
<br />Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro which can pause updates for up to 35 days or block them for a year.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/defer-block-uninstall-windows-10-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/defer-block-un...</a>
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation
<br />Click the link ‘Go to the store to upgrade or enter a product key’
<br />Click the $99 button to make your purchase (the price might vary by region or depending on the edition you are upgrading from or upgrading to).
<br />Follow the on screen instructions to make your purchase.
<br />Within 5 to 10 minutes, your system will be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro, your personal files, apps and settings preserved. 
<br />You won’t get a product key, you get a digital license, which is attached to your Microsoft Account used to make the purchase. 
<br />
<br />Additional options you can consider
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />sc stop wuauserv
<br />sc config wuauserv start= disabled
<br />
<br />
<br />2. changing the group policy to "Notify for download and auto install"  (Only available in Windows 10 Pro and higher)
<br />
<br />3. Open Start, type: regedit
<br />Right click regedit
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />Add the WindowsUpdate/AU options keys to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows

            Hi Phil, you need to delete the Windows Update process altogether:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type services and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to find Windows Update Service
<br />
<br />If it is Started, double click it and stop that service
<br />
<br />CLose the services App
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />sc delete wuauserv
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Restart your PC
<br />
<br />
<br />If you also have the Update Assistant installed on your system:
<br />
<br />The Update Assistant in Windows 10 cannot be uninstalled, but you can get rid of it 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Task Scheduler and hit enter 
<br />In the left Pane, navigate to: Windows - Update Orchestrater 
<br />Right Pane double click 'Update Assistant' 
<br />Click on Triggers Tab 
<br />On each of the triggers ( At login . . . etc.) double click and uncheck 'Enabled' 
<br />
<br />Under 'Update Assistant, there is another event 'Update Assistant CalendarRun' 
<br />Do the same for all triggers on that event 
<br />
<br />Restart your system, that's It!
<br />
<br />When finished and after a system restart, open the services app and make sure the Windows Update Service is now gone . . .

<h2>            on Windows 10, how do I disable the touchpad long term&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I prefer not to use the touchpad, especially when typing a document. I have an external mouse that I attach via the usb port.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frequently, I end up with both the mouse and the touch pad controlling the cursor. This causes problems. I set the controls so that the touchpad is supposed to be disabled when an external pointing device is plugged in. This setting works until I reboot
 the computer. Then I am back to having problems with the touchpad being active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I disable the touchpad on a long term basis? I do not want to have to reset the controls each time I turn on my computer.</p>

            Hi Congernm,
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the 'Human Interface Devices' section
<br />Right click HID-Compliant Touch Screen and choose Disable
<br />(do not uninstall as Windows will automatically install it again)
<br />Do this for any HID-Compliant touch screen or pen devices you find there
<br />
<br />That's It!

<p>Under Human Interface Selection, I found no touchpad item, but I found one for pointing devices.</p>
<p>Under pointing devices there are entries for my external mouse and the touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately under touch pad, I was not allowed to disable the touchpad. The button for disabling the touch pad was a light gray shade and would not respond.<br />
</p>
<p>I am still left with no way to disable a default touchpad.</p>

<p>Sorry, I have done both of these via other means. Thanks for the try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your option 1 puts me onto the control page where I click the box that disables the touchpad when other pointing devices are in use. This temporarily disables the touch pad, but the next time I start the computer, the touchpad is in full use and conflicting
 with commands from my external mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your option 2 is what was suggested by the previous respondent. It works well until I get to the point where I want to disable the touchpad. then the disable box is not available. (It is pale indicating that it is not active.)</p>

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />Some laptops are able to disable the touchpad permanently using a function key command.

<br />On my laptop it is Fn key + F7
<br />Yours might be different, look for a block symbol over a function key icon.

<p>HP &nbsp; model: 15:ac061ar</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased it with Windows 8 I had no problem opening the control panel and clicking a box that said the touch pad was to be disabled when an external pointing device was plugged into the USB port. The touchpad remained disabled as specified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then Windows forced me to accept an upgrade to Windows 10. Then the little box required more work to find. For a while, the touchpad remained disabled until I would receive an update. On each update I had to reset his setting. On some updates, the control
 panel was revised requiring me to search for the command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently no one at Microsoft thinks it is important to be able to disable the touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am back to the point where I have to reset the controls daily. It is irritating.&nbsp;</p>

            Congernm I totally agree with you . . .
<br />
<br />A lot of HP laptops have a Synaptics touchpad, and generally if you double tap the top left of the touchpad, this turns off the touchpad . . .

<p>Dear Mohammed Yaseer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your email together with 3 methods for me to try to 'turn-on' my 'touchscreen'.</p>
<p>You ask me first for my computer details and they are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Name of Computer - HP ENVY TS 15 Notebook</p>
<p>Serial Number: - SCG3480GOY</p>
<p>Product No: - E6B23EA#ABU</p>
<p>It has an Intel i7 Processor</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a qualified IT 'person' - I use my computer to digitize my own paintings and then sew the resulting pictures on my sewing machine.&nbsp; I also make cards and calendars for charity now that I am retired from teaching.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp;two computers - this touchscreen together with an HP Pavilion Tower and at the moment I shall not be touching the tower.&nbsp; I have had terrible trouble with my 'emails' on my Notebook and, with help from Microsoft, I have had to change my Email account
 to another provider so losing all my saved Emails and addresses.&nbsp; This 'Email' problem on my Notebook has&nbsp;even effected my tower computer as I was using the same Email 'address' and 'server'. and so both computers have lost a lot&nbsp;of valuable emails and addresses.&nbsp;
 This 'Touchscreen' problem only happened after I had downloaded the next 'Update' on 7th August 2015.&nbsp; When I first downloaded Windows 10 it was working OK!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting back to my present problem.&nbsp; I had no problem 'updating' to Windows 10 and I certainly like it but I cannot simply&nbsp;use the 'touchscreen'.&nbsp; I have applied your 3 methods but without success.&nbsp; Looking at my Notebook name's page I see that under the
 'Pen and Touch' heading this message appears - 'No pen or touch input is available for this display'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for all the help you have suggested so far but is there anything else I could try?&nbsp; The 'first update' went on so smoothly and so&nbsp;did the other updates that have been downloaded but I am lost at what I can do next!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanking you in advance - Mrs. Wendy Hull.</p>

            <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a similar problem. Thankfully, I was able to find the solution. It is a specific driver. If you are having the same problems please follow these steps:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1) Go to Device Manager (Windows Key+X, select it)&nbsp;<br />
2) Under the "Mice and other pointing devices" list find "USB Touchscreen controller", or the driver that's not your mouse/touchpad.&nbsp;<br />
3) Right click to select "Properties", click the "Driver" tab, and click "Roll back".&nbsp;<br />
4) After confirming, this will remove the driver from that list but bring up a bunch of new ones under "Human Interface Devices", where the touchscreen stuff logically should live.&nbsp;<br />
5) Make sure that all the other drivers are updated EXCEPT "USB input device". This is the one that moves it all to the mouse drivers.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>After a restart the driver didn't automatically reinstall like they usually do. If it does, run the "Show or hide updates troubleshooter"&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">found here.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to think this is an issue from eGalax Touch, which is responsible for the driver, but if you do a search for "egalax touch acts like mouse" this is an issue dating back to Windows 7. Either a) Microsoft should stop doing business with
 them, b) Microsoft should provide a fix for how the driver interacts with the OS, or c) let the consumer know that there is an issue and how to fix it. Because it's the SAME ISSUE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>JDRC&nbsp;</p>

    <title>SKYPE account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonybraithwaite  say:</h3>
<h2>            SKYPE account</h2>
                    I had an old Skype account that was used very regularly. Along came the new version and everything has gone haywire - it is terrible.&nbsp;I was asked for extra security to enter a personal alias - another email address, so I did but made an error on the address
 so now the verification codes&nbsp;to enter my old account go to a non existent email! They say that you can amend this alias email&nbsp;twice a week and I have been trying for 4 days and each time with no success. In desperation to get back on Skype I have had to create
 a new&nbsp;Skype account which now works. However I had a UK to US phone call subscription on my old Skype account which I would like to either transfer to my new account or cancel from my old account. Has anyone any ideas on how to do&nbsp;that please? After a lot
 of searching I found a call number for MS Support but it is just a recorded options menu and all selections just refer you back to the website. I have&nbsp;also tried the Virtual Agent which is useles

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply however as I stated in my original question I cannot access my old account with the Skype user name txxxxxx1 as the personal alias requested of me is not a valid email. I am doing as you suggest and using Chrome rather than IE and as
 you can see have been able to get back to my question and your reply!</p>
<p>I have created a new Skype account now but as I said I have a call subscription set up on my old account txxxxxxx1 which I want to make sure does not take anymore money from me as I cannot use it - because I cannot access my old account.</p>
<p>I also wish to close my old account txxxxxx1 and cannot do that as I keep being asked to Verify using the code that would have been sent to the incorrect personal alias email account.</p>
<p>I also cannot change that personal alias and have tried everyday day since last Wednesday although your Help suggest that can be changed twice a week.</p>
<p>If I give you my confirmation (written in blood if you need that as well) can you PLEASE either get me into my old account so I can do what I need to do or you cancel the account and the phone subscription on my behalf. I will even
 forget about the outstanding credit I have on my UK to US phone call subscription.</p>
<p>It is the most frustrating experience I have ever had with anything to do with technology.</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP!</p>
<p>My regards</p>

<p>Hello Tony, </p>

</p><p>Thank you for the clarification. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To recover a Skype account which you cannot anymore access, please proceed with

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please understand that the recovery of accounts can only be done <strong>from the Skype account&nbsp;owner's end</strong>. You can fill out the Account recovery form as many times as you wish (3x per day). You just need to
<em>provide the correct information</em>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still unable to retrieve the account, we suggest for you to <strong>
contact your financial institution or bank</strong> to have the <strong>payment method associated with your account cancelled</strong>. This will prevent further charges.

<div>Simple question - when I view a list of photos it is in slide show mode. Where do I turn this off as I wish to manually click to show the next photo. Can't seem to find any documented help.</div>

<div>Regards, </div>

            <p>Hi William,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you trying to set Windows Media Player so that it doesn't automatically switch to the next photo when viewing it? Because if so, then I think maybe using a different program to view the photos in is the best solution. Ideally, it would best to view your
 photos via the Microsoft app 'Photos'. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note, as far as I'm aware, you can't actually view the photos in full screen on this app unless you select 'slideshow' in which case, it will automatically switch to the next photo. If full screen without slideshow is what you are trying to achieve,
 then I recommend an entirely different app from the app store. &nbsp;I can happily recommend you some if you would like me to.</p>

<h2>            Looping stop code.... Cant boot Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Since yesterday I have not been able to boot windows and login to my laptop. &nbsp;I cannot access my desktop, and cant even reach my windows login page. &nbsp; I get a looping stop code: &nbsp;OxcOOOO21a</p>
<p>The system tries to automatically repair, but to no avail. &nbsp;I have restarted many times, tried different options, and have also tried to Reset the PC (stops around 30% and fails)... &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I have followed some advice on the web, and know this much from using the Command Prompt:<br />
</p>
<p>SrtTrail - Notepad:&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>A patch is preventing the system from starting.</p>
<p>Repair action: System files integrity check and repair</p>
<p>Result: Failed. Error code = 0x570</p>
<p>Time taken = 152094 ms<br />
--------------------------------------</p>
<p>--------------------------------------</p>
<p>Session details</p>
<p>--------------------------------------</p>
<p>System Disk = Device \Harddisk0<br />
Windows directory = E: \WINDOWS<br />
AutoChk Run = 0<br />
Number of root causes = 1&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I am far from being IT savvy, and stuck from here..... &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference; I cannot recall downloading/updating anything recently, *but I have had Windows account Date/Time setting issues since I upgraded to 10 for free. &nbsp;(I have not been able to automatically set time to my location, and have been manually updating
 every few weeks). &nbsp;Other points to mention are:</p>
<p>- I have no restore point</p>
<p>- No System Image to date back to</p>
<p>- Start up repair doesnt work</p>
<p>- Cannot boot in Safe Mode (get the same stop code)</p>
<p>- tried HP start up test (nothing seems to be wrong)<br />
</p>
<p>Would anyone know how to fix this issue? &nbsp; Any assistance would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi I agree with @Vanessa! If you can not perform a reset/refresh from the Advanced Startup mode, the next option you have is create a media creation tool. Let us know how things go!</p>

<h2>            Middle mouse button induces sleep in pc.</h2>
                    <p>Just finished installing windows 10 on this lenovo x220 laptop and the middle mouse button above the touch pad that is used for scrolling immediately puts my computer to sleep whenever I press it. I am working at a school and have installed windows on about
 12 of these laptops and this is the first time this issue has occurred and I can not find any related info online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can wake the computer up almost immediately afterwards but this forces me to have to manually use scrollbars on the windows that I use to navigate and I know that as soon as a student uses this laptop I will get a panicked call from a teacher in the middle
 of my workday and I don't really have time for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already run as many updates as I can and have reinstalled all my touchpad, bios, and firmware drivers several times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Buying a new laptop is also not an option the budget can't handle that.</p>

<p>A few more details would not go amiss such as upgrade from what to which version of Windows 7?&nbsp; Laptop or desktop?</p>
<p>However, my initial recommendation would be to boot to safe mode by pressing F8 on startup to see if the problem still occurs in safe mode.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><span><span>Adding to itfidds's suggestion, if the issue does not occur in safe mode, then perform clean boot to check if a third party application
 or service is causing the problem. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer this KB article for more information about clean boot.<br />
</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing
 a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong></span></a><span><strong><span><br />
</span></strong></span><span><span><br />
Steps to perform a clean boot:<br />
a. Click the start orb on your desktop<br />
b. Type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
c. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
d. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box. <br />
e. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
f. Click OK. <br />
g. When you are prompted, click Restart. </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong></span><span><span>:

<h2>            How do I return my Xbox One&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I bought an Xbox One after being a satisfied Xbox and Xbox 360 user. I had a launch day Xbox 360, but had to wait a few months for the One this time around due to finances. I bought the Xbox One about 24 days ago. There is only a 14 day return policy. Am
 I stuck with it?<br />
<br />
It is horrible. The Kinect barely recognizes anybody or recognizes the wrong people. We have good lighting.<br />
The apps multple times do not work. I click on buttons and the buttons do nothing. I have to reset the Xbox multple times.<br />
Xbox has built a beautiful interface with the Xbox 360. Great functionality and easy to use. I have no idea what they did with Xbox One. I mean, In click on friends, what is this feed thing? What are we going back to the days of RSS? Where are the cool avatars
 showing me their statuses and what they are doing?<br />
Messages, why are there only text? Why can't I send audio and/or video? I can do it on Xbox 360... Why are we going backwards with functionality when in reality we should be going forward. Ok, maybe its because MS wants us to use Skype? Well I'm not giving
 weirdos from Xbox Live my email address. Bake the service in as the message delivery service if that is how you want video and pic and voice messages sent.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Xbox One, I think you are losing me. I, for the first time since the original Playstation, think I may go get a PS4. I feel like this $500 console is a beta product. BTW, I'm a tech geek and love beta products, I even own me a pair of Google Glass. This product
 however was sold to me as a final product and it is not. The Xbox 360 has more apps and functionality than the Xbox One right now. Yes, Kinect may be more advanced, but I'm looking at this as far as the interface and usability goes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sorry Xbox.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
How do I return this? I feel like I have wasted $500 and am very disappointed.</p>

<p>In exactly 2 months since my first, I am now on my 4th XB1 after some awful advanced exchange experiences, however I think you are slightly overreacting here.</p>
<p>A GUI update is coming in a couple of weeks which addresses functionality improvements to things like the friends section, recent players, party chat etc. In time, features will be added, ***, until a week ago we couldn't even see a controller battery indicator.
 This is still basically a 'beta' product and that's what you accept buying a new console at launch. The XB1 has a lot of room to grow, but it needs time.</p>
<p>It's no rosier with a PS4, you can't even stream your music and videos from your PC to it at the moment, which is something the PS3 did so well, at least you can do that with an XB1. The XB1 is silent, you can't hear a peep out of it unless you put your
 ear on it, tell that to a PS4. Each has apps the other doesn't at this time, but eventually they'll both have them. As of right now, &nbsp;most people would argue the XB1 has the far superior game lineup and will have this advantage all year.</p>
<p>I have also spent a lot of time wondering if I made a mistake buying the XB1, especially through this bizarre ordeal I have experienced with Microsoft shipping me refurbished (And still faulty!!!) advanced exchange replacement consoles, but at the end of
 the day I loved my 360 and never even thought of getting a PS4, ALL of my friends had 360's and have switched to XB1's or intend to this year, I prefer the feel of the controller and I prefer the exclusive games. Sure, there are drawbacks right now, the missing
 features, the lower game resolutions, the missing apps (I NEED NBA Gametime!!!)</p>
<p>But the updates are coming and so are the better games! Just think what your 360 could do in 2013 compared to 2006, it will get better, a lot better.</p>

    <title>I am constantly having to reset network adapter, no matter what router - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeeba83  say:</h3>
<h2>            I am constantly having to reset network adapter, no matter what router is being used, or Vista notebook, for that matter.</h2>
                    Okay, First let me state that I am not a very big fan of Windows, as far as reliability and well, just reliability.&nbsp; The best thing Windows has going for it is that in a time of financial strain, one can go out and purchase a Windows based computer for
 well, nowaday, $200.&nbsp; But that is besides the point, because I own a Windows run computer.&nbsp; For every day needs, it does the job, and I got a really good deal on it.&nbsp; I have had this computer (Gateway M6755) for two years.&nbsp; I have always had this problem,
 but it is seeming to get worse and worse as the days go by.&nbsp; It has gotten to the point that i have the Device Manager as a shortcut on the desktop and the QuickLaunch bar.&nbsp; I really have loved everything about this notebook (except that it runs Windows and
 wasn't built by Apple.) Its quick, I have yet to fill half of the available hardrive, its equipped with wireless N, and its lightweight and has a decent sized, bright LCD screen.&nbsp; What more could you want?&nbsp; Oh, I guess a computer that does what it is supposed
 to do and stay connected to the internet.&nbsp; Even more frustrating is the fact that I have not only had this problem on this computer, but also an HP from my past, that was running Vista.&nbsp; Also, a similar problem seems to show up in forums all over the internet,
 but none seem to be exactly my issue.&nbsp; These all suggest waiting for all of the components to "power on."&nbsp; Okay I'm sure you are confused at this point....let me begin =P<br />
<br />
As noted, I've had this notebook for 2 years.&nbsp; It has always randomly lost connection to the wireless network, no matter if I am using it or not.&nbsp; I have used this on Several different networks, all with the same issue.&nbsp; I figured at first that something happened
 to interrupt the connection, but the computer would never reconnect on its own, as it should as soon as it finds the connection again.&nbsp; So i would go double-click on the network status indicator, and it would say "you are not connected to any networks" and
 "wireless networks are available."&nbsp; So I would go to the Network Connection Center and try to connect to the network, (Always Good to Excellent Signal strength [I can even be sitting RIGHT NEXT to the router]) and *grr* all I get is: "Windows cannot connect
 to SoAndSo.&nbsp; Diagnose problem?" Of course, if it claims it can diagnose, it ought to be able to fix it as well, right.&nbsp; Nope, instead it says for me to "Resolve low signal" or "Connect to another available network."&nbsp; Well, for s**ts and giggles, I will attempt
 to connect to any other available networks that might be around me....But Windows can't connect to those either.........so what's the deal?<br />
<br />
The work around is to go to Device Manager, manually disable, and then re-enable the Wireless Adapter.&nbsp; After that, things are good, for a little while....sometimes.&nbsp; Or sometimes its only 10 minutes or so before I have to do it again.&nbsp; It is definately NOT
 the router....we have other Wireless items that connect to it just fine...aside from random interruptions...which is natural.&nbsp; Anyway, the wireless adapter I have is a Marvell TopDog PCI Express 802.11n EC85. But this happened on the previous HP laptop as
 well, which I don't think had this same wireless adapter, but I am not sure... I have also searched for the most up-to-date driver, which is the one the factory installed at birth, therefore, I cannot "roll-back" the driver to see if that might be the issue.&nbsp;
 I feel to be a somewhat tech-savvy person, and given enough time to do research and toy around, I can usually get things running again.&nbsp; But for two years I have not successfully found a fix to this issue.&nbsp; I have dealt with it and dismissed it, and researched
 it, and I am about to throw this thousand dollar box at a wall.&nbsp; Like I said, the Device Manager is a shortcut on my desktop and QuickLaunch.<br />
<br />
Is the only solution (and it may not be a GREAT solution) to upgrade to Windows 7? Thats a somewhat rediculous suggestion, considering i cant see much difference in Windows Vista and Windows 7, excepts its a bit snappier and they moved things around on me again.&nbsp;
 But as for Vista, it runs pretty well on my laptop, except the Normal Plague of Windows bugs...<br />
<br />
I am at wits end.&nbsp; Can anyone help me???

<h2>            Install Windows 7 dual boot on Windows 10 laptop with GPT partition</h2>
                    <p>Dear Windows 10 Experts,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was forced to do a clean install of Windows 10 on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like Windows 10 but it will not completely shut down my laptop, even though I have tried everything I can find on the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I have some 7 stuff that I must run in Windows 7, especially since Windows 10 does not support Easy Transfer. So I want to keep Windows 10 and install a Windows 7 dual boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created an empty partition and formatted it. But when I try to install Windows 7, I get the error message that it cannot be installed on the partition because it is of GPT style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do NOT want to lose my Windows 10 installation/partition. How can I easily install Windows 7 from my installation DVD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank &nbsp;you very much!</p>
