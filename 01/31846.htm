            <p>Troubleshooting kernel-power event id 41 can be one of the most frustrating issues to troubleshoot because there isn't a universal cause for it. A lot of people experience this problem for so many different reasons; think of it as a doctor treating a disease
 but every patient exhibits different symptoms and no two patients have the same virus (metaphorically speaking).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's either going to be a software/driver issue or a hardware issue.&nbsp;A lot of people speculate that if the Stop Error BugcheckCode and the PowerButtonTimestamp both have an integer value of "0" then it's hardware related, but this is only supposition and
 not definitive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a lot you can do to troubleshoot this error, and believe me when I say a lot, but before I get into any of that let's try two simple steps. Working on computers is a lot like applying the scientific method and the first step is analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[1] Look for devices in conflict - Go into device manager and browse the different stacks looking for multiple devices which may be installed in the same location and be in conflict*.
</p>
<p>A lot of Radeon users, such as myself, will have two audio drivers; one will be an AMD audio driver which comes with the catalyst driver package and the other will be the realtek which is usually the driver for the motherboard onboard audio device. For some
 reason the AMD audio driver will install itself onto the same high definition audio bus the realtek driver is using. If you look into device manager and you do happen to have multiple audio devices listed then disable the one not being used by the system.
 If you can't tell which one the system uses right click the speaker icon in the taskbar and open volume mixer. Up at the top you will see "Volume Mixer - Speakers (specified audio device)". The device specified in parenthese is the one being used by the system
 for sound so disable any other audio driver in device manager that is not the one listed in the volume mixer. A lot of people have fixed their kernel-power reboots by disabling any audio device that is not the one being used by the system.
</p>
<p>*If you have a mutlticore processor and see multiple instances of your processor listed in the processor stack&nbsp;in device manager this is fine. For every core your processor has windows generates a virtual core; a quad core processor will have four instances
 of the processor&nbsp;listed in device manager. This is normal and not a device in conflict.</p>
<p>If you have a device in conflict disable it and reboot. If disabling the device in conflict doesn't resolve the issue of if you don't have any devices in conflict then proceed to step 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[2] Investigate other system event errors&nbsp;in event viewer - Whenever a kernel-power event id 41 is logged into event viewer usually an EventLog Event ID 6008 is generated as well. Look for the 6008 and it will state "the previous system shutdown at &lt;specified
 time&gt; on &lt;specified date&gt; was unexpected". Make note of the listed time in the 6008. This is the time that the kernel-power error caused the spontaneous reboot. Now look in event viewer and investigate errors by applications or windows services just prior
 to the time listed by the 6008. As an example if the EventLog Event ID 6008 lists the reboot at 3:35:42 PM then you want to investigate any system event which is an application or windows service error that is logged just prior to 3:35:42. So continuing the
 previous example if you see an application or service error logged at 3:31:57 this is a clue. Now scroll down the list looking up other kernel-power event id 41 errors and see if you see the same application or service error&nbsp;logged just prior to the event
 id 41. If looking&nbsp;down the list of events you see the same&nbsp;application or service&nbsp;event error you previously found&nbsp;logged just prior to every kernel-power&nbsp;event id&nbsp;41 in event viewer&nbsp;then it's a pretty good chance this is the application or windows service
 forcing the reboots. If it's an application try uninstalling it and see if the problem persists. If it doesn't then you have found the culprit. If it's a windows service research the event id on the net and see if you can find steps to troubleshoot or manually
 force the service to restart itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If after doing all this your reboots persist then something else is wrong. Post back and we can continue troubleshooting some more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck everyone.</p>

<p>hey,&nbsp;</p>
<p>this problem persists usually when 2 drivers for one harware, ur case it may be if u have a ATI or nvidia graphics installed, wen the drivers are installed for these cards, they usually install the HD audio drivers too, which are meant to use the same bus
 as your Realtek hd audio, disable or install one of them and try again,</p>
<p>lemme noe if it works!</p>

            <p>Normally, I can usually figure out causes to issues like this. I really believed it had to do with Windows 7 but was able to recreate the same issue after installing XP.</p>
<p>My machine would just randomly reboot itself when I was right in the middle of normal tasks, such as surfing the internet. Sometimes right before it'd reboot and while it was booting up, I'd have multi-colored scrambled code show up on my screen while it
 was booting up so I'd have to shut it down and restart it manually. Event Viewer would state: Critical error, Kernel-Power, event Id: 41.</p>
<p>I thought about the possible causes over the course of a few months or so and couldn't figure out the cause, even after reinstalling Windows going from 7 to XP and replacing the thermal paste on my CPU. As far as I could tell, my machine didn't have any
 overheating issues. Because of this, I thought it might be something wrong with my motherboard.</p>
<p>It really seemed like an overheating issue to me, so I took off my heatsink again to make another attempt at replacing the thermal paste. My heatsink covers my video chip with a thermal pad in between. I replaced the thermal pad with Arctic Silver 5 thermal
 paste and it resolved the issue completely. I haven't had another random reboot since and it's been about a month now and the random reboots used to happen multiple times every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It appears my video chip was overheating using the thermal pad installed by the manufacturer.</p>

<br />
To check whether this scenario is occurring, press the CAPS LOCK key on the keyboard. When you do this, if the CAPS LOCK light on the keyboard does not change when you press the CAPS LOCK key, the computer may be completely unresponsive (hard hang).
<br />
<br />
This scenario usually indicates a problem with the hardware. Another possibility is that a driver may cause this problem. To help isolate the problem, check the following items:
<ol>
<li><b>Overclocking</b>: Disable overclocking and see whether the issue happens when the system is run at the correct speed.</li><li><b>Check the memory</b>: Verify the memory by using a memory checker. Verify that each memory chip is the same speed and that it is configured correctly in the system.</li><li><b>Power Supply</b>: Make sure that the power supply has enough wattage to appropriately handle the installed devices. If you added memory, installed a newer processor, installed additional drives, or added external devices, such devices may require more
 energy than the current power supply can provide consistently.</li><li><b>Overheating</b>: Check whether the system is overheating by examining the internal temperature of the hardware.</li><li><b>Defaults</b>: Use system defaults, and run the system. <br />
</li></ol>
<br />
If you see that the computer generates a Stop error that contains a BugcheckCode value that is not reported in an event ID 41, modify the restart behavior for the computer. To do this, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Right-click <strong>My Computer</strong>, and then click <strong>
Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Advanced system settings</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab. </li><li>In the <strong>Startup and Recovery </strong>section, click <strong>
Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click to clear the <strong>Automatically restart </strong>check box.<br />
</li></ol>

<h2>            black ops 2 achievements problems</h2>
                    
<p>hello microsoft i just got off the phone with one of your workers answering call they told me to write a forum ok so what happened i was playing search on destroy on black ops 2 i exited one game and i joined another lobby and it all seemed normal until
 i started getting almost all the achievements &nbsp;for the game out of nowhere i know i wasn't the only one people where saying they where getting it too so i left the lobby then i joined another lobby it was nuketown 2025 and the same thing happened but this
 time it gave me 6 achievements but everyone else in the lobby was getting them pretty weird 2 lobbies in a row i did not join no one in specific it was a regular game lobby idk what happened but i do know someone was hacking because when people where saying
 in getting all the achievements on guy comments "yea he is giving the away for FREE" all i want is to not get banned or reset for joining a hacked game lobby while i was just trying to play a search and destroy game it was not a private or custom game lobby
 it was a regular lobby so if you want you can take the gamerscore that was hacked on to me TODAY don't reset my gaerscore i worked hard for it i just wanted to let you know i did not intentionally join that lobby if you want you can see video and check my
 gameplay and what i did i just wanted to let you guys know in going to contact treyarch bout this thanks im just letting you know i got achivements without meaning to and to let you know there are hackers giving people free achievements &nbsp;</p>

<p>While I understand that it is not intentional and I understand your frustrations, the only thing you can do about the hackers is to file a complaint against them.</p>
<p>To file a complaint:</p>
<p>1. Go to the person's profile</p>
<p>2. Select File Complaint</p>
<p>3. Select File Complaint again</p>
<p>4. Select the general reason for filing the complaint</p>
<p>5. Select the specific reason for filing the complaint</p>
<p>6. Select File Complaint or Don't file if you don't want to file a complaint</p>
<p>The above is the only way for the enforcement team to take action against the hackers. About your Gamerscore, Gamerscore resets are handed down only if you meet specific criteria and they cannot be reversed by anyone. A Gamerscore reset will take away all
 of your Gamerscore earned so far and will label your gamertag as a cheater. I enjoy BO2 and I hope you can get back to the action as soon as possible.:)</p>

</p><p>You could be right with your discovery. Some antivirus programs may prevent the Skype application from working properly. Disabling it may allow Skype to function as it should.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if the issue persists after disabling the said program. </p>

<p>3. Select <strong>Manage how you sign in to Microsoft.</strong></p>
<p>4. You may be prompted to enter a code we send to the email address, or phone number listed in your account as security information. This lets us know the request is coming from you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. If you want to create a new email address to use, select <strong>Create a new email address</strong> and add it as an alias, and then follow the instructions.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. If you have a non-Microsoft email address (such as an @gmail.com or @yahoo.com email address) that you want to use, select
<strong>Add an existing email address as a Microsoft account alias</strong>, and then click
<strong>Add alias</strong>.<br />
7. If you selected <strong>Add phone number,</strong> follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Select your country from the list.<br />

<h2>            Unable to play&#47;sign into Minecraft on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to play Minecraft yesterday and it says that I have a trial version.&nbsp; I assume this is because I am not properly signed in.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have owned the full game for several years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a "Sign in" button on the main screen but it does not allow me to sign in, instead it takes me to the store to purchase an upgraded version of the game.&nbsp; &nbsp;The "Sign In to Xbox Live for Free!" button within settings also takes me to the same spot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Restarting my computer</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Logging in and out of the Windows Store</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Uninstalling and Reinstalling the Game</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cleared Account Sign in Data</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Crik.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try Resetting the game in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Minecraft &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then did you reinstall it from the Store Settings &gt; Your Library or from the Store search?  Use Your Library to get the license too.  Also in the Settings try Update Game.
<br />
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to repair the store:
<br /> 
<br />See if the fixes here help:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows/3-quick-fixes-for-your-windows-store-problems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br /> 
<br />If that fails then reinstall Store.  Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</code>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />If these all fail then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Issue with sound on Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gtorg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with sound on Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have had trouble with sound for a couple of weeks. there is an icon on the taskbar that is a speaker with a red "x" next to it.&nbsp; When I hover over it it says "the audio service is not running".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried everything, updating the driver, uninstalling the driver and reinstalling it, checking all connections, running the troubleshooter, etc.&nbsp; The troubleshooter shows that one or more audio service isn't running.&nbsp; When I run the "services.msc" function
 and check the Windows Audio Endpoint builder it shows that it is started and the startup type is automatic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows Audio does not show started, but when I click on it to start, I get an Error 1068 and says it can't start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            Hi!<br />
<br />
Please check if all dependend Services are running and started:<br />
<br />
<br />
Right click on the "Windows Audio" service and choose "Properties"<br />
<br />
You'll see 4 tabs, click on the last one, labeled "Dependencies"<br />
<br />
In that tab, you will see the "This service depends on the following system components" box, it displays 3 services<br />
<br />
Next to each service there is a "+" icon, click on it to expand the list. The 2nd service has 2 dependend services, the 3rd service has 1 dependend service.<br />
<br />
Now please make sure that all those 6 services (3 main, 3 dependend) have the "Started" status in the "Services" window you opened earlier<br />
<br />
After all are started,&nbsp; try again to start the "Window Audio" service from the "General" tab.<br />
<br />
Hope that's helpful.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Julia<br />

            <p>Thanks Julia,</p>
<p>I did as you suggested and found that all of the dependencies were "Started" except for the MMCSS.&nbsp; It had the following under Description:&nbsp; &lt;Failed to Read Description.&nbsp; Error Code: 2&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I try to start it then it gives the Error 126:&nbsp; The Specified Module could not be found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this something with the registry being messed up?&nbsp; I have never opened it or attempted to change things, but I have had a few BSOD in the last few months.&nbsp; They are not fully resolved either, but seem to be happening less often.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have enclosed a screenshot of the above description.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Please type mmcss.dll in Start searchfield. It should pop up under Programs. Right-click it, choose Open File Location. It should be in C:\Windows\System32 (supposing yr Windows is sitting on drive C).<br />
<br />
Please make a System File Check: <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1538-sfc-scannow-command-system-file-checker.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>When I searched mmcss.dll in the computer, it was not found.&nbsp; I copied it from another computer running Windows 7 and pasted it into the System 32 folder on the bad computer.&nbsp; It worked!!&nbsp; I had to start it (MMCSS) in the services.msc window, but this time
 it started and when I clicked on the speaker icon on the taskbar, it let me start the Audio Service.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm now listening to music from that computer again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After many frustrating hours of trying different things, this fixed it.&nbsp; Thanks for the idea!</p>

===============================================<br />
Playing a DVD requires a DVD Decoder and the only versions<br />
of Vista that have one included are Home Premium and Ultimate.<br />
<br />
Have a look at the following article:<br />
<br />
Why do I receive "Windows Media Player cannot play this DVD <br />
because a problem occurred with digital copyright protection" (C00D1163)?<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/knowledgecenter/mediaadvice/0094.mspx#E3B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/knowledgecenter/mediaadvice/0094.mspx#E3B</a><br />
<br />
There are DVD Decoders available at the following link:<br />

<br />
FWIW...before installing software it is always best to create a System Restore point.<br />
<br />
And...you may be able to play your DVDs with the free&nbsp;VLC Media Player:<br />
<br />
VLC Media Player<br />

<br />
One last option would be to install a Codec Pack:<br />

<p>Since yesterday my Xbox one has been trying to do a system update. It says there is 378MB to download. It appears to get stuck at 20% (302MB to go)</p>
<p>It sits there for a while, then jumps to about 67%, appears to download a few more MB then stops with the following error:</p>
<p>There was a problem with the update</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried a wired connection to my hub and also doing a hard shutdown with no success.</p>

<p>Hi Kev,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear the recent system update is getting stuck on your console. I'd be happy to provide some information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This step by step guide should walk you through what the next steps would be based on the error codes and issue you are experiencing:

<p>
</p><p>You may need to factory reset the Xbox or eventually try an offline system update, but just follow the guide and it should lead you to the right solution.</p>

<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried this but I end being pointed to the error search page as mine is not listed</p>
<p>When i enter 80070079 the only 2 options are&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) checking status of xbox live (and it seems to be fine)</p>
<p>2) checking my network settings. but i cant check these offline and as soon as i go online it restarts the update process so i cant check the settings or packet loss etc</p>
<p>These are the only 2 options listed.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi AshavanX,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post! If the troubleshooting so far has not changed the issue with the console, try updating the console from another internet connection. Even if the network statistics check out as normal, firewalls can still block necessary protocols for
 updating the console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how this goes, thanks again.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10- Windows Update fails repeatedly ERROR OXC1900209  due to Infineon TPM Professional Package</h2>
                    <p>I am being told to uninstall TPM when it cannot be found in any normal place. Also, this was installed native to Windows 7 or 10, right?? Why hasn't MS just included a FIX link for this or modified the update?? I still have build 1703. This has been going
 on since Oct. Not enough time?</p>
<p>

<p>Using Agent Rucksack, I found that most files referring to Infineon TPM are in one of two folders, C:/SWSETUP and C:/$WINDOWS.~BT. I renamed them both by adding a $ to the folder names and the update installed!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process of getting rid of this Infineon software is still not handled by Microsoft. I talked to Infineon and they say that they only provided the micro-chip and not the software. Sounds like B.S. but it is what it is. Can I removed the $ signs now? Thanks,</p>

<span>Hi Conan_Kudo,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft answers.
</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest that you optimize the Internet Explorer settings on the computer and check if you are able to watch the videos
 without any issues:</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link for more information:
<strong><span>How to optimize Internet Explorer: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213</a>.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, then I recommend that you reset the internet explorer settings on the computer,
 you may download the Microsoft fix-it from the link which automatically resets the browser settings to default settings on the computer:</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link for more information:
<strong>How to reset Internet Explorer settings:</strong></span><strong><span>
</span></strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, then this might be an issue with the adobe flash player that is installed on the computer,
 I recommend that you install the latest version of Adobe Flash Player on the computer and check:</span></p>

            Hi Peter
<br />
<br />If you are having difficulty creating bootable installation media for Windows 10, this is a reliable and safe method to create Windows 10 Bootable Media
<br />
<br />you mention Croatian Windows, is your licence key for Windows 10 Home, or Home Single Language?
<br />
<br />If that is for the Single Language version, you should download the 1703 ISO, otherwise go for the 1809 ISO
<br />
<br />Click this link to download the Windows 10 ISO
<br />
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />Click this link to download a tool from Microsoft which you can use to create the bootable installation media from that ISO - tool works for Windows 7, 8 and 10
<br />

            Hi Petar
<br />
<br />Most modern systems do not have an optical drive . . .
<br />
<br />The tool I linked to at the bottom of my post will create installation media on a USB flash drive from the ISO - while that tool is named as Windows 7, it works perfectly well for Windows 10

<p>There is another way.</p>
<p>When you download the ISO, open it in File Explorer and double click on Setup.</p>
<p>See if this works.</p>

            There is a process that uses Rufus that you might look into also.&nbsp; It makes a bootable USB.<br />

<h2>            Shortcut keys are not working on Sony Vaio VPCEH26EN after installing Windows 7 Ultimate &#63;</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my Sony Vaio VPCEH26EN laptop which was running on genuine Windows 7 Home Basic to genuine Windows 7 Ultimate. I have downloaded almost all drivers required for its functioning from official sony vaio website. All the functions are
 running properly except for the function keys(i.e, Fn + F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,F6 and F7). Please suggest a solution or atleast tell me about any driver remaining to be downloaded so that I can install it.<br />
<br />
Thank You !!<br />
