            <p>Hello Andrew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked the accounts that you've provided but, did not find any Family settings within the Microsoft accounts. We would like to verify how you were previously monitoring your kids and what is the set-up that you would prefer to monitor your kids for
 us to provide proper instructions. In addition, how are you cancelling the accounts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would also need to verify if what you're trying to monitor an email account or within Family Safety website/client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll await for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I originally set up family safety with my then current aapt email addy and every thing worked fine I was able to adjust setting just as family safety is supposed to allow the parent to do however as time passed and aapt is now no longer my current email
 addy something has changed and I can no longer field my sons requests for access to new progs etc so I need to change the parent email to a live .com.au and renew it all as I have also renewed the operating system and loaded some different programs than the
 ones that I made the access or not access to have no relevance&nbsp; help please</p>

            <p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for coming back and providing additional information about the issue. It seems that Family Safety is still recognizing the old parent e-mail address in your system. To change it, you need to re-install Family Safety then sign-in the new parent
 account and re-establish the child account. This will remove the previous credentials that are saved in the program. To accomplish these tasks, we recommend that you follow the instruction below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Uninstall Family Safety, please click <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/family-safety-remove-uninstall-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<p>2. Install Family Safety, click <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-other-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here.</a></strong></p>
<p>3. After re-installing Family Safety, open the program and sign-in with your new Parent account.</p>
<p>4. Re-establish the child account by following the steps in this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Protecting-your-kids-with-Family-Safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>solution article.</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the result afterwards.</p>
<p><br />

<p>If you have further questions or clarifications, don't hesitate to post it here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am glad that you are now able to setup Family Safety thanks to the instructions of Leonard. As I understand, the feature you are finding is Contact Management. That feature allows the&nbsp;parents to view and control the address book of their children in Family
 Safety. Unfortunately, that feature was already discontinued. For more information, you can visit this
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/family-wlsettings/where-did-the-contact-management-feature-through/bca859a1-afa7-45bd-8715-b53af21fa1a2">
<strong>post</strong></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, you can manage the child account through user accounts in your computer. You can do this by setting up your Family Safety through this

<p>
</p><p>Linux Skype now sets the video feed to fill the Skype Window, compared to v4.3 that set the video feed to show the whole video feed. &nbsp;As a result the minimum Linux Skype call window is approximately 85% of my screen (very portable laptop), whereas v4.3 minimum
 was around a far more useful 10% of my screen enabling easy access to the other apps we were communicating about.</p>

<p>For Linux computers, the preferred method of updating is to use the inbuilt software updater, or the Ubuntu Software Centre (like the App Store but much older). &nbsp;Followed both processes last night where both took me to from Linux Skype 8.11.0.4 to Skype
<span>8.13..0.2 (also there this evening)</span>&nbsp;which stops the start process at the white screen and goes no further, with only a few of the menu items working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the suggested link above which offers RPM Skype which for my Linux leads to the following error message:</p>

            Have you tried changing the shape of the call window to see ho the video call responds, with this version then you will lose part of the video instead of blank bars for the parts of the window that are not used by the video call. &nbsp;You could therefore be
 losing half or more of the video feed if your call window is the wrong shape

<p>As spoke to customer services, you pushed 8.13.0.2 out which only went to a white screen and no further here, customs services told me that it was impossible to go back to 8.11 for a working Skype, however, thank you Jonas who shared the link for 8.11 on
 page 21 of this thread:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Re-installing does seem to have helped, the minimum window is now about 50% of my screen, which does reduce access to other apps, but better that the 85% of the screen before, although not as good as Linux Skype 4.3 which would go down to around 10% each
 for the chat window &amp; video call window. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I think labelling my comment as an answer is a bit optimistic. &nbsp;The minimum Skype window is still 50% of the screen, excessive as would like to use other apps whilst on a Skype call. &nbsp;Linux Skype 4.3 would go down as far as about 10% of the screen each for
 chat &amp; video call, making using other apps so much easier, so would be looking for a much smaller window. &nbsp;The one window version makes it then hard to hold a chat conversation without losing control of the video call window size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still think that the window size is a major bug that needs addressing, along with the masses of wasted space when you are looking at the chat conversation. &nbsp;The real issue with the space is creating a call history, with v 4.3 this was tortuous as the only
 method that could find was to screenshot each call record and then paste them into a document, Libre Office far better than MS Office as in those apps, out does not take many photo insertions for the formatting or placement of this photos to become random
 with every version of Office that have used; with the new versions of Skype the process has become far far more laborious as a result of the wasted space in the chat window.</p>

    <title>Unable to work with Microsoft LifeCam Dashboard app - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to work with Microsoft LifeCam Dashboard app</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Lifecam dashboard download???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently updated to Windows 8.1 and all traces of the microsoft lifecam dashboard app have been removed from my computer. Lifecam still works but is useless without the dashboard because I can't turn off auto focus which is awful and constantly stalls
 and blurs the picture. The app has been removed from the windows store and I cannot find any other downloads. Would love to find a download so I don't have to buy a new camera to fix the problem. Would appreciate any help or tips anyone can give me on this.
 Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the model number of Microsoft LifeCam hardware that you are using? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to select the exact model number of the&nbsp;device&nbsp;from the list provided here.
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/downloads#webcam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/downloads#webcam</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check if your model is compatible with Windows 8.1 by checking the list of compatible operating systems.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the driver is not compatible with Windows 8.1, you can download and install the driver in Windows 8 compatibility mode. Follow the steps provided.

            Hi Winston,
<div><br />
<div>I don't believe you addressed part of the OP's question. What has happened to the Lifecam Dashboard app (which was available via Windows Store in Windows 8.1 Preview), and will it be returning to the store for Windows 8.1 users?</div>

            I'd like to know as well. I just purchased this camera and it is difficult to use on Windows 8 as there is no app. One thing that seems to be mandatory is disabling the awful auto focus. The Camera app in Win8 doesn't seem to have any ability to adjust
 camera settings.<br />
<br />
Pretty terrible experience so far with this cam. Might be returning it for a comparable Logitech model.<br />

</p><p>&nbsp; I just purchased this hardware as well, I've been trying to find a solution to the lack of software for the past 4 hours, I am extremely frustrated at this answer due to the fact that it is not the solution to the problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; The LifeCam app seems to be incompatible with the latest version of Windows 8. This hardware is now useless to me because of the auto focus feature that I am not able to turn off, without the incompatible softwere. Please help.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 does not shut down after the windows update.</h2>
                    <p><em>Original title : Since Installing 12th Feb Update my Laptop wont shut down</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a DellXPS Laptop and installed the updates this evening (30 of them). Had to try a few times, and uninstall my printer software to allow the OneNote update to install. Since doing so, I cant shut down my laptop. On shutdown it immediately restarts.
 I have tried running the powercfg -lastawake command and it gave me a 0 output. I have checked my power settings and Allow Wake Timers is switched off. I dont know what to do. This is immensely frustrating.

<p>Thanks for your replies. I have had the HDD on and off and was able to see content on there when connected, so it's not a HDD issue. I put the update on a USB stick, which seemed to work (ethernet cable disconnected) but it just seemed to go in a loop -
 extracting, green progress bar at 99.9%, restart, etc. left it on overnight - with ethernet reconnected. Now today, my avatar is back properly - yesterday he was just grey. I can sign in, but now get " your xbox has some corrupt files - please restart" or
 something like that. Done that, restarted, now applying another update.. Well that didn't work either. Progress got to about 50% then "can't download the update", same error code. My network and internet connections check out ok and good download speed of
 12MB/s. </p>

<p>Add the update to a USB and then, try it that way though the xbox. See if that makes a difference as it has done for some people :). If that hasn't helped post back. With what else is happening, as I am happy to help :)

<p>I have a feeling that the HDD is to blame in some way. I have saved my profiles and reformatted the drive, but it still doesn't update correctly. USB update doesn't work, nor does update via disc. I think I need to flash a new HDD....which is odd because
 I don't use the XBox very often.</p>

<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t my Windows Update Agent update to version 7.6.7600.256 as KB949104 says it should&#63;</h2>
                    OS: Windows XP Professional SP3<br />
<br />
They recently hardened the WUA to deal with the Flame virus by updating it to version 7.6.7600.256.<br />

How to obtain the latest Windows Update Agent&nbsp;
If Windows Update or Automatic Updates is turned on, the latest version of the Windows Update Agent will be automatically downloaded and installed on your computer. If you go to Windows Update before it gets installed automatically, you will see a message to
 install the Windows Update Agent: <br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
I have visited Windows Update and .256 isn't offered. I have 7.4.7600.226 currently.<br />
<br />
I also did an experiment in an XP virtual machine:<br />
I rolled back .226 to what comes stock on XP SP3 and then visited WU. 226 was what was installed not .256.<br />
<br />
I also have a Windows 7 running in a VM and don't notice it coming through but <a href="http://www.wilderssecurity.com/showthread.php?p=2069096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this guy</a> does.<br />
<br />
Also, why isn't the redistributable not being offered for download? Those of us that make unattended CDs need it.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />

<u><i><b>There is no standalone installer of the latest version of the Windows Update Agent (7.6.7600.256). The following are instructions on how to obtain version 7.4.7600.226 of the Windows Update Agent.</b></i></u><br />

            Looks like they finally released the floodgates on this. My Google Alerts for keyword 7.6.7600.256 has been non stop the last 24 hours. All my systems updated recently.<br />
<br />
I really doubt they were not putting it out all at once to lighten the load on the servers since a patch Tuesday works them probably a million fold harder.<br />

As you can see by the subject, when i try to start my computer i get a blue screen with the error "File :\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\BCD Error code: 0xc0000034".<br />
<br />
I've seen previous answers to this topic and the sugestion is always the same, and it seems to work considering most people feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT, i can't seem to reach <strong>point 3</strong> because my computer just freezes in a black screen with windows logo on it... What can I do?<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Prior on the steps that you provided, let me just clarify if you have already changed the boot sequence on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Please make sure that the first boot sequence is set to the optical drive. You may refer to the computer's manual or manufacturer's website on how to change it in BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>

<p>I am currently experiencing the same problem and I do not have any installation disc because the system came pre-installed with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was installing a game software and left the computer to run on its own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Came back from the afternoon and saw this blue screen message on the monitor.</p>
<p>Same message every time i try to reboot the system.</p>
<p>Tried changing from UEFI to Legacy Option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could not do anything else as I don't have a backup or restore USB ready as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

            <p>Hi dont know if it will help, but try checking in your "my apps and games" menu, just click menu (stripes) and select manage game on your xenoverse 2 game. There you should see something like "ready to install" for that specific game. Under it there should be a item "pre-order bonus". Just install it and enjoy.</p>

<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I was doing some last hope searching a few minutes ago and Found THIS:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smashboards.com/threads/anyone-use-a-wire-xbox-controller.326536/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.smashboards.com/threads/anyone-use-a-wire-xbox-controller.326536/</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>about Two-Thirds down the page you'll find a post by someone named Sparlight that goes something like this:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p><span>"Hey bro. I saw this post this morning (well, technically yesterday morning: August 17), and I was having the self-same problem.<br />
I just bought myself a nice computer and used my Madcatz controller (model #4716) on it. It worked on my laptop, but not on this one. Seems as though Microsoft mysteriously got rid of the driver for it on their compatibility site. Madcatz just has an "idgaf"
 attitude and only hosts drivers that they didn't throw onto Microsoft's site in the first place.<br />
<br />
While going around trying to find a driver for this (I've been working at it all day, mind you), I've had no success. I did, for instance, find XBCD, which is a controller emulator. It doesn't work really. Anyway, I did install that, and then I tried to uninstall
 it. It didn't uninstall all the way, but I managed to get it to stop attaching itself to my controller.<br />
<br />
Without further ado, I will tell you how to fix your controller (provided you're having the same problem as me -- the lights on the controller flash for a moment then stay off)<br />
<br />
1. Download the XBox 360 controller software from Microsoft&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/xbox-360-controller-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">here</span></a>.<br />
2. After installing that, plug in your USB controller. If it tries to automatically install the software, let it try, then close it out.<br />
3. Open the start menu, and type in "devmgmt.msc" in the search box. Press enter. You're now in the rather familiar Device Management page!<br />
4. Double click the MadCatz controller in the list. Go to the drivers tab. Click on Drivers in the menu.<br />
5. Click Update Driver. Select you want to do it manually. Now, instead of browsing for some drivers for the software, select the option below (something to do with selecting from a list).<br />
6. In the list, select Microsoft Common Controller for Windows Class. Use this and click next. You will get a warning box saying it might do your system harm. Proceed anyway.<br />
7. Your controller now should be lit up and should work properly.<br />
<br />
Took me forever to figure this out. I decided I'd register on here and tell you what I found in case you're still following this thread.<br />
Best of luck. Tell me if that solves your problem. &lt;3"</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>It worked perfectly for me and I can only hope it does the same for you.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>

            <p>Hi Glend</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft community forums.<br />
I understand that you want to know how you can change your password from one laptop to another. Correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>Are you trying to change the password for the Live/Microsoft Account which is used as the User Account?</p>
<p>Unfortunately you can’t change your system password from one laptop to another, in case if your password is blocked, hacked or forgotten you can follow the below links.</p>
<p>I suggest you to refer this below Microsoft link.</p>

<p>Xbox 3604GB has worked flawlessly, one day I went to turn it on, and at the Xbox swirl it froze. Upon restarting it, the screen is always black, the power button is green for about five seconds then turns red in the middle. The power brick is always green,
 and the Xbox is cool and not overheated. What's wrong?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Jeff
<br />
<br />There should be a wide variety of options. Here is what I see in mine:
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:

            Hi Jeff.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Camera app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Camera &gt; Advanced Options.  
<br />
<br />Did you enable the Privacy setting to allow apps to use your webcam?  
<br /><a href="https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disable-camera-or-webcam-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disabl...</a>
<br /><a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-camera-and-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-...</a>
<br />
<br />Try also these steps from Microsoft for when webcam isn't working:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/s13753/windows-10-camera-does-not-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/s13753...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Hardware &amp; Devices troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the webcam driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  
<br />
<br />Also compare all other drivers including Chipset, display, sound, etc to make sure you have the latest on the PC maker's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Webcam device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br /> 
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I downloaded <u>the windows 7 service pack 1 and internet explorer(IE) 9</u> as new updates on my computer 4 days ago. but&nbsp; I saw that IE&nbsp;wasn't responding anymore!</p>
<p>so,I restored my computer to the date before installing windows 7 service pack 1 and then I uninstalled IE 9.</p>
<p>the errror with IE was resolved but other worse errors appeared! </p>
<p><strong>the error that comes after computer boot up is:</strong></p>
<p>"<strong>couldnot load file or assembly 'sortkey.nlp' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the files specified</strong>."</p>
<p>and after that, I see this message:"<strong>VAIO Care has stopped working</strong>. windows is checking for a solution to the problem."</p>
<p>at last,another bothersome error is that I can't use the restore or recovery options anymore.
<strong>when I click on restore/recovery options, no window is opened! and it seems that they are inactivated!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please help me to solve these problems.</strong></p>
<p><strong>They're&nbsp;driving me&nbsp;crazy=(</strong></p>

<h2>            Fullscreen tile mode Start bar can&#39;t be closed</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this recurring issue where upon opening my laptop a tile mode of an app screen opens and can't be closed by any means. It is somewhat transparent over the desktop and has categories like "Life at a Glance" and "Play and Explore".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now I have no need for this screen, and while I'm indifferent to the feature it severely impedes the performance of any applications I open and is much less user-friendly to navigate. Ordinarily I can just click on any non-tile space and it will instead open
 the Start menu, returning to the desktop and letting me navigate through my folders. Every once in a while, however, it won't close when I do that and no method I have yet found can return me to the regular desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no use for this feature, and I would much rather it just be completely disabled. I've yet to find any option in settings to do this, so if anyone could please show me how to just turn it of that would be greatly appreciated. The image below shows
 the screen I'm talking about:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aff872be-e429-438c-931b-f9b7fab3b7b1" /></p>

            You are probably in tablet mode, Check Settings &gt; System and then tablet mode. If it is on try turning it off.

                    I tried to make MComix my default app for opening cbr files, but I could not do it. I tried doing it from "open with" option, I tried doing it from the "default app" settings, and from the control panel, which took me back to the "default app" in the "settings".
 But it would just not stay default. I had to "open with" each time I wanted to view a cbr file.&nbsp;<br />

            Hi Souriddha, for now there is nothing you can do . . .
<br />
<br />Setting File Associations in Windows 10 is now impossible, a lot of users are reporting this at the moment, this seems to be a bug in Windows 10 since the last update.
<br />
<br />Microsoft are working hard to patch the bugs in the last couple of updates, hopefully this is one of the bugs they are working on
<br />
<br />Please provide feedback to the Windows Developers on this bug, press Windows Key + F to open the Feedback Hub, the more users that report this, the quicker it will be resolved . . .       
        </p>

<p>Windows has a bug where it will not allow you to change your default apps. I have given two different Microsoft&nbsp;agents remote access to my laptop to resolve the problem and neither of them were able to solve the issues. I had my laptop set up to NOT install
 updates, but wouldn't you know it windows went ahead and reverted my laptop right back to installing updates and I've been dealing with this headache ever since. I am extremely unhappy with windows/Microsoft their updates are nothing but nightmares and they
 don't seem to be in any kind of hurry to fix the problems they cause. I wouldn't be surprised if this "bug" was intentional. All of my default settings have been changed to windows and I NEVER use windows apps. I spent all of yesterday waiting for windows
 to reinstall to a different point to before the update, was told my the agent it would take care of everything, it didn't. I am still stuck with windows default apps and have heard nothing from Microsoft about resolving this issue just a bunch of half assed
 work around. I do not want a work around I want you to fix the problem that YOU caused. You'd think after wiping people's personal files with your last up date you'd make sure that your updates were safe. It's like none of you care. You just put out updates
 without testing them and then leave your customers to deal with the fallout.&nbsp;</p>
