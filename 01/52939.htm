<h2>            Windows 7 a disgrace &#40;Epson RX425 and Genealogy software&#41;</h2>
                    Having just purchased a'free' upgrade to Windows 7 I now find that my Epson Printer RX425 does not work properly. The ink levels are not displayed. Epson tell me that they do not have a driver for windows 7 and I will have to buy a new printer!!!. Also
 my wife's genealogy discs from the Mormons do not work with Windows 7 and they say that they will ot be issuing the appropriate driver. Windows 7 was supposed to be better than Vista but it is turning out to be far

You can't really blame Microsoft for the decision of Epson not to provide Windows 7 drivers for your printer. I'd be ranting at Epson if I were you. My advice to all people going the Windows 7 route, is to check that there are Windows 7 drivers available for
 their existing peripherals before taking the plunge. That being said, have yuo tried using the Epson drivers for Vista? They might work considering Win7 was built upon Vista.<br />

            I upgraded from Vista to Windows 7 and the printer and genealogy discs worked fine there. I would contend that the problem is with Microsoft as it was them who brought out this supposidly new and better system. I had no problems with Vista. In any case
 thank you for your reply.

            The responisbility for drivers lies wholly with the hardware manufacturer as they make it it.<br />
<br />
Did u use the Win7 Upgrade Advisor to check whether your hardware was going to be compatibale before u upgraded?<br />
<br />
Did u check the MS Application compatability site before upgrading?<br />
<br />
Why didn't u check with the genealogy software people before upgrading, rather than doing so afterwards and then complaining when it doesn't work?&nbsp;

            Have you tried installing the genealogy software in compatibility mode? Also, if you go to control panel, open 'action center', select 'trouble shooting', and select 'programs' it will help you in setting up older programs. Using this, I was able to install
 and successfully run an older program that was written for Windows 95 that I could not get to run any other way
<div><br />
<div>Also , under trouble shooting, there is a section for 'hardware and sound' devices that may help with the printer problem.</div>

            I did check all available sources re compatability. I was informed that Windows 7 was a far superior system than Vista, where incidentally all these systems worked.&nbsp; So the problem IS WINDOWS 7. Microsoft have produced a new system to take over from the
 allegedly poor Vista system, which has as many if not more problems than before.<br />
<br />
Before you post vitriolic notes take some time to look at the problem and you may see that Microisoft have produced another dog!!!&nbsp; I also see that you have been reported, not by me, for an abusive post.

            dhayone has the same problem that I have,,, Not Win 7 but Microsofts Hype saying it will work when it won't.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 has an XP compatability Mode that will sort all of the Vista compatability problems.... WRONG!<br />
<br />
My brand new Canon printer has no Win 7 drivers, not to worry XP compatability mode...&nbsp;Two program installs later and a bunch of XP OS updates and reboots....<br />
<br />
Firstly, XP compatabilty mode is some sort of deranged Virtual PC.<br />
Secondly to run the printer I have to load it into the virtual PC and network share the printer from my Virtual XP machine.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, now I have XP Compatabiliuty mode (otherwise known as Windows Virtual PC)&nbsp;I can't run Microsoft Virtual PC to access the XP machines that I had already configured and with Microsofts new "Lets hide all the options so that people can't actually use
 our programs any more and call it intuative" Office 2003 style I can't even find how to try and load the MVPC machines onto WVPC...<br />
<br />
I was excited about Win 7, in a way I wasn't with Vista or XP... I am beginning to hate it now...

Yes you have to blame to microsoft. Because they create all those problems, they dont care people stuff problems. Like hardware or software. Only the wish its the money you pay the system. And You have to be smart to fix by your self. Where it's the book or
 the infomation to handle every step the did it.<br />
Think about. They sell you the w/7 with books or indice how to find every steps. Where? You need to be smart.

<p>I presume you're trying to cast to a Chromecast device using the Chrome browser since Chromecast is not Miracast compliant so it cannot be cast to natively using Windows 10.&nbsp; I am able to connect to my Samsung SmartTV (which is fully Miracast capable) but
 neither of my two Chromecast devices are available for native casting.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I simply select the Connect icon in the Notification Center.&nbsp; The connect screen opens and available devices show up under connect.&nbsp; (My Roku Streaming Stick is also Miracast-capable so I see both it and my Samsung TV.)&nbsp; I select the Samsung TV and the TV
 displays "Connecting to Surface."&nbsp; It sometimes takes several tries to connect and sometimes turning the TV off and then back on, but when it does connect the Surface screen is displayed on the TV.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. The flakiness of the connection to the Samsung TV is likely the TV, not the SP4.&nbsp; The SP4 connects reliably the first time to the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter.</p>

            <p>I use chromecast with SP4 and works fine for webpages, pictures, music, movies etc.</p>
<p>I use the Google cast extension in Chrome which adds a shortcut in top right to cast any page and Videostream for google chromecast app in Chrome to cast movies, pics etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure it is setup properly and connected to the same network as your SP4?</p>

            The OP is trying to mirror their SP4 on their TV, not cast content from Chrome.&nbsp; Full screen mirroring is not possible with a Chromecast because the Chromecast it not&nbsp;a Miracast device.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            My gamerscore has gone down from the time I got offline yesterday to today.</h2>
                    <p>My gamerscore was 40,000 a lil over but I know 40k because it just happened to round out to that exact number which I thought was neat at a milestone like that, anyways I got on today and was getting the rest of the little achievements in Modern Warfare Remaster and I happened to notice I was at 39,545 G. I have no clue why it has gone down, I have no proof that I did in fact hit 40k just my word. I have talked to support about this issue and they directed me here, so here I am. I was also told to leave my reference number in this too so here it is:&nbsp;1369125007</p>

            <p>Figured I would comment that I looked through the xbox app (on Android and also on Windows 10)&nbsp;and wrote down all my gamerscore that I should have then added it all up and it was 43,235. I also know that I didn't lose nearly that much yesterday (Jan. 3rd) so I don't know whats happening. (It is possible that some games that are on both 360 and X1 only count for one or the other and not both like some do and that could throw my total that I got last night off a little bit, however, being 3,000 less gamerscore than what my total should be based on simple math is very confusing and worrisome because there is no telling how many people might actually have more gamerscore than their profile shows. Again I would like to point out this isn't a huge issue, to me anyways, and I don't even care for what little bit I lost yesterday (if it was in fact any at all) to be added back to my account, if thats even possible, I just want to know what happened to it and if this is a common issue. &nbsp;</p><p>

Thanks for the update and info about it taking a lil while to show up. You can delete this now if you want! Hope you have a great day XD</p>

                    I had to&nbsp;re-install&nbsp;after changing some&nbsp;equipment&nbsp;in my tower and I had a bad install so then I had to start over. It will not let me activate my product even though the MAGDiag tells me I'm&nbsp;genuine. The error code is
<div>0x80070005 Access Denied.&nbsp;</div>
<div>There is only one user and that is me and I'm set to admin.</div>
<div>When I try to go through customer support it asks me for my PID and when I type it in it tells me that it has expired or something.</div>
<div>I tried this command prompt:&nbsp;slmgr.vbs and it wouldn't let me do that either.</div>
<div>I can't seem to run any script from cmd promt at all. I can't flush dns, /repconfig /rearm &nbsp;or anything even running as admin.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>need to get this activated.</div>

<span>To properly analyze and solve problems with Activation and Validation, we need to see a full copy of the diagnostic report produced by the MGADiag tool (download and save to desktop
 - <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012</a> )</span></p>
<p>
<span>Once downloaded, run the tool.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Click on the Continue button, after a short time, the Continue button will change to a Copy button.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Click on the Copy button in the tool (ignore any error messages at this point), and then paste (using either r-click/Paste, or Ctrl+V ) into your post. (please do not edit the report.)</span></p>

 and pasted it here. If there is still missing information let me know what it is so I can parse the info and put it in. Thanks.</div>

<h2>            BLACK SCREEN WITH WHITE POINTER AFTER START UP</h2>
                    I went on vacation and turned off my computer.&nbsp; When I got back, I stupidly plugged in my blackberry storm while the system was booting up.&nbsp; Now all I get is this stupid black screen with the white pointer.&nbsp; I tried the task manager solution and a few
 others that were listed in the similar questions to no prevail.&nbsp; At some point I did a startup Repai Tool and it came back with it couldn't repair the iso or ico or something like that.&nbsp; I have done a system restore to an earlier date from before I left and
 that hasn't helped.&nbsp; Please help me.&nbsp; Thanks.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver - then Right Click<br />
on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.</p>
<p>Another method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular Windows and Safe Mode) is to<br />
CTRL + ALT + DEL and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe . Safe Mode is reached<br />
by repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up.</p>
<p>First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a</span></a></p>
<p>Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss basis.<br />
That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just adds to the<br />
difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect. You can try a<br />
google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these cover a wide<br />
field of efforts.</p>
<p>Here is a video of one fix.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=black+screen+of+death+vista&amp;btnG=Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=black+screen+of+death+vista&amp;btnG=Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g1</span></a></p>

<p>Do you have a Vista Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the disks your<br />
system maker will sell them cheap. Or try from Safe Mode if you can get there.</p>

<p>You can create a Recovery Disk or use someone else same version (to do the System Restore it<br />
only has to be bootable).</p>

<p>These require the correct Vista Disks since you can't boot to Safe Mode.</p>

<p>If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.</p>
<p>You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data) or a repair installation<br />
(hopefully saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or three.</p>
<p>You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own<br />
Product Key.</p>
<p>In-Place Upgrade<br />

<p>If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have to<br />
reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions. You will<br />
need to know your Product Code.</p>

<p>Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Vista boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - do not type parenthesis<br />
or BOLD)</p>
<p>c:</p>

<h2>            Windows 10  &#34;Documents and Settings&#34; Shortcut</h2>
                    <p>I had some malware on my laptop and as I was investigating it i found the "hidden" (they weren't at the time) folders which from what i found were junction points of some sort. The virus was removed by norton but i then realised i had deleted an important
 folder because i thought it was corrupted. </p>
<p>Now i am without a Documents and Settings Shortcut that previously existed within my windows drive and I have no idea how to replace it as i deleted it from recycling bin as well (thinking it was infected). All i could say about it is that it was of the
 same class as the "System volume Information" folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for some reason my programs are not reachable from my startup menu and i believe it is related. How can i fix this as most searches involving documents and settings are for previous versions of windows and i do not think the fixes apply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also prompts on start up in notepad</p>
<p>
</p><p>"[.ShellClassInfo] LocalizedResourceName=@%SystemRoot%\system32\shell32.dll,-21787"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>"C:\Documents and Settings" is a legacy name for "C:\Users". You find it as a junction point under Windows 10 for compatibility reasons. Deleting this junction point makes no difference to current programs.</p>

            <p>Confusing to me. The Documents folder in my user account contained My Music, My Video, etc, and Quicken, Custom office templates, AZZcardfiles, and others.&nbsp; I removed most of them.&nbsp; Confusion is that File explorer showed them at the top of the nav stack
 as well as in my account 'documents',&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So which is the preferred current location "C:\Users"&nbsp; Thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>MY RANT is next. </p>
<p>Thus&nbsp;it would seem logical that the Documents folder in User account or at the top of nav stack is deliberately confusing stuff caused by silly program manager at Microsoft.&nbsp; Why have&nbsp;so many things being&nbsp;in different and thus confusing to old men.&nbsp; Yes,
 I loved junctions in&nbsp;Unix but, that was because&nbsp;normal users could only see the desired location.&nbsp;&nbsp; that's my 2 cents &nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry, your question relates to "User Libraries" rather than the legacy folder "C:\My Documents". Please start a new thread on this new subject.</p>

            <p>Frederik, Sorry about that.&nbsp; My Documents files and folders at the top of the navigation stack is, in my opinion a Redundant and Confusing strategy.&nbsp; This might be ok for users who have Music and Pictures Junctioned to that location. Those were always in
 C:\Users which is where they belong, or delete the&nbsp;USERS&nbsp;folder completely and just use "Libraries" Not both. As I&nbsp;stated above Unix&nbsp;only had 1 location (call it Libraries if you want)&nbsp;that users could easily&nbsp; find all there stuff not&nbsp;2 or 3&nbsp;etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;So some
 rethinking on access to their interface with programs.&nbsp; As I said above&nbsp;confusing stuff is caused by silly program manager at Microsoft who do not understand real world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this because Businesses could not use Windows 10 as it was 1st published and that is why M.S. now has a "Windows 10 for Business).&nbsp; This my comment gathered from friends in business, as I was one of businesses Testing location for Windows 3.5 which
 resulted in the release of Windows 3.51.&nbsp; Good luck to Microsoft on the future direction of Windows as being just another iOS10, 11, etc. will in my opinion result in no more Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Toshiba L40 XP boot problem</h2>
                    
<p>I have a toshiba lap top which came with Home Vista pre-installed. But I installed a fresh&nbsp; XP .</p>
<p>Problem is the computer won't boot. I get a few seconds of the XP start up and then it crashes. Any option from the "Windows didn't start normally " screen just loops the whole thing.</p>
<p>Anyone know why Toshiba can't run XP?</p>

<p>Perhaps you XP is not licensed to run on Vista.<br />
Do you have <strong>OEM</strong> Windows XP, or <strong>RETAIL</strong> Windows XP?<br />
Did you try XP <strong>Pro</strong> or XP Home <strong>Premium</strong> or <strong>
Basic</strong>?<br />
<br />
It is possible that you do not have suffiicient drivers for Toshiba L40 Laptop on XP Recovery DVD.<br />
Retail XP should not have such problem, and if they are their present you can get money back from Microsoft.</p>
<p>One question, Why do you not want to use Vista? It is much more stable than XP/SP3.</p>

                    <p>I was on an internet application and scrolling through a document with the scroll button on my mouse and all of a sudden my screen got smaller and I haven't been able to enlarge it again. Everything I bring up is now smaller than it should be.&nbsp; An example
 is when I bring up Bing the picture was the same size as the screen but now it is quite small even though the actual screen is maximized.</p>

<p>You could try contacting any support for Hypercam and see if they have any known solution for the problem that their program is causing.</p>
<p>You could try reinstalling Hypercam and see if the Programs and Features repopulates.</p>

<p>I think that perhaps the only solution, short of completely rebuilding vast amounts of registry locations, would be to save your valuable data and then reinstall (OEM recovery options) the operating system.</p>

                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Quantum Break was released on the windows store, so figured id check it out. I'm unable to click on the cost of the app and purchase stating that i need to visit a&nbsp;go.microsoft.com fwlink linkid site (Sorry i dont have the exact code right now as im on
 a different computer). However this link directed me to a download for get windows 10. I already have windows 10 installed. So I'm a little lost as to why the store wont let me download anything. It also states on the store page that I dont have the certain
 hardware and that my experience may not be the same as the reviews offered. The specs of my PC should be more than fine to handle this game.</p>

            <p>I have tried different solution and nothing helped. Where is only one way to resolve this problem. I found that my vesion of Windows 10 is not the last one, despite that the windows update said that there is no update for me, everything is up to
 date.</p>
<p>Try to check your windows version by writing ''winver'' in the ''run command'', and if your windows vesion is not 1511, you will need to reinstall it.<br />
Use that link, choose your edition of windows 10 and download it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/techbench<br />
</p>
<p>I did that and now everything is working for me.<br />
Good luck.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion, but it didn't work. Still receiving the same error message when trying to Export to either a new file or a .csv saved file on the Desktop.</p>
<p>I am logged on as Administrator so I hope it is not a permission issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just had a thought and copied the Desktop .wab file to an old laptop. Making sure the Export function worked properly on that laptop first, and it did. Then I renamed the files and tried to Export the&nbsp;Desktop Address book on the Laptop, and it didn't work.
 So that means there's most likely something wrong with the desktop's .wab.</p>
<p>Is this something you have heard of before?</p>

<h3> ne_idet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Displaying Korean characters in Windows Media Player</h2>
                    I just can't seem to make the Windows Media Player to correctly display Korean characters on my WMP. I changed my locale to Korean(Korea), and it displays some of the Korean characters on WMP correctly, and the rest are all in broken characters. I currently
 have Windows 7 Professional and I know that this was a problem for me on Vista; I tried to look for a way to fix this problem and found that there are LIPs (<em>Language Interface Pack</em> ) and MUI(<em>Multilingual User Interface)</em> that is only supported
 for Windows 7 Ultimate and Enterprise. I'm wondering if that could solve the problem but that isn't a valid option for me. Could anyone shed light upon this problem?

            I see. But could this guarantee that the broken texts will be readable?<br />
Also, Could it be possible that I need a certain font to fix this issue? The thing is, Other media player such as iTunes correctly displays the Korean characters on the specific songs that WMP can't.

            <p><span>Hi Praanesh,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues with Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try the following methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try to boot the computer in safe mode and check, Please refer to the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or
 an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may
 temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the
 computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a
<strong>SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

    <title>Account Suspended - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tiredbard757  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account Suspended</h2>
                    
<p>I am extremely disappointed because my account has been suspended. My mate decided to prank me and try to get me suspended on xbox live but he didn't realise it would actually happen. The email says it's due to cheating/ inappropriate gameplay/ system abuse.
 But this was not intentional, so can you please urban me as I have read the code of conduct over and over again and read it thoroughly. Can you make the altercations to PGPxLuck, this is the account that has been wrongly suspended. Thank you.</p>
<p>By the way, this is a dummy account I'm using to make this enquiry</p>

    <title>Microsoft Spider Solitaire in Windows 8.1 does not work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evandrobezerra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Spider Solitaire in Windows 8.1 does not work</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 8.1 Pro. I installed Microsoft Solitaire Collection. Spider Solitaire was working properly. Now it won't&nbsp;create a&nbsp;RUN (a stack from King to Ace).</p>
<p>I can play until the time comes to join the cards that will create&nbsp;the RUN. There is no way to join the cards&nbsp;that makes&nbsp;the RUN. I tried to re-install the game (twice) but it doesn't solve the problem. I tried the program that checks the apps (apps.diagcab)
 but still it doesn't work. What is wrong? What I need to do? May be it is silly, but my grandmother doesn't live without it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

</p><p><span>This seems to be an issue with the game itself and not an app issue. In this case, I would suggest you to contact the Xbox game support for further assistance. Here are the links to the support resources:</span></p>

            <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Sorry for the delay in answering your email. Occurs that I couldn't solve the problem, even with what you told me. So, in order to solve the problem of my grandmother, I&nbsp;went back&nbsp;to Windows 7, where everything works without a problem. I must say that it was
 against my will because I would like to TEST the 8, despite the problems I see my friends, who work with IT, have.<br />
<br />
I believe that the application has problems in the code and a review, searching the problem I reported, could solve.
<br />
Meanwhile I will keep with Windows 7&nbsp;<span>which is</span> rock <span>
solid.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Sincerely,</span><br />
<br />
<span>Evandro Bezerra</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>PS: I don´t have a Xbox account and I don´t intend to do. Ga</span><span>mes are not</span>
<span>of interest to me</span><span>, much less</span> <span>

<p>Yes, this is a complete and total scam.&nbsp; Assuming you did not give them access to your computer, you are probably safe enough.&nbsp; They make what are called "cold calls" - picking numbers from phone listings at random and attempting to sell services and/or
 gain access to your computer.&nbsp; You did the right thing, hang up on them.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t use drop down menus, screen title bars flicker and I can&#39;t use address bar</h2>
                    I upgraded by laptop from Window 8.1 to 10 a couple of months ago, everything seemed fine for the most part, but the last couple of days my computer has been doing some strange stuff. Example: when on Facebook and using the private message the window where
 the person I'm messaging's name is flickers, when I try to type addresses into the address bar I get about as far as www and then my cursor leaves and I have to start over and make several attempts&nbsp;before accomplishing my task, when trying to use drop down
 menus it collapses (close) before I can select an option. The only way I can do it is to use my arrow up and down keys. My windows will disappear and then reappear.&nbsp; What's going on? HELP. I have an HP DV 7229 AMD Vision

            I found out what the issue was, a few days ago I began having the issues as previously described. It turns out the problem was with Norton's Anti-virus. I'd used Norton's for years and I'm not sure why I suddenly began to have this problem, but I'd seen
 where someone was having the same issues, but with the Surface tablet, so I used the Norton's Uninstall website and the problem stopped, however with that being said I now have a problem that when I try to open the start menu either by keyboard or clicking
 the icon I will not open, nor can I search in Cortana. It won't even let me type anything into it.

<strong>PowerShell </strong>is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language designed especially for system administration. Built on the
<strong>.NET Framework</strong>, Windows PowerShell helps IT professionals and power users control and automate the administration of the Windows operating system and applications that run on Windows.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><span>Open an Administrator command window by</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Right click
</span></strong><span>on the taskbar and select
<strong>task manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on<strong> More details

<strong>Create this task with administrative privileges.</strong></span></li><li><span>Type <strong>CMD
</strong></span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>Type the following commands in the CMD Prompt:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:
</span></strong><span>After running the above commands and it shows no remaining issues, run the below commands:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>powershell<br />
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>Step 4:
</span></strong><span>Check to make sure the above command ran, shows a blue progress indicator and then returns to the prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>If you see a red error, then the command may have been typed or pasted incorrectly, or there may be a larger problem with Windows 10. Try again.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 5:
</span></strong><span>Check the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>If not, <strong>
restart</strong> the PC. In this case try as a new <strong>Administrator user account</strong>.

    <title>BitLocker requires recovery key after taking Surface Pro 3 out of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesallendoe  say:</h3>
<h2>            BitLocker requires recovery key after taking Surface Pro 3 out of docking station</h2>
                    I have a Surface Pro 3 with Windows 8.1 and BitLocker enabled. When I take the pro out of the docking station BitLocker requires the recovery key. After putting in the recovery key I then suspend, reboot and re-enable BitLocker and all is good again. When
 I put the Pro back in to the docking station, again I am required to put the recovery key in and go through the above motions to make all good again. Has anyone run in to this issue and have a fix for it? Any help is greatly appreciated.
