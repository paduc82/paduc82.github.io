<h2>            Windows 10 not detecting devices plugged into 3.5mm audio jack. Please Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My problem with my Dell Inspiron 5558 laptop is that whenever I plug a device in, the computer does not detect anything is plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>BEFORE ANYONE responds on solutions, let me make sure you understand the problem.</strong></span> I am
<em><strong>VERY</strong></em> specific. It does not DETECT anything plugged into the audio jack. Most people with issues with their audio jack have an issue where they will plug in headphones in the audio jack, but upon doing so, the audio will continue to
 play through external speakers built into their laptop, and not through the headphones because they were not detected due to a driver issue. That is
<strong><em>NOT</em></strong> my issue. The headphone jack and all my audio drivers and all my Windows Audio services and related services are all functioning and have ALL been messed with to try to resolve my much weirder issue. For me, all devices plugged
 into the audio jack work fine. It will stop playing audio through my speakers, and go to my headphone or earbuds, and work like it normally should, the problem is it does not KNOW that it is doing that. The computer still thinks that when it cuts the audio
 from the external speakers and starts playing only into the headphones, that it is STILL playing through the external speakers. Why is this an issue? Well, all my audio devices have built in microphones, but unlike the speakers, the compute will NOT switch
 over the microphone from the built-in webcam mic to the one plugged in into the audio jack, because it does not detect anything is plugged into the audio jack, despite playing audio through anything plugged into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I noticed is BEFORE this issue occurred, any time I plugged anything into the audio jack, Windows 10 would prompt me with a notice asking me what I plugged into the audio jack, and those options listed
<em>"Headphones with Mic"</em> and <em>"Skull-candy Headset" </em>and stuff like that, and the audio BEFORE I select anything from the list would go to my headphones or earbuds, but only after selecting an option that had a microphone on it did the microphone
 get detected and viewable through the available devices on my PC. When I plug something into my PC's audio jack now, it does not ask me that anymore, but still will play audio totally fine through whatever is plugged into it.</p>
<p>ALL of my drivers have been updated, uninstalled, reinstalled, disabled, enabled, and I have troubleshooted this by going into
<em>"Services"</em> and stopping and restarting Windows Audio and Windows Audio Endpoint Builder, and restarting my computer after all of these and every combination of these methods, as well as checking to see that the PC's 3.5mm headphone jack is working
 properly with the correct drivers and that it is functioning properly, which it is. I cannot see any reason that this is a hardware issue, it appears to be something related to Windows that is not letting it detect anything is being plugged into the headphone
 jack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC uses Realtek High Definition Audio, and under <em>"Playback devices"</em>, it is labelled as Speakers/Headphones. Under
<em>"Recording"</em>, Microphone - Realtek High Definition Audio is the default device, and all of these are turned on, under properties nothing is disabled, at all. Everything is set to function totally fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would like as a solution is not for my microphone to work, I do not want ANY solutions that can fix my problem by explaining how to fix common audio problems for a PC when you plug something in and it does not work. Anything I plug in DOES work, but
 not the microphone, because it does NOT ask me what I plugged in, and I cannot select it is a headphone with a microphone, so it will not switch over from the webcam mic to the headphone mic, nor can I do that manually because when I plug something in it does
 not recognize I plug anything in at all despite properly functioning when I do to be able to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any potential solutions at all would be greatly appreciated, and thank you so much for reading.</p>

            Hi Matt,<br />
<br />
<br />
Based on the information you have provided, considering that you have done updating (uninstall and reinstall) the driver, disabling and re-enabling the driver from the Services, and the issue persists, then it's possibles that the issue is due to a faulty hardware
 or an issue with the device itself. You can consider contacting the manufacturer of your device for advanced assistance.<br />
<br />
Regards.

<p>Hi Joshua,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information you provided, it seems that the issue is caused by your driver. We suggest downloading a fresh copy of the audio driver through the manufacturer's website and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

    <title>Xbox One Elite Controller on Mac&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One Elite Controller on Mac&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys so I'm planning on moving back to the Xbox One X when it comes out but currently do not have a system. I have a good deal on an elite controller and was wondering if I&nbsp;would be able to use it on a Mac to play CS GO via Steam? I'd really like to purchase it now as the deal will pass, but prefer to buy it only if I&nbsp;can use it now (as I've heard there have been issues with the product). I&nbsp;saw you can download a driver for the regular xbox one controller, just was not sure if the same applied for the elite controller.&nbsp;</p>

 </blockquote> <p>From what I've seen on youtube it looks like people are able to use the regular xbox one controller on a mac w/out bootcamp. I just want to use it for a couple steam games...I'm assuming the same method require to link up a regular controller should apply to the elite given this?&nbsp;</p>

                    Since the update, besides the lack of ringing on my laptop (Windows 10) to announce an incoming call on my Skype number which I pay for to do business when I am out of the country, incoming calls no longer forward to my cell as they have for years. What
 was once a clean workaround is now impossible.&nbsp; Anyone figured this out?

            Can you sign out of Skype on all of your devices, restart then sign in again?
<br />
<br />Also, make sure Focus Assist on the Windows 10 desktop in the Taskbar Notification area is turned off.

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their<br />
supplied drivers. Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation and <br />
drivers, and ask in their forums. <br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

<h2>            Have my Computer Drivers Been Updated&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I recently paid a company to update my drivers in my computer. I went through all folders in my Device Manager and looked at the Driver dates and there are none there for Jan. 2018. How can I tell if my drivers have been updated as they have said?
 This went through Microsoft as I received a survey from Microsoft. Thank you. Regards, Linda

<p>At best, you paid for a service you didn't need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At worst, your personal information has been harvested and you have malware installed on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not need to update your drivers unless there is a problem that you know will be fixed by a specific update or that there is a particular new feature that you want or need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what you mean by "folders" in Device Manager, but it is far from surprising that the dates of your installed drivers are not "January 2018."&nbsp; Most device drivers simply do not get updated that often.&nbsp; Assuming that the company you paid at least
 tried to do the right thing, they probably scanned your drivers, and found that most didn't need updating.&nbsp; For the few that may have been updated, the "most recent driver" may well have been several years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that "survey from Microsoft" almost certainly was not "from Microsoft" and you didn't go "through Microsoft."</p>

            Thank you.&nbsp; I am going to go on the Internet and see if I can find out more about this company.&nbsp; I also seem to remember that they said they reinstalled Home Premium 7.&nbsp; Would there be drivers located somewhere specifically for this program?&nbsp; Also, are
 all drivers located in the Device Manager?&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Regards, Linda

<p>Windows 7 Home Premium is one of the editions of Windows offered by Microsoft.&nbsp; You can check to see what you have by doing either of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click Start (the Microsoft "globe"), right-click "Computer" and select "Properties."</li><li>Press the "Windows Logo" key and the "Pause/Break" key simultaneously</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You should see a screen that looks like the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What do you see under "Windows Edition"?&nbsp; Does it mention a "Service Pack"?</li><li>What do you see as the "System type"?</li><li>For your "Product ID," what are the 3 characters in the second grouping (corresponding to "068" in the image below)?</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>"Drivers" are small programs that act as the interface between your computer's "operating system" -- Windows 7 -- and the various hardware components in your computer.&nbsp; For example, there is a driver for:</p>
<ul>
<li>your video card (also called the "display adapter"), which creates the output to your display device</li><li>your sound card, which creates the output to your speakers or headphones</li><li>your mouse</li><li>your keyboard</li><li>etc.</li></ul>
<p>Windows 7, like all versions of Microsoft Windows, incorporates a collection of drivers for many -- but not all -- hardware devices.&nbsp; When Windows is installed, it detects the various hardware devices and looks to see if it already has a driver for each
 device.&nbsp; If it does, it installs the driver.&nbsp; Windows also checks for new hardware devices when the computer starts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows does not have a "built-in" driver for a device, you need to obtain that driver elsewhere.&nbsp; For "brand name" computers (e.g., HP, Lenovo, Dell, etc.) the first place to look for drivers is the computer manufacturer's support site.&nbsp; The next place
 to look for drivers is the web site of the manufacturer of the specific hardware device.&nbsp; For example, if you have an Nvidia graphics adapter, you would go to the Nvidia site (<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us</a>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason to go to the computer manufacturer site first is that the big computer manufacturers will often customize hardware that they incorporate in their products.&nbsp; Thus, for example, an Nvidia graphics adapter in a Dell computer might require a Dell-specific
 driver rather than the "generic" driver from Nvidia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, Windows will have a basic driver that gets a hardware device functioning but doesn't enable all of the special features that you get when you install the specific driver from the computer manufacturer or the hardware device manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all cases, whether the driver comes from Microsoft, the computer manufacturer, or the hardware device manufacturer, drivers are free.&nbsp; You should
<strong>never </strong>pay for drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Except for a few hardware devices -- notably printers -- you can find information about device drivers in the Windows Device Manager.&nbsp; Drivers are not "located in" Device Manager, but you can get information about your hardware devices and their drivers
 using this tool</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following is what you could see if you opened Device Manager and clicked on the "Help" menu:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Device Manager provides you with a graphical view of the hardware that is installed on your computer. All devices communicate with Windows through a piece of software called a device driver. You can use Device Manager to install and update the drivers
 for your hardware devices, modify hardware settings for those devices, and troubleshoot problems.&nbsp;
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><em><strong>Uses for Device Manager</strong></em></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><em>You can use Device Manager to:</em></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><em>Determine whether the hardware on your computer is working properly.
</em></li><li><em>Change hardware configuration settings.</em></li><li><em>Identify the device drivers that are loaded for each device, and obtain information about each device driver.
</em></li><li><em>Change advanced settings and properties for devices. Install updated device drivers.
</em></li><li><em>Enable, disable, and uninstall devices. </em></li><li><em>Roll back to the previous version of a driver. </em></li><li><em>View the devices based on their type, by their connection to the computer, or by the resources they use.
</em></li><li><em>Show or hide hidden devices that are not critical to view, but might be necessary for advanced troubleshooting.</em></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><em>You will typically use Device Manager to check the status of your hardware and update device drivers on your computer. Advanced users who have a thorough understanding of computer hardware might also use Device Manager's diagnostic features to resolve
 device conflicts and change resource settings.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Ordinarily, you will not need to use Device Manager to change resource settings because resources are allocated automatically by the system during hardware setup.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>You can use Device Manager to manage devices only on a local computer. On a remote computer, Device Manager will work only in read-only mode, allowing you to view, but not change the hardware configuration of that computer.</em></p>

    <title>How can I change the name of the user folder in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnlonghurst1  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I change the name of the user folder in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently had to reinstall Windows 10 on my daughter's pc. During the installation process it asked me to sign on to my Microsoft account which I foolishly did and so after the installation the user account was set up in my name which I did not want. I
 have changed the user account to local in my daughter's name but cannot change the user folder name to hers. I read somewhere that it is impossible to change the user folder name without re-installing the OS again but that cannot be right because that would
 be an idiotic and utterly stupid limitation to build into the OS, so can someone tell me the proper way of doing this so I can return her pc to her.</p>

<p><span><em>I read somewhere that it is impossible to change the user folder name without re-installing the OS.</em></span></p>
<p><span>-&gt; This is correct. The reason is simple: The registry contains countless references to the name of user profile. Some of them were created by Microsoft software, some by third-party software. If you changed the name
 of the profile folder (which is fairly easy) then these references would be invalid and your account would be crippled.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If I felt strongly about the name of my profile folder then I would do this:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Create a spare admin account.</span></li><li><span>Reboot and log into this account.</span></li><li><span>Delete the problem account (but keep the user data!).</span></li><li><span>Create a new local account with the desired name.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>You will get a profile folder with the correct name. If desired then you can copy the personal files from the old to the new profile folder.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Language Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benjamin_fox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Language Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple days ago, on the 30th, I upgraded my PC to Windows 10 Pro. It automatically set itself to English (UK), which pleased me. Just yesterday I was messing with Cortana, and I must say I'm fond of the feature. Now today I launch my PC, updates; yay,
 the uncancelable, unannounced and not-roll-backable updates. My PC's <em>again</em> cluttered all of the items in my start menu, just like it did upon the initial update, and it's changed itself to Dutch (Which, okay, was the language of the Windows installation
 I bought). My Dutch isn't particularly amazing, so it's not the easiest thing to get around with, plus it's disabled Cortana and any other language restricted features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to change the language pack, it just tells me it's 'Searching in Windows Update' for a few seconds, then goes back to doing nothing or even closing my settings window. I'm amazed I could go from loving the update to disliking it again that rapidly,
 it's been giving me a lot of work on fixing everything it caused me. Now, does anyone have any idea on how I can fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ben</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, it just 'searches' (like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KHV0OKY.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>so</strong></a>) then goes back to just showing "English (UK)" without any text below it, however it doesn't change the language, not even after signing out and in, it also doesn't lost "Dutch" as a language in said list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a Microsoft account (this very account), because it wouldn't let me use Cortana without it.</p>

<h2>            Hourglass Icon frozen on taskbar</h2>
                    Just got HP Envy x360 running Windows 10.&nbsp; Operating less than 24 hours.&nbsp; On task bar at bottom, I have an hourglass image sitting over the blue question mark icon.&nbsp; I cannot get it to close as obviously a program is running.&nbsp; Any ideas what is going on
 here or how to close/exit the hourglass?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description,&nbsp;I suspect that the blue question mark with the hourglass icon might be the icon for<strong> HP support assistance.
</strong>To get a clearer image of the issue in hand, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1. Can you send us a screenshot of the icon on the taskbar?</p>
<p>2. If you hover the mouse over the icon, you will see the description for the same. Hover the mouse above on the icon&nbsp;and send us the name that it displays?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I suggest that you perform the methods stated below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>
<p>To remove the icon from your taskbar, open HP Support Assistant, select the <strong>
Settings</strong> button in the lower left corner, click the <strong>Notification settings</strong> tab, and select the pop-up only option.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Update HP support Assistance</strong></p>
<p>Click on the link below to download the update for the same</p>

                    <p>G'day all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>ISSUES</p>
<p>1. After several attempts to install a printer driver (Brother MFC-J6930DW), could no longer access Printer Properties for any installed printers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Device Manager would not start with an "Unable to create new document" error</p>
<p>3. Services.msc cannot start with an "Unable to create new document" error</p>
<p>4. Could not run "sfc /scannow" (under admin account) with a "Windows Resource Protection could not start the repair" error</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issues 2, 3 and 4 only occured after issue 1 arose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DETAIL</p>
<p>OS : Windows 10 1607 (Build 14393.1198)</p>
<p>NOTE : Fully patched - Falls Creator upgrade downloaded but not yet installed</p>
<p>Printer #1 : Brother MFC-J6930DW</p>
<p>Printer #2 : Brother L8850CDW</p>
<p>Printer #3 : Brother MFC-J6710DW</p>
<p>
</p><p>ATTEMPTED REMEDIATION</p>
<p>1. Printer driver appeared to install correctly (no error dialogues) but did not appear in SETTINGS-&gt;DEVICES-&gt;PRINTERS &amp; SCANNERS</p>
<p>2. Printer did, however, appear correctly in Brother Utilities</p>
<p>3. Successful scan completed from with Brother Utilities scan function</p>
<p>4. In CONTROL PANEL -&gt; DEVICES &amp; PRINTERS, changed the view from LARGE ICONS to DETAIL and the new printer appeared</p>
<p>5. Change view back to LARGE ICONS and the new printer was still there</p>
<p>6. Right clicking on new printer and selecting PROPERETIES does nothing</p>
<p>7. Attempting to start DEVICE MANAGER produces issue #2 (above)</p>
<p>8. Attempting to start SERVICES.MSC as a test produces issue #3 (above)</p>
<p>9. Attempting to run SFC /SCANNOW to test system file integrity produces issue #4 (above)</p>

<p>Usually, when you get <strong>"</strong><span>The file autorun.dll could not be loaded or is corrupt. Setup cannot continue. Error code is Ox36B3" message, a clean install would be our option to resolve the issue. However, before doing that, kindly check
 if you managed to disabled your antivirus program and close other running programs before performing the repair upgrade. This is to make sure that there are no software conflicts that may cause any issues. Once verified and the issue persists, go to this link

            I would try resetting the Calendar app then try setting up again.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />		Scroll down to Calendar
<br />		Select it
<br />		Click Advanced options
<br />		Click Reset
<br />
<br />		Restart

            Hi Tammy.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Open Calendar app, on left side scroll down to see if Gmail is added and if so if the choices you want displayed are selected.  If not choose Add Calendar to add it properly.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi again Tammy -
<br />
<br />It may be that Google Reminders haven't made it to the Desktop yet.  The issue is being tracked here:  <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/calendar/fOnLEpUnCYA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/...</a>
<br />
<br />I'm not sure that reminders are included in Calendar content anyway.  You may need to list something on the Google Calendar itself to see it in Windows 10 Calendar.  Is this working for you?       
        </p>

    <title>Program missing from Start Menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> riley mashburn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Program missing from Start Menu</h2>
                    <p>I'm running windows 10, build 1607 (work machine, *I* can't update it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>A while back, I was trying to create a shortcut to Outlook and accidentally MOVED the shortcut out of the start menu folder.&nbsp;
<em>(%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs)</em></p>
<p>I've re-added it, but it still doesn't show up in the start menu. New programs are added with no issue automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed all the troubleshooting steps I've found aside from a repair install:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ran the SCF in Powershell Admin, no issues found</li><li>Reinstalled windows apps thru Powershell</li><li>Deleting the start menu cache files so they are rebuilt</li><li>I've seen several people reference the http://aka.ms/diag_StartMenu/ utility, but I get redirected to the Microsoft homepage. (bad link?)</li></ul>
<p>Nothing has worked thus far. Outlook is most definitely in the folder, but is nowhere to be found in the start menu.
</p>
<p>This drives me crazy, but some of the security software on my machine makes repair installs more trouble than its worth to fix this. (requires my computer to be decrypted, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else ran into this? </p>
<p>Any other suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated. </p>

            Hi Riley
<br />
<br />The default location for Microsoft Office Shortcuts to appear in the alphabetical list of Applications on the Start Menu is (you may need to replace Office 2016):
<br />
<br />C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Microsoft Office 2016
<br />
<br />
<br />If you want to pin Outlook as a Tile to your Start Menu:
<br />Open Outlook
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />Find Outlook in the resulting Processes list, right click Outlook and choose 'Open File Location'
<br />Then right click the Outlook executable and choose 'Pin to Start'       
        </p>

<p>Thanks DaveM121.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Office 2016 Programs are in the root of programs, each listed separately. </p>
<p>I have Outlook pinned to start already, along with a few other office programs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rest of the office apps are listed in the start menu, but since I accidentally removed that shortcut, it won't show back up. It's been replaced but I can't seem to get it to populate back into the start menu.

<br />I create a new shortcut on my desktop, then drag that shortcut into this folder
<br />
<br />C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs

<br />It instantly appears in the alphabetical list on the Start Menu . . .

            I've been tolerating since August but figured it was worth a short to ask the forums. I appreciate you taking the time to look, Dave. Out of curiosity, what build of windows 10 are you running? I'm guessing this issue may be build related, but I'm stuck
 on this build (1607) until our admins update it.

    <title>Downloading Any .zip File or Program Causes Crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jondan7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Downloading Any .zip File or Program Causes Crash </h2>
                    
<p>1) Sometimes when a download completes with a .zip file, immediately after Internet Explorer 'windows' start violently loading about 2/sec., some white, some black. Now there is no mouse so no task manager or start menu or ability to restart. There is only
 power off or unplug, rest, start again in safe mode.</p>
<p>2) Sometimes if the download completes without the above immediate action, I will go to my download file in Windows Explorer and if&nbsp;the named file.zip is there successfully, then&nbsp;left click just to highlight it or right click to click open, the same frenzy
 described above starts again.</p>
<p>Now, what I did notice as the window loading started, was after clicking to highlight this .zip file, what should happen on the Explorer tool bar is the word 'Extract'&nbsp;appears. Well, I get the Internet Explorer e icon instead. That's when I knew I'm in Big
 Trouble. If you don't touch the file with the mouse, then try clicking the drop arrow next to the Internet Explorer e on the toolbar, the loading frenzy will start and continue until power off. This is of course not just one .zip file, as I've tried a dozen
 different one now in the past week or so.&nbsp;I have no malware or virus. Where would this type of problem be located? &nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>If that doesn’t help, then try uninstalling and reinstalling the games.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As the issue is only with HP games, you may get in touch with HP for further assistance.<br />

<h2>            WHS 2011 Connector Fails with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My PCs working perfectly with my WHS 2011&nbsp; server even when running release 1 of Windows 10 with the connector functioning under across my 'estate of PCs'. The Vista portable, upgraded to 7 and then to&nbsp; Windows 10 originally without without problems,&nbsp; and
 several other Windows 7 PCs updated to the first release of Windows 10 again without issue. So why does the November refresh of Windows 10 mess up the connector software requiring a re-install of the software thus disconnecting the new back ups from the original
 sequence of back ups?</p>
<p>Is this some punishment for using MS software?</p>

                    No idea how this forum lark works? but ille give it a go! i was playing with the sound effects on my win 7, home premium, realtek HD audio manager, i thought i had put it all back to default settings? then i put some music on to find that at exactly 50,
 half way, the volume went&nbsp;really&nbsp;quiet on my cheapo pc speakers &amp; it is hissing in the background? ive probably missed something really obvious! has anyone else had this problem &amp; fixed it?

            <p>Hi Nicholas,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I will help you with this audio issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>2.Which security software is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1.</b></p>
<p><b>Open the Playing Audio troubleshooter</b>:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2.</b></p>
<p>If the changes were made recently, then you can try a system restore and check.</p>
<p>
<b><span>System Restore</span></b><span>:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/system-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/system-restore</span></a></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span> System Restore will not revert any of the non-system files like documents, email, music, etc. to a previous state. These
 types files are completely unaffected by System Restore. If your intention with this tool was to recover a deleted non-system file, try using a
</span><span>file recovery program</span><span> instead of System Restore.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try these steps and let us know the status.</span></p>
<span>Thanks.</span>

            Hiya Srimadhwa B, its all working correctly now! i tried the troubleshooter &amp; this found no faults? I thought i would just go through the settings on the Realtek HD audio once more before doing a system restore &amp; i found i had changed a setting that didn't
 go back with default settings? i had selected AC 97 front panel instead of HD audio front panel! It just goes to show, a little&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;is dangerous! &amp; i still have a LOT to learn! Thank you for your time though, ime sure our&nbsp;paths&nbsp;will cross again.

<h2>            Bad header pool error Windows 10</h2>
                    I was working on my hp when I left he room for no more than 5 mins. I came back to a black screen. I couldn't wake the computer up so I restarted the hp. At restart I got a blue screen saying there was an error and that after gathering crash information
 computer would restart. The error was bad_pool_header. The computer shut down and started to reboot but the screen is still black and I suspect that it didn't reboot because I didn't hear it do so. The power button is lit up but I can't tell if it's actually
 on. No menu comes up for repairs. After the blue screen I just can't get he computer to turn on. I tried reboot several times. I really do need help

    <title>windows 7 64 bit stuck on Windows Resume Loader screen on Toshiba - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows 7 64 bit stuck on Windows Resume Loader screen on Toshiba Satellite T-135</h2>
                    <p>When I power on the laptop,&nbsp;it sticks on a&nbsp;black screen titled "Windows Resume Loader" (in reverse video).&nbsp; The title is followed by white text on the black screen:&nbsp; "The last attempt to resume the system from its previous location failed.&nbsp; Attempt to resume
 again?"</p>
<p>Then there is an instruction to "use the arrow keys to highlight your choice".&nbsp; Then the choice of:&nbsp; "Continue with system resume" or "Delete restoration data and proceed to system boot menu".</p>
<p>This happened a couple of days ago - I removed, rested, then replaced the battery and startup went normally.&nbsp; Today, it will not.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Today I tried pressing F8 repeatedly, to start in safe mode, but it has no effect.&nbsp; The "WIndows Resume Loader" screen remains.</p>
<p>(I do not use the laptop daily.&nbsp; In the past week or so, I did install a Windows 7 - 64 update that was rather large.&nbsp; I also installed a PDF update.&nbsp; I do install the security guard updates.)</p>
<p>I have not found an answer on this Microsoft site, or others.</p>
<p>?</p>

            <p>Hello Judith,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like the data that Windows is using to resume itself may be corrupt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we choose the second option- "Delete restoration data and proceed to system boot menu" then it will delete that resume data and proceed as if we are on a normal boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if that helps.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Matthew_Ha</p>
