<h2>            Find My Device - Notification alert upon next use</h2>
                    The Microsoft Windows feature to Find my device is very useful in recovery of a lost or stolen laptop.&nbsp; However it could be days, weeks or longer before the device is online.&nbsp; The feature requires that you refresh the Microsoft.com&nbsp;website in order to
 see updated activity.&nbsp; The ability to mark the device as lost or stolen and thereby
<strong>Notify</strong> you immediately when the device becomes online would be pivotal for actual recovery.&nbsp; &nbsp;Come on Microsoft; an upgrade to your online system would be easy to implement.&nbsp; Amazed that over the past decade that such a simple notification
 alert wouldn't have already been made.&nbsp; &nbsp;Please consider this tactical, very useful upgrade to account.microsoft.com.

            You can reactivate as many times as needed, but you can't install Windows on more computers then allowed.<br />

<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>﻿If you purchase one (1) retail Windows 7 edition, you may install and activate just one (1) installation at a time. You will need to buy a second license/key to activate a second Windows 7 installation
 at the same time. There is no discount on a second license if you already have a license.
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
<span>Windows 7 includes a 32 and 64 bit disk - you can only have one installed per key.</span></p>

<h3> kiran castellino  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows cannot access Windows Explorer</h2>
                    My computer recently had troubles with one of the user accounts, giving a '<span><font><span>The User Profile Service failed the logon. User profile

Not wanting to play around with the registry, I followed Method 2 in the following help&nbsp;article:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947215</a>. This has mostly worked, with the only problem
 so far being that the computer can't find the Windows Explorer (the file manager part). The shell works fine (oddly enough). The error basically says that it cannot find the program.</span></font></span>

    <title>Bluetooth not working on Surface Pro 4 after recent Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rezwan kabir  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth not working on Surface Pro 4 after recent Windows 10 update in July 2017</h2>
                    <p>Okay chronological occurrences and status given in order below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Regular Windows 10 update on my Surface Pro 4 yesterday (July 24, 2017)</p>
<p>- I noticed that the Bluetooth option from the Action Center has gone missing. But I take no further action at this point.</p>
<p>- I tried to connect my Microsoft Arc Touch Bluetooth Mouse but it doesn't work.</p>
<p>- I ask Cortana to activate my Bluetooth and she responds by saying that it is active; however there is still no response from the mouse.</p>
<p>- I go to the Bluetooth &amp; Other Devices Tab in Settings to see what's up and if needed remove and reinstall my Bluetooth devices. It was here that I first noticed that not only was it saying that my Bluetooth was turned off on Surface Pen and Arc Touch Mouse
 (no change to my Surface Type Cover), but also the option to remove the devices are not available (but available on the Surface Cover).</p>
<p>- I ran the troubleshooter for the Bluetooth, only to have the response that "Device does not have Bluetooth";&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So,</p>
<p>Basically after this update, Bluetooth is no longer working/available on my Surface. (Quite a remarkable update that takes away Bluetooth functionality from a device).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else had this problem?</p>
<p>If so, how did you resolve it? Did you roll back the update? Or is there some other way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or advice regarding this will be highly appreciated.</p>

            On my Surface Pro 2017, I discovered my bluetooth action button went missing as well.&nbsp; Disconnecting my Surface from the Surface Pro 4 dock and rebooting brought the action button back along with the ability to turn on/off Bluetooth.&nbsp; Before disconnecting,
 Bluetooth devices were ghosted in Device Manager.

    <title>please help,,strange icon overlays windows7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kolobyyyyhaynessss  say:</h3>
<h2>            please help,,strange icon overlays windows7</h2>
                    Not sure exactly when or how but suddenly all my desktop icons have weird "overlays" on them. The associated program icons are still there,but there is also a "strange" overlay. Kinda like the the program shortcut has lost its path. When I reboot, the
 icons are fine,but within a couple seconds the others appear again as well. &nbsp;I can change the icon via properties but the "other"keeps showing up again. Rebuilding the icon cache had no effect. Right clicking my desktop shows everything is how it should be
 as far as the views are concerned. Its not really the icon issue that concerns me, obviously its an eye sore, but I try to keep my system PRISTINE, so the underlying cause is what im concerned about. The last program I installed is Bit defender 2013. Thanks
 in advance for any help you can offer.

Here is the strange icon I have on my laptop. I cannot delete it or move it in my trash bin...&nbsp; I cannot right click on it.. I can move it around the desktop and when I move it to trash bin it stays on top of the trash icon. I've restarted my computer many
 times as this strange icon reappears on startup.&nbsp; I am running window 7 and this icon has been on my desktop for about 6 months now... I would love to have it removed.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
I've once seen a very similar icon which was connected to an application named Salesforce for Outlook..<br />
<br />
Perhaps that helps...<br />

            Hello Julia,<br />
<br />
I did a search in my computer "Salesforce" but didn't find anything unfortunately.... It normally appears in the upper top-left corner of my screen.. I am able to move it around if I grab it just right in the middle of that icon, however I cannot right click
 it nor move it to trash bin.&nbsp; Double clicking it does nothing either.. Just plain strange and just wondering if it's some sort of virus...??
<br />
<br />
So far it seems to not effect anything to my knowledge... Any other info you can provide about this would be appreciated..!<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            You could check what processes are run at startup. Most useful is the little tool Autoruns. How to use it, is described here:

http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/windows-and-office/quick-tip-manage-the-autorun-process-in-windows-7-with-sysinternals-autoruns/</a>&nbsp; Let's see if that helps.<br />
<br />
To be on the safe side, you might want to download and run a FULL scan with free Malwarebytes Anti-Malware:

            What do the overlaid icons look like?&nbsp; I have been getting overlays, sometimes an image of an audio speaker, sometimes a camera, sometimes something that looks like the international "do not enter" sign. I thought they might have had something to do with
 Carbonite, but they say no.

            Hi culeskoekemoer, the Windows Update has probably installed an incompatible driver for your Printer . . .
<br />
<br />Unplug the Printer
<br />
<br />Download the drivers fro your Printer from the page below
<br />
<br />Begin the installation, then when asked to, connect the printer
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.samsungdrivers.net/samsung-m2675f-driver/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.samsungdrivers.net/samsung-m2675f-dr...</a>
<br />
<br />That should get the printer working for you . . .

<h2>            Microsoft Fix it 50323 - Windows Vista exeplorer.exe problem</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
After "Microsoft Fix it 50323" was installed automatically in my system, my computer's Explorer.exe has stopped working.
<br />
Everytime I try to open a folder, My Computer, Control Panel, the window pops-ups and then closes. If I start the computer in safe mode it works normally. The first time the update was installed I used the system restore and it fixed, but then it installed
 again and this time the restore is not working.<br />
The IE was also affected as it does not load the homepage.<br />
<br />
Could you please assist me?<br />
<br />
I have to remind you that only through safe mode I am able to open Control Panel, Windows Update, Programs and Features, and so on...

            <span>Hi,</span><br />
<span>I tried everything suggested and nothing helped.</span><br />
<br />
<span>As I said previoulsy, very time I try to open the Windows Explorer (Winkey+E or through Start menu), My Documents, Control Panel or any other folder the "window" flashes as it would load and it closes. Then, if I try to open again just by clicking
 Start / Computer (for example) it doesn't allow me to click, it looks "frozen". So I have to open the task manager and end "explorer.exe" and then create new task "explorer".</span><br />
<br />
<span>If I start the computer in safe mode, the explorer and all other folders it runs normally.</span><br />
<br />
<span>I tried to reregister the entries as you suggested and it messed my right-click menu, besides that there was one of the commands returned an error (msshsq.dll)</span><br />
<br />
<span>Again, the problem appeared after "Microsoft Fix it 50323" was installed.</span><br />
<br />
<span>By the way, I'm only able to exchange messages with you because I'm using "Google chrome", because the IE was also affected by this problem.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Thank you,</span><br />

            <p>Lets see what's happening with that file that didn't register. It's probably corrupt. So test hardware and verify files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Standard Hardware Troubleshooting</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>First lets test what hardware we can. Hardware faults can appear as many software faults, therefore we need to test hardware first..</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Please do the following in order. Memory faults can cause disk corruption, disk faults can cause disk corruption. Disk corruption causes corrupted files (which SFC may be able to fix). If you get an hardware error stop and post back.
<strong>Do not run chkdsk with faulty memory</strong>.</p>
<div><font>&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Memory Diagnostic</strong></div>
<div>If you haven't run a memory diagnostic then please do so. Click <em>Start</em> -
<em>Control Panel</em> - choose <em>Classic View</em> in left hand pane - choose <em>
Administrative Tools</em> -&nbsp; then<em>&nbsp;Memory Diagnostics Tool</em>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>S.M.A.R.T</strong></div>
<div><em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;(or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disk drives in Windows monitor themselves for impending failure.&nbsp;The feature is&nbsp;called S.M.A.R.T. It will detect impending&nbsp;failure&nbsp;30% of the time.&nbsp;In an elevated command prompt type (it's one line)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><em>wmic /namespace:\\root\wmi PATH MSStorageDriver_FailurePredictStatus get active,predictfailure,reason /format:List</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it's on Active will be true, if not on turn it on in the computer's BIOS.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Predict Failure should be False if everything's ok.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In Vista and later if SMART predicts failure Windows prompts the user to run Backup.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Run Chkdsk</strong></div>
<div>In <em>Computer</em> right click all your drives and choose <em>Properties</em>, then
<em>Tools</em> tab, then click <em>Check Now</em>. Tick <strong>BOTH</strong> checkboxes then Start. Reboot. This will take overnight.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>SFC</strong></div>
<div>Check for file corruption by clicking <em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click
<em>Command Prompt</em> and choose <em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;(or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>sfc /scannow</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Heat</strong></div>
<div><font>Heat can cause problems like this and also sudden reboots without crashing. Ensure your fans are not clogged with dust.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>For Memory Diagnostic Results</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Click <em>Start</em> - <em>Control Panel</em> (and select <em>Classic</em> view in the left hand pane) choose
<em>Administrative Tools</em> then <em>Event Viewer </em>then look at <em>Event Viewer (Local) - Applications and Services - Microsoft - Windows - MemoryDiagnostic-Results</em> for entries.</div>

                    Hello there,<br />
<br />
I just recently reformatted my computer and I am having some issues getting blue screen 0x3B errors at random times (during windows update restart, when im not even at my computer, etc. I have updated all my video card drivers and everything.
<br />
Can anyone help me along with the troubleshooting? <br />

<p><strong>1.</strong> Check with Nvidia Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask about known issues
<br />
in their forums. Update the Nvidia video driver. If there are no newer it may be necessary to revert
<br />
back to an older stable driver&nbsp;version.<br />

<br />
-------------</p>
<p><br />
<strong>2A.</strong> Check ASUStek Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known<br />
issues. Check for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board device drivers.<br />
<br />
BiosVersion = 1602&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
BiosReleaseDate = 12/14/2010 &lt;- check for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major
<br />
on-board and separate device drivers.<br />
SystemManufacturer = System manufacturer<br />
SystemProductName = System Product Name<br />
BaseBoardManufacturer = ASUSTeK Computer INC.<br />
BaseBoardProduct = P7P55D-E PRO<br />
BaseBoardVersion = Rev 1.xx<br />
<br />
<strong>2B.</strong> Also check for update to the major separate device drivers&nbsp;- run DriverView - set VIEW ot Hide Microsoft<br />
drivers - update those without Dump in their names (see driver update methods in the troubleshooters below).<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Check the memory very thoroughly - keep in mind that the tests do not catch all errors such as tiny speed<br />
differences between what appears to be identical modules. Faster memory always has to be in front of slower<br />
memory so it may be necessary to swap the modules in and out in different combinations and patterns. See the<br />
memory testing methods in the troubleshooter below.<br />
<br />
------------</p>
<p><br />
<strong>4.</strong> Check the hard drive - run checkdisk and SFC /scannow.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; CMD&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />

============================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong></p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p><strong><span><span>Hi bulletboys89,</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>1. Do you have issues when you play other type of files (.asf, .wma, .wmv, .wm)?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Are you able to hear sound when you other application to play music?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Do you get any error message?<br />
<br />
4. Have you made any changes on your computer?<br />
</span><strong><br />
<span>Step 1:<br />
</span></strong><span>Try using the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter to fix the problem. The troubleshooter checks the configuration and network settings for Windows Media Player to make sure that you
 can play content you've downloaded and saved to your computer, or content streaming over a network or the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a. Open the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel.</span></span></p>
<p><span>b. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Click View all, and then click Windows Media Player Settings.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Open the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter</strong><br />
</span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-Settings-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-Settings-troubleshooter</span></a></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>However, if you have installed any Codec’s, try uninstalling the same and see if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>You can use Programs and Features to uninstall programs or to change the program's configuration by adding or removing certain options.</span></p>
<p><span>Uninstall or change a program:<br />

<p><span>Once you test this try re-installing the codec’s back and check again for the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.<br />
</span><strong><span>Regards, <br />

<h2>            File History&#58; When is &#34;Every Hour&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am configuring File History on my Windows 10 machine. &nbsp;And while it does work and did run earlier in the day (or rather, morning), it is set to run every hour and it has not run since. &nbsp; If I manually run it everything runs as expected. &nbsp;However, it is
 not running at every hour and I am wondering why this could be?</p>

</p><p>OK... File History is actually working like a CHAMP now... very happy with it. &nbsp;There IS one small problem, which did lead me to this post. &nbsp;The time presented in the Control Panel is not the same/accurate as the last time it actually ran:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a screenshot of what I am seeing:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am indeed thinking that a reboot might be in order (I am in the middle of a lengthy operation currently so cannot do that just yet), but wanted to throw this your way to see what you thought.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the exact issue that you are facing? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT (HKCR) key contains file name extension associations and COM class registration information such as ProgIDs, CLSIDs, and IIDs. It is primarily intended for compatibility with the registry in 16-bit Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the simplest terms possible, the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT registry hive contains the information necessary so Windows knows what to do when you ask it to do something, like view the contents of a drive, or open a certain type of file, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may not be able to delete the registry files without changing the permissions. Deleting the registry keys are not recommended until and unless if the troubleshooting demands it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide more information so that we could help you further. </p>

            the point is, I cannot change persmission, and even "system" does not have any permission. Because this it is suspect. The "creator" only has a permission, but I can't see what/who is the creator. I suspect it is a key from an unwanted program or unwanted
 program feature, as it does not relate to any hardware or software I've installed.<br />

There are many keys like this. Just because you cannot touch them does not mean that they are placed there by malware.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            if I cannot identify an entry, analyse to what is is related, and I also cannot change permission or delte it, I also can NOT be sure that it is not part of an unwanted operation or identification.<br />
<br />
In this case the more, as I did not had it until ~ 4 weeks ago. it is new, and because that it is not made from a regular program installation I had done or something of hardware.<br />
<br />
In general: I do NOT allow any one to install on my comp things that I cannot control or minimum which I cannot identify.<br />
<br />
I'm not so naive to believe any programmer or company being trustwothy anyways. There are lot of commercial and political issues why also "serious" companies want to spy and monitor. The range is wide, starts i.e. at TerreTec TV which opens silently an own
 port in firewall, not detected by most anti spamware or anti virus programs, except&nbsp; Spybot S&amp;D,&nbsp; or HP's features, or Sony's etc. etc.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying with the status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see if there is any unwanted programs&nbsp;or to remove, you may visit <strong>programs and features</strong> in control panel. Uninstalling the program from this list would automatically remove the registry keys.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Uninstall or change a program</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The permission could be with&nbsp;certain programs and we cannot delete it from the registry as it might cause serious problems.

            Just a side note - maybe it's known. Some registry values contains null values to be protected against modification - and also some registry keys can't be changed from a regular user.<br />
<br />
There are two approaches, that may be tested.<br />
<br />
a) You can try <em>PsExec.exe -s -i regedit </em>within an<em> </em>administrative console, to run regedit under System account permission. Maybe it allows you to access the registry entry<br />
<br />
b) you can check the registry for null entries, that prevents alterations of entries.<br />
<br />
PsExec.exe and RedDelNull are part of <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/de-de/sysinternals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Maybe it's helpful.<br />

<p>Only the owner can change permissions on some objects.&nbsp; Howeverr the System Administrator and SYSTEM, both should have the "Take ownership" priviledge.&nbsp; This allows you to becomet he owner of an object so that you can then set the permissions as you wish<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the key has had 'null' bytes put in the name so you cannot access the key through the Win32 interface.&nbsp; Programs can do this by using the underlying NT calls that Windows is based on.&nbsp; If you want to remove those... search on
 'regdelnull.exe' on the MS sysinternals site.&nbsp; It runs in cmd.exe and can remove such problems.<br />

                    <p>I wish you guys would quit messing around with solitaire.&nbsp; every time there's an upgrade, it seems, something about solitaire and the way it plays changes. don't you guys have anything more constructive to do? now, on just about every game I've played today, the red suits of a given number / face card have been following directly after each other in the deck.&nbsp; this is happening much more often than statistically likely.&nbsp; what's up with this noise? and no, I'm not imagining this, so don't go saying I'm confused.</p>
