<h2>            photogallery  stops working</h2>
                    <p>MY brand-new computer has Windows 7 - which I have always loved.</p>
<p>PC Mover even managed to migrate all of my Window Live Mail archives (79000).</p>
<p>However PHOTO GALLERY did not migrate and &nbsp;I tried reinstalling Windows Essentials 2012 - partially at first,
</p>
<p>then the entire ESSENTIALS 2012,</p>
<p>then I &nbsp;"repaired" essentials in the PROGRAMS AND FEATURES.</p>
<p>then I uninstalled everything except LIVE MAIL,</p>
<p>then I reinstalled Essentials 2012.........</p>
<p>The very aggravating and puzzling problem persists: Photo Gallery stops working, but what stumps me as well: Photo Gallery tries to show ALL of my photos....aInd I have MANY.</p>
<p>I LOVE photo Gallery and find it far less complicated than other photo editing programs.</p>
<p>I have scanned all the other questions and answers on this subject.</p>
<p>Can you offer anything new?</p>
<p>I am sqeamish about deleting ALL of ESSENTIALS, including the huge mail archive in LIVE MAIL because I cannot afford to loose that.</p>
<p>THANK YOU for your efforts!</p>

            <p>Hello Amrita, I performed more than one CLEAN boot, but PHOTO GALLERY resists.</p>
<p>It will not edit - immediately stops</p>
<p>It will not import - immediately stops</p>
<p>If I merely want to open Photo Gallery and click to OPEN, then the new window ALWAYS shows VIDEOS...however I deleted all videos yesterday....immediately stops working</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my previous email to you I wrote that I uninstalled Windows Essentials 2012.</p>
<p>Reinstalled ALL files....PhotoGallery stops running</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I reinstalled only Photo Gallery.....then I REPAIRED all files in ESSENTIALS....all no use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I have given you more clues to help</p>

            <p>HEllo Amrita,</p>
<p>Here is an update to the continuing problems with Photo Gallery:</p>
<p>Periodically there was a message that Photo Gallery could not open any videos - I did not want to look at any videos.</p>
<p>Before Photo Gallery stopped I was able to find and delete some small videos among my pictures. It took several attempts, but now there are no more videos among my photos.</p>
<p>However, now Photo Gallery wants to open ALL (16000+) photos. Clearly this is an overload.</p>
<p>But how do I STOP Photo Gallery from trying to select ALL the photos?</p>

            <p>Hi PA BEAR,</p>
<p>This is a brand-new - from China - Probook Notebook G2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked the ICON in the taskbar. In the old computer this opened the photoGallery with perhaps the last photo file I was working on.....Or I opted to import from the camera chip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THis new computer came without any photoediting program. I felt lucky to find information and downloaded WINDOWS ESSENTIALS 2012 selecting only PHOTOGALLERY, since My WIndows LIVE emails were migrated to the new computer via PC MOVER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WINDOWS LIVE stopped working for me years ago, but I use it to archive 70000 emails "from the beginning of time".</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the moment that I downloaded Photogallery to the new computer I had this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;One time ONLY there was a message about VIdeos. I only had 5 of those...they were accidentals from the camera.</p>
<p>I deleted all.</p>
<p>But the window looked the same: on the left side ALL options were greyed and it seemed that PhotoGallery was trying to open every file, folder and Photo (16500+) in the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact the message "not working" comes on on nearly at the same time PhotoGallery &nbsp;opens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled Windows Essesntials, reinstalled ALL, Uninstalled All, installed PhotoGalleryonly , REPAIRED photoGallery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid to delete My 79000 emails archived in LIVE, because I cannot afford to lose them.</p>
<p>I hope the answer does not lie in deleting EVERYTHING in WIndows Essentials including LIVE MAIL and starting over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I LOVED the way PhotoGallery worked for me, easily resizing or cropping or importing.</p>
<p>I miss that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT PHOTOGALLERY ALLOWS!! is to select a photo from My PICTURES, right click to open it...in Photo Gallery. THen I can copy and paste it back into the folder.....and resize the copy in a different photo editing software.....then save it back into MY PICTURES.</p>
<p>IT will not allow me to EDIT a photo....some message about CODEC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am allowed to VIEW all photos in a file with PhotoGallery, buy clicking "next arrow".</p>
<p>Long-winded explanation....I hope I gave enough information.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Wrong icons in start menu</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, and in my start menu some icons are PNG instead of the right one:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.eldalie.it/mrn_windows_settings.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens also for calculator; I have to check if other icons are affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens just when I search for the apps, in apps list ("All apps" in start menu) the icons are right.</p>

                    <p>I am reformatting a computer to clean it off before upgrading.&nbsp; The computer boots to the "choose windows installation" screen and lists Windows XP professional (which is the correct OS) and 2 different XP Home versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went into MSCONFIG and the boot.ini file and removed the two other Home versions.&nbsp; I then restarted and the Selective Startup warning pops up.&nbsp; I then went back into MSCONFIG and tried to go back to Normal Startup but it reverts my Boot.ini back to its
 original state with the 2 faulty Home OS's.&nbsp; </p>

<p>How do I get out of Selective Startup and keep my boot.ini changes?</p>

            I did the thing which you told me. But, I am still facing the same problem(PC still restarts automatically). The problem is being faced by me only in some of the videos, not all.
<br />
Also my drivers are up to date.

<h2>            Notifications and split screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2 subject matters above please bring it back as it is really helpful in getting alerts for new messages stay on the bottom of the task bar and also the option to have a split screen was wonderful.&nbsp; Now it's annoying that once the brief new message pops
 up, it disappears and if you stepped away you wouldn't know you received one unless you open the whole program.&nbsp; Also, the split screen helped in the previous version,&nbsp; you don't have to open the whole messaging with the names in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please bring these back</p>
<p>

    <title>Replacement Elite Controller Right Trigger Vibration not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rich ayz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Replacement Elite Controller Right Trigger Vibration not working</h2>
                    
<p>I received my first Elite Controller and went to vibration settings. Changed the trigger vibrations down quite a bit. Went back into the settings minutes later and the right trigger vibration would not work. Reinstalled the app, same thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm a preview program member, but did not think that this could be affecting the controller so I sent the controller back as faulty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I ordered replacement from a completely different retailer and I have exactly the same problem.</p>

<p>Is the controller broken or is a software issue? Please can someone help me with this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else.
<br />If it doesn't allow you to rename - Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update, SFC etc)

    <title>Win7 explorer freezing and weird behavior, as well as other issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Win7 explorer freezing and weird behavior, as well as other issues</h2>
                    <font color="#070f14"><span>Hello everyone,&nbsp;</span></font>
<div><font color="#070f14"><span><br />
</span></font></div>
<div><font color="#070f14"><span>These problems started happening maybe several months ago. I don't really use this laptop that often, so I have no idea what could of caused this. I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit. Here are a list of the problems that are
 occuring.</span></font></div>
<div><font color="#070f14"><span><br />
</span></font></div>
<div><font color="#070f14"><span>1. &nbsp;If I press computer in the start menu, it ‚Äúfreezes.‚Äù It continually searches for drives but the blue wheel keeps spinning and nothing shows up even after 10 minutes. So far I've only noticed this with Computer, I can just
 press Documents from the start menu, and it instantly loads, and then click on the drive and go to where I want to go.&nbsp;</span></font></div>
<div><font color="#070f14"><span><br />
</span></font></div>
<div><font color="#070f14"><span>2. &nbsp;Sometimes a window will freeze for no reason. If I right click a file or folder in that window, it will always freeze that window. I have tried to right click a folder in 5 separate windows and it froze every one of them.
 Doesn't matter where the file location is, it can happen to any window. By freeze I mean the same spinning blue wheel, and the window cannot be moved or won‚Äôt respond ever again (I've left the window for hours and it never unfreezes).The only way to fix this
 is to end explorer.exe in the task manager and restart it, but that doesn't prevent it from happening again.&nbsp;</span></font></div>
<div><font color="#070f14"><span><br />
</span></font></div>
<div><font color="#070f14"><span>3. &nbsp;Some icons like text documents will look like a blank page with its upper right corner folded. Resetting the icon cache fixed this. On my desktop, currently my text documents and VLC player are missing their normal icons,
 replaced by this blank page.&nbsp;</span></font></div>
<div><font color="#070f14"><span><br />
</span></font></div>
<div><font color="#070f14"><span>4. &nbsp;In the column in the far left of the explorer window (the one that lists your library, and your drives), when I right click one of the libraries (like Documents or Pictures) the window will freeze. If I right click one of
 my drives (like C: ), the right click menu will come up, but when I click properties, the properties window won't come up ever.&nbsp;</span></font></div>
<div><font color="#070f14"><span><br />
</span></font></div>
<div><font color="#070f14"><span>5. &nbsp;Probably unrelated, but I just wanted to post this anyway. I'm also having an issue with Chrome. If I open a new Chrome window or a new tab and search something in the omnibox, sometimes the tab will never load. It‚Äôs just
 not that website. Anything I type into the particular tab will not load. Some tabs will load, others will not load (the circle in the tab will keep spinning and the page will be forever blank). So for instance, if I open 3 tabs and make them all go to the
 same site (for instance youtube.com) usually one of them will not load YouTube while the other load the site right away. If I go to the tab that isn't load YouTube, and type another site or search in the omnibox, it won't load that either. I know this isn‚Äôt
 an issue with my network because the same thing happens sometimes if I try to open settings or extensions in a new tab (which doesn't require internet to open). I‚Äôve uninstalled and reinstalled Chrome twice and the issue persists.&nbsp;</span></font></div>

 it shows up as disk 3.&nbsp;</font></div>

</font></div>
<div><font color="#323232">If that's the case, then it's a USB controller error? Don't see how an external hard drive error could be affecting Windows Explorer. I was told I may have a bad motherboard if it's a controller issue, but I'm not 100% sure if that's
 the case. My Windows installation may be corrupt. That DLLHost.exe application error looks pretty ominous.&nbsp;</font></div>

            <div>Apologies for the triple post, but I thought I'd just record my progress of getting to the bottom of this, and for when someone sees this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Well, unfortunately I have to report that I haven't had my external drive plugged in since yesterday, and I've been using my computer today without it. Just now though, explorer froze again when I clicked Computer (just the wheel spinning and not listing
 the drives). Also right click is freezing again. The only drive error that was recorded in the event viewer was for my external drive. But it isn't even plugged in and I'm still having issues with explorer. So I don't think that it's a faulty drive controller
 that's causing this anymore.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The only two errors I got today were:</div>
<div><br />
<div>The server {995C996E-D918-4A8C-A302-45719A6F4EA7} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.</div>
<div><br />
<div>and this warning:</div>
<div><br />
<div>The content source &lt;csc://{S-1-5-21-4101250725-296594027-3050616062-1000}/&gt; cannot be accessed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Context: &nbsp;Application, SystemIndex Catalog</div>
<div><br />
<div>Details:</div>
<div>The object was not found. &nbsp;(HRESULT : 0x80041201) (0x80041201)</div>
<div><br />
<div>A restart will temporarily fix this issue with explorer, but I still don't know what is causing it. The only drive error that was recorded in the event viewer was for my external drive. So I don't think that it's a faulty drive controller that's causing
 this anymore. So, this is possibly related. Someone told me to look at the Raw Read Error Rate and the Ultra DMA CRC Error Rate on my drives. My mSATA and my HDD all report raw values of 000000000000, but my Vertex 4 SSD reports this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>[img]http://i.imgur.com/tNdZsu7.jpg[/img]</div>
<div><br />
<div>Don't know what that 000000000006 means for a drives Raw Read Error Rate. Also, the Vertex 4 is missing a lot of readings and even it's temperature compared to another one of my drives:</div>
<div><br />
<div>[img]http://i.imgur.com/w1ULNeE.jpg[/img]</div>
<div><br />
<div>I know that it doesn't have a sensor so that's why it can't read temps, but not sure why it has so little readings too. Despite what it says, I have never run into a problem with my Vertex 4. I have games and some non-vital programs on the drive, and I
 haven't ever had the slightest hiccup.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now that my first guess has been proven false, I'm not really sure where to go with this. Any ideas? Thank you!</div>

            <p>The Flxhcic.sys was tied to a new USB 3.0 card that was installed before the start of the BSOD. If you look at my info on OneDrive you will see that that card was removed, annd the drivers removed. I did try the latest drvers for that product prior to removing
 the card completely. &nbsp;Verifier now crashes on boot up with no specified associated driver named.&nbsp; Please refer to the dumps from the last day or two. I had a crash today when noone was on the machine and it was idle. I will sendthat dmp file tonight.&nbsp; Also,
 Overnight I did run MemEtest86 for 15 hours with no errors reported.</p>

            <p>I am trying very hard to maintain my cool as well. I supplied (uploaded) every bit of info that they typically request on my very first post. Typically they ask for the last 30 days of dump files, which is what I supplied. I assumed someone would look at
 all of them before offering solutions. I also included a system description text file which included details regarding system hardware changes, as well as driver updates that have already been done. &nbsp;What I got from Vinodh_Kumar V was a knee jerk response
 based on looking at a few dump files.&nbsp; Hopefully later responders will be more helpful. I also pondered the "Screen Shot of a BSOD".</p>

<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong>Do not use device manager it may tell you the device is up to date but will not tell you if it is corrupt&nbsp;</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><strong>Search</strong> Google for the name of the driver, or go to the computer makers site.</div>
<div><span><br />
<strong>Compare</strong> the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to<br />
<strong>Visit</strong> the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).<br />
If there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program<br />
<br />
The most common drivers are listed on these pages:&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Surface Pro, Surface Dock &#38; Surface HDMI Adapter - NO TV VOLUME, HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have brand new Microsoft Surface Pro with Windows 10.</p>
<p>I have brand new Microsoft&nbsp;Surface Dock.</p>
<p>I have brand new Microsoft&nbsp;Surface Mini DP to HDMI Adapter.</p>
<p>I have brand new 4K HDMI cable made by Wirelogic that are 18GB, HDCP 2.2, HDR, ultra HD.</p>
<p>I have 7rs old 1080p Samsung LED TV that does volume with my Acer Laptop with the above HDMI cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When all connected, video works great but no audio from TV. I switch default devices back to surface pro audio and it works no problem. I have tried changing Advance audio and change to lower and higher quality, still no volume.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done all Windows Updates, all Surface Pro updates and all Surface Dock updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read you need "Active" HDMI cables. I have some on order. I also ordered a MINI DP cable as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please tell me what I'm missing?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see a need to uninstall my Intel Display Audio Driver, but people keep saying I should. Is this true?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 unexpected boot problem. Can&#39;t find answers anywhere. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> breezox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 unexpected boot problem. Can&#39;t find answers anywhere.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Last night I tried to boot my PC running Windows 10. I had been using my laptop for the last couple of days, but the last time I shut off my PC, nothing was out of the ordinary. I hadn't done anything different that day. But when I tried to boot it, it just
 gave me a black screen with a cursor I could move. Now this isn't new, so I thought I'd just wait it out. After 20 minutes nothing had happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I restarted it, and again I had to wait. So I tried multiple times, and just let it sit there. Then for some reason, the screen turned blue and the little white balls spinning showed up. I thought it had finally worked, but this took a long time as well.
 Then the welcome/login screen showed. It was pretty unresponsive. If I clicked the password box, and input my password, it took like 30 seconds before it actually responded. Anyway, I hit enter and it started to load and it said "Welcome". But now it was just
 stuck there, for an hour before I decided to shut it off completely. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried searching for the problem online, but to no avail. I tried to boot it in the Windows Recovery Environment, by resetting the computer in a consecutive streak, but nothing happened. I was just back at the black screen with cursor again. So now
 I'm desparate to know what I can do. The only option I can think of is booting from a usb or dvd, but I'd rather just boot the system in Safe Mode if possible. I've never had a boot issue since I installed Windows 10 half a year ago, so it shouldn't be related
 to the multiple problems I've seen of Windows 10 booting slow the first time it has been installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is gladly appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>restart Windows with pressing SHIFT, then choose "Shutdown".</p>
<p>Another boot will take some more time, but in my case it was OK after it.</p>

            So do you mean press the hardware restart button, while holding the SHIFT key down? Because I don't have access to a software shutdown feature.&nbsp;

            I can't access the Start Menu. That is the point. I can't get to the desktop. I can only get to the login screen after waiting for 20 minutes, and it locks up from that point on. Or maybe it is just very slow, I don't know. :(

            I finally got it to work. Just had to wait long enough for the system to boot. It was extremely slow, took me a day to get anything done, but I updated my graphics driver (which I couldn't do in safe mode for some reason) and now it runs like it used to.

<h2>            Hard disk esterno</h2>
                    
<p>Ciao a tutti, oggi mi √® capitata una cosa strana, non riuscivo ad accendere l'xbox one, andava nella schermata verde poi freezava e si riavviava, rimanendo in un loop infinito di freeze e riavvii.. dopo vari tentativi ho capito che la causa era l'hard disk
 esterno che inspiegabilmente ne causava il crash; scollegandolo l'xbox si accende normalmente, ma se poi lo collego, questa crasha e si riavvia ripetendo lo stesso problema di prima.. qualcuno sa dirmi quale potrebbe essere il problema?</p>

<p>Sembra che ci sia proprio qualche file corrotto nell'HDD esterno che causa il blocco della console.</p>
<p>In rarissimi casi potrebbe essere l'HDD rotto.</p>
<p>Per toglierti ogni dubbio... collegalo al PC e formattalo.</p>
<p>Se collegato al PC va in blocco pure quello (mi √® successo con una penna USB una volta), allora rivolgiti al negozio dove hai acquistato l'HDD per richiederne uno sostituitivo.</p>
<p>Miglior soluzione comunuque: attaccalo al pc e formattalo.</p>
<p>Perdi i giochi che dovrai riscaricare o reinstallare.</p>
<p>I salvataggi sono su internet e vengono sincronizzati ;)</p>

    <title>Theme problem in Microsoft Solitaire. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Theme problem in Microsoft Solitaire.</h2>
                    <p>I have a PC and a Surface Pro.&nbsp; I can play my Microsoft daily games on either and my progress is saved.&nbsp; I just recently encountered a problem with Solitaire where my custom theme is not recognized after I switch machines. I get an error message about my
 custom theme and it switches back to the Classic theme.&nbsp; I even tried to use another theme without customizing it and I still get an error message when I sign in after switching machines. How do I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS, this only started happening after Solitaire changed its look recently.</p>

            Yes, this was option 4. Uninstall and reinstall is always the last option. The reply by me suggested the least interfering options first and if nothing worked, it suggested uninstall and reinstall as option 4.
<br />
<br />Glad that your problem is solved. Wonderful work by you.

            <p>Hmm that was almost a month ago now. So I've done the proper thing and got rid of Windows 10 altogether. The big mistake was putting the rubbish on my pic to start with. &nbsp;I've gone back to Windows 7 as I don't have faults on there. Windows 10 was released
 much to early as usual by Microsoft to take money from the public. It was not thoroughly tested and had major problems all over it. Rendered my pic useless until I got rid of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed many others by removing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. Even though it was almost a month late.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Same issue as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Trying to reset Windows 10 to speed up an older and slower machine. No "real" issue with Windows 10 itself;&nbsp;I've found on other computers that doing a Reset after the upgrade deletes a lot of programs and&nbsp;related patches&nbsp;no longer required (noticed this
 in the Control Panel... much cleaner after a Reset versus post-upgrade which keeps everything including all the patches). In the end, the computer has fewer issues and is noticeably faster overall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Changes prior to the issue... transferred all Windows Live mail to Outlook.com / Mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of other note, I did run the 'sfc /scannow' and if I recall correctly, it found errors it could not fix.</p>

            Give this a try:
<br />Delete NGC folder and add a new PIN code
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\NGC.
<br />In NGC folder delete all the files. To do so you must be logged as Administrator.
<br />delete the temp folder within the NGC folder
<br />Now go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in Options.
<br />Click Add a PIN and add a new PIN code for your account.
<br />
<br />Now the PIN login should be working again.
<br />
<br />Switch to local account and add a PIN code
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />try to switch to local account, and the add a PIN code. Here‚Äôs how to do that:
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Accounts and locate your account.
<br />Click Sign in with a Local Account instead.
<br />Follow the instructions to set up a local account.
<br />Sign out and sign in with your local account.
<br />Now add a PIN code.
<br />After you‚Äôve added your PIN code you need to locate your account under the Accounts section in Settings.
<br />Choose Sign in with a Microsoft Account instead.
<br />
<br />That‚Äôs it, PIN login should be working now for your account

<p>Basically, all those characters that were announced as Sony exclusives (Pac-Man, bad-boxart Megaman) appear on the disc for the 360 version. Movesets, ending cutscenes and character models are all on the retail disc. This is a little different from the ME3
 situation as well as the mere fact that these characters are included for free with the PS3 version sort of nullifies &nbsp;the whole 'separate budget; argument.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Unless of course Capcom are going to unlock this stuff for free at a later date. Which would be totally cool, I guess.</p>

<p>I don't know. The way the article puts it it sounds like it's a 'timed exclusive' on PSPV and then it will get a 'free' unlock on PS3. The way they specify 'free' makes it sound very likely that 360 owners will have to pay.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>And now hackers have already enabled all 12 characters on the 360 discs. You can watch gameplay videos on youtube, but they'll get taken down quickly. DLC has become a total farce. There's no way this can be called 'additional' content.</p>

<p>Pac man? Jesus! (Not literally, as that would likely upset catholics worldwide).</p>
<p>This is typical Capcom though. Whiel the game looks promising (though 6 buttons is a nightmare for the dpad and capcom should bloody well learn this), the crap they pulled with MvC last year was the final straw for me.</p>

<p>the additional characters look crap anyway so i am not fussed. I probably wouldn't use them anyway. As i don't have a PS3 or a VITA (i'm just not rich enough) anyways i'll be buying this on 360 and it's almost here now whoo hoo i can't wait

<p>One of the extra characters is Tekken's Brian, one of my personal favourites. Series staple Jack is also locked.</p>
<p>On the SF side there's Blanka. Kind of hard to imagine a SF game without him.</p>

<p>I have to agree, the new characters are underwhelming as far as I am concerned.&nbsp; I couldn't care less if DLC was on the disc, at least this way I don't have broken DLC updates (a la Mortal Kombat) and I am not prevented from playing against people who have
 the DLC.<br />
<br />
I hope Amazon dispatches my special edition promptly this week.<br />
<br />
P.s. Az, read up on the facts before you starting spewing nonsense, only one retail disc is planned and only one retail disc will be needed.</p>

<p>The withholding of &nbsp;'on the disc info' for DLC is robbery. Quite correct. Despicable, in fact. In this case Capcom have done us (a bit) of a favour though - who really wants to play as Pac-man or Megaman? I don't!

<p>I agree with this, if it is shipped on the disc, it should not cost the customer any more. If it was an unlock code for first time buyers, fair enough. Withholding content (however rubbish) is underhand and Capcom should be ashamed of themselves.</p>

    <title>Lifecam HD-5000 Mic Issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lifecam HD-5000 Mic Issues</h2>
                    To put it simply, I have the Lifecam HD-5000 and want to use it with a separate microphone, but when I disable the onboard mic it also disables the camera, I am running Windows 7 64bit ultimate. Has anyone else encountered this problem?

            I also have this issue.&nbsp; When I set my external mic as the default mic it doesn't mute the mic on the lifecam.&nbsp; There is an odd little phone icon on the lifecam mic.&nbsp; Maybe that indicates that it will be used by skype and other such programs?&nbsp; At any rate,
 my system always uses both mics and thus people can still hear me when I mechanically mute my external mic.<br />
