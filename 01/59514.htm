<h2>            Having problems with windows update, running sfc &#47;scannow, and booting in safe mode. &#40;Vista Home Premium&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please bear with me here as I attempt to explain all of the issues I'm having with my computer right now. I'll try to explain everything as throroughly as possible, but if you need more information and/or log files to provide a more accurate solution, just
 let me know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For starters, I am running an HP Pavilion dv6000 series (dv6748us to be exact) with Windows Vista Home Premium (32-bit) installed. (Service pack 2.)&nbsp;About 6 months ago, I recovered this&nbsp;laptop from what I believe was the conflicker virus (kept redirecting
 pages, stopped updates&nbsp;and antivirus programs, etc.) and&nbsp;I managed to get&nbsp;Windows Update up and running again. My&nbsp;Help and Support wasn't working though, it was only working in Safe Mode, so I did&nbsp;some research and tried a bunch of&nbsp;suggested fixes&nbsp;(updating
 the registry, etc) and got that to work again as well. I am not sure if one of the diagnostic tools that I used while fixing Help &amp; Support might have caused&nbsp;the problems I&nbsp;am having now&nbsp;(as I literally tried everything under the sun until I got it to work),
 but my Windows Update is not functioning correctly again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, I installed some updates and restarted the computer, but the updates didn't finish installing during reboot. It said the usual "Configuring Updates, do not turn off your computer," but never showed percentage complete or anything.
 It restarted, and when I opened&nbsp;Windows Update, it said the last time I checked for updates was&nbsp;never (obviously not true), and&nbsp;when I did&nbsp;attempt to check for updates, it skipped right to the message that tells me I need to restart my computer to&nbsp;finish installing
 updates.&nbsp;It continues to do this every time I open Windows Update. Once in a while, I try to restart it, just to see if it will work, and it never does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent hours trying all of the solutions that I could find in Google.&nbsp;I tried running the System Update Readiness Tool, which seemed to run successfully (but did not solve the problem). I then tried the Fix It for Windows Update, and that didn't solve the
 problem. (It might be important for me to mention that I&nbsp;am also having problems with the Fix It Center itself, too. The individual tools like the one for Windows Update&nbsp;will run, but the Fix&nbsp;It Center&nbsp;program keeps giving me the error message&nbsp;that "A problem
 is preventing the troubleshooter from starting.") I also tried renaming the pending.xml file, then later I deleted it, after reading in&nbsp;another forum that&nbsp;renaming the file could cause system instabillity or something like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot use System Restore to fix any of my problems, because all of my earlier restore points are gone (I'm not sure if the virus wiped them out, or if the computer deleted them on it's own) but the only restore points I have stored are
 ones that were created recently, during the time I have been having these problems.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried running sfc /scannow to no avail, as it keeps telling me that there is a pending repair, but the pending repair never completes. I tried&nbsp;using the&nbsp;dism.exe/image:C\/cleanup-image&nbsp;/revertpendingactions command in the recovery center command prompt
 to stop this pending repair, and that didn't work because it claims that dism.exe does not exist/is not a valid command. No matter what I try, I cannot get this pending repair or my pending updates to complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;tried booting into Safe Mode several times as well,&nbsp;and it hangs up at crcdisk.sys while booting every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being that I cannot use system restore, sfc /scannow, or get into Safe Mode, I am truly lost as to what I should do next. I am honestly unsure if the problems are related, but I just thought it would be logical to list all of them in one place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that I do not want to re-install Windows Vista, nor do I think that&nbsp;I need to, because the computer is functioning just fine for the most part.(I am using it to type this right now). I'd much rather bring it back to full functionality on my own,
 which I believe can be achieved with the help of the right person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone could provide any suggestions/solutions for me, it would be greatly appreciated! It would certainly relieve a lot of stress for me!

            <p>Dism is a Windows&nbsp;7 thing. Start with hardware testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Standard Hardware Troubleshooting</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>First lets test what hardware we can. Hardware faults can appear as many software faults, therefore we need to test hardware first..</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Please do the following in order. Memory faults can cause disk corruption, disk faults can cause disk corruption. Disk corruption causes corrupted files (which SFC may be able to fix). If you get an hardware error stop and post back.
<strong>Do not run chkdsk with faulty memory</strong>.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Memory Diagnostic</strong></div>
<div>If you haven't run a memory diagnostic then please do so. Click <em>Start</em> -
<em>Control Panel</em> - choose <em>Classic View</em> in left hand pane - choose <em>
Administrative Tools</em> -&nbsp; then<em>&nbsp;Memory Diagnostics Tool</em>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>S.M.A.R.T</strong></div>
<div><em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;(or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disk drives in Windows monitor themselves for impending failure.&nbsp;The feature is&nbsp;called S.M.A.R.T. It will detect impending&nbsp;failure&nbsp;30% of the time.&nbsp;In an elevated command prompt type (it's one line)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><em>wmic /namespace:\\root\wmi PATH MSStorageDriver_FailurePredictStatus get active,predictfailure,reason /format:List</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it's on Active will be true, if not on turn it on in the computer's BIOS.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Predict Failure should be False if everything's ok.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In Vista and later if SMART predicts failure Windows prompts the user to run Backup.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Run Chkdsk</strong></div>
<div>In <em>Computer</em> right click all your drives and choose <em>Properties</em>, then
<em>Tools</em> tab, then click <em>Check Now</em>. Tick <strong>BOTH</strong> checkboxes then Start. Reboot. This will take overnight.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>SFC</strong></div>
<div>Check for file corruption by clicking <em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click
<em>Command Prompt</em> and choose <em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;(or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>sfc /scannow</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Heat</strong></div>
<div><font>Heat can cause problems like this and also sudden reboots without crashing. Ensure your fans are not clogged with dust.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>For Memory Diagnostic Results</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Click <em>Start</em> - <em>Control Panel</em> (and select <em>Classic</em> view in the left hand pane) choose
<em>Administrative Tools</em> then <em>Event Viewer </em>then look at <em>Event Viewer (Local) - Applications and Services - Microsoft - Windows - MemoryDiagnostic-Results</em> for entries.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>1201</strong>&nbsp;or <strong>1101</strong> and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is
<strong>MemoryDiagnostic-Results</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>Double click the entry for details on that entry.</div>
<br />
<strong>For Chkdsk Results</strong></div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Click <em>Start</em> - <em>Control Panel</em> (and select <em>Classic</em> view in the left hand pane) choose
<em>Administrative Tools</em> then <em>Event Viewer </em>then look at both the <em>
Application</em> and <em>System</em> logs (under <em>Windows Logs)</em> for entries.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Look for <em>EventID</em> is <strong>7</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>
Disk</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>11</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>Disk</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>50</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>Disk</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>51</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>Disk</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>52</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>Disk</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>55</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>NTFS</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>130</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>
NTFS</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>134</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>
NTFS</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>137</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>
NTFS</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>1001</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>
Autochk</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>1001</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>
Winlogon</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>1001</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>
WinInit</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>1001</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>
Chkdsk</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>26212</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>
Chkdsk</strong><br />
<div><font>Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>26213</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is
<strong>Chkdsk</strong><br />
Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>26214</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is <strong>
Chkdsk</strong><br />
</font></div>
<div>Double click the entry for details on that entry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>P.S. <strong>7</strong> and <strong>55</strong> are the auto repair codes where windows repairs&nbsp;disk errors silently on the fly.
<strong>52 </strong>is the SMART warning.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>For SFC Results</strong></div>
<div><em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;(or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing

<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>findstr /c:"[SR] Cannot" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log|more</em></div>

<p>1. delete your gamertag from your console (only Profile, not Content), this does not mean you lose everything related but simply means you have to redownload it by entering email and Password you are using and can possibly the solution</p>
<p>2. check your billing Information to be correct and complete</p>
<p>3. even though you are trying to redeem a code, an outstanding Balance could be what prevents you on activating this code, if neither step 1 or 2 help and you end up here, you should contact Support on phone or Chat to get this solved</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Appreciate your interest in using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform the methods provided below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Run a SFC (System File Checker) scan.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click on Start button and select “Command Prompt (Admin)”.</li><li>Type “sfc /scannow” and press Enter.</li><li>After the scan is complete, type “exit” and press Enter.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about SFC scan, click on the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: DISM TOOL:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the Search bar type “cmd”. Right Click on the Command Prompt option and select Run as Administrator. (If prompted for a password, type the password and click Allow).</li><li>Type “DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth”\</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about DISM click on the link below: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/947821</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Perform a Clean Boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install
 a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>* Place the computer in a Clean Boot and check if the issue is occurring due to any third party programs.</span></p>

    <title>Surround Sound setup correctly&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenji san  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surround Sound setup correctly&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased a Sony <span>BDV-E780W for surround sound.&nbsp; I like the system but I can't tell if I have the surround sound working correctly (mostly because i've never owned a surround sound system). &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br />
Basically, I have my 360 running to my receiver (HDMI), and the receiver runs to the TV (HDMI).&nbsp; As of now, I don't know if I need to get a optical cable as well. &nbsp;&nbsp; I have the settings for audio set to Dolby Digital 5.1</p>
<p>I probably didn't provide all the necessary information, so let me know if you need to know anything else.</p>

<p>OP...set your console for Dolby Digital and that's what you'll be getting, over HDMI, anyway. There's no need to layer another DSP over that. Just leave it on Auto Format Direct and you'll get proper output from the source.</p>

<p>Dolby Digital&nbsp;and DTS bitstreams were supported in HDMI from the outset. HDMI 1.1 and 1.2&nbsp;added support for MLP (for DVD Audio) and DSD (for SACD) bitstreams, respectively. HDMI 1.3 added support for raw Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD bitstreams.<br />
<br />
The reason why the Xbox 360 doesn't support 5.1 LPCM, Dolby TrueHD, or DTS-HD&nbsp;is that the audio goes across the south bridge, and there simply isn't enough bandwidth available for those formats. Dolby Digital encoding is done onboard the CPU,&nbsp;in parallel with&nbsp;a
 matrix encoded 2-channel downmix (optimized for Dolby Pro Logic II decoding). The 640 kbps Dolby Digital stream and 1,5 Mbps 2-channel LPCM are routed to the south bridge, from where they are output to HANA for HDMI output, S/PDIF for the AV and optical outputs,
 and the audio DAC for analog output.<br />
<br />
If it's not possible to get the Dolby Digital signal&nbsp;through to&nbsp;the receiver but only 2-channel stereo, it's possible to apply Dolby Pro Logic II decoding (in Movie mode, or Game mode if available). Pro Logic II&nbsp;detects level and phase differences between the
 left and right channels to restore the sound field. It works surprisingly well with a matrix encoded source like the Xbox 360 - the drawbacks are that sound placement isn't as precise or stable as with discrete 5.1 sound. When there is a lot going on, sound
 placement can get very diffuse and indistinct.<br />
<br />
There is a misconception about Dolby Pro Logic II producing only "fake" surround. That's like saying NTSC produces fake color. It's not fake, just a clever compromise with some drawbacks. This misconception stems from that Pro Logic II is stable enough to handle
 a variety of material, and has a dedicated Music mode. The original Pro Logic was so sluggish and&nbsp;stubborn that movie and TV mixers had to adapt their mixes to its behavior. With Pro Logic II this problem pretty much disappeared. But matrix surround encoding
 remains, and the Movie and Game modes of Pro Logic II handle it.<br />
<br />
TVs generally don't&nbsp;accept Dolby Digital over HDMI, and will make the Xbox 360 switch over to its 2-channel LPCM audio stream. Running the sound from the TV thus limits.<br />
<br />
I advocate using Dolby Digital with the Xbox 360 if at all possible with ones audio setup, but if it isn't, Dolby Pro Logic II comes to the rescue as a decent compromise.</p>

<p>Pro-logic produces false channels. just like 120hz produces false frames, just like 3D produces false depth. All of these methods "trick" the brain, sir. They are fake. Think of NTSC as a&nbsp;"container" to broadcasting sources. Its used in all North American
 broadcasting sources and uses "fakes" to lower bandwidth consumption to be able to show higher definiton broadcast at some sacrifices like color and audio. Color being RGB-compressed YCbCr and Audio being lossy Dolby Digital. Only real and future technologies
 are things like Deep Color and hell... more LPCM channels. Dolby TrueHD and DTS Master Audio (DTS-HD) are still containers and fakes to provide a compensation for the "real" thing.</p>

<br />
The terms "fake" and "false" tends to make people think that things are not controlled. I also don't&nbsp;feel that&nbsp;Dolby Pro Logic II should be discredited as an option if that's what's left, even though it has limitations.<br />
<br />
Just like NTSC would mostly reproduce color from the subcarrier with&nbsp;cross-color and cross-luminance as artifacts, Pro Logic II mostly reproduces intentional surround with magic surround and a diffuse soundfield as artifacts. Sounds that are 180° out-of-phase
 will very audibly come from the surrounds, much louder than the magic surround. So you'll hear things coming from where they should be, just not as precisely or clearly if there is a lot going on as with discrete channels.<br />
<br />
In Movie mode, the magic surround is kept at bay just a little bit with a 10 ms delay to the surrounds relative to the fronts, if speaker distances are set up correctly. It's all very specifically tailored to get as much control as is possible over the sound
 given the limitations of matrix surround. So, there is "false" surround as in magic surround, but it's not all false and unintentional if the mix is surround encoded.<br />
<br />
I know I'm arguing semantics here, but for good reason I think. Dolby Pro Logic II tends to be associated with "concert hall" DSP effects, whereas its intended purpose is quite different.</p>

    <title>Xbox one vs Xbox 360 for an 8 year old&#63;&#63; Suggestions - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox one vs Xbox 360 for an 8 year old&#63;&#63; Suggestions please&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Okay so I'm really struggling with this. My son wants an Xbox for Christmas this year and I'm now doing my research. I'm trying to decide if I should get him an Xbox 360 ($149 right now) or Xbox one. He is a moderate player that enjoys Mindcraft, Star Wars
 and kids based sports games. He doesn't care to much about online playing, streaming features, etc as this moment. I realize Xbox 360 will be obsolete soon as I heard no&nbsp; more new games the end of this year??? But there are a ton of games that should hold
 him over for a few years. But on the other hand Xbox one will be around for a while and new games that will be supported for years to come.&nbsp;I'm not rich either so if he gets the Xbox one that means less gifts under the tree.&nbsp;What would you suggest?? Thanks!</p>

<p>Normally I would suggest the 360. It will still be going strong for a few years because there are still so many people using it. Plus, like you said, there are already a bunch of games out there you can get him, and pretty cheap at this point.</p>
<p>But, you may want to wait until backwards compatibility released on the One in the next few months to see what kind of games will be available for that. Then you would be able to get the One for future content, but he can still play some of the older games
 as well.</p>

<p>If you get your son an Xbox 360, make sure it is not the 4GB version as it won't be sufficient for very long. I would advise getting your son the Xbox 360. There are still games that will be released, and the console is not going anyway. With a large backlog
 of family-friendly games, the Xbox 360 will be a great starting point for your son.
</p>
<p>I myself do not have an Xbox One and finding plenty of enjoyment with my 360. There's still plenty of life left in the console. As for Minecraft, the Xbox 360 community is still quite strong with that game.
</p>
<p>Even if no new games come out by 2017 for Xbox 360, the Xbox LIVE servers will still remain for quite awhile, allowing online capabilities. &nbsp;Xbox One is adding backwards compatibility for many Xbox 360 games, so the servers will probably not go down anytime
 soon as well. </p>

<p>Thank you for the responses.</p>
<p>I'm leaning towards the xbox 360. I saw the 4gb for $149 which is outstanding. Can I add memory to this unit? Like a flash drive? The 500gb run about $250 so I'm not sure which is the better value?</p>

<p>You can use an external USB drive (up to 2TB and 2 plugged in at a time). However, there are some games that require an Xbox hard drive, so you would need either a 250gb, 320gb, or 500gb if you run into those issues.</p>

<p>Xbox 360 would be my suggestion. It works right out of the box and without being connected to the net, and will likely still be playable decades from now. Even when online services go dark... Which with XBL happens pretty regular these days.</p>

<p>That's good info, Thanks!</p>
<p>So will new games stop being made the end of this year, 2015? Or will Microsoft continue to produce new games in 2016?</p>
<p>Also, will the downloadable games at the Xbox store still be available long after the new games stop? Or will I need to hurry up and download games before they are gone? Thanks</p>

<p>There really hasn't been any official word on if/when new games will stop being made for the 360, but it's mostly been up to the publishers as to whether or not they make them for both or just the One.</p>
<p>Downloadable games should be around for as long as Live sticks around for the 360. So you wouldn't need to hurry to buy them.</p>

<p>Talk with other parents who have kids with a 360 and set up a swap program for old games. Also check out gamefly ( game rental program). &nbsp;Also check yard sales for cheap games. &nbsp;At 8 years old, I would allow only Teen or lower rated games in the house. But
 check out the Teen games. Hit the various game sites online. </p>

2.&nbsp;Was this a normal crash where you restarted your computer and started working, or you had to perform factory restore etc.?</div>

<div><strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>If it was a normal crash, try to perform system restore.<br />
Restore the system to a date it was working fine. Given link helps you perform System restore:http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions</div>

Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise versions can only run Hyper-V, in addition to the other requirements listed in the link below:</div>

<div>Please refer to the suggestions of Andre Da Costa replied on June 6, 2015, to fix your issue.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since you want to make changes in the BIOS, I would request you to contact the computer manufacturer or a local technician.
<div><br />
<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Be careful when changing BIOS settings. The BIOS interface is designed for advanced users, and it's possible to change a setting that could prevent your computer from starting correctly. Updating BIOS should only be done if necessary
 (to solve a compatibility problem, for example). It can be a complicated process, and if an error occurs, your computer could be rendered inoperable. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions exactly.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;Also, I suggest you to post your question in the TechNet Forums, where we have support professionals, who are well equipped with the knowledge on issues with Hyper- v and VT -X on WINDOWS 10.</div>

<p><br />
Windows Photo Gallery is just a " middleman ". It does NOT store your pictures.</p>
<p><br />
When you downloaded a picture, you saved it to a folder. Yes ?<br />
That is the folder you should go to. That is where you picture actually is.</p>
<p>I know nothing about family tree maker, so I can't tell you what to do next. But at least you now know where your pictures are.</p>

It’s a message sent from Xbox and people were getting them last night. But I didn’t. I’m not pressuring you guys about it, but i could pre order a game I’ve been wanting with that $5 lol.

</p><p>I thought I had it fixed with a .pfx&nbsp; key export and import but can't find the instructions I did to fix it (if it did fix it).</p>

<h2>            Windows system restore error&#58;  &#40;0x800700b7&#41;  and previous errors&#58; Windows 10 - Video_TDR_Failure and Video_DXVDXGKRNL_Fatal_Error</h2>
                    <p>I have had compatibility issues with the hardware on this computer ever since I got it and realized it didn't support windows 8. Thought 10 may help but I still run into the same issues. But I get a BSOD when I play games - so I guess you reap what you sow
 (or maybe it's not hardware related at all).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, here's the necessary information</p>
<p>
</p><p>Link to most 3 recent minidump files:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Let me know if any additional information is needed. In the meantime I will read this article:&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-10-videotdrfailure-nvlddmkmsys-video-tdr/1719728a-e5dd-4d5f-93e2-e3497e193aad?auth=1</p>

<p>
</p><p>Somethings wrong with my Nvidia graphics card. I am looking up how to solve BSOD errors in general (because that is the most frequent problem that I have ran into). Also I am looking up how to troubleshoot my Nvidia graphics card to see what is actually
 going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may try to manually update my Nvidia drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>***UPDATE #2***</p>
<p>Pc can only boot to login screen and to advanced recovery options screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once i login the computer freezes and i have to manually shut it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During system restore i received the following error message:</p>
<p>0x800700b7</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am attempting to go further back to a older restore point now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also reading the following post in order to troubleshoot the problem.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Advice is appreciated as i dont know the best route to take to get my computer working again.</p>
<p>I believe my system wasnt compatible with the new nvidia drivers.</p>

            <p>So I have tried both Method 1 and Method 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 seems to have successfully updated my Nvidia 675M drivers. However, each time that I run troubleshooter from the control panel,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and troubleshoot "hardware and devices",</p>
<p>I receive the following prompt:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Restart your PC to finish installing drivers and updates."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone through this loop twice, with no change in the error message that the troubleshooter gives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One problem that I know that I have been having is with Nvidia's GeForce Experience. Which just allows you to update drivers for your video card. But each time i open the program it says: "Unable to connect to Nvidia servers." Please try again later or it
 forces itself to close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am working on getting that following these steps:</p>
<p>https://joshmccarty.com/2014/02/fix-geforce-experience-unable-connect-nvidia-try-later-error/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you think of a different solution, or if this is even part of the problem.</p>

            <p>one occurance that I find strange is the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time if I leave something open, and come back to using my PC after like 30 minutes, and attempt to do anything this computer will BSOD with "Video_TDR_Failure"</p>
<p>
</p><p>One example is that this just happened when I was watching a youtube video and paused it. I left to go talk to someone for about 30 minutes or something like that, and when I came back, I moved the mouse with the touchpad, and it crashed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strange. Don't know if it means anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently trying your fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also my computer has been running very hot recently. Both the CPU and the GPU are like 10-15 Celsius over the tempertures that they would run at when I first got the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I attempt to play a game, they go up to 80-90+ range then the computer Blue screens. So I haven't been doing that lately.</p>

            <p>Hi Karthicka,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot uninstall or install my nvidia drivers or anything related to nvidia software (physx or geforce drivers included).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ihave tried to uninstall in both safe mode and regular boot mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time i try to uninstall ond of these products i received the following error on safe mode:</p>
<p>"There was a problem starting C:\Program Files\Nvidia Corporation\Installer2\InstallerCore\NVI2.DLL</p>
<p>
</p><p>The specified module could not be found."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ialso cannot install newer version of the drivers bwcause i recieve the error that "Nvidia hardware cannot be detected."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i cannot fix the problem by removing old drivers or updating to new ones. Help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read abould driver cleaner's, but i think that ia what got me into this mess in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>how to proceed. I have also read that theres errors can be cause by just stressing pc components too hard. So i nees tp somehow adjust the power to the compoent that is failing...</p>

<h2>            Lenovo B570 freezing and crashing</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've had my laptop for about two and a half years now, but for a while now it has been randomly freezing and emitting a loud buzzing noise when it does so. &nbsp;The only time it does this is if I'm watching a video (windows media player, or netflix through
 google chrome, even youtube videos) or when I'm video skyping with people. &nbsp;I've updated all of my drivers, nothing is working. &nbsp;I've scoured the web for an answer to this and just can't seem to find one that works for me. &nbsp;I'm not computer retarded but I'm
 also not incredibly knowledgeable so any answer would ideally be in the most simple way possible. &nbsp;I'd appreciate any help to this, as I have gotten more and more frustrated and really don't want to buy a new computer just for the sake of stopping this when
 the rest of the time it still works just as well as the day I bought it. &nbsp;I have updated all of my drivers, and the bios. &nbsp;I really don't know what else to do.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you, and please help. :[&nbsp;</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
That issue sounds like a hardware problem and since it happens when using video the<br />
problem is probably the video device though it could be the power supply or other<br />
hardware.<br />
<br />
Check with Lenovo Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their<br />
forums about any known issues.<br />
<br />
Lenovo Support and downloads<br />
<a href="http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/homeLenovo.do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/homeLenovo.do</font></a>&nbsp;<br />

<a href="http://forums.lenovo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0072c6">http://forums.lenovo.com/</font></span></a><br />
<br />
However you can't fix hardware with software so you really should have the laptop
<br />
looked at by a real computer shop (one that does its own in-shop service).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<p>See if the quality improves on a different network.</p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />To connect your printer to your wireless network, you can follow these steps:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.hp.com/au-en/document/c04704963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/au-en/document/c04704963</a>
<br />
<br />You'll need your router's WiFi password, which HP won't be able to give you. You'll need to see if you can find the password written down somewhere, or else reset your router.
<br />
<br />If you want to contact HP anyway, here's the link:
<br />

<h2>            Driver Power State Failure &#40;BSOD&#41; after Windows 8.1 Installation</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just bought a brand new laptop and it came with a Trial Version of Windows 8.1. I was able to play some games and work with video editing without no problems. Two days after that, I bought a license and updated the system to the Full Version of Windows
 8.1 Pro 64-bits, but after that I had some problems because the system was not able to recognize my dedicated graphics card. I uninstalled all the drivers and updated them all, one by one. But then, after almost a week, my laptop is still showing several BSODs
 with DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE error, mostly when I try to execute a program that uses a lot of my graphics card (Nvidia GT 730m), like Sony Vegas 12, Photoshop and games. I'm having more than 4 BSODs per day, and I'm really worried because the laptop is
 less then a week old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the minidump files:&nbsp;http://www.mediafire.com/download/bdnb0j5tdvmd3tm/dmp.zip</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you guys can help me!</p>

    <title>System Speakers not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobvinton  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Speakers not working</h2>
                    <p>
I have an HP G60 Notebook using WIN 8.1 64 bit.</p>
<p>
Two days ago Windows gave a message like - "encountered a problem with AMD (something) &amp; must close &amp; restart".</p>
<p>
After that there was no sound thru the System speakers. I tried all the HP &amp; Windows Troubleshooters but no problems detected. I also did a System Restore from a 5 day old Windows System Backup.</p>
<p>
I have a Logitech USB Headset\Microphone which I keep permanently connected. Previously I only ever used it for Skype phone calls. After a lot of experimenting I find that I can hear computer sound from all sources - programs, Netflix, YouTube, Internet videos,
 etc. - only thru the USB Headset with the following setup ~</p>
<p>
Set the Logitech USB Headset as the 'Default device' (in Control Panel\Sound). This now shows in the Volume Control on the Taskbar. Previously the Default Device was probably the 'AMD High Definition Audio Device', but I don't know for sure because I never
 needed to check it.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Note:</p>
<p>
The Sound output jack&nbsp;doesn't work - as tested on external speakers &amp; ordinary plug-in headphones.</p>
<p>
Device Manager\System Devices\System Speaker - says no drivers are required for this device.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
My conclusion is that the computer speakers hardware has failed, meaning a costly repair or even a new computer. Fortunately a few weeks ago I purchased a Care Pack Warranty extension.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Is my conclusion correct, or do others have comments?</p>

            <p>Thanks. Now things have changed drastically. In trying to fix the Sound problem I went to the AMD website looking for a solution for the AMD Device. I found an AMD program that searches for the devices\drivers for my computer &amp; I used it. It Installed a
 lot of things &amp; then said I need to Restart the computer. When I did that the system was corrupted. I could not start the computer.</p>
<p>I had to use an HP Recovery USB thumbdrive to get back into the computer. That sort of 'Recovery' takes me a long way back, so I lose all Data &amp; installed programs.</p>
<p>Fortunately I have all of my Data backed up on an external HD only about 1 week old. So after some work I have my Data restored.</p>
<p>However, also on that external HD I have a 1 week old System Image Backup. But Windows 'Recovery' doesn't allow me to access that Backup. Without that, I have the very big job of re-installing all of my programs.</p>
<p>Maybe I have to Post to another Forum on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, re Audio, after the HP Recovery, I found that the 'Default Device' was set at 'Speaker/HP - Realtek High Definition Audio'. With that, I DO get computer sound, &amp; the audio output jack DOES work - at least when tested on ordinary Headphones. I
 can't test the external speakers because I have a damaged connecting wire.</p>
<p>The sound level on that device is not very high.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it does show that the problem was never with audio hardware.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Where does Windows Easy Transfer save to so I can delete everything it moved before it locked up and screwed me over&#63;</h2>
                    I ran Windows Easy Transfer..it got to about 85% transferred and it just locked up.&nbsp; I never got warning message, incomplete pop up or anything.&nbsp; I closed the program and 85% of the 25.7 GB I had been transferring DID transfer but there is no organization
 or anything to it.&nbsp; I have found a better way to do the transfer but I currently have an extra 20GB of memory on this computer bc of the failed transfer.<br />
<br />
I want to delete everything it put on here but I never got a transfer list or anything.&nbsp; I've tried resetting the date on my computer and other forms of recovery but I got nothing. Is there anything I can do to get rid of this 20GB of programs, files, etc.
 that I cannot find and do not want??<br />

<p>Hi Mike,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under normal circumstance, Windows Easy Transfer should successfully transfer all your files and settings to the desired location on the target computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If files don’t get transferred, it could be due to one of the reasons that they might have been detected as known malicious software, which means they were blocked from being transferred to your new computer.</p>
<p>See what the transfer report has to say about the whole operation.</p>
<p><strong>To open Windows Easy Transfer Reports</strong></p>
<p>1. Click the <strong>Start</strong> button. <br />
2. In the search box, type Easy Transfer Reports, and then, in the list of results, click
<strong>Windows Easy Transfer Reports</strong>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>Normally when you use Windows Easy Transfer to migrate the data to the Destination computer it prompts you to type a path and a folder name in which you want to store the Windows Easy Transfer wizard files, and then click Next.</p>
<p>If you can remember the location you can go ahead and look for the data in that location.</p>
<p><strong>Note :</strong> The default path is <strong>C:\migwiz.</strong></p>
<p>Check if you can find the data over there. Else if you remember the name of the file you can type it in the search engine and check if you can retrieve the file from there.</p>
<p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>
