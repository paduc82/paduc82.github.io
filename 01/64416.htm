<h2>            Windows 10 updates sometimes stop internet access</h2>
                    <p>(This topic relates to both internet and updates but I can select only one topic)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My HP tablet has Windows 10 and for some time now I have had this issue. I found that sometimes I turn it on and try to use a web browser to find it cannot find any pages. I tried a different browser ( I have Chrome and Edge) but neither works. &nbsp;In the past
 I have started troubleshooting and spent half an hour to &nbsp;an hour (or more) to no avail, checking the network connection and settings and checking my router etc., checking another computer ( my PC and laptop work fine) then I give up and turn off......</p>
<p>...As it begins to turn off it announces I must "wait while Windows configures updates".</p>
<p>Then the penny drops- Windows update disabled my internet connection somehow during its updates. Once it finishes, turns off then I start up again.... the internet works fine again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The problems<br />
This is very annoying because there is no indication of the fact that updates are being installed so I have no clue what is causing my lack of connection. I have spent much time troubleshooting to no avail. &nbsp;Now, with experience, I do try to remember the issue
 so sometimes I say- oh updates! and turn off. However, &nbsp;I often forget and get caught out again, wondering what is wrong.</p>
<p>The issue also prevents me getting any work done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed many people are complaining because there is no way for the computers owner to control updates; I think my suggestions could go a long way to help many people, even if you do not allow updates to be fully controlled by the computer owners.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Suggestions</p>
<p>First try not to disable the internet while doing updates. &nbsp;It is a bad idea to disable the internet while performing silent background updates- nobody has a clue what is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you must disable the internet during updates this must be made obvious:</p>
<p>I think it would be a great idea for Microsoft to show a warning/alert/indicator when updates are being downloaded, so computer owners know exactly what is happening and they have a 'heads up' that the computer may soon be completely useless due to internet
 going out.</p>
<p>Even a system tray icon like Windows 7 has, to indicate updates are being downloaded, would work and give a clue why things are not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A warning should be given when the update actually disables the internet too, so users at least realise what is wrong and don't experience complete frustration wondering why their computer doesn't work. &nbsp;Users can then go ahead and reboot to finish it and
 regain internet. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Even better would be for each update to stop before disabling the internet and warn users that the "automatic updates are about to disable your computer, so please finish your work and press OK to proceed". (Much better because users get control of their
 own computer back and feel better about Windows and can still let auto-updates continue once they have finished up their work. &nbsp;Users could then turn the computer off and let the updates continue and then switch power off, or users could leave the update to
 finish then they could turn it off themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope at least one of these positive suggestions will be accepted and incorporated to improve Windows for all users and computer owners.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you for your advice- however my Windows 10 "does not have Advanced Options" (i.e. there is a link for Advanced Options but the only options there are: 'Give me updates for other MS products when I update Windows' &nbsp;and &nbsp;'Use my sign-in info to automatically
 &nbsp;finish setting up my device after an update').</p>
<p>My tablet (originally had Windows 8.1) upgraded to <strong>Home</strong> edition when I put Windows 10 on it.</p>
<p>The Update &amp; Security screen has no options, just a fixed text, saying 'Available Updates will be download and installed automatically., except over metered connections'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the problem. It seems other versions can now be changed but the Home edition is stuck like this. &nbsp;That's why I suggest at least some warnings or indications should be shown when updates are being downloaded then when about to install and a warning
 that internet connectivity will be lost while this happens.</p>
<p>Thank you again for trying to help though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way- your link to troubleshoot internet connectivity does not help in this case because I have no problem with connections normally; it is only when the Windows update download/install process begins; it loses all connectivity until I restart/shutdown,
 whereupon the screen advises I should wait while Windows configures its updates. After it finishes and restarts it will connect again. &nbsp;So it's the update process that is causing all the trouble. &nbsp;I just don't know when Windows is updating because it is all
 done behind the scenes.</p>
<p>If I saw a warning then I would know what was happening.</p>

            <p>Do you also encounter internet connection issues with other devices using the same network? Windows Update requires an active internet connection to download available updates. If you lost your internet connection, the update will stop. If you're doing some
 other activities that require internet connection while Windows is updating, you might experience slowness with your connection.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi, &nbsp; I have a desktop that never fails its Ethernet connection to the router. When the tablet does this thing with an update the desktop still connects through the router to internet. &nbsp;Its only the tablet that seems to lose its connection once an update
 starts. The Wifi indicator shows it is connected to my network but I cannot find any web pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this tablet, when I have the problem of &nbsp;a browser taking forever to try and get a web page then failing, when I try to shut down or restart it then says that it is installing updates. This seems to indicate to me that Windows has already downloaded
 the updates and probably has begun making changes and those changes affect the internet connection, preventing me getting web pages, then it needs to shut everything down to finish installing everything. So the download works but then the internet connection
 is lost until I restart and let the updates finish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the link but I looked at it and the advice does not work in Windows Home.</p>
<p>First I do not have computer configuration/Administrative Templates ( or I cannot find it; a search in the circle box on the task bar only goes to the internet- it doesn't find something named like that on my tablet.)</p>
<p>Also, in my 'Turn messages on or off', the option for Windows Update is greyed out and has a tick in it but I never see any message that updates are being downloaded or installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other internet posts suggest that only Windows 10 professional allows you to configure updates. That's the problem. &nbsp;It is quite bad that Windows Home does not let you configure updates- after all a person's computer is their own property yet we don't have
 any control over it.</p>
<p>Windows 10 home should at least warn you when updates are being downloaded and that the internet connection is going to be disabled by some update changes until you restart. &nbsp;Mind you I don't see why updates should disable my connection- can't they wait
 until that phase when you are shutting down?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, it's worth checking the HP forum- thanks, although I have no trouble except when a Windows update is half way through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew" a few times when the trouble happened. No help. It just couldn't connect to the internet. &nbsp;It was only when I shut down that it announced I should wait
 while windows finishes installing updates and after that it worked fine again.</span></p>

</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE: April 12 2017. &nbsp;Tablet has not suffered from this in a while, so possibly it's only certain types of windows updates that affect the wifi/internet connection, or- maybe an update has fixed the issue (?). &nbsp;Not sure but have checked through HP forum-
 nothing there is exactly my issue. The issue has only ever happened when a windows update was half way through, waiting for the shut down to complete. Otherwise the wifi / internet has been no problem.</p>
<p>If it happens again and/or I find the problem I'll update again; otherwise must leave this issue as unresolved until something new happens.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup. The ADMIN account in Safe<br />
Mode has no password by default (so unless someone changed the password it should be available).<br />
<br />
Some programs like the Google Updater (if you added the Google Toolbar, Chrome&nbsp;or Google Earth)<br />
has been known to cause this issue.</p>

If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember<br />
to always leave an Admin Account that is unused except to test and fix).<br />

<h2>            Xbox Elite Drift Stick</h2>
                    
<p>I bought my controller a couple months ago. My left stick drifts up without me touching it. I cant seem to find any help. Costumer service hung up on me 5 times already. Does the Xbox elite come with any warranty? Is there anyway to fix this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The accessories for the xbox typically have a 90 day warranty although it may be longer in some regions. &nbsp;You should be able to log in here

                    <p>I too am getting this error code now (1170000),&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been able to play games OK until tonight ?&nbsp; Although, I did have a few times when I would have to try logging in&nbsp; more than once to be signed in.&nbsp; Before this started, my daily challenge games would
 lock up and it took forever to play a game.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'M not even sure if this message will get through as I am not able to click on any replies and have the button work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 seemed to work OK until about a week ago.&nbsp; Has anyone else had these problems and how did you solve them ?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Patricia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What exactly are the games that you are referring to?</p>
<p>2. By "logging in&nbsp; more than once", are you referring to&nbsp;Windows 10 sign in?</p>
<p>3. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>4. Did you get the error message when you play games?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned that it worked fine before, I would suggest you to perform a system restore and check if it helps.
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you are having recent problems with Windows 10, then you could do a System Restore to restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point.</span></p>

            The Microsoft Mahjong and Microsoft Solitaire (both Xbox) versions worked fine until today. Today I get error code 1170000 and another message says this app is no longer available on Microsoft. &nbsp;I paid to upgrade both games to the premium versions and
 still have 3/4 &nbsp;of the year left on the subscriptions. &nbsp;I tried going to the Microsoft web page to reinstall the games but nothing happens when I try to install them. &nbsp;Please let me know what to do. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi, Rick
<br />
<br />Ok I'll give you some tips.
<br />
<br />1.- Review the Ram Memory with 
<br />

<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.memtest86.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.memtest86.com/</a>
<br />
<br />2.- Check your SSD or HDD with (chkdsk)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee872425.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee8...</a>
<br />
<br />3.- Re-create the USB or DVD to install the Operating System, because sometimes it is damaged or corrupted.

            It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

<h2>            Windows 8.1. apps stopped working</h2>
                    No apps will start in windows 8.1 - not even "Store"
<div>
<p>It seems I'm not alone having this issue. </p>
<p>This is a fairly recent fresh install of the OS, and it is activated.</p>
<p>Fortunately, other programs run fine -chrome and rdp, som I'm not paralyzed, but it's no longer a functioning OS.</p>
<p><span>this is what's tried: change user account type, verify display resolution, firewall and UAC, sfc /scnannow, download and run apps to repair, updated hardware drivers, running windows update, wsreset (will not start)..</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a tip ?</p>
<p>A MS consultant began to help me, but&nbsp;<span>I mentioned a curious new behaviour when accessing this faulty computer through a vpn network, and the MS-consultant trying to help me just dropped the issue and ran away.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Ketil,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing the troubleshooting methods that you have already tried. The thread link that you have included in this query shows that you have some corrupted system files on the computer and the SFC Scan was unable to fix it completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, in this case, let us use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management Tool to fix the System File Corruption issues and check if that resolves the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Use Deployment Image Servicing and Management to fix the System File Corruption</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To run the DISM Tool, you may follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>X</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard and select “<strong><em>Command Prompt (Admin)</em></strong>” from that menu.</p>
<p>b) On the <strong><em>Command Prompt</em></strong> window, type the following commands, and then press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>” after each command.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 31.5pt"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><strong><em>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><strong><em>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 31.5pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) After completing the process, type “<strong><em>Exit</em></strong>” and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>” on the
<strong><em>Command Prompt</em></strong> window to close it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After running this tool successfully, please run the SFC Scan again and check if still there are any system file corruption on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Hope this resolves the issue. Please get back to us with the results.</span>

            <p>Hi Ketil,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for sharing the troubleshooting result with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned in my previous post, did you run the SFC Scan again to make sure that the corrupted files are completely fixed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, please try that and share the details. You may follow these steps to run the SFC Scan again on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Run an SFC Scan</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The “<strong><em>sfc /scannow</em></strong>” command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>X</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard and select “<strong><em>Command Prompt (Admin)</em></strong>” from that menu.</p>
<p>b) On the command prompt window, type the following command, and then press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 72pt"><strong><em><span>sfc /scannow</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 72pt"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>c) Follow the on-screen instructions and complete the scan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> richardhively  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer crash need to transfer files</h2>
                    I killed my computer last week by spilling my coffee into the CPU. I was running windows vista as the OS. I have a backup dvd&nbsp; with all my files and folders. I purchased a new computer that runs windows 8. My problem is that I cannot extract the files
 to this new OS. Is there a way to get it transferred? and if so what do I need to do? I also have the hard drive from the old system. Can anyone help? desperately need the files back.

            Sorry, I fried the whole computer when the liquid spilled into the fan vents. I had made a backup disk a week before I did this, but when I tried to download the files to my new computer which has Windows 8 OS all that was downloaded was the file name
 and no other files or folders are opened. The disk was using Vista OS and my file system program was Microsoft Works. I hope this helps. Thanks for your time. Richard

            I opened the control panel, clicked on backup and restore, clicked backup inserted disk as asked and formatted it. It asked where I wanted the files to go to which was drive D: and then burned all the files to the disk. I took the disk out after it finished,
 backed out of the process and then loaded the disk and open it to make sure all the files were there which they were. Again I was using windows Vista OS. Thanks for getting back to me. Richard

<h2>            Can&#39;t boot to windows 7 hangs at classpnp.sys and starting wnidows</h2>
                    Laptop was working fine until i tried to turn it on 4 days ago and it hangs all the time<br />
<br />
- Hangs at starting windows screen<br />
- Safe mode(w/ command prompt and w/networking) hangs at classpnp.sys<br />
- Went to boot options and deleted the /NOEXECUTE=OPTIN line, didn't work, still hung<br />
- Launch Startup repair - hangs at System Recovery Options where it says choose partition, with a loading cursor<br />
- Tried using a Windows 7 recovery disk, same result as above<br />
- Tried using a Windows 7 installation disk to repair, same result as above<br />
- Tried using Windows 7 installation disk to reinstall windows, and it hangs at Setup is Starting<br />
- Removed and replaced the CMOS battery, didn't work<br />
- Can't change my hard drive configuration, my bios doesn't have advanced settings. i have an HP dv6-6315dx<br />
- Tried booting to Ubuntu to recover my data but that just shows a blank screen<br />
<br />
- and once again, the recovery console does not work, nor does recovery disk or installation disk, so thats not a solution<br />
any answers will be appreciated, because this is really frustrating me. I bought this laptop in October and it was running 100% fine until this happened.<br />
No I am not going to call HP as I have already called them, I am out of warranty and I'm not going to purchase an out-of-warranty warranty.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance<br />

    <title>Drop down bar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julianwebster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Drop down bar</h2>
                    Hi does anyone know how to remove the annoying black drop down bar which appears at the top of my Microsoft surface RT every time my cursor goes near the top of the screen? For example if I'm using Ebay and go to click on "my Ebay" if my cursor goes anywhere
 near the top of the screen the black bar drops down so I have to move my cursor away then slowly position it carefully not to activate the drop down bar. Most annoying thing in the world! Apart from Brussel sprouts.

<p>"drop down bar-Microsoft community-internet explorer" which is the page I'm on now.&nbsp; I'm not the best with computers so bear with me on this as I'm trying to give as much info as possible. I don't know how to do a screen shot? Or how to post it on here.</p>

    <title>Direct X Problems with Games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tristxd_92  say:</h3>
<h2>            Direct X Problems with Games</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed a fresh version of Windows 7 Ultimate onto my new SSD and I installed my motherboard drivers and then all windows updates and then installed my newest GPU driver, for my Nvidia GTX780. Then I wanted to install Far Cry 4, and I encountered
 a Direct X Installation error. I got an error message during startup that I required a D3DX_43.dll, so i put one in the system32 folder and then a new error replaced it with:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The Application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b). Click OK to close the application"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then installed Metro 2033 via steam and it installed visual c++ and DX but it could not launch, and now it trys to install DX everytime i try to start it.</p>
<p>Direct X seems to have installed all the DLLs correctly though even the one that FC4 was missing, Does anyone have any ideas? I've installed different VC++ redists and no difference at all.</p>
<p>

            <p><del>You need to update DX, particularly when running a new Windows insatll.&nbsp; </del>
<br />
</p>
<p><del>D3DX_43.dll ( which should read d3dx11_43.dll - or replace 11 with 9 or 10) was released after Win7.
</del><br />

<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>EDIT: Or... Because Steam is quite compulsive about reinstalling C++ and DX&nbsp; with each game,<br />
</p>
<p>and possibly because you have placed a DX file in System32, it may be the file in question has been corrupted (or the package that downloaded with the game, and which the game keeps reinstalling,
<br />
</p>
<p>may have been corrupt). <br />
</p>
<p>If this is the case, you need to reinstall DX using the full DX redist (June 2010) installer package.
<br />
</p>
<p>(The Web Installer I linked above only fills in gaps. It does not overwrite corrupt DX files as does the<br />
</p>
<p>full installer package) -<br />

<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Or - Assuming it''s not corrupted, METRO 2033 has a sub-folder called -<em> install
</em>- . In this folder you will find an 'unpacked' DX install. Find the DXSETP.exe , and run that to reinstall DX.<br />
</p>
<p>The correct version of C++ for this game is also in this folder, should that be necessary.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you continue having problems after reinstalling DX&nbsp; use the&nbsp; <em>verify integrity of game cache</em>&nbsp; option to make sure the game does not have corrupt files (R/click on game title in your Steam Library<br />
</p>
<p>and go to Properties \ Local Files ).<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Regarding FC4 - Only just released. No surprise if it has problems until patched.<br />
</p>
<p>Is this a Ubisoft download or retail disk ? Other ?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But ... It may be the real issue is .NET - Upgrade to .NET4.5 -</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 notebook &#40;hp pavilion dv6 6119tx, x64&#41; doesn&#39;t boot up</h2>
                    <p>Hi friends,<br />
<br />
I am stucked into a trouble with my hp paviloion dv6 6119tx notebook running x64 Windows 10 Home (10.0.14393.1066).<br />
<br />
Just a week ago I updated my notebook with mentioned version of windows 10. Today I was trying to change display settings&gt; screensavers and changed screensaver to Mistyfy. Then I went to see preview but suddenly as I pressed preview button my notebook hanged
 and got blacked. I waited for 5 minutes but nothing happened. I pressed esc button on device few times and desktop screen appeared but in hanged mode. None of screen item was clickable, cursor was not moving. Again I waited for around 15 min but desktop screen
 was still hanged. I restarted my notebook...it booted but got hanged on windows logo with static rolling circle on it. After wait for 10-15 min when nothing happened, again i restarted this time automatic windows repair task started. It started with defender
 scan but again it stucked on windows logo with static circle. Sensing that it can be some start up failure. I run startup repair from advanced troubleshooting but no sucess and
</p>
<p>stucked on windows logo with static circle. Windows recovery also doesn't worked. I also run sfc/ scannow from commond prompt but it failed with windows resource protection could not perform the requested operation message.<br />
Please help to get rid off this issue.<br />
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Many solutions described out there doesn't apply my reported issue or troubleshooting steps not provided with my notebook model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Performed memory check, hdd test, hdd detection in bios. Everything is fine. Reset also doesn't work.</p>

<p>You have to be careful using third party fans, if the external fan makes the internal Xbox One fans spin faster than they are supposed to it could possibly damage it and causing more harm then when it's a bit warm. Alternatively when not spinning fast enough
 it could cause hot air to be trapped inside making the Xbox overheat faster</p>

<h2>            Family Safety in Windows 8 Doesn&#39;t Work</h2>
                    


Like many other people, I have discovered that Family Settings often does not work in Windows 8.  Please let me know if there are some types of laptops on which Windows 8 Family Settings does work so that I can buy one of those and can return the laptop that I have.  The range of things I have tried is as follows:  

	On a brand new laptop, I set up an administrator account  linked to an account on Microsoft's FSS.live.com website.  (The laptop is linked directly to the Internet, and not through a domain.)  I then created a standard account upon which I applied web filtering using FSS.live.com.  Although the process on FSS.live.com went as expected, after logging back into the standard account I quickly realized that no **** sites were being blocked.  

	I also tried setting up web filtering on the machine itself using the embedded Windows 8 functionality.  I repeatedly get the error message "Sorry, we couldn't make changes to Family Safety settings."  Then, although the status indicato

            <p>In truth, I don't think&nbsp; that you do understand the inconvenience that I have experienced.&nbsp; To reiterate, the problem is with the implementation of Windows 8 on some machines or with some vendors, and I want you to direct me to a machine/vendor on which
 Family Safety works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding your suggestions, I had already tried Method 1 (adjusting User Account Controls) before, but I did it again anyway since I now have a different machine.&nbsp; It has no impact.&nbsp; Method 2&nbsp; doesn't make sense since I am now on my third machine and the
 odds of there being uniquely corrupted files on three different machines is absurdly small.&nbsp; (I also have done a complete factory refresh on this machine.)&nbsp; Method 3 is similarly unlikely, but it did yield one new piece of information:&nbsp; There are no files
 in the Parental Controls folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please respond, and please be aware that before reaching out to you I scoured the help sites and have already tried every suggestion that I could find.&nbsp;</p>

 one standard for my daughter). I found a thread somewhere that AV software may not help so I removed the bundled McAfee - still not working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This falls way, way short of my expectations of Windows 8, and I would like to know please what the solution is.? I bought the computer for my 12 year old daughter, and whilst I can trust her to be sensible I would like the peace of mind that an OS as "cutting
 edge" as Windows 8 can help me out - this is very basic stuff in my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please respond.?</p>

 one standard for my daughter). I found a thread somewhere that AV software may not help so I removed the bundled McAfee - still not working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This falls way, way short of my expectations of Windows 8, and I would like to know please what the solution is.? I bought the computer for my 12 year old daughter, and whilst I can trust her to be sensible I would like the peace of mind that an OS as "cutting
 edge" as Windows 8 can help me out - this is very basic stuff in my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please respond.?</p>

            We're also having problems with Family Safety.&nbsp; When I try to set it up, it routinely says it's not functioning correctly and closes.&nbsp; When I re-open it, it has the settings I've been trying to implement.&nbsp; However, the settings don't work.&nbsp; I set up time
 restrictions for my daughter and she is using her laptop when the computer is supposed to be locked out.&nbsp; She's also using it for more hours than I set up for her to be allowed to use.&nbsp; This is on Windows 8 on a new Gateway laptop NV570P09u I got her for Christmas.

            This problem can drive you crazy.&nbsp; You spend hours (even paid time with a support sourcel) on this, next time you open the computer the porn sites open up!&nbsp; I hadn't known about this resource, but downloaded K9webprotection which hopefully will work.&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi Becky35,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does this happen while using any
 particular program or an application or is it random?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does it log you out of any website
 or the comptuer user account?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer

</p>
<div>
<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command 3 times restarting the PC after each time to completely fix everything that it's able to.
<br />
<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Restart the PC afterwards, and try the <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command again.<br />
<br />
If still not, then try using <strong>OPTION ONE</strong> above to run the <strong>

If still not, then you could do a <strong><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2293-refresh-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">refresh</span></a></strong> of Windows 8, or run a

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />
<br />
If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the <strong>OPTION THREE</strong> section&nbsp;to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.

                    <div>Hey! I have a problem... On June 23, I extended my subscription to Xbox Live Gold for another 3 months, paying 79 PLN. Today I decided to buy the Game Pass Ultimate for PLN 4 advertised by Xbox. When I learned that after a month I would be obliged to pay
 54 PLN for the next three months, I canceled my subscription, so I got 4 PLN back.&nbsp; Unfortunately, what I learned now, my three-month Xbox Live Gold subscription was also canceled, except that I did not receive a refund.&nbsp; So it turns out that the week of using
 Xbox Live Gold cost me 79 PLN... Can anyone advise me what should I do in such a situation?&nbsp; Is that possible to retrieve my money? Thanks for help.</div>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>for a situation like this I would advise to contact Xbox Support via Phone or Chat at
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/contact-us</a></p>
<p>To see if they can look into it and help you out regarding the refund etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For future reference, in some cases it might be best to stop auto renewal compared to cancelling the subscription, in your case your subscription would just stop at the end of the remaining time instead on cancelling it immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results</p>
        </p>

<p><span>Hi Susana,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you see any yellow exclamation mark in<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Device-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Device Manager</a> under USB devices?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 7 contains several troubleshooting programs that can automatically fix some common problems with your computer. One among them is the hardware
 and devices troubleshooter. I would suggest you to run the troubleshooter as the first step of troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Remove and re-install USB Controllers</span></strong></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Start; in the start search type devmgmt.msc and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers.</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click every device under the Universal Serial Bus controllers node, and then click Uninstall to remove them one at a time.</span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restart the computer, and then Windows will reinstall the USB controllers.</span></p>
<p><span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plug in the removable USB storage device, and then test to make sure that the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>

            <p>I spend 3 days trying to figure it out</p>
<p>in the end I re-install the OS&nbsp;</p>
<p>in order to fix a problem that required to get in safe mode</p>
<p>but I couldn't just get there</p>
<p>and guess what? I fix the problem</p>
<p>then I check if after re-install I can get in safe mode but still no working</p>
<p>but I don't care anymore because I create an image of my system&nbsp;</p>
<p>so if something happen I don't have to re-install again</p>
<p>I hate microsoft but I'm stuck with them&nbsp;</p>
