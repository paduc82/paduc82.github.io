            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Community where you can find the necessary information about Microsoft
 products!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You are unable to open Quicken 2013 Deluxe and get error 7852.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Did you make any
</span><strong>changes</strong><span> on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue may occur if the software is corrupted or because of third party programs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to re-install the program and check in clean boot:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Clean boot</strong></p>
<p><span>When the computer is started in clean boot, non Microsoft programs will not be started and any interruption from them would be avoided.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link:</span></p>
<p><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></b></a></span></p>
<p><strong>Note: Once you are done with clean boot, follow step 3 in the article to set your computer back to normal startup.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: If in case you are connected through a wireless connection then when you start the System Configuration Utility to perform clean boot, click Startup &amp; Services
 tab one at time and ensure wireless related entry is Checked (Enabled).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Uninstall the program</strong></p>
<p><span>Refer the site:</span></p>
<p><strong>Uninstall or change a program</strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</span></b></a></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Install the program</strong></p>
<p><span>You can use the Quicken sites mentioned below for assistance in installing the software:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://quicken.intuit.com/personal-finance-software/deluxe-money-management.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://quicken.intuit.com/personal-finance-software/deluxe-money-management.jsp</a></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://quicken.intuit.com/support/windows.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://quicken.intuit.com/support/windows.jsp</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I would suggest you to get assistance at the Quicken support site.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If the issue persists, let us know and we would be glad to help you.</span></p>

    <title>Cannot sign into Microsoft Account, cannot update, cannot view windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthew western  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot sign into Microsoft Account, cannot update, cannot view windows store, other browsers not working.</h2>
                    <p>I previously upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 when the upgrade became available.</p>
<p>I first noticed this current&nbsp;problem when I attempted to change my lock screen, and realized that when selecting an image the preview would not display and I was left at a loading preview screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After looking into the initial issue, I then realized that Windows could not update. Mind you, I&nbsp;was and currently am&nbsp;connected to the internet, and am using the same PC I am experiencing trouble with. Whenever I attempt to update, I receive this message:</p>
<p>"There were some problems installing updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for information, this may help: (0x80080005)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I open the Store, I'm stuck on a loading screen until it gives up and gives me this error message:</p>
<p>"The server stumbled</p>
<p>We all have bad days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code is 0x801901F7, in case you need it.</p>
<p>CV: y5/FY+3rzEeBoVdh"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I try to "Sign in using a Microsoft account instead", I enter my credentials, verify my identity with the code, and when it asks for my&nbsp;Windows password "one last time"&nbsp;and it is entered, I receive this error message:</p>
<p>"Oops, something went wrong</p>
<p>Whatever happened, it was probably our fault. Please try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since 11/4/2015, I've lost functionality of my other web browsers, and my spyware and malware removal tools either cannot update, or they cannot be started now. I'm forced to used Edge as it is the only browser that functions currently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've feverishly exhausted many possibilities. I have "reset" this PC using the recovery tools in Windows 10, used command line "sfc /scannow" as an administrator, and have used a windows powershell "fix" as has been described by other users, but to no avail.
 I am at my wit's end with this issue.</p>

            <p>Thanks for responding, and yes this is Windows 10 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Upgraded and installed via Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I think the update took place early-mid August. I reserved my copy through the notification on my taskbar, and I remember waiting a week or so after the official release date came.&nbsp;The system&nbsp;automatically downloaded the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. When I originally bought this PC, I believe it had McAfee on it, but&nbsp;at&nbsp;one point during the system's lifespan the machine became inoperable.&nbsp;I&nbsp;had done a Windows 7 reinstall off of a&nbsp;USB stick&nbsp;and I believe I lost all the files I originally had during
 formatting, even though I had a separate SSD for installing 7 on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Again, a McAfee trial was once on this hard drive, but after Windows 7 was reinstalled I don't recall seeing it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Spybot + Antivirus Home Edition and Malwarebytes. Spybot has trouble updating now, but it still runs and I can perform scans.&nbsp;Other applications that connect to the internet like Steam&nbsp;can no longer connect to the internet to update, but I can still log
 in to my account (not in offline mode either). Malwarebytes lost complete functionality when Mozilla Firefox did. I've since uninstalled and attempted to reinstall it, but it will not finish installing and runs into a "script error" failing to call a proc.
 when attempting to run or installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. I've done a reset for Windows 10 earlier in September, and then just yesterday on the 4th of November I've reset but chose to keep my files during the reset process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. None of the updates in item number&nbsp;7&nbsp;are listed&nbsp;among my updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. I have version: You have version 18,0,0,232 installed (will update after this post).</p>
<p>EDIT: Flash will not update, Adobe says:</p>
<p>"Flash Player is integrated with Microsoft Edge in Windows 10. <br />
You do not need to install Flash Player."</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Mozilla Firefox is installed, and had been functioning normally up until 11/4/2015 (yesterday afternoon). The application does not start in safe mode, and crashes the same way it does when&nbsp;Windows 10 is&nbsp;booted normally. If I open the application, the
 crash reporter comes up, and if I choose to restart, the crash reporter comes up until I choose&nbsp;quit Firefox. When error reporting, it says "There was a problem submitting your report."</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. I use CCleaner, and this application is functioning normally.</p>

            <p>1. Originally purchased the machine sometime back&nbsp;in 2011, but have since physically upgraded and replaced&nbsp;all parts of the machine, save the hard drive which was&nbsp;formatted in 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;I think it was around&nbsp;late August&nbsp;of 2014 when I reinstalled Windows 7 using the USB stick, and that&nbsp;was when the&nbsp;most&nbsp;recent, radical&nbsp;physical changes were made to the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. No, if I recall correctly&nbsp;McAfee did not reappear after the reinstall of the system in 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4a. Nothing went missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4b. Yes I chose the same reset option back then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Yes, same error has been occurring for a long time now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. MBAM Free was installed because I was having internet webpage redirection issues due to malware. Spybot wasn't able to remove the programs, but Malwarebytes did, so I kept the program. This happened back when I did the first reset in an attempt to correct
 the webpage redirection issue, but the reset didn't work. Since then I haven't had webpage redirection issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Not all of them, but I remember using CCleaner in an attempt to fix the non-functionality of windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm reviewing your links/articles.</p>
<p>Edit: Have used the earliest saved&nbsp;registry backup and have not noticed any change to the system.</p>

<p>My apologies. I thought "I've lost functionality of my other web browsers, and my spyware and malware removal tools either cannot update, or they cannot be started now" meant that Spybot &amp; MBAM had been removed/went AWOL&nbsp;when you did the "reset."</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Was Spybot +Antivirus installed after you "reinstalled Windows 7 using the USB stick" in August of 2014&nbsp;or after you upgraded to Win10 sometime in August of 2015?</p>

            <p>No worries, also, the Firefox browser issue persists, as does the updating issues with Spybot and Steam. Was able to access the Windows Store before the Windows&nbsp;update, and now the Store is just closing when I open it.
</p>
<p>EDIT: Store opens when it wants to? Just clicked it and I now have access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Both times it was installed before and reinstalled after. When I first upgraded to 10 I had to reinstall several applications to restore their functionality.</p>

            <p>Definitely will, however <strong>I ultimately needed to clean install from a USB drive to correct the issue in its entirety</strong>.</p>
<p>By checking the sfc /scannow logs, I was able to determine that a browser-hijacking adware trojan that had been removed early on was the culprit, as it had corrupted my dnsapi.dll files. Malwarebytes has a
<a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.org/intelligence/2015/09/shopperz-alters-dnsapi-dll/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
page</a> dedicated to this, but the damage was still being done to my machine well after removal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desperate, I downloaded a dnsapi.dll file and replaced one of the two accessible on my system, which gave me slightly more internet connectivity, but still did not resolve the issue. The other file was "in use" so it would never replace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When system file checker would try to restore this file, it was unable to because the file no longer existed. It was at this point that I could not use a Restore Health command to fix this issue from a windows 10 .iso file as well, so I created a boot USB
 drive to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When reinstalling windows 10 I had to also format my dedicated SSD, and from there I received an error message about the partition being an incorrect format and windows being unable to install to that drive. Undaunted I used my phone to google a fix for
 this new issue, and using a keyboard shortcut to bring up the command prompt I followed the instructions listed to re-format the drive in the correct partition format for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks PA Bear MS MVP, even though you didn't tell me exactly what to do, you still helped me gain a lot of insight to the issues by probing and helping in isolating the problem.</p>

<h2>            Stranded folder&#47;broken link</h2>
                    <p>There is a directory folder "stranded" on my desktop (Windows 10).&nbsp; I ctrl-c exited a script that was creating the directory and now it seems to be a link to nothing.&nbsp; It appears as a folder on the desktop.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the desktop (in Explorer), deleting the item
 produces the dialog box "Item not found"&nbsp; The icon can be moved, but not placed in the trash.&nbsp; However, it can't be moved to another folder.&nbsp; Refreshing the desktop doesn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a (administrator) CMD window, it appears in response to a DIR command, but all the other commands one can think of (ATTRIB, RMDIR, DEL) just come back either saying the name is incorrect or doing nothing in the case of del).&nbsp; There seems to be a broken
 symbolic link somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions for deleting it would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer, right click your C Drive and choose Properties
<br />
<br />Click on the Tools Tab and click Check
<br />
<br />Windows will refuse to check your system drive and ask you if you want to schedule check disc on startup, choose Yes, then restart your PC . ..

<p>Hi Ken,<br />
<br />
This could be a symbolic link set by the script that you mentioned. The steps required in deleting the symbolic links depends on the type of symbolic function used to create it. You might need to check the actual script or contact the provider of the script
 on what function was used. </p>

<p>Hi Ferdz, These are helpful links, but I haven't been able to use them to solve the problem.&nbsp; I did download and use junction (junction64 in my case) which indicates that there are no junction points in the desktop directory where the stranded icon resides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The script is mine.&nbsp; It has a MKDIR command to create a directory to contain log files it subsequently writes.&nbsp; I started the script, realized I would like to do something else, and cntl-c escaped out of it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Strangely enough, the script made the directory's
 name with a space at the end of the name (which is not in the script, nor has it done that before).&nbsp; I looked around and found the syntax &gt;rmdir "\\?\c:\users\&lt;username&gt;\desktop\&lt;directoryname&gt;".&nbsp; This worked, but I have no idea why (which is a little disturbing...).&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I believe it is a local account as i still have the option of signing in to my Microsoft&nbsp;account. I am the only user on my computer (Dell XPS 13 9365). As well as my password, my laptop can no longer properly shutdown in will only sleep then turn on and
 be in airplane mode. I have updated all the recent updates and had to reinstall the Bluetooth driver as Bluetooth was removed during the update.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you suspect someone is reading your email then change your password on the account.<br />
Check with the email provider.<br />
<br />
=========================================================<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />
(If Rootkits run UnHackMe)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />

<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />

            Solved this myslef.&nbsp;&nbsp;Created repair disk in Win 7 (control panel&gt;backup and restore&gt;create system repair disk).&nbsp; Moved pagefile to C: drive and booted with repair disk. &nbsp;Selected command prompt and found the FAT32 volume - note: it was&nbsp;Z: in Win7, but
 D: in the command&nbsp;prompt&nbsp;(dos) window.&nbsp; From the command prompt,&nbsp;typed, "format D: /fs:ntfs", without quotes.&nbsp; On re-boot got "missing bootmgr" message.&nbsp; So, I booted from the repair disk again and selected "Repair" option.&nbsp; It took two boots from the disk
 to complete the fix.&nbsp; Once Win7 opened, I moved the pagefile back to Z: drive and ran back-up utility.&nbsp; Back-up is in progress, 60% complete,&nbsp;but hasn't stopped yet, so I think I'm all set.

<h2>            Upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10, now World of Warcraft won&#39;t start up anymore.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a problem with World of Warcraft. I contacted the Technical Department of World of Warcraft but he/she could not help me and told me to contact Microsoft. I figured maybe one of you could help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everytime I try to start up the game it gives me the error: World of Warcraft has stopped working. I have located the error in MSInfo32 and it said that atkex_cmd.exe is causing the crash. I started looking for a solution and stumbled upon one from the ASUS
 ROG forums which told people to update their BIOS and install AI Suite III. Did that but I still get the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error never happened before when I was on Windows 7 two hours ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ahnkheg</p>

<h3> simon l. k.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Apps won&#39;t Launch after Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently, after much trouble, got my laptop to update with the anniversary version. That means I'm now running version 1607.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have run into an issue with the apps from the store, the store itself and the search button. None of them will launch. Every time I click on any of the apps from the start menu the tile goes a bit dark and a bar appears on it, which only loads
 3/4 of the way and then stops and nothing happens. In addition to this the search bar stopped functioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to fix this?</p>

            <p>Hi Rolando,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for you answer. I tried using the troubleshooter, with no results. It says the the Windows Store chache might be damaged but the solution the troubleshooter proposes (resetting the store and opening it again) doesn't yield any results.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there other solutions I can try? </p>

            <p>Rolando,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main computer at our office is experiencing the same problems as Simon's. &nbsp;I have tried running the Troubleshooter but all users, whether administrator or regular user, are local. &nbsp;The Troubleshooter recommends running with a Microsoft ID but the process
 for adding an ID won't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the Event Viewer, we're getting the following codes after trying to access the Start menu or Cortana:
</p>
<p>1000 Faulting application name: ShellExperienceHost.exe; </p>
<p>5973 Activation of app Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperienceHost_cw5n1h2xyewy!App failed with error: The remote procedure call failed. &nbsp;See the Microsoft-Windows-TWinUI/Operational log for additional information;&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Disable the antivirus software temporarily and test it by installing an app. If the issue is resolved, try to update the antivirus software. If there is none, I suggest removing it and enable Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To repair the damaged Windows files. Do the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Right-click the <strong>Start </strong>button and select Command Prompt (Admin)</p>
<p>2. At the prompt, type <strong>Dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></p>
<p>3. If the DISM command reports problems that cannot be fixed, stop here. There may be a memory or hard drive
<span>issue</span>. Windows needs to be Reset to repair the damage. </p>
<p>4. At the <strong>Command </strong>prompt, run this command next:</p>
<p><strong>Sfc /scannow</strong></p>
<p>5. Again, if problems are reported that cannot be fixed, stop here. There may be a memory or hard drive
<span>issue</span>. Windows needs to be Reset to repair the damage. </p>
<p>6. Run these two commands next: </p>
<p><strong>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted</strong></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Watch out for red errors, this could indicate a problem which cannot be repaired. If you see errors. Windows needs to be reset to repair it.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Rolando,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made it all the way to step 6 without any red text anywhere. When I tried to run the final command, it gave me an error message, saying that I needed to activate Windows Firewall, for the command to work. I then went to "run", typed services.msc and right
 clicked on Windows Firewall to make it start. It wouldn't start however. It says that I can find more information in "the system's log".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess my question now is, how do I make Windows Firewall start? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>

 (uwp). Notepad will open (win32). Settings, Store, Photos, Movies all won't open (uwp).

<h3> ringo prime  say:</h3>
<h2>            XB1X Scorpio Edition Controller issue</h2>
                    <p>I've just received my XB1X Scorpio Edition (yay!) and have noticed an annoying issue with the controller. When I plug the controller into my charging stand it doesn't register as charged, normally a red light will show that it's charging and a blue light when fully charged, I left the SE controller plugged in all night and it's still showing a red light. I also connected the controller via the USB cable and the charging light doesn't come on, it should either be orange or white, but nothing comes on.</p><p><br /></p><p>When turned on the console shows the controller is fully charged, and it is working normally and I tested my other controller and all the charging indicators work normally. I use official play and charge kits for both controllers and have tried swapping the batteries and the same thing happens, so it looks like the problem is local to the SE controller. </p><p><br /></p><p>I've also checked and the firmware is all up to date.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Any advice you could

 </blockquote> <p>Hi, as per my original post the problem seems local to the controller as it's having the same issue with the official XBOX USB cable. The controller itself appears to be charging, it's just not outputting it's charge status.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Megadream-Charging-Charger-Microsoft-Controller/dp/B00XOIKSCK/ref=sr_1_17?s=videogames&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1510220012&amp;sr=1-17&amp;keywords=xbox+one+charging+station" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This</a> is the charging stand I use for my controllers, but as I said before my other controller works fine with it. I am using the official XBOX play and charge kits for both controllers and swapping the batteries around has no effect, and as the controller is having the same kind of issue with the USB cable it's pretty clear the problem is with the controller and not any 3rd party devices.</p>

            <p>I'm having the same issue, Xbox One X Scorpio Edition and controller. I'm using the official Xbox play &amp; charge kit and while the battery is charging, the USB cable is not displaying the status light.&nbsp; Controller firmware is up-to-date.

 </blockquote> <p>Hi,</p><p>I was just checking out the forums for this exact problem I have as well. I use an official Microsoft play and charge kit (usb cable and battery) on the scorpio controller the LED fails to light and the battery does not charge, however if I swap the battery back into my original xbox one controller and keep everything else the same it works perfectly LED lights and the battery charges as normal. Was the charging system circuitry altered in the scorpio controllers?</p>

<h2>            Precision Touchpad</h2>
                    Hi. I own a Samsung series 9. Im not entirely sure if my laptop even has a Precision Touchpad. It does say that the system has a "Limited Touch Support with 5 Touch Points" I dont know if this really helps but i just want to ask if it is possible for my
 laptop to get a Precision Touchpad. Is there something I can download and install to get a Precision Touchpad. I recently updated my OS to the Windows 10, this is when I first learned of the Precision Touchpad.&nbsp;

            You don't say if you have installed the latest driver updates from the motherboard manufacturer. If you have and there is no change I would also ask questions on the manufacturers website.

<h2>            windows 10 pro reactivation after hardware change</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I have changed laptops and moved my SSD with all my data on it into the new computer. It did not have any compatibility issues, booted just fine, with all my settings still there. Before moving from one laptop to another, I have connected my Microsoft account
 to my digital licence for windows (build 1706) and then put my SSD into the new laptop. Problem is, when I try to reactivate windows, I have a message from Troubleshooter that it has found a digital licence for windows 10 home edition and I have pro. When
 I click on "I changed hardware" I can select my current computer to set it as active, but activation doesn't go through, I get a "failed, try again later" message. Is there anything I can do to get it activate my win10 pro, or do I have to reinstall windows
 to 10 home edition because it has decided my licence is not pro anymore but home?

            Hello,
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this: 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends) 
<br />Contact Microsoft at <a href="http://www.support.microsoft.com/contactus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.support.microsoft.com/contactus</a> through chat support. They would take control of your PC and activate(might need a proof of purchase) 
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.

            It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.
<br />
<br />	If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.

            <p>Hello Jonathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that the Xbox App is unresponsive when you try to launch it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation,&nbsp;I suggest you to<span><span>&nbsp;check for the latest Windows update in Windows&nbsp;which will&nbsp;help the PC&nbsp;to make optimal&nbsp;use of Windows 10 capabilities as well as helps in fixing any performance issues.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/getstarted-whats-new-november-release-cortana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">latest update of Windows&nbsp;10</span></a></strong>&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Now, refer to the below recommended methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to run the Windows in built troubleshooter: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>in the search box and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>
tab<strong>. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>view all</strong> option on the upper left corner.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Store apps&nbsp;</strong>option from the list.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Next to run the<strong> </strong>Troubleshooter.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, also refer to the below link to deploy the <span><span><strong>Troubleshooter for Windows 10 apps</strong></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, in order to eliminate any issues with Microsoft Sync in Windows, I would suggest you to deploy the Microsoft Account troubleshooter from the below which automatically resolves sync issues.</p>
<p>Ref: <span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/sign-up-create-account-cant-450-LEFKPM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/sign-up-create-account-cant-450-LEFKPM</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>Place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if there are any third party applications to be causing the slow down.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>A <strong>clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program.</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Steps mentioned for Windows 8/8.1, will work fine with Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Also, temporarily disable the antivirus/firewall software&nbsp;installed in your computer to check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">NOTE:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

<h2>            Call of Duty Elite Subscription</h2>

Call of Duty Elite
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwindows7themes.net%2fpics%2fcall-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-elite.JPG" /><br />
<br />
Hey everyone, I'm here to bring you know everything you need to know about the new
<strong>Call of Duty</strong> subscription based service entitled <strong>Call of Duty Elite</strong>. It is essentially a HUB for all things Call of Duty a la Bungie.net.<strong> Activision</strong> plans on charging gamers for the service as it offers extra
 content that can not be found straight out of the box. Activision has yet to release a price for the service but they announced portions of the service will be free. Activision wants to have it around the same price as other monthly subscription based programs
 such as Netflix, which charges $8/month. <br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi1125.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fl586%2fSpacey712%2fCodElite1.png" /><br />
<br />
A big feature for CoD Elite is a new tool that gamers will get to use. It allows you to check your in-game stats, analyze your performance, and give you feedback on how well you are playing on maps, with which guns, map overlays, etc. This feature was lightly
 touched upon in Call of <strong>Duty: Black Ops</strong> but not to the full extent as this service will provide.
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi1125.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fl586%2fSpacey712%2fCodElite4.png" /><br />
<br />
<br />
A trailer had been leaked detailing the service in a "comical" fashion. I use the term comical lightly as it stereotypes the average Call of Duty player in an insulting manner.
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi1125.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fl586%2fSpacey712%2fCodEliteWebsite.png" /><br />
<br />
The video has been taken down by Activision as fast as it went up. The reason being is most likely that there was a sneak peak of<strong> Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</strong>'s multiplayer within the trailer. It was nothing special, just a few character
 models and a map. You can hear a funny jingle right before the MW3 clip came up went a little like this:<br />
<br />
♫Legal's always circling, like the type of vultures, but instead of eating carcasses they eat all our fun♫<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi1125.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fl586%2fSpacey712%2fMW3MP2.png" /><br />
<br />
Whether or not this clip in the video is actual footage from Modern Warfare 3 has not yet been revealed. The graphics look extremely similar to that of Modern Warfare 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
All will be revealed soon as E3 is right around the corner. Till then we just have to salivate over 10 seconds of theater mode footage of MW3 someone working on Call of Duty Elite was willing to toss in to spite Activision.
<br />

<p>From what i've heard is that they are using the MW2 game engine slightly updated.</p>
<p>Paying for a games subscription to get free stat tracker and the odd free content ? ... nope doesn't pursuade me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see people who care about their so called precious "Kill/ Death ratio" getting the stat tracker.</p>
<p>In my eyes the project £10/ $10 scheme seems more pursuading.</p>

<h2>            Suddenly, only 3 of 4 monitors working on windows 10</h2>
                    Hello, I just reinstall windows 10, the first time that pc booted, windows installed their drivers for gtx770 and all 4 monitors was working properly.&nbsp;<br />
Suddenly and before I install the nvidia drivers, windows must have installed some chipset driver (all monitors go black and reopened again) an only 3 of the 4 monitors was working irrelevant of the port. I have tried to connect monitors in every way there
 is, I install all latest drivers, chipset and gpu but the problem remains, 3 monitors can work simultaneously.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I need help. Thank you.&nbsp;<br />
