    <title>Left Stick Drift Problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Left Stick Drift Problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I'm posting because I (like apparently many other customers) am having a problem with my Xbox One controller. My controller's left stick "drifts" to the top of the screen when untouched. It is not all of the time, but it is very frequent. When I attempted
 to go through the Support page, I received an error message since my controller is no longer under warranty. The representative via chat told me my options were to 1) pay $60 for a replacement, or 2) purchase a new controller. While I understand there is no
 obligation to fix the controller since the warranty has expired, this seems to be a widespread issue. Another thread on the topic (now locked) has 71 pages of discussion. It seems to me that this is a known and widespread issue, and I hope that Microsoft would
 be willing to do more for its customers (especially those of us who purchased the console early in its lifecycle).</p>

<p>If the only response is to contact support for a replacement, please do not bother replying since I have already pursued this route to no benefit. Thank you for your time.</p>

            <p>Hey there Thewagon29.</p>
<p>Sorry to hear you're having with issues with your controller. I'm afraid the 2 options that Chat Support provided you with are the correct options. If your controller is no longer in warranty &nbsp;a replacement is your best option to get you back with a properly working Xbox One controller. </p>

<p>Hi Mister Maka,</p>
<p>Thank you for the response. However, you do not really address the underlying issues here.
</p>
<p>1) I am far from the only person with this problem. Simply searching through the forums shows many other users (and given the timestamps primarily early Xbox One purchasers) with the same issue. I understand that things break, but there is enough here to
 make me think there is a design and/or part issue here. Buying another controller is just me spending money to encounter the same problem later.</p>
<p>2) You indicate that a replacement is the best option. I covered my problem with purchasing a controller from a retail partner above. If you're suggesting I acquire a replacement from Microsoft, the customer support representative quoted me a price above
 what controllers sell for at retail stores (and I'm assuming I would have to pay for shipping as well which makes that worse).</p>
<p>If Microsoft chooses to abandon their customers, that is fine - they have that option. However, I do not see why I should spend $60 (the price of a new game) for something Microsoft knows has problems and will not support after 90 days. I would be better
 served purchasing a game for a different system - at least I know the developer will continue supporting it for a longer period of time. Thank you for your time and hopefully further consideration.</p>

<p>Hey Thewagon29, </p>
<p>I could not agree with you more. &nbsp;I have just had the exact same experience with MS support just today. Let me tell you a story about a boy named little Timmy (me).
</p>
<p>Little Timmy purchased his Xbox One on release and loved every single minute of it. Unfortunately for little Timmy, after 4 months his controller started ghosting (the problem you state). Luckily for little Timmy, his controller was "under warranty" and
 little Timmy sent it off to be repaired. But oh wait, little Timmy had nothing to play on his Xbox with so he went out and purchased an additional controller to use whilst he waited for his replacement Day One to be returned.
</p>
<p>Little Timmy didn't need two controller as he was the only one who played on his Xbox but little Timmy was happy and playing candidly with his new controller. Suddenly, &nbsp;there was a knock at the door and It was the postman carrying little Timmy's brand new
 replacement Day One controller, "oh the joy" he exclaimed. Now little Timmy over the moon and was the proud owner of two working controllers......... until the very next day that is.</p>
<p>Little Timmy's (spare) controller that he had purchased to use whilst his original one was being replaced had acquired the very same issue his original controller had experienced. Noooooo! little Timmy cried, but his tears were shortlvied when he remembered
 his replacement Day One. Now all little Timmy had to do was send his newly broken one away to be repaired.
</p>
<p>Fast forward and little Timmy's controller was replaced and now had two new versions of the original two he had bought controllers number 3&amp;4.. Over the next 8 months, both controllers broke (exact same left stick ghosting issue). Little Timmy was upset
 and confused, he didn't know who to turn to. Maybe Xbox support? Yes, the Xbox Service center will help me out, he figured.
</p>
<p>Little Timmy now sits looking at his Xbox and dreaming about a day when his need to go out and purchase his third Xbox One controller within 18months because Microsoft refuse to acknowledge a massive widespread design floor of some variety.
</p>
<p>It's a completely poor show for Microsoft to turn a blind eye to this. Little Timmy will effectively have to go out and buy controller number 5 since launch. This again, will most likely last the average 4.5 months and he will then have to buy controller
 number 6 come early next year. </p>
<p>Seriously Microsoft/Xbox Team, you really need to sort this out, or don't. But I can name at least 5 of my regular friends that have the exact same issues going on and I've probably only asked 6 of them.
</p>
<p>Disenchanted, </p>
<p>Little Timmy</p>

            <p>Hey GDrive,</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the controller trouble you're having. As I mentioned above, I'm afraid this particular issue is something that would require purchasing a replacement if it's outside of warranty. Really sorry to hear the frustrations, if you have any other questions be sure to create a new thread detailing the information. </p>

<p>it's not MS's fault, not originally anyways, it's FoxConn's fault for making cheap stuff and MS hasn't held them accountable, however MS's engineers and support staff should be on correcting this, and they're not, they most likely going to ignore your problems
 and shut up anybody who complains about it</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am also having the same issue in that I have been through the command prompt, successfully created the recovery partition on my SSD and am now trying to create the recovery drive using&nbsp;a usb but am unable to select the "Copy the recovery partition from
 the PC to the recovery drive" check box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any ideas?</p>

            My windows 8 OS had to be reinstalled and the OEM partition was deleted even though I used the computer manufacturer's OS disk to reinstall. I followed the directions in the link given above and the box is grayed out. If we no longer have the OEM partition,
 does this mean we cannot create a USB Recovery drive or is there some work-around?

            Hi Tadasha,
<div><br />
<div>I had a upgraded version of windows 8 from xp and now i have upgraded to windows 8.1</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now when I am trying to create the recovery drive its the same problem, I am unable to select "<i>copy the recovery partition from the pc to the recovery drive</i>". Its been grayed out as you mentioned.&nbsp;</div>
<div>So does this mean that I can go ahead without selecting this and create a recovery drive.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did successfully create a drive this way but its hardly 245MB whereas the recovery folder&nbsp;<i>(RefreshImage</i>) which I created following this link "&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive</a>&nbsp;"
 is around 6.20 GB on my hard disk&nbsp;.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>My worry is whether the recovery drive I created is valid one and if it will work when needed ??</div>
        </p>

            I have a similar problem - brand new (non-OEM) fresh Win 8 installation,, a large size recovery folder in c:\RefreshImage and a greyed out&nbsp; "<span><font><font color="#000000"><b>Copy contents from the recovery partition to the recovery drive".&nbsp;
</b></font></font></span>The process isn't hung, so that's not the problem. <br />
<br />
I have read as much as I could about this issue here and in other places, but I still don't get it:&nbsp; Is it possible or impossible to create a recovery drive under these conditions?
<br />
<br />
If impossible, is there any way to back up the operating system and settings in case the c:\ drive fails? Can I create a bootable USB recovery drive by manually copying the RefreshImage folder onto a USB drive? How about creating a second RefreshImage folder
 on another hard drive on the same computer?<br />

            I too had the problem with the with the box for copy contents from the recovery partition to the recovery drive being grayed out.<br />
<br />
I found that I could create a system image drive by going to the Windows 7 file recovery page. If you look at the upper left side of the screen, you will see "create a system image". I clicked here and was able to download the image of the internal hard drive
 on an external drive. It takes up about 65gb's of space.<br />
<br />
After this process was completed, a box came up and asked if I wanted to create a Windows Repair Disk.
<br />
First, I had to insert the manufacturer's windows 8 disk into the DVD drive. The computer downloaded the information and then prompted me to remove the OS disk and insert a blank DVD, and completed the repair disk. This process took about 10 minutes.
<br />
<br />
I believe that the system image is supposed to backup all of the OS, its settings, drivers, all of my software and files so if my computer crashes I should be able to reload everything from the external drive.
<br />
<br />
I am not a computer IT so I'm unsure if this is doing the same thing that the gray box was intended to do, or if it will work as I believe it should.&nbsp; Hopefully Microsoft or someone will respond.

<h2>            Blue screen involving Steam and ntkrmlnp.exe</h2>
                    <p>I was away from my computer and had it downloading a game through steam. I came back to find that it had crashed. My specs are :&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel core i5 4690K at stock clocks with a Coolermaster hyper 212 evo (so it's not a heating issue)</p>
<p>Gigabyte B85-HD3</p>
<p>Corsair Vengeance 4x2 gb</p>
<p>Western digital 500gb and excelstor 160gb hard drives</p>
<p>Asus Strix 750Ti&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asus Xonar DG sound card</p>
<p>600 watt power supply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer was idling with a bunch of tabs open at opera and steam downloading. At the time of the crash I had daemon tools installed because I don't have a cd drive and now I uninstalled it. Rainmeter had not caused any issue the past month I am using
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the hardware is fine because I was stress testing it yesterday for an hour with great results.</p>

<h2>            Cell phones from verizon showing up in our private network.</h2>
                    They show up in windows 8 file explorer "network" but do not show up in Network Magic.&nbsp; These are new events. Why? Thanks.

<p>I ended up calling tech support for my wireless router. In my case if I&nbsp;disabled the WPS Automatic Security Configuration (WPS), the problem went away. I was told that even though these phones did not show up when doing a "Net View" they may indeed have
 been using my wireless connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not&nbsp;100% clear on&nbsp;what this option&nbsp;is used for, but if I understand correctly, turning it off&nbsp;may cause problems if you are using a wireless printer or other device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else want to clarify this issue? I'd appreciate it.</p>

<p><br />
It's basically meant to be a simplified way of connecting assorted WPS compatible&nbsp;Wifi enabled devices to&nbsp;a secured network. It's often enabled by default on routers that&nbsp;feature WPS but it&nbsp;isn't at all necessary for normal use. When it was&nbsp;newly installed&nbsp;my&nbsp;router&nbsp;picked
 up my neighbour's routers that also had WPS enabled. A bit disconcerting to see the&nbsp;external network connections show up on my LAN&nbsp;but there was no cross communication as there wasn't any shared security key either way. The router simply reported the existence
 of potential WPS network&nbsp;connections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Disabling WPS shouldn't be a problem, especially if you don't actually use it to connect any devices to your network (Verizon freeloaders notwithstanding).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since WPS was apparently cracked a few years ago it is probably better if you do disable it in any case.</p>

            I had the same issue of a Verizon Driod phone appearing on my network. Reset my security and its still there, then vanishes periodically. I can see the model number and mac address, but that's all, the rest of the information is blocked.

            <p>Phones started showing up on my network also.&nbsp; One named Shamu, a Nexus 6 phone with MAC address 44:80:eb;76:fb:f7.&nbsp; I blocked that MAC address, and the same phone came in with another MAC address.&nbsp; Iblocked it three times , then right clicked and pinned
 it to my desktop, where I went in to properties and disabled everything I could.&nbsp; the next day another phone.&nbsp; HTCOP-4E1,&nbsp; MAC address 84:7a:88:1d:2e:14.&nbsp; what to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did turn my WEP Off, but now my daughter cant get on the new Verizon Modem.&nbsp; guess I'll have to limit the MAC Addresses that can get onto my network.</p>

            I have a similar issue. When I first switched to Win 8, my internet worked it just didn't work on the start screen applications. I had someone from Mircosoft look into my computer and he reset what appeared to be the network because the computer didn't
 see the actual connection. Now when I went to Win 8.1 I have no internet at all.&nbsp;

</p><p>I even do have the same problem. Marvell Support do not update their driver for Windows 8.1, have to use the generic driver from the Windows Drivers list. I even contact the Motherboard Support, they simple say that it is not compatible for Windows 8.1!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I try around with the 3G Broadband, WiFi.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update failed, black screen with cursor, task manager fails</h2>
                    <p>About a month ago, Windows 10 automatically updated, and ever since I've been unable to use the computer.&nbsp; After login I just get a black screen with cursor, no icons.&nbsp; The cursor is either a white arrow or a spinning blue icon.&nbsp; I've looked up videos and
 other solutions that all say to access the task manager and run explorer.exe or regedit.&nbsp; However, when I use ctrl + alt + del to run task manager, nothing happens; just sends me back to the black screen and cursor.&nbsp; The same happens in safe mode.&nbsp; Nothing
 works:&nbsp; no clicking, right-clicking, ctrl + shift + esc, no windows logo + P, no task manager, no start menu, nothing on taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the shift + restart to go back to previous Windows version, reset, and all the troubleshooting methods.&nbsp; I've unplugged everything except the keyboard and monitor (there were no other peripherals except the mouse and network cable).&nbsp; I even removed
 the graphics card and reverted to the integrated VGA monitor port.&nbsp; Nothing from all the videos and posts I've researched works without the task manager working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally got the reset PC to using the shift + restart method.&nbsp; I hope it is successful, but I know this will basically reset the computer to factory default.&nbsp; Is there anything else I could've tried short of a clean install...should this happen again?!</p>

            Did you try creating a new user account?
<br />
<br />Sounds like you have logged into a temporary profile. Try restarting your computer a few times. Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />At the sign in screen, click the power button, then click Restart. Do this a few times then try signing again. If the desktop still does not show up, then you will need to  create a new local user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Shift + Esc
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Enter a user name
<br />Password, confirm it, create a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Finish
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files 
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account. 
<br />
<br />Or
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />
<br />Type: explorer.exe
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Another option is to to kill the File Explorer process completely.
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />
<br />Type: CMD
<br />Hold down the the shift key
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Type: 
<br />taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Exit Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />
<br />Type: explorer.exe
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/block-windows-10-feature-update-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/block-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of the above work and your system is still functioning after the reset:
<br />
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy

            <p>Hi Kim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was the computer reading the pictures before? If YES, did you make any significant hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a possibility that the folder on the card that contains the pictures <span>
may</span> be hidden. You might need to show hidden files and folders as detailed below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Windows explorer.</li><li>Click on <strong>View</strong> in the toolbar above.</li><li>Click on <strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>In the Folder Options window,&nbsp;go to the <strong>View</strong> tab.</li><li>Under Hidden files and folders, click the radio button for <strong>Show hidden files, folders and drives</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Try inserting the SD card and browse the files. Check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another reason could be some third party software conflict that is rendering the folder empty. So, you may try booting your system in a selective startup to figure out and eliminate the program that is causing the issue and check if you are able to browse
 your pictures.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Results verified by WinDBG, DumpCHK, and BlueScreenView.<br />
<br />
The Bug_Check were all 9F CAUSE usbhub.sys which means something else drove<br />
it into Fault. Root cause was likely <strong>AiCharger.sys</strong> ASUStek Charger Driver.<br />
<br />
BugCheck 9F, {3, fffffa800b445060, fffff80000ba2748, fffffa8007b03470}<br />
Probably caused by : usbhub.sys<br />
<br />
Further analysis shows :<br />
<br />
<strong>AiCharger.sys</strong> dated 5/5/2010 ASUStek Charger Driver. This could be the driver,<br />
the charing/battery hardware, or both.<br />
<br />

<br />
Check with ASUStek Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in<br />
their forums about any known issues with that model. Update the BIOS, low level<br />
chipset drivers, and the major on-board device drivers.<br />

            <p><span>Hi Eric,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are getting a popup on your desktop to reactivate your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on the description of the issue it seems like you have exceeded license for an application that you are using in Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To check whether Windows is activated or not, refer to the article below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-can-I-tell-if-Windows-7-is-activated" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-can-I-tell-if-Windows-7-is-activated</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try performing a clean boot to know which application is causing the problem and may contact the Application support team so that they can help you in activating the Application.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link below to perform Clean Boot</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Perform a Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot allows the Windows operating system to launch without any additional programs or services running when you turn the computer on. This allows you to determine if computer issues are caused by a program
 or service that starts up when you boot the machine<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Refer:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After performing the troubleshooting steps for clean boot refer the section
<strong><span>“how to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps, get back to us if you need further assistance with Windows.</span></p>

<p>Hi, I have instaled the codecs to play .flv files corectly and the "Play with WMP" entry apears in the explorer context menu, but how do I get the enqueue or add to playlist menu item to be the same as the context menu for other files ?</p>
<p>I know it probably requires &nbsp;a regestry edit, as the old dialogues to do this seem to have been dumbed down.</p>
<p>Im surprised a&nbsp;search did&nbsp;not seem to have come up with the necessary registry entries, anyone able to provide them , a&nbsp;auto registry insert file would be cool.</p>

<p><span>Hi CoolColin,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You cannot add the Windows Media player Playlist to the Windows Explorer context menu. This is by
 design. This cannot be done by&nbsp;editing or modifying the registry entries too.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>However, you may post your suggestion or feedback on this incase you would like to see this implemented
 in the future. </span></p>

<p>I think your reply is grossly in error, firstly the explorer context menu&nbsp;already has such feature for other files.</p>
<p>Secondly this is not by design, as there is no design document which pertains to the sale of Windows 7&nbsp;and any bundled software wich details such behavour, nor any such document in any of the much more detailed SDKs or anywhere on MSDN which details this
 bizzare situation.</p>
<p>thridly no sane person would design a system specifying this specific behavour, where some file types have the functionality specified by registry entries but, but this specific file type does not, but further than this the functionaility is excluded for
 these types.</p>
<p>fourthly, &nbsp;this isnt a future issue, this has been available before, I have done this in windows XP, you even had a menu where you could add more than the "open" context menu entry, likly it was possible with win2K, although ive a job&nbsp; to remember that far
 back now.</p>
<p>fifthly, whats the point of asking for something to be implemented in the future when you seem to be steadily removing features.</p>
<p>im&nbsp;not sure sixthly is a real word so&nbsp;I'l stop now,,,</p>
<p>5&nbsp;major mistakes in 3 sentances, whats going on here ? does microsoft not get enough money to do these things anymore ?</p>
<p>I wont be keen on buying any more mircosoft products at this rate.</p>

<p>thanks, I tried something like that I think, but cant be 100% sure it was exactly the same, I was copying entries from the .mp4 changing everything to .flv but wasnt getting anyhwere untill I set&nbsp;the type to video/mp4.</p>
<p>I dont like hacking the registry, its an awfull maze to try and decipher without any documentation for what each entry does, and a easy accident can easily cripple the system so you cant even restore anything.&nbsp;the "delegateexecute" entries are a new one
 on me, I wonder if its a real function pointer ?</p>
<p>heres what ive got now anyway,</p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.flv]<br />
@="WMP11.AssocFile.MP4"<br />

@="{9DBD2C50-62AD-11D0-B806-00C04FD706EC}"</p>
<p>------------</p>
<p>I was thinking of adding new entries for .flv for the refernce to WMP11.AssocFile.xxx but it seems to work fooling it its mp4.</p>
<p>oh and it seems I have WMP11 not 12 as I thought,, its easy to lose track.</p>
<p>next chalange is to get the icon to be the same video preview like the others,&nbsp;the K-Lite codecs have an option when you install it to do this I think, but doesnt seem to be something you can select after install, I fnd a registry edit to addd the entry
 it wld at install, but didnt seem to work.</p>
<p>Im somewaht dismayed that a microsoft support person (or is it just someone pretending to be)&nbsp; has actually said you cant do this ! instead of being helpfull.</p>
<p>this gives the impression that anything microsoft support say is totally 100% unreliable.</p>

<p>DelegateExecute is just a more complicated way to add items to a file type's context menu, instead of specifying the path to the program that needs to run. See&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/03/12/9977246.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/03/12/9977246.aspx</a>
 if you're interested in the details.</p>
<p>DelegateExecute will only work on Windows 7 and WMP 12. As you have WMP 11, and WMP 11 is not available on Windows 7, what version of Windows are you running then? XP or Vista? (in both cases, this is the wrong forum)</p>

<p>well thats a very good question Indeed, I know I definatly have windows 7 64 bit, no doubt about that, and I initialy thought I had WMP12 as thats what comes with win7 as standard, but the registry entries refer to WMP11, so I assumed id been mistaken about
 it being WMP12.</p>
<p>obviously its likely that the registry entries that refer to "WMP11" have&nbsp;simply not been updated.</p>
<p>so I would gues I have WMP12.</p>
<p>nearly all programs since win3.11 have a help menu and on the help menu there is an about entry, and that tells you what version it is, I looked for the same on WMP12(11?) but its not there. now it seems you have to find some program to check the dll or
 whatever,,,</p>
<p>thanks for the info on the DelegateExecute, il have a look later, it would be interesting if most of the significant registry entries are explained.</p>
<p>I knew my way round nt3.51 but since then ive not written many windows device drivers.</p>

To get the Help menu in WMP, you need to press Ctrl+M.<br />

<p>oh wow yeah, thats realy usefull thanks, its version 12, :) so WMP11 in the registry is just a red herring, I wonder&nbsp;if it will stay for the next few versions, save me updating such entries etc,,</p>

<h2>            Why is Skype asking me to update billing information when I have the free version&#63;</h2>
                    I've used Skype before and it was free. But recently when I try to sign into my Skype account, the next window says "Skype can't connect." So I click below on "Problems signing in?" and it takes me to a web page where I sign in again, then it takes me
 to a web page which says at the top "Please update your billing address to enjoy the full Skype experience." In the left column of this page it says $2.99/month. But all information I check on the web says Skype is free. What's wrong?

Sorry I wasn't able to reply sooner. Just now I tried to paste a screenshot into this email reply, but nothing happens; then I tried the icon on the menu to insert an image of it (screenshot pasted onto a docx), tried to upload it, and a message popped up saying
 "Invalid file type." I don't know what else to do.<br />
To answer your questions, my operating system is Windows 10, Skype version is<br />

<p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>
I can't find saving format options in the Edge browser, only the print option. Internet Explorer would only allow me to save it as an htm, not a jpeg, and when I try to upload the htm file I still get the message "Invalid file type." So I saved it as a pdf,
 tried to upload it and again "Invalid file type."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It appears to me that Microsoft support needs to fix this communication system to allow for the upload and insertion of more file types. I can easily take screen shots and paste them right into my Outlook emails. This system should surely have the same capability.<br />
<br />
The best I can do is tell you that the address of this strange page is https://secure.skype.com/portal/overview. Near the top it says "My account." Below that is my name and picture. To the right there's a pink bar, and inside of it are the words "Please update
 your billing address to enjoy the full Skype experience." To the right of that is the word "Modify" which is a hyperlink that takes me to a page of blanks to insert my address, etc.<br />
<br />
I can also tell you that this happens when I click the Skype icon on my computer desktop. But when I go to my Microsoft account online and go to my Skype account there, I can access it just fine. In the past I've been able to simply click on the Skype icon
 on my desktop and log into Skype that way, but not anymore.<br />
<br />
Steve</p>
