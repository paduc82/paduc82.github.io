    <title>NO START BUTTON ON WINDOWS 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sylver51  say:</h3>
<h2>            NO START BUTTON ON WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    UPGRADED TO WINDOWS 10 FROM 8.1 ON 31st JULY. It worked great for about 3 hours and I WAS IMPRESSED but then the START BUTTON stopped working, CORTANA stopped working, NO EDGE and I have NO ACCESS to SETTINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The only thing working is Chrome.
 No matter what I try it has error messages, file missing messages etc, etc. I cannot refresh, reset, restart, or even shut down unless I remove the battery. I've tried contacting Microsoft every day since it happened but can't get through to anyone,( 2 hours
 waiting on phone yesterday). I put a thread on here on Sat/Sun. No help! Do Microsoft even look at these pages????? This is not a little glitch microsoft, it's a HUGE PROBLEM! DO SOMETHING! &nbsp;

            <p>Not really the&nbsp;direct answer to your problems but I had the same issues. I upgraded to Windows 10 &nbsp;without issues but then&nbsp; post upgrade there was a&nbsp; cumulative upgrade of Windows over night and next morning I found my PC locked up so I reset the power and
 found everything working except the Start button, Task Bar and many of the new feature of Windows 10 had failed such as Apps Store, Edge and Cortana had failed.</p>
<p>I did a system restore and found this returned the task bar and some other features but still no Edge. I tried many things to resolve including various&nbsp;Microsoft recommendations but nothing would return Edge (although all other browsers worked fine).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually after thinking long and hard I carried out&nbsp; a return&nbsp;to Windows 7 &nbsp;(via settings - update and&nbsp;security&nbsp;- recovery) and to my amazement I was returned to Windows 7 in only a couple of minutes. Apparently you only have a month to do this though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I than went to Microsoft and downloaded the MediaCreationTool which is the manual download for Windows 10. Followed the&nbsp;install instructions and&nbsp;after the new reinstallation of Windows 10 all&nbsp;is working fine and dandy.
</p>
<p>As I had only installed Windows 10 a few days ago nothing file wise was lost and the new install was perfect.</p>
<p>Hope this helps others solve their issues. Maybe not the perfect&nbsp;IT answer though to solving the issue which clearly many have.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Since resolving my Start menu, Edge, Cortana issues by returning to Windows 7 and then back to 10 I'm running pretty well apart from I discovered my power down, sleep mode was not fully shutting down and leaving the computer running when it should have been
 asleep. This was preventing upgrades completing fully and I think caused my Start button problems in the first place. I had seen two upgrades simply hang and I needed to perform a full hard shut down to restart the PC.</p>
<p>I have since discovered the issue lies with the power settings. I had mine set to a high performance setting. I reduced this to a moderate setting and also disabled some none essential options in advanced power settings such as USB selective suspend. I'm
 sure these were stopping my PC from sleeping correctly and have had no issues&nbsp;since.&nbsp;</p>

            Did you even read all of his description? I am having the same problem and can't log into Windows 10. And no I don't have any disks because as far as I know it's download only. So by that logic alone I cannot go to the link and download the file. So please
 have an intelligent answer next time or just send the disks.

            <p>Hi, sorry for not replying sooner, In the end the only thing I could do was boot up and in the split second I had before the system fully booted I managed to get it into safe mode by holding down the shift button and clicking the power button and choosing
 restart (while still holding the shift button). when booted in safe mode I managed to choose a system restore which reverted it back to windows 7 and i've not tried to reinstall since. I've not attempted the fix given as the license key has rubbed off and
 I can no longer read it if I need to put 7 back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll just have to leave it as windows 7 and not upgrade i think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>R.</p>

            <p>Hi Ray, thanks for the possible solution you found.</p>
<p>I just did not understand what you meant by clicking the power button while holding Shift. Is that a physical button or something on screen? If it is on screen, I am out of luck, as I cannot get to this screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also second Matthew's lack of satisfaction with MS Support Engineer Divya who attempted to answer the question. The tech really did not read the description.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem, the computer is stuck on a boot loop. All I get are the 'Sys Thread Exception...' screen and another 'Preparing Automatic Repair'.</p>
<p>The second screen will also loop back to the 'Sys Thread&nbsp;Exception...' and I cannot get out of it.</p>
<p>I also tried creating a USB using the Media Creation Tool (32-bit), but when I tried to boot with this, it goes into the same loop.</p>
<p>My original system was a Win 7, and I don't have the disks to revert back to that Op Sys.</p>
<p>Please help...</p>
<p>Thanks Rogerio</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi Rogerio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to hold down the shift key as the windows icons start to load, then in the process of the machine booting click on the windows icon (the start one on the left) and the menu pops up, you then need to click on the power icon and then click on restart
 while shift is still being held down (I held shift until it started to boot back up), this took quite a few attempts over a few days as the small window you have before it fully boots is very very small and blue screened quite a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>R.</p>

            <p>Hello again Rogerio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just tried something else on my laptop which successfully updated to windows 10 with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can, as the machine is booting you may get to a log in screen if you do you can try the following, before you put your password in there are power options on the bottom right hand side of the screen (these where not available to me when I was trying
 to fix my wife's laptop), if you can pick restart from there you can hold down the shift key and click the restart option and it does boot into safe mode from there without starting windows properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know if it makes a difference but as I pressed the power button to start my laptop I was holding down the shift key and repeatedly tapping F8 before the log on screen appeared but this step may not be needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>R.</p>

            <p>Thank you Ray for the help,<br />
</p>
<p><span>I tried both methods as you described them, but did not get the same results as you did.</span></p>
<p><span>When powering up the machine:</span></p>
<p><span>1 - I get a Windows logo in the middle of the screen and what you meant by "process of the machine booting click on the windows icon (the start one on the left)"&nbsp;does not happen. There is not Windows Icon on the left, nor anything that
 can be clicked on.</span></p>
<p><span>2 - It changes to the famed blue screen with the Thread Exception.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I held the Shift key, but the computer will not move forward&nbsp;until I release it.</span></p>
<p><span>As you mentioned, you had to try this for several days until it worked. I am doing the same, so far‚Ä¶ no luck.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As for the second post, I never get to any login screen.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand the objective, which is to load Windows in safe mode, and I will keep trying to get there‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><span>Problem is I am not being able to get out of the loop ( Windows Logo in the middle of the screen and Blue Screen of Death.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I will keep trying these fixes and research others as well.</span></p>
<p><span>Once I figured out something that works for me, I will post the solution here.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thanks once more for the help and I hope your wife‚Äôs laptop stays alive for good now.</span></p>
<p><span>Cheers,</span></p>

            <p><span><span>Having created a new account and a new avatar, I found the same error (described above). </span><span>The
 essence of the problem is that when you create an avatar (using the 
site or the Avatar application), the avatar you selected (template), 
which you are offered, automatically becomes your avatar. </span><span>And
 even after changing the appearance and buying things on it will be 
displayed that "template avatar," not the one that you did. </span><span>This applies to Windows 8 and the services you access using the Microsoft account. </span><span>I do not know how things are when using the XBOX console but on the PC version everything as I described.<br /></span><span>But it does not even amaze these small errors (bug), but the fact that those. </span><span>Support absolutely for this "do not care" ... And it really upsets. </span><span>When I chatted with people from those. </span><span>Support
 one of them wrote to me that this is due to the old version of the 
software, which is not currently supported and therefore it can not help
 me. </span><span>Tell
 me please about what the old software is talking about if the 
application "Avatar" is still operational (also applies to the site). </span><span>I have one answer: In those. </span><span>Support are incompetent employees who have nothing to do with developers. </span><span>And then I have a question to the Microsoft management that in their understanding represents those. </span><span>user support? </span><span>Because in my understanding of those. </span><span>Support should solve certain technical problems, and not ignore and look for excuses ("If we could help you"). </span><span>You wrote this product and only you, the developers, can fix it. </span><span>Or am I wrong? </span><span>And
 do not send users of your service to a dead forum where none of the 
developers even appear ... I had a greater opinion about Microsoft until
 this day. </span><span>And I can wish you only one thing: If you do something, do it well or do not even start!</span></span></p>

    <title>Headphones not set as default Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Headphones not set as default Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so to start off, I didn't even realize this was a problem until something came up with skype. &nbsp;For some reason I can only set my headphones as the default communications device and not just the default. &nbsp;The weird thing is, I can still hear sound from
 them, yet it shows it's coming from the speakers. &nbsp;If I disable the speakers, it's louder on my headphones but I can no longer make the volume go up or down. &nbsp;Also for awhile, every time I'd plug my headphones it, a window used to pop up asking which device
 I was using and it's no longer doing that. &nbsp;So I suppose that's where the problem started. &nbsp;I have an HP EliteBook, if that helps at all (and obviously windows 10 as well)</p>

            hi Muhammad.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Fix here for the error:  
<br /><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uplay/comments/6nqiwn/upcexe_error_all_of_a_sudden/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/uplay/comments/6nqiwn/...</a>

<br />
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service tag from sticker on PC.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />If this fails I would run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This repairs most problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello, this may be an error due to a corrupt installation of that program. Uninstall it once, then reinstall the application and see if that fixes the issue. If this does not work, try running Windows 10 in compatibility mode. More on that here:

            Hi muhammad
<br />
<br />You should download and install the latest version of UPlay from UbiSoft to see if that resolves this error for you . . .

<p>The error you are getting is&nbsp;STATUS_DLL_INIT_FAILED.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Presumably upc.exe is not able to initialise a DLL it depends on.&nbsp; If it can't find a DLL, I'd expect the error to have been&nbsp;&nbsp;0xc0000135 STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND so it might require a little more debugging work than just running Process Monitor looking for file
 not found/access denied (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) although that would be a good start to get a quick overview of what might be happening to the upc.exe process.<br />
</p>
<p>I would do as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Download the Software Development Kit (SDK) of the platform you are on.&nbsp; For example:<br />
Windows 10:<br />
<a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Win 10 SDK">https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk</a></p>
<p>Windows 7:<br />
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=8279" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Win 7 SDK Download">https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=8279</a><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> You can Google SDK and the OS version and it should be the top result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Install the "Debugging Tools for Windows" feature,.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Note the install location when installing as you will need it later.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Once complete you will have a directory such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64\<br />
</p>
<p>The applications in the directory we will be using are:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>gflags.exe</li><li>cdb.exe</li></ul>
<p>1. Launch an administrative command prompt.<br />
<br />
2. Change directory to where the tools above are installed to. e.g.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">CD "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64\"</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Run the command:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">gflags.exe /i upc.exe +sls<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This will turn on loaded snaps for the upc.exe process. Essentially creating the registry keys:</p>
GlobalFlag = 2<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\upc.exe<br />
GlobalFlag = 2<br />
</p>
</p><p>4. In the same command prompt then run (one line):</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Change the path to upc.exe if required.<br />
<br />
I assume you will then see a stream of text go by and you''ll end up with the same error in your original post.&nbsp; You can dismiss the error.&nbsp; Then in the command prompt at the "0:000&gt;" prompt you can type the following commands hitting enter after each:
</p>
QUIT&nbsp;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Under %temp% you will have the log file logloader.txt.&nbsp; If you can post/attach the contents that would be helpful.<br />
<br />
To remove the loader snaps for this process, run:</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">gflags.exe /i upc.exe -sls</p>

<p>This is not a size limit issue. You don't have any partitions on the<br />
drive. You need to format the drive, which establishes a partition. It<br />
will then have a drive letter.</p>

<h3> collinroberts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reverting back to genuine Windows 10 Home from Windows 10 Pro validated with KMSpico</h2>
                    <p>I have a client who has an HP all in one desktop that originally came with Windows 7 home. This was upgraded to Windows 10 home during the free upgrade period. This version of Windows crashed, and for some reason a computer guy installed Windows 10 Pro and
 validated it with KMSpico.</p>
<p>I want to remove this and install Windows 10 home back on the machine. My question is, will the Windows 10 Home product key be stored in the BIOS enabling installation and validation of Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>If I run produkey, it comes up with the Win 10 Pro product key. </p>

            Hi Collin.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />When it was upgraded to the correct Home version it should have issued a Digital License stored in MS activation servers, which will reactivate after install and connecting to the internet.  Just skip the Product Key during install.  It will no longer respond to any Product Key except the generic Version key for home which will be present after install, so don't change it.
<br />
<br />We are seeing a rash of shops doing this, which is felony piracy.  So if you want to report it to Microsoft here is how:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/report.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/r...</a>
<br />
<br />It's important also to wipe the old install off the drive completely to get rid of the illegal KMS key only to be used by large organizations and businesses who activate with on-site servers which regularly require reactivation or it expires.  So be sure to delete all partitions off the drive during install, then click Next to auto-create and -format the necessary partitions and begin install -  this makes it foolproof.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated steps here for doing the best possible Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />The media is provided in the first step.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    How do I sync windows live photo gallery across two computers?&nbsp; I thought if I had photos saved in it that were loaded through my work computer, I would then be able to login and pull them up on my home computer.

            <p>Not necessarily in that way,</p>
<p>You can access the files through skydrive using the same sign in or just put the files in Public View and Edit folders where you can access and download them if you want to,</p>
<p>This thread has some very good screen shots on how to make Public folders,</p>

<p><span>There are some advantages with using live mesh but there are also disadvantages,</span></p>
<p><span>Editing files when using mesh reflects the changes automatically, not always what a user would want to do, by altering the original file on skydrive,</span></p>
<p><span>Accessing the files from skydrive and just downloading the ones you want to and possibly editing, then re uploading them to skydrive will offer you a couple of choices,</span></p>
<p><span>Replace/ or have both files stored, this is what mesh will not give you.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Jo0O_911,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you added you gmail account on Windows Live Mail on someone else's computer, you will need to remove the account from Mail completely. To do this, just right click your account name on the left side panel of Mail and choose remove account. Otherwise,
 your account will remain there and emails might be viewed by someone else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi Johan,&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Thanks for you reply mate! No one else uses my laptop other than me. So should I just click on the little x on the right top corner on the window? If yes then will that lead to any loss of data? Also I am aware that you can't just close the window in
 a normal gmail account because it leaves a door open for hackers, won't that mean the same thing for windows live?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once again thanks for your help!</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see that you want to log out from the gmail account which is an added email account in WLM.
</p>
<p><span>What I advise you to do is to log out properly from WLM to avoid hackers from invading your account. Below are the steps to do this:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Click the drop-down arrow above <b>Email Message.</b></span></p>
<p><span>2. Click <b>Exit.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Logging out from WLM will also log you out from the added account in it. Since its Gmail is an added account, then contacts and emails are stored in the folders after this account was configured in WLM.</span></p>
<p><span>Logging out does not lose these emails in the account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>It doesn't exist yet, the team is busy building it for the next update later this year.
</p>
<p>You can use another program to get a small "Classic" start menu, something like
<a href="http://www.stardock.com/products/start8/download.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start8</a> for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can just wait it out.&nbsp; The new start menu might be bigger, but it functions the same (your favorite shortcuts first, then the rest under the "all programs" menu, just like always).&nbsp; The only difference is the size.</p>

                    <p>I have an xbox gamertag that i've used for years, that i started with a dummy email. i forgot the info for that email, and it was deactivated for inactivity years ago. When i got a new computer and a surface, i had to make a new microsoft account using my
 current email. there was some confusion, and a random xbox gamertag was started for this new email. I want to remove that random gamertag associated with my email address so i can link my current email address with my actual gamertag, but from what i can tell
 the random one is bound to my email forever blocking me from linking the accounts. I DO NOT want to make another dummy email, nor do i want this ridiculous gamertag associated with my email address, just unlink the random one so i can merge my real one with
 my current email.</p>

<p>Hey there! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are running into these problems with the account alias. It looks like in this case you are not able to add the new alias as the primary to your older account as it has already been linked to an Xbox account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go ahead and take a look at the following support article for all possible ways to update your account alias.

<p>Just so I am understanding things correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You have a gamertag that you setup with a dummy email account that is no longer active we will call this A1&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You then bought a new computer and surface you used your current email address that is active and it created a new gamertag for you. We will call this A2</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you are wanting to do is put the gamer tag on A1 on to the email address that is now associated with your computer and surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if I have this all right and as long as A2 email is not a MS server email (outlook, Hotmail, live, msn) then it is going to be possible but you will need to have access to both accounts at account.microsoft.com so in other words you will need to have
 the email and MS account password for both accounts and unfortunately you will need to create a dummy account. Hopefully you will have not of purchased anything yet on the new account also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically the ONLY thing that would be able to be done is move the email address from A2 to A1 as far as any purchases go they would stay with the account that made the purchases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically this is what you would need to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Sign into A2 at account.live.com/addassocid this will probably ask you to verify the account by sending a verification code to any security proof that you have on the account once you verify the account then it will bring up a screen that will give you
 2 choices create a new MS email (outlook) or use an existing Non-MS&nbsp; (gmail, Yahoo, ISP) email address that is NOT already another MS account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>DO NOT DO THIS&nbsp; NEXT STEP IF THE EMAIL THAT YOU ARE USING IS A MS SERVER EMAIL IF YOU DO YOU WILL LOSE ACCESS TO THAT EMAIL FOREVER AND NEVER BE ABLE TO GET IT BACK.</strong></p>
<p>2. Choose create a new (dummy) account and create one. Make this new email the primary email on this account. ONLY DO THE NEXT step if it is not a MS server email. Once the new dummy email is the primary email you can then remove the other email from the
 account which will then free it up to put onto the other original gamertag account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Once you free up that email you can then sign out of A2 and sign into A1 at account.live.com/addassocid you may have to again verify ownership for this account and then once it brings up the screen to create a new or use an existing email you would choose
 use an existing email and put in the email you just took off of A2 and put it in here it will then send you a verification email that you do have access to that email and once you verify it you can then make that email the primary email and remove the old
 email from that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now keep in mind all this is doing is changing what email you have associated with your account it is not changing anything else like security proofs, billing addresses, phone numbers, payment options.</p>

<p>Hello murrayrm,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the Microsoft Answers Forum.</p>
<p>You can try Compatibility Mode:</p>
<p><span>If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Use the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the Program</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Properties</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Compatibility tab</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 Run this program in compatibility mode and select Windows Vista or whatever operating system the program was running successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link here: Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the compatibility is not successful, then try and run</span><span>the</span><span> Program Compatibility troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the<span>Start</span> button.</span></p>
<p><span>Then click <span>
Control Panel</span>. In the search box, type <span>troubleshooter</span>, and then click<span>Troubleshooting</span>. Under
<span>Programs</span>, click<span>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</span>.
</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the troubleshooter, browse to the program's setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something
 similar. The troubleshooter is not designed to work on programs that have an .msi file name extension.</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
If that doesn't help, then you may want to look into using a virtual program.<br />
If you run Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate versions , install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP mode (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx</a>) and execute your software
 in Windows XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you run Windows 7 Home Premium, try VirtualBox (<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.virtualbox.org</a>) or VMware Player (<a href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.vmware.com</a>) and install a separate copy of Windows XP (either
 Home Edition or Professional) for that purpose.&nbsp;You can do a search on the internet for any 3rd party virtual programs that will work on Windows 7 Home Premium. Many are free of charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Activation of Windows 10 after changing Hard disk. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> avinashkarnik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activation of Windows 10 after changing Hard disk.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Acer laptop is as old as introduction of windows 8. When I bought it was loaded with Windows 7 Home edition. When Windows 8 was introduced, I purchased Windows 8 pro on line &amp; installed it. That time it was activated on line. As and when new editions
 were introduced I was getting upgrades &amp; had no problems in activation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; But recently I had to change the hard disk. for replacing the I gave the laptop to Acer servicing. Unfortunately, the service center installed windows 10 pro with their volume licencing key. Now, I have started getting message as "Your activation
 in expiring soon". </p>
<p>Please, let me know how to activate the Windows 10 Pro. </p>
<p>1. My old Hard disk can be accessed through USB. can I retrieve the digital activation key by connecting it?</p>
<p>2. I have repair disk prepared with me, which was prepared 5 to 6 years back on CD ROM. Can this disk be useful for retrieving digital activation key?</p>
<p>3. If not by 1 or 2, any other method such as contacting Microsoft server center, or any other method.</p>
<p>3. If not by 1 or 2 or 3, can I buy only activation key which I suppose is cheaper than buying complete Windows 10 Pro Software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<br />
<br />If you still have access to your Windows 8 Pro key you can activate Windows 10 with that.
<br />
<br />If not we can try to get the key from your old hard drive.

<br />I'm awaiting your reply

            Hi Avinash
<br />
<br />That repair center have made an error installing Windows 10 on your system, the free upgrade period form Windows 7 and 8 to Windows 10 ended 3 years ago and upgrading for free is no longer possible
<br />
<br />Your best option is to backup your data and clean install Windows 8.1, which your PC is licences to, which will then self activate . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 8.1 at any time, you will not need a product key and it will not cost you anything ! 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 8.1 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 8.1 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 8.1 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Windows 8.1 ISO file
<br />
<br />Then click this link to download a tool from Microsoft to create the Windows 8.1 Installation media on a DVD or USB flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 8.1 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Did you ever upgrade to Windows 10 during the free upgrade period?
<br />If not then you‚Äôll have to clean install Windows 8/8.1.
<br />If you did then just insert the default key:
<br />VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T
<br />
<br />Also run this to see what is currently installed &amp; post a screenshot:
<br />Cmd/powershell with admin - slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />If this states you have a volume licence then there is away to return to a legal key if there's one in the BIOS.
<br />If it does please post back.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>C: is the System partition where the operating system, program, data, etc.&nbsp;are installed and work from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>D: is normally a Recovery partition imaged onto your hard drive by the computer manufacturer to reinstall the operating system from to bring the computer back to new condition.</p>
<p>You don't touch it, add files to it, backup to it, etc.</p>
<p>You should have made recovery Media from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once it is deleted it is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to now reinstall the operating system, these are your options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can contact&nbsp;HP and order Recovery Media from them for a small cost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can&nbsp;download and create your own Windows 8.1 Installation Media to reinstall the Operating System with..</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Check with the System Maker's Support, their on-line documentation and drivers,<br />
troubleshooting, and ask in their forums about ant known issues. Doueble check<br />
for Windows 10 compatibility.<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Control Panel - Troubleshooting - Hardware and Sound - Configure a Device.<br />
<br />
See if that troubleshooter helps.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Control Panel - Device Manager - DVD-CD drivers -&nbsp;Right Click the drive -<br />
Driver Tab - Uninstall the drive - then&nbsp;restart the computer<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>See&nbsp;if this helps :<br />

Fix: DVD Drive Not Detected In Windows 8/10<br />
<a href="http://www.intowindows.com/fix-dvd-drive-not-detected-in-windows-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.intowindows.com/fix-dvd-drive-not-detected-in-windows-8/</span></a>
<br />
<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
If needed let's test the CD/DVD drive to see if it works at all &nbsp;:<br />
<br />
Try this to see if the drive is viable at all (you will need to make these on <br />
another computer&nbsp;since your's will not start - XP, Vista,&nbsp;7,&nbsp;8/8.1 , or 10<br />
or even running&nbsp;Linux&nbsp;does not matter).&nbsp;You could also try booting with <br />
another Windows disk&nbsp;- any OS though do not use&nbsp;it to try to ANY&nbsp;repairs <br />
unless it is absolutely the same&nbsp;version of Windows on your system - just <br />
boot to see if the drive&nbsp;works. You can even&nbsp;make a Windows 10 DVD boot<br />
disc&nbsp;by running the Windows Media Creation tool&nbsp;(on any computer) -<br />
<br />
Windows Media Creation Tool (make 32 or 64 both disk same as the OS<br />
version you are running.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10&nbsp;&nbsp;</a><br />
<br />
Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 so watch the screen as you boot - set <br />
the boot&nbsp;order to CD/DVD first. Remember to set it back when done.<br />
<br />
Or ry booting to a Linux boot disk.<br />
<br />
If the drive will not boot to these then it has failed or there are other hardware
<br />
issues&nbsp;affecting it. However even it does boot that does not mean there are <br />
not some possible&nbsp;hardware issues affect the drive's other functions.<br />

            <p>Hi Kurtis,<br />
<br />
<br />
The ProgramData specifies the path to the program-data folder (normally C:\ProgramData). Unlike the Program Files folder, this folder can be used by applications to store data for standard users, because it does not require elevated permissions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The path can be on a volume other than the system drive and should not cause performance loss nor cause confusion to Windows , as long as it meets the following requirements:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>It must be on an NTFS volume.</li><li>It can‚Äôt point to a drive that has a different copy of Windows on it.</li><li>It can‚Äôt contain any serviceable components</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
