<p>Hi Nakib,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Flickering issues are caused by driver issues, but can also be due to hardware problems. Just to clarify, have you already tried running the
<strong>Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</strong>? If not, we recommend that you run the SDT and give us an update of the result. The SDT resolves common Surface problems and it takes 15 minutes or less, but can take an hour or longer and depending on your internet
 connection speed and on the repairs that the tool needs to do to fix the problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> to run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the the issue persists after running the tool, we highly suggest that you contact our
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Support</a> so we can assist you through the unit replacement process if eligible.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Gamertag reported and changed by Microsoft.</h2>
                    <p>so my account got reported for having an inappropriate Gamertag (must admit, it wasn't very appropriate) and Microsoft changed my name using a randomly generated name (which is completely ridiculous)&nbsp;and now I wanna use my one free name change to change it to something that suits me but it keeps wanting to charge me. I haven't changed my Gamertag since I created it and them changing my Gamertag shouldn't count as my one free change. Someone help me!!</p>

            <p>The free gamertag change is only available if you were given a randomly generated tag when you created your account and are changing that tag for the first time. Since you previously had a tag of your choosing, you have already used your free change. You will have to pay if you want to change it.</p>

    <title>Install Win 10 Pro 32 bit on 64 bit Notebook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nodrogchavez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install Win 10 Pro 32 bit on 64 bit Notebook</h2>
                    <p>Please bear with me, as I try to explain my situation.&nbsp; When Win 8 Pro was first released, I purchased it directly from Microsoft, and they sent me two CDs; one for 32-bit and one for 64-bit, with both having the same Product key.&nbsp; I installed the 32-bit
 one on my desktop PC, which upgraded itself to Win 8.1.&nbsp; When Windows 10 Pro was released to market, I upgraded to that.&nbsp; So far, so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago I purchased an Asus Notebook with 64-bit architecture, and an OEM Win 10 Home version installed.&nbsp; I want to somehow change the notebook to Win 10 Pro, but don't want to spend the $200 to do so.&nbsp; And, logic tells me that I shouldn't try to
 install the Win 10 Pro 32-bit onto the 64-bit notebook.&nbsp; Where I bought the notebook, I asked if I could install the Win 8 Pro 64-bit onto the notebook, and was told no, I could not install a Windows version that is earlier than the existing one on the notebook.&nbsp;
 And, just for the record, if that had been a viable way to go, I was going to delete the Product key from the PC, so that it wouldn't be on two machines at once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My worst case scenario would be to reformat the Asus, install the 64-bit Win 8 Pro, and then keep doing upgrades until I get to where I want to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are my options here?&nbsp; The end result I want is for the Asus Notebook to run Windows 10 Pro 64-bit.</p>
<p>

            <p>I'm curious as you've sort of left out part of the puzzle.</p>
<p>What originally was the operating system on the Desktop &amp; was the windows 8 pro&nbsp;an upgrade&nbsp;discounted version&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;the full cost&nbsp;version of&nbsp;win8 pro&nbsp;purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can of course, upgrade your new laptop for about $100 to pro. &amp; then both the desktop and laptop will be matching Pro's.</p>

            I 'think' is was probably Win XP with all of the updates, and I didn't comment on that as it is immaterial.&nbsp; All I did was plug the Win 8 Pro into the slot, and it installed overtop of whichever O/S it was.&nbsp; And, it was the full cost version, which I seem
 to recall was US$40.&nbsp; Yes, I am aware that I can upgrade to Pro, but as I already mentioned, it is US$200, not $100, and I don't wish to go that route.<br />

            <p>Lets clarify some things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That Windows 8 Pro license you bought in 2012, is an upgrade license. The product key can only be used for one installation, either 32 or 64 bit, you can't use it for both at the same time or multiple installations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to transfer the Windows 8 Pro license to the new ASUS computer, you must remove any trace of it from any existing computers it is presently installed on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't use the Windows 8 Pro product key to upgrade the Windows 10 Home installation to Pro, you must use the work around below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First step, you will need to reset the old computer to the original installation that came with it, you said that was Windows XP.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a specific reason why you need Windows 10 Pro on the new machine? </p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the features unique to Pro:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Domain Join</li><li>Network Back</li><li>Group Policy Editor</li><li>Remote Desktop</li><li>Hyper-V</li><li>BitLocker Drive Encryption</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Most of these are enterprise features, if you are not using your computer for those specific needs, I strongly suggest leaving your Windows 8.1 Pro license in tact where it is now and use your Windows 10 Home license as is on your new machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you must, then you will need to first uninstall the Windows 8 Pro key on the current computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Windows key + X</p>
<p>Click Command Prompt (Admin)</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the command prompt type: </p>
<p>slmgr.vbs -upk</p>
<p>Hit Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exit then restart, this will set your computer trial mode, you are now free to transfer the license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you need to do the following on the new ASUS computer, I strongly suggest you backup first:</p>

            <p>I already stated that I would be removing the Product key from the desktop PC, before trying to activate it on the Notebook.&nbsp; Part of what you suggest, I already know, but you have provided me with the key steps needed to accomplish what I want to do.&nbsp; I
 know of the differences between the Home and Pro, and because I know them, I want the Pro on the Notebook.&nbsp; Once I have successfully activated Windows 10 Pro on the Notebook, the desktop PC will be reformatted and donated to a local non-profit that refurbishes
 used computers, and then resells them to people who are down on their luck, and cannot afford new computers.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You say "You can't use the Windows 8 Pro product key to upgrade the Windows 10 Home installation to Pro...", whjch makes sense.&nbsp; However, I notice that the product key in my Windows 10 Pro on the PC, is different from the product key&nbsp; on my Win 8 Pro CDs
 received from Microsoft originally.&nbsp; Could I not use the PC Win 10 Pro product key instead of the default key you provided above?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This afternoon I will be removing the Pro product key from my PC, so it will be available if it will work.</p>

<h2>            How do I remove Winfix 10 Pro pop up&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't remember what I was trying to download, but whatever it was it downloaded a bundle of adwares. I ran a McAfee scan and Windows Defender kept saying it detected malware and was taking action to remove it. I got all there adwares on my computer
 right before upgrading to Windows 10. I also went to uninstall the programs but I am still left with this pop up. I have visit websites for removal tools and none of them are helping.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you tried removing the virus and malware from your system. This could be an issue with the third party applications. I suggest you to place the system in clean boot and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows
 10. Clean boot will help you to determine the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Here is the link;</span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Note: Once you put the system in clean boot, please follow the section which says “</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”.</span></span></p>

            You won't be able to resell Windows XP, it is no longer available for resale.&nbsp; The only legitimate way of supplying Windows XP would be with the refurbisher program or by way of downgrade rights with a Windows 7 Professional license.<br />

<p>Hi acg52,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please clarify this for me. Which emails are you marking as spam? If it were the emails on your Junk folder, marking it as spam is probably a not a good idea as spam emails are supposed to go this particular folder. Considering that this is a typographical
 error, and what you meant was marking it as <em>not spam</em>, try logging in to your account using a browser and review your inbox rules. Assuming you are using Outlook, go to this

<h2>            system crash &#40;blue screen&#41; 0x00000124 Error, please help</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I keep getting the 0x00000124 blue screen error when trying to render out a big scene in 3Ds Max 2009 and or 3Ds Max 2010 (Yes they are both 64 bit versions). This should not be happening considering I have a very well built machine. I figure something must
 be wrong with the BIOS, I don't know. I am not too savy with hardware and such, so I am looking for help asap. I have also slightly tried troubleshooting with some of the render setting in 3D Max to see if it was a software problem, but I keep getting the
 blue screen. Sometimes I do not get the blue screen, and 3D max just crashes, so I am very confused. If anyone has any solutions or advice, it would be very much appreciated. Also a side note, when rendering, my processor power is about 98 - 100% and the RAM
 is only around 25%.. (I thought this was normal, but I do not know). someone please help : )
<br />
<br />
Here are my system specs below:<br />
<br />
I am running windows 7 ultimate (64 bit), version 6.1.7600 BUild 7600. System type: x64-based pc. Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q6600 @ 2.40GHz, 3001 MHz. SMBIOS Version 2.5. Installed Physical Memory: 8.00GB<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />

<p><span>Hello Austin Neill,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is the Operating Systems Requirements for 3ds Max 2010: It doesn’t seem to run on the Home Versions of Vista and is not listed as being compatible with Windows 7.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Microsoft® Windows® XP Professional (Service Pack 2 or higher) or Microsoft® Windows® Vista (Business, Premium, or Ultimate)

<p><span>I would suggest you try running in Compatibility Mode:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have an older application for Windows Vista that doesn't run in Windows 7, you may be able to get it working properly by running the program in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>1. To begin, find the application or shortcut that is causing the problem, then right click on it and select Properties.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Then, select Compatibility from the tabbed menu at the top of the properties page:</span></p>
<p><span>3. Now, check the "Run this program in compatibility mode for..." box and select the OS you wish to emulate. For most applications, it will be Windows XP SP2. Once you are done, click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>4. When you next launch the application it should run under compatibility mode using the OS you selected. If it still fails to run correctly, try another OS selection in step 3 and try again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run the installation program in compatibility mode:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Right-click the installation file's icon.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click Properties &gt; Compatibility .</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select the compatibility mode for Windows Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click OK .</span></p>
<p><span>5. Run the installation program.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After it's installed, run the program in Windows Vista compatibility mode by doing the same with the installed program.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are still having problems, then try to run in Windows XP Mode using Virtual PC.
</span></p>
<p><span>Running Windows XP Mode requires:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>1. Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate editions.</span></p>
<p><span>2. A computer capable of hardware virtualization. This means your computer has a central processing unit (CPU) with either Intel-VT or AMD-V virtualization features.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Virtualization features turned on in your computer’s basic input/output system (BIOS).</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>To determine whether your computer’s CPU is capable of hardware virtualization, go to the Windows XP Mode and Windows Virtual PC support website and download a utility that can check whether your Intel
 or AMD CPU is compatible. </span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/support/configure-bios.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/support/configure-bios.aspx</a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>To find your brand of processor so you can download the appropriate utility, click the Start button , right-click Computer, and then click Properties. Under System, next to Processor, you can see what
 type of CPU you have.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Even if your CPU can run Windows XP Mode, you might also need to turn on virtualization settings in your computer’s BIOS. Procedures vary depending on the BIOS manufacturer. For more information, see
 BIOS: frequently asked questions.</span></p>

    <title>Surface Pro&#47;Paperweight - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ridesinnergy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro&#47;Paperweight</h2>
                    <p>After a recent forced update, my Surface Pro won't boot, won't pass chkdsk, won't boot from recovery partition, won't find anything useful.&nbsp; I was able to create recovery media and have tried every permutation of the menus there that I can find without improvement.&nbsp;
 The command prompt allowed me to save my files, so I'm OK with a complete wipe and reinstall, but I can't seem to get there either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please direct me to where I can create media with a set of tools that will allow me to go through the whole process of setting up the drive and installing the operating system?&nbsp; At this point, I don't care if it is the original 8.1 or 10.&nbsp; This
 is a rather expensive paperweight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            Hi Ride Sinnergy, did you download Windows 10 Installation Media or the Surface Recovery Image which is specific to your Surface Pro
<br />
<br />Surface Pro Image:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/surfacereco...</a>
<br />
<br />Use this tool to create a bootable USB Flash Drive:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br />
<br />Connect a USB Hub to the only USB port, and connect your keyboard and mouse to the hub, and also the USB that has your recovery image
<br />
<br />Boot menu (volume down + power) and choose boot from USB

<p>First, thank you for the quick reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made that usb, and it is the one that I can boot from and eventually got to the command prompt with. None of the other options seem to work, however. Either the tablet restarts and goes to permanently spinning dots, or it goes to a blue screen with
 nothing on it. Consideeing the possibility that it was 'thinking about it', I have left it on each of these for at least fourty-eight hours with no changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I could get at it and fix it with other tools, but getting past the UEFI into an OS where I can use them is proving frustrating as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            Hi Ron, I am not too familiar with the Surface, but on a normal laptop/PC to load Windows on a UEFI BIOS System, this is what I do:
<br />
<br />1.	Insert the Bootable Media
<br />2.	Disable Secure Boot
<br />3.	Enable Legacy Boot
<br />4.	If Available enable CSM
<br />5.	If Required enable USB Boot
<br />6.	Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order
<br />7.	Save BIOS changes and restart your System

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I feel like I've tried all of this, but I wanted to go step-by-step through your approach (doing it as I type).</p>
<p>
</p><p>One note from your earlier bits; I am using the keyboard cover with mousepad, not a full keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; I have a hub and USB mouse and keyboard if you think it will make a difference, but that's what I've worked with today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I inserted the bootable media.&nbsp; In this case it was the Win10 installation media that I built a few days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I booted into the UEFI (hold volume-up while holding power for three seconds, release power when the Surface logo comes up, release volume-up one second later).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disable Secure Boot.&nbsp; There are no other options, that fit your list (the Surface doesn't have a legacy BIOS).&nbsp; Click save and restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It reboots to a red background, the Surface logo, and permanently spinning dots.&nbsp; Wait five minutes to see if it is going to do something different this time.&nbsp; It doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hold power for six seconds to shut it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hold volume-down, and press power for three seconds, release power when the Surface logo comes up, release the volume-down one second later to force a boot from USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After approximately one minute, a window opens with options for language, time and currency, and keyboard or input.&nbsp; The defaults of English (United States), English (United States), and US work for me.&nbsp; I click 'Next'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has options to 'Repair your computer', which I have tried too many times, and in the main box 'Install now'.&nbsp; I click 'Install Now'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says 'Setup is starting'...&nbsp; After probably twenty seconds, a window comes up with 'Activate Windows' and has a place for a key.&nbsp; My research says that the Surface doesn't need a separate key, and one of the options is 'If you're reinstalling Windows,
 select I don't have a product key.&nbsp; Your copy of Windows will be automatically activated later.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click 'I don't have a product key'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Across the bottom of the screen there is now a white/green line showing numbers 1 and 2.&nbsp; The green is filling from the left, about 1/4 of the way through the 1 which is labeled 'Collecting information'.&nbsp; Windows setup is telling me to 'select the operating
 system you want to install'.&nbsp; This machine came from the factory with Windows 8.1 pro, and I immediately did the online upgrade to Windows 10 pro, so I select Windows 10 pro, x64, and hit 'next'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The window now wants me to agree to the EULA.&nbsp; I check the box 'I accept the license terms' (like there's a lot of choice), and click 'Next'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It gives me two options: Upgrade: and Custom:.&nbsp; Last time, I tried the Upgrade option hoping it would run like it did before the forced update.&nbsp; This time I'm clicking 'Custom: Install Windows only (advanced).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has me select from four partitions on the drive, and I select the largest, called 'Windows'.&nbsp; The green bar is all the way to '2', which is now labeled 'Installing Windows'.&nbsp; A status window has opened that says 'Installing Windows'.&nbsp; It has five lines,
 the first of which is in bold saying 'Copying Windows Files (0%)'.&nbsp; This is where is sat the last time I tried this for more than 24 hours.&nbsp; I'm not optimistic, but I will let it run and will update here tomorrow.</p>
<p>

            It looked encouraging for a while, but before it ever went to 1%, the screen went blue, and the only thing I could do is reset.&nbsp; I'm going to be gone over the weekend, I think I'll try to let the chkdsk run for 72 hours and see if it goes anywhere.<br />

<h2>            Lexmark Z35 in Windows 7 Starter</h2>
                    I have this printer working ok in Windows XP. I have tried to install it in my netbook Samsung N145 Plus with Windows 7 Starter 32 bits, but i am offline and the process finishes with error and without any correct driver. Do i need to allow the assistant
 to connect to Windows Update and search for a driver? <br />
<br />
If so, it is not completely true that this printer works in Windows 7 32 bits with "No action required" http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=Lexmark%20Z35%20Inkjet%20Printer&amp;v=Lexmark&amp;uid=15J0289&amp;l=en-US&amp;pf=2&amp;pi=2&amp;c=Printers%20%26%20Scanners&amp;sc=Ink-Jet%20Printers&amp;os=32-bit<br />

<h2>            sfsync03.sys corrupt, unable to boot</h2>
                    I installed a new game, Race Driver 3, and from a bit of research, I made a massive mistake. Windows 7 is unable to boot and the Startup Repair is unable to fix the problem. I've tried running Command Prompt to delete the files to blame which I've discovered
 elsewhere, but I always get the message 'cannot find file specified'.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have Windows 7 Professional 64 bit, and my computer is only a month old! Please help!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know there's another question the same, but it didn't work for me which is why I'm asking again :(&nbsp;</div>

            Hello sdquincy,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Sorry you are having this problem.&nbsp; How long would you suggest you have been having this issue?&nbsp; Have you changed anything with your operating system prior to this occuring?&nbsp; Any new Windows Updates or new software/hardware installed?&nbsp; Are you getting any
 errors when your computer crashes?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;If you log into your computer in Safe Mode do you also have the same problem with blue screen/crashing/high CPU?&nbsp; I would suggest trying this and if you are unable to duplicate this problem I would suggest performing a Clean Boot to try and determine if a
 background application is causing this.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Please let us know status.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</strong></a><br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. This article describes
 how to troubleshoot problems in Windows Vista by performing a clean boot. This article also describes how to start the Windows Installer service and how to reset the computer so that it starts as usual.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original behavior.<br />

<h2>            Windows Vista to 7 clean install upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a computer with an OEM Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit installed on it. My school offers me an upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate, which I am more than happy to take, however, I raised concerns about the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The OS is quite bogged down from about 6 years of use. As a result it makes the OS operate
<em>very </em>slow. I would like to start over with a clean install and clean copy of Windows 7, rather than one with 6 years of old files and possibly even malware holding it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I would also like to use the 64-bit Windows 7, rather than the 32 bit one, as I plan to upgrade the computer a much higher RAM configuration than it currently has with its 32-bit OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have the product key for Windows Vista, and will receive one for Windows 7 Ultimate once I accept the upgrade. Can I upgrade from Vista to 7 with the criteria above; a clean install and from 32 to 64 bit?</p>

<p>Thanks everyone for all the replies,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The further I look into it, the more grim it begins to look. I plan on&nbsp;<em>completely
</em>revamping the computer's components, including swapping out the motherboard, so the OEM license restriction prevents me from upgrading from the Vista installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately I do have a plan B, where I found an old Windows XP CD I still have laying around, where I may just format the hard drive partition with vista (no files I really need on it anymore) and just perform the double install method with XP (which is
 a retail license).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The school's volume license may expire, but that likely won't be for another year, at which point I'll just purchase a new retail license or a copy of Windows 10, since it'll be out by then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all the help and information!</p>

<p>3) If you plan to replace the power supply because the wattage rating is to low, check the case mounting hole locations and the AC power cord / switch location. Some companies did on occasion use non-industry standard mounting.</p>
<p>4) Cooling fans and space inside the case for the new CPU heatsink/fan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck.</p>

<p>Note: If you are Overclocking or use any automatic overclocking or power saving BIOS features, start out by disabling them: Intel EIST, Turbo Mode, Cool and Quite and drop back to the stock speed as a starting point.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Disconnect any other (additional) internal hard drives and external USB devices.</p>
<p>Check for any loose hard drive power or SATA cables, Graphics card or other power cables.</p>

<p><strong>First run Memtest86+: </strong></p>
<p>This runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or confirm if one or more of your memory</p>
<p>sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.</p>
<p>Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours (at least 3 full passes), if no errors by then your ram is OK.</p>

<p><strong>Hard drive Testing:</strong></p>
<p>1) If you don't know your drives make / model number AND your computer is no longer able to load Windows:</p>
<p>a) Renmove the drive from your desktop and check the label for the make and model number.</p>
<p>b) Remove the bottom cover of your laptop, remove the drive and check the label for the make and model number.</p>
<p>2) If Windows is still usable, install "Speccy",it provides System/computer Information in detail about your:</p>
<p>OS, CPU, RAM, Motherboard, Graphics, Hard Drive, Optical Drive, Audio, Peripherals, Network.</p>
<p>Note: RAM option will show number of slots, DRAM Timing,</p>

<div>Thank you for the solution posted. The real problem here seems to be the attitude Microsoft is having towards its clients. Indeed, the error stopped appearing, but I still can't connect my phone to the computer, so the problem is not solved. It's good

<br />
Thanks David Junge for the pointer to "Adam's" solution. I removed sqmupload from from the Task Scheduler about two weeks ago and have not seen the error since.&nbsp;&nbsp; So early days, but this does seem to work.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll post back if the error returns.<br />
Once again - thanks for the help.&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Firstly, DO NOT DELETE Sqmupload as previous replies have suggested. This may remove the error popping up but you will still have issues with your removable media devices e.g. connecting mobile phones to your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realise this is an old issue but I have recently experienced the same problem after upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem comes from having the N version of Windows, which does not include the Media Feature Pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve this problem download the Media Feature Pack found on the Microsoft website:
</p>
<p>search for "Media Feature Pack Windows 10" (or Windows 8.1) on Google and it should be the first link.</p>

            Hi BRbradlee15,<br />
<br />
In Regards to your request, whenever you will upgrade to windows 10.<br />
The System restarts Multiple Times.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you put your system to sleep Mode, the restart won't happen and the system will get Halted there only.&nbsp;<br />
I have got a Couple of Cusotmer who have tried this and later on they have found that their system doesn't Boot only to the desktop.<br />
If you are Updating the system to Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Don't let the system go to sleep. you might find that you Laptop booting the Next Morning.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are asking about Normal Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That can Definitely happen in the Background there are NO Problem in that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as you have got an Internet connection and set the Windows Update to Download Automatically, till then it will Download the Update and Once you Restart your Computer it will Apply the Updates as well.</p>

            Hey Trojan_horse, it seems that bradlee15 is taking about the November update.I believe that while the update is downloading, there wont be a problem with your PC on sleep. It will prepare for installation automatically in the background. After that, it
 will ask you to restart your pc. During which, your computer will restart several times. That entire process is automatic and will happen without any disturbances. My advice would be to avoid sleep mode for this update. Especially at the time a restart is
 scheduled.

    <title>System crashes after Windows 10 upgrade. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            System crashes after Windows 10 upgrade.</h2>
                    <p>After much prompting by Microsoft I decided to upgrade to W10. &nbsp;The download first checked my computer and advised it was suitable for the upgrade, so I went ahead. W10 ran perfectly for a few days but then crashed my PC. Nothing I tried could make it work
 again so in desperation I took the machine to a local repair man. They tried to fix the problem - twice - but shortly after it failed again. A different repair man wiped the disk and re-installed W7. This may be an old system but at least it works. &nbsp;I am now
 having problems with input as the PC seems to forget where the cursor is and all input ceases until I notice and hit the ENTER key. &nbsp;This is my life at the moment. &nbsp;From talking with others I am not alone as many users of W7 and W8 machines are having problems
 with W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am reluctant to upgrade again as the first failure cost me much software and data that I can ill afford to replace, If I stay with W7 will it still operate or will Microsoft arrange for it to cease operation suddenly?</p>
<p>

</p><p>The laptop is an HP Pavillion. It came about 7 years ago complete with W7 Pro and until my trial of W10 it has worked very well ever since. &nbsp;Partly because of the loss of software I no longer do much of the CAD work I once used to do and if possible I would
 like to keep the machine rather than replace it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received no error messages to warn of impending problems. One morning the computer just sat with a blank screen and did nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually use wireless mouse and keyboard so I changed batteries in everything but to no avail. I then tried wired mouse and keyboard but no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to post a screen shot of the Resource Monitor but it refuses to add it to this message. &nbsp;I am very nervous about another attempt at loading W10. My machine was built around W7 and I believe that some of the inbuilt drivers may not be suitable.
 I have only been told this and as I am not a computer geek I have to believe. I know of many others who are also in similar positions. &nbsp;If W7 is to be supported until 2020 I am leaning towards sticking with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All suggestions welcome</p>

            <p>Yep svchost.exe taking up 25% of the cpu this is caused by the windows update system,</p>
<p>Try using this to reset the update system it's very good,</p>
<p>Use Option 2 on the list after right clicking it and select run as administrator</p>
<p>You might even try Option 3 too</p>

<p>
</p><p>Download it to your downloads folder</p>
<p>Right click it and select Extract all to the downloads folder.</p>
<p>Then right click ResetWUEng and select run as administrator</p>
<p>Follow the rest of the prompts</p>
<p>Press any key to continue</p>
<p>Type 2 for that Option on the list and the Enter key</p>
<p>Press y for Yes I believe twice </p>
<p>After it has completed </p>
<p>Type 15 for that option and the Enter key to restart the machine.</p>
<p>Should say will restart in 60 seconds save your work.... press any key to continue.</p>
<p>After restart go to windows updates and manually check for updates shouldn't take a few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you'd rather you can use this one from M$ to reset the update services but it is not as good as the above one</p>

            Sorry to appear thick (I did say I wasn't a computer geek) but what will resetting the update components achieve? I am nervous about again going down the W10 road yet this seems to be what Microsoft want. &nbsp;Many people I speak to tell me that W10 was loaded
 on their machines "in the background" and without their knowledge. I do not want to open the doors for the same to happen to me.

            <p>Mainly to get rid of all of the prior updates that have installed ones like win-10's...</p>
<p>Resetting will also recreate the updates cache</p>
<p>There is a bit of a snag but you're already in that boat of endless searching for updates so resetting the update system is a better way for it to recreate a better cache which might have longer lasting positive effects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might have to let windows search for updates all night by disabling sleep and hibernation so it might complete it's searching.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But also notice all the other tools the first reset utility has :)</p>
<p>If you're really worried about upgrading again use either of these to disable os upgrades</p>

            <p>The saga continues. I created a new Admin account and made sure it had all the permissions but I was still unable to run the "ResetWUE". I then followed the steps in the "Fix a corrupted profile" far as I could but the entire file seems to be empty. &nbsp; See

 the cable box. &nbsp;There is a direct path for the IR. &nbsp;Still nothing. &nbsp;Im in the same boat as Omay1990 and need help.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft store sends me someone else&#39;s receipts</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been receiving someone else's Microsoft purchase receipts for a few years now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are sent to my email address, with my name, but the receipt is for someone else's purchases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I tried to chat online to a Microsoft employee about it and they claimed the email address the receipts were from wasn't a microsoft email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that's definitely not true. </p>
<p>(mostly *** Email address is removed for privacy *** ; sometimes *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not a phishing scam. There's nothing in the email that wants my information.
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I tried to block the address but I can't. It's from microsoft.com!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a small nuisance but how long does it take for this mistake to get identified? I know this guy's home address and all his purchases. I'm sure he wouldn't be that happy about his info being sent to some random guy in Australia.</p>
<p>

            Hi Omoks,<br />
<br />
If you have your Zune playlists in your music library, you should be able to import them using the following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Launch the Music app<br />
2. Go to My Music<br />
3. Select Playlists tab<br />
4. Select Import Playlists button, or if that's not present, show the App Bar and select Import Playlists button<br />
<br />
This will import all of the playlists found in your music library into Music app.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Scott<br />
