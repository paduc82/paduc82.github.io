<h2>            Windows 10 hangs until I press any key</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I recently upgraded to win 10 and loved it for about 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Starts but then I had to hit a key to get to logon</p>
<p>Then it started and thought it was updating--until I'd hit a key.</p>
<p>Then it started getting glitch in programs. Mozilla (and others) would load slow freeze.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>Eventually i discovered that if i hit any key the sites often worked for a while. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>So, to use internet it would stall, I hit key, work for a while, repeat.</p>
<p>Process became: Start hit key, update--until I hit key, work a while and hang--until I hit a key</p>
</div>
<div>Now I'm beginning to regret the "upgrade".</div>
<div>Then it happened:</div>
<div>Start opens to "Auto Repair"(if you hit any key), then to the next sectio "Diagnosing"</div>
<div>At some point I ran Dells comprehensive tests on all the hardware and it all passed.</div>
<div>I tried resetting the computer got something like " No operating system was found".</div>
<div>Swapped an HD with win 7 from a working HP and got the same message.</div>
<div>Tried restore 8.1 from a WD Passport and got something like "file has no info on your hardware".</div>
<div>So I downloaded Win 10 media tool to a 16gig usb--nothing loaded&nbsp; "file has no info on your hardware"..</div>
<div>Tried setting the BIOS to "Legacy"</div>
<div>Tried setting the boot order to "USB..."; tried the Passport again.</div>
<div>Tried advanced settings for "Use a device," and"Troubleshoot", "System Image Recovery,"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;This last one allowed me to see the file on the USB. &nbsp;I selected the win 10 file</div>
<div>and alternately the win 8 restore backup (then just tried files from the Passport as well).</div>
<div>All of them " File contains no info on your hardware." &nbsp;Uggh!</div>
<div>
<p>That's most of the last three days.</p>
<p>Then I tried a restore--left it all night--in the AM the msg said "Restore didn't work. Files not changed"&nbsp; AWESOME</p>
<p>But it STARTED.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I updated all my drivers today and all seemed fine!</p>
<p>Until just now.&nbsp; When it started, it hung--until I pressed a key (seems restricted to alphabet keys).&nbsp; And that's the last few times I started it today.</p>

            <p>Thanks,</p>
<p>I installed from 8.1 with the upgrade link windows sent.</p>
<p>10/24</p>
<p>Just now tried what you suggested and the install hangs on install, and again when I cancel.&nbsp; So I just stopped it in Task Mgr.</p>
<p>Then I went to the " Win 10 create media"file I had on a USB and it worked.&nbsp; It installed and the first couple of times it started properly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This time, however, I had to press a key after the "Dell" page to start the loading process. So, my guess it is going downhill again.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; I think it is actually working fine.&nbsp; Started normally this AM.</p>
<p>If that's the case then the solution was to install the upgrade from a USB file rather that from the web for some reason.&nbsp; We'll see.</p>
<p>UPDATE 2: I noticed that wunderground.com would not load well... sure enough, the problems began creeping back in. Then it died. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I took the unit in for service. &nbsp;Hope it's hardware related.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One S Controller Loud Hissing Noise when Connecting Headset</h2>
                    
<p>I have the new &nbsp;Xbox One&nbsp;S Controller - when using the headphone adapter for the Xbox One Controller with the Tritton Headset - I get loud hissing sound.&nbsp; The Xbox Elite Controller however works fine, when connected to the Xbox One S Console.&nbsp; Is this something
 to do with the update of the software on the controller, as the Elite controller has not been updated, so far as I am aware.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Hey Johny! It might have something to do with the update. Did you see if your controller needs an update at all? You can do this by connecting it to the micro usb cable then go to settings, Kinect and devices and select controller then choose update to see
 if it has the latest update. </p>

<p>Thanks for the response Maximum Extreme - when the controller was set up with the new Xbox it updated automatically, so the update has been done. &nbsp;It's strange it only happens with the Xbox One S Controller that came with the new console. &nbsp;It works fine
 with the remote that hasn't been updated. &nbsp;Is there anyway to reverse the update to the previous software?? &nbsp;Thank you.

 is never fully disappears.

<p>All three worked fine up until about a month ago.&nbsp; I think the problem started after an adobe flash player update was installed, but I am not certain.&nbsp; I noticed that internet video went green at the time, but i was able to turn off hardware acceleration
 in the flash player to correct the problem.</p>
<p>I tried the following, but nothing has worked:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rolled back to a previous version of the Adobe&nbsp;flash player. </li><li>System restore to prior to the issue. </li><li>Reinstalled Windows 7. </li><li>No option (grayed out) to globally turn off hardware acceleration in the display settings.</li></ol>
<p>So far nothing has worked fix this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 32 bit and an ATI Radeon HD 4550 graphics card.&nbsp; I had been able to view live TV, recorded TV and DVD playback in Windows Media Center with no issues before.&nbsp; I am able to play DVD's TotalMedia Theatre 5 and I get no errors in WMC,

    <title>OneNote on Windows 10, Insert text on top of PDF using touch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimsauce  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote on Windows 10, Insert text on top of PDF using touch</h2>
                    I'm using the Windows Store OneNote app on Windows 10. Most of my note-taking involves first inserting PDF printouts into the document and then writing/typing on top of it. However, I can't figure out how to type on top of a PDF printout without using
 a keyboard. If I use a keyboard, then I can simply use the touchpad to click on the place on the printout where I want to insert text and type, which inserts the text properly. However, I often don't have a keyboard with me and would rather use the on-screen
 keyboard. If I touch with my finger, it instead selects the PDF and doesn't let me type. And if I click the "show onscreen keyboard" icon in the taskbar and then type using that, it inserts the text at the bottom of the PDF and not on top of it. OneNote 2013
 doesn't have this problem; I can simply double-tap wherever I want to type and it works fine. Why doesn't OneNote have this functionality, and is there a way to type on top of a PDF printout without a keyboard?

<h2>            Defender Antivirus Update KB2267602 problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo LNV IP320; bought in UK with preinstalled software on 04.02.18</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check for updates, the check process shows Win Defender KB 2267602 then quickly moves from download, install and then back to the checking process. At the end of the process I'm informed the Device is up to date.&nbsp; On looking in "file update history"
 there is no mention of KB2267602.&nbsp; And on checking the Widows Defense Security Centre&nbsp; am informed "no action is needed"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When login in again and checking for updates, the above cycle repeats itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I don't know whether the update is on the system, whether it needs to be on the system, or why these messages keep re-appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked online and saw problems for KB2267602 reported from 2015 onwards, but couldn't find anything specifically for Win 10 v 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Should mention I ran into early problems with the v1709 updates, but this was quickly resolver on local advice with a PC reset]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this problem would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Andre</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently on Win 10 v1709 (OS Build 16299.248)&nbsp; for x64 based systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think all upgrades have so far been in Window 10: and presumably on v1703 as this is a very recent purchase of a new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On visiting www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions</p>
<p>I saw that the most recent release at that time was version 1.261.1610.0</p>
<p>and on checking the "Open Windows Security Centre" on my computer found my computer was in sync with this.&nbsp; So the definition updates must be coming through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I login in and checking my updates the KB2267602 notifications keep coming: yet interestingly no definition updates are recorded on "installed upgrade history." &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trust this info will be of help</p>
<p>

            You can try two things. 
<br />
<br />Reset the software definition folder to clear out that zombie KB. 
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.
<br />
<br />Use the Show/Hide Updates Tool to remove it.
<br />
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

<p>Hi Andre</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Followed the KB3073930 route.&nbsp; Checked the box for KB2267602 and followed it through.</p>
<p>But still get the KB2267602 message on occasions when login in and checking for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the messages don't come through every time I check for updates, wondered whether Window Defender Security Centre (definition update) releases act as a trigger for when the messaged appear on my update check screen (as the KB number is constant but the
 definition reference keeps updating.)&nbsp; Probably this is just a red herring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should also mention, I initially started on the CMD path, but at the Windows\system 32&gt; prompt came up with the response: the Background Intelligence Transfer Service service is not stated, more help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 3521.&nbsp; As this was
 not a suggested option, followed up on the alternative given above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks once again</p>
<p>

            You probably need to clear out your software distribution folder.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

<p>Hi Andre</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I followed the path suggested</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the KB2267602 notice still appears when I check for updates (and new Windows Defender threat definitions are issued.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'm now much less concerned about this notification itself, as on the positive side it keeps me regularly informed of threat definition updates. Initially my concerns were one of an upgrade not installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as this is an issue unlikely to be a threat the overall upgrade process, I'm happy to leave it a this point.</p>

<p>Click Start &gt; right click Computer &gt; left click Properties &gt; see if you have Vista 32bit or Vista 64bit installed.</p>
<p>It will also tell you there what Service Packs, if any, are already installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then choose the correct "bit" download to use to install the Service Packs, installing SP1 first.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you have any problems:</p>

<h2>            Fast internet - slow Xbox&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>I don't understand why this could be?&nbsp;</p>
<p>My internet speeds: (taken from router)</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>DownStream Connection Speed</td>
<td>40001</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UpStream Connection Speed</td>
<td>9999</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Using online speed tests confirms these speeds</p>

<p>However, running a speed test on the Xbox gives me a down speed of around 3000-4000</p>
<p>Downloading games takes most of the day for full games 1gb+ - addons I have to come back to after around half an hour.</p>
<p>Game play - I'm placed automatically into 'poorer connection' groups</p>
<p>Netflix streaming - it sometimes to doesn't switch to HD, have to be wary of buffering (starting film and pressing pause allows it to buffer ahead)</p>
<p>Have tried wireless and wired connection to Xbox - no difference...</p>

<p>Everything else that uses the internet in the house is perfectly fine.. it's just the Xbox...</p>

<p>Why is this? Can anyone suggest anything for me?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Hey there Jason! Let's see what we can do to get things sorted.<br /><br /><strong>To start off, here's a few clarification questions for you:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I assume the download and upload speeds that you listed are in kb/s? So your download speed is ~40mb/s down and ~10mb/s up?</li>
<li>Are you able to download an ~1gb game demo and time how long it takes?</li>
<li>Has this always been an issue for you? Or is this a recent development?</li>
<li>Do you experience lag in your gameplay? Or are you just classified as having a poorer connection, but everything runs fine?</li>
<li>Can you take a look at <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/t/155724.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This Sticky</a> and post back with the information in <strong>bold</strong> at the bottom?</li>
</ol>
<p><br />Let us know and we'll look into things with you. However, it sounds like your setup is fine. Remember that the Xbox 360 was released in 2005 so 8 year old technology can have trouble keeping up with modern day technology, especially when it comes to download speeds.<br /><br />Also, Netflix streaming can often be affected by the Netflix servers themselves and not just your internet connection.<br /><br />Let us know the answers to those questions and we'll be standing by to hear back from you. =)</p>

            I also have this problem, even more serious. Everytime my HP Elitebook connect to my office wifi router, it started drop connection after 2-3 hours then couldn't get back, whatever I tried. This problem happened only to me. Other devices worked fine. Today
 I have to switch back to 8.1. So sad!

<p>Each time I get out of sleep mode, wifi network are showing up but internet connectivity is lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fastest way to recover from this is to right click on wifi tray icon and launch troubleshooting (not sure it's the exact name in english, my OS is in french). Wifi card is then reset and connection comes back right away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deactivating manualy wifi, or going into airplane mode does not help.</p>

            <p>Exactly the same problem here as well with "just" installed W10, &nbsp;7 days ago. I tried to do everything possible suggested on the net, my Surface Pro 3 has everything updated, including the WIFI Marvell driver (15.68.3091.193 Date 4/06/2015). &nbsp;I also disabled
 the "Turn on fast startup" as somebody suggested, but not luck either. The WI FI become "disabled" , and it is not possible to turn it on. I couldn't get to the power mode setting for the WI-FI interface ;-(.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far i noticed two way to fix it: reboot of the system, or try to "Diagnose" WI FI interface. The second option will "fix" it with 50-50% luck. However the wizard will report that the IP address is incorrect every time regardless WI FI actually working
 or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This WI FI in surface Pro 3 is relay disappointment, No ch 13 now power mode start to play up.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;It is relay the most annoying thing specially when you need surface to act as the tablet - it would not work every time. Hopefully Microsoft will fix the Microsoft hardware first - fingers crossed.</p>
<p>

            <p>After many time tried, suddenly my computer works OK with wifi router. Can't figure out exactly&nbsp;how, but I would narrow my steps were:
</p>
<p>- Uninstalled the wireless driver </p>
<p>- Update the lastest pack Windows update. I&nbsp;kept it automatic update mode</p>
<p>- Install the wireless driver from EOM&nbsp;manufacturer </p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last few days, my problem has gone. I can connect to the office wireless router without dropping wifi signal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop using chip Intel Wireless AC 7260 combine both Bluetooth &amp; Wi-Fi receiver. Please note that I removed both driver of Bluetooth and wifi driver before install any update. Before I only tried to install new wifi driver and couldn't fix anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very bad experience this time upgrade.</p>

 Used to work fine on 8.1.

    <title>Clean install Windows 8.1 using recovery drive stuck in infinite - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> groundfast  say:</h3>
<h2>            Clean install Windows 8.1 using recovery drive stuck in infinite re-install loop&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Computer: Lenovo Thinkpad T440s</p>
<p>OS: Windows 8.1 pro</p>
<p>New HDD: Crucial MX200 1TB SSD</p>
<p>Old HHD: OEM&nbsp;500GB drive</p>
<p>There's an OEM&nbsp;16GB M.2 SSD in the machine that I didn't remove (don't know if it matters)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This machine has no passwords AT ALL (not even Windows login password) since day 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I first tried to use the Acronis True Image software from the SSD to migrate, but it required a reboot during its cloning process.&nbsp; I got a BIOS warning during the reboot to confirm some changes, which I accepted.&nbsp; However, Acronis didn't seem to do anything
 following the reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a few loops of this, I decided to just try a clean install by making a USB recovery drive and booting off of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I'm stuck in a loop constantly resetting my computer when recovering using USB recovery drive where it is "Resetting" my machine from 0 to 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time when reset reaches 100%, I get the following on-screen confirmation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Confirmation - A configuration change was requested to enable, activate, clear, enable, and activate this computer's TPM (Trusted Platform Module).&nbsp; Note: This action will clear and turn on the TPM.&nbsp; WARNING: Clearing erases information stored on the ...
 Press [F9] to confirm, ESC to reject.&nbsp; The system will restart."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all 3 possibilities (hitting F9, ESC, and doing nothing, which causes the machine to restart by itself"</p>
<p>
</p><p>All 3 cases&nbsp;produced the same outcome, which is rebooting off the USB and restarting the recovery process, i.e. "resetting" 0%-100%, then the TPM confirmation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried disabling the security chip in BIOS, changing the boot ordering, nothing seems to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new HDD does seem to have Windows on it, but it does not boot (i.e. if I remove the USB and just leaving the new HDD in the computer, Windows boot manager won't boot from it).&nbsp; This the first time I've every seen Windows Boot Manager, what's interesting
 is that it didn't ask my which partition to boot off of on the new HDD (the USB recovery created 3 partitions).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, any hints ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this is my personal computer and there's never been any passwords put on it or any security features enabled since coming from Lenovo factory.&nbsp; Just in case if that matters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks.</p>
<p />

    <title>Challenge is unsolvable&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> big red husker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Challenge is unsolvable&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Ok I forget the name of the challenge, but it's located on basic campaign, in the middle top right after you beat jace.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know you have a lord of the pit&nbsp; and some other black vampires.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent 40 minutes on this last night and could not solve it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 frustrated I joined up with some friends in party chat and they have not been able to solve it either, so we worked together and have concluded that the puzzle is unsolvable with the cards on the board.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps with old rules where you could sack after
 blocking it could be solved but not in its current form.</p>
<p>you have 1 life, no matter how you block you are going to take at least 1 damage from the goblin if&nbsp; you sac your cultist to gain life and 2 from the collosus that is 9/9 trample.</p>

<p>either that or we are all missing something very obvious. &nbsp; but with 4 people who have been playing magic over the years &nbsp; we can't figure it out. &nbsp;if it's not glitched I have a feeling were going feel retarded once we realize a solution.</p>

<p>It is solvable. &nbsp;Not sure how you are blocking. &nbsp;4 attackers 4 blockers . &nbsp;You have 5 creatures. &nbsp;Look at the ability on the vampire and don't forget the enchantment that is sitting on the board. &nbsp;They key to remember is once a creature is declared as blocked
 it stays blocked no matter what happens to the blocker.</p>

<p>No they do not stay blocked, &nbsp;after assigning blockers and pressing y to continue, then pressing X to stop timer and activate creature abilities sacrificing. &nbsp; &nbsp;the creatures that were supposed to be blocked do not stay blocked.</p>

<p>So your assumption is I just jumped on here and made up a solution? &nbsp;I along with others have solved it. &nbsp;I practically told you how to win it. If you are assuming it does not work because the arrows show the creature targetting you after you sac your blockers
 I encourage you to actually finish the solution. &nbsp;The solution does not involve you sacing the creature to gain life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However per the existing rule set once a blocker is declared the attacking creature is blocked even if the blocker is removed. &nbsp;The sac effect works the same way it would if your opponent after you declared blockers used a removal spell on your blocker.
 &nbsp;Their attacking creature remains blocked, it will not do damage to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your assumptions of how blocking works is preventing you from completing the challenge.&nbsp;

<p>I am new to Magic entirely and was really stuck on this too, until i researched and found that blockers still block even after sacrificing them (the animations may suggest otherwise).</p>
<p>Once i found that out, the solution is pretty standard, even for a complete newbie like me :)</p>
<p>In summary, Vkandis is spot on!</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This issue can occur if the boot loader cannot find Windows 7 boot sector or boot files.
<div>Let’s follow these steps and check if it helps.</div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong></div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;Step 1:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>a. Insert the Windows 7 DVD and restart your computer<br />
&nbsp;b. Boot from the DVD.<br />
&nbsp;c. Choose your language and click Next.<br />
&nbsp;d. Click Repair Your Computer and then select Command Prompt and try the following commands:</div>
<div>cd /d f:\windows\system32</div>
<div>&nbsp;then press enter</div>
<div>bcdboot f:\windows /s c:</div>
<div>&nbsp;then press enter. </div>
<div>&nbsp;Close command prompt.</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;Restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2:</p>
<p>
</p><div>Use a Windows 7&nbsp;recovery disk and try the following commands in the Command Prompt option:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>• bootrec /fixmbr<br />
• bootrec /fixboot<br />
• bootrec /rebuildBCD</div>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Run Check disk and check if it helps. You can solve some computer problems by checking a drive or drives for errors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Check a drive for errors</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors</span></a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Microsoft does not recommend interrupting the CHKDSK process. Microsoft does not guarantee the integrity of the disk if the CHKDSK program is interrupted. For safety you can back up your data before using the check disk command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Hope this helps. Let us know the status of the issue.</p>

</p><p>Yesterday my main browser (Waterfox) wouldn't start due to this error but cmd.exe worked fine. However, today cmd.exe now doesn't run with the error.</p>

            <p>Malwarebytes AntiExploit is most likely the cause.&nbsp; You can quickly check this:</p>
<p>Right click on AntiExploit icon in the tray &gt; Stop protection</p>
<p>Test run Waterfox and CMD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix the problem:</p>
<p>Uninstall Malwarebytes Antiexploit</p>
<p>Restart the computer</p>
<p>Download and reinstall Malwarebytes Antiexploit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you recently installed or updated AntiExploit? </p>
<p>How long ago was the computer upgraded to Windows 10? </p>
<p>Was AntiExploit installed on the previous system?</p>

    <title>Kinect Lights - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> majornick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kinect Lights</h2>
                    
<p>My XB1 was DOA and I have already put in the advance exchange. I noticed that my Kinect has 3 red lights that won't turn off (they are horizontal in the center of the kinect). On the Xbox online support center page it says that a red light on the kinect
 is an issue. I also saw on the forums that those 3 lights might be the "infrared lights". Is the right light that the XOLSC page talks about the 3 red lights or is it talking about the light behind xbox logo on the front of the Kinect?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 with Norton Internet Security and iTunes</h2>
                    <p>I installed windows 10 soon after it was released, since then I have been having difficulty running Norton Internet security. I have removed and reinstalled Norton and was able to update and scan my laptop however Norton will not open. &nbsp;Also yesterday I
 noticed all my music has disappeared from iTunes - are these difficulties related to the installation of Windows 10. &nbsp;I did not have any difficulty before installation of Windows 10.</p>
<p>

            <span>Thanks for your response. &nbsp;Norton for 2015 has been installed on my laptop since April, however since I installed Windows 10, it wont open unless I remove it and reinstall it. &nbsp;I
 did this again on Friday and was able to get updates and run a scan. &nbsp;There is no error message displayed it just wont open. &nbsp;Regarding iTunes, I updated to the latest version also on Friday however my music is still missing (other than the album which U2
 released a while ago and was sent to everyone without being purchased/requested) &nbsp;I would like to know why my music disappeared from iTunes as I don't think I did anything that would have deleted it (and it is not in my recycle bin/deleted items). &nbsp; The music
 appears to still be on my laptop but is in various different files.</span>
<div>Any help would be appreciated.</div>
<div>Thank you</div>

            <p>Hi Brian, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Performing a check disk would help in getting the issue resolved. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Due to Windows 8.1 added security mechanism, you could be facing this permission issue. Hence if you need to access, take ownership of the drive and assign rights or permission to the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is guide on How to take ownership and grant permission in Window 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>"Access Denied" or other errors when accessing or working with files and folders in Windows</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Also applies to Windows 8.1 </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> <span>Perform <strong>Check disk</strong> and see if it helps.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>a</span></strong><span>: Press <strong>Windows Logo + C</strong> to open the Charms bar.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>b</span></strong><span>: Now click <strong>Settings</strong> and then
<strong>More PC Settings.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>c</span></strong><span>: Now click <strong>General</strong> and then
<strong>click Restart Now</strong> under <strong>Advanced Startup.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>d:</span></strong><span> Now Click <strong>Troubleshoot.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>e</span></strong><span>: Now click Advanced options and select <strong>
Command prompt.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>f</span></strong><span>: Type <strong>Chkdsk /r</strong> and hit enter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Important:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive,then chkdsk tries to repair that sector. If any data is available then<span>&nbsp;

            The problem resolved itself somehow.&nbsp; I guess that's the power of Microsoft Community - just the threat of intervention worked!!
