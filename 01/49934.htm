<h2>            Windows XP will not start</h2>
                    Hi, I have an XP that's about six years old. I was using it last night when all of a sudden it momentarily froze and then tried to restart itself.
<br />
I haven't installed any new hardware or software. I had been to the forums I use every day, then I started playing a BF42 secret weapons demo that I play all the time when I get bored. I was playing multiplayer on the same server I always go to, all running
 fine. Then out of nowhere the screen freezes, and vertical lines of colour flash up to the left of the screen. The screen then went black, and the computer began to reboot. It got about half way through the POST, the the screen went black again and it rebooted
 a second time. <br />
This time it went through seemingly fine until it got to the logo screen , which the colours looked a bit wierd on. The 'welcome' screen came up, then half of that screen disappeared and I could see the desktop behind it. It stayed like that for about five
 seconds, frozen, then the screen went black. About five seconds again, and the half welcome-half desktop screen again. It did this several times until, after hitting Ctrl+Alt+Delete a million times, I managed to get it to restart. It went through until it
 got to the logo screen, then the monitor lost signal and there was no power to the keyboard, even though the computer was still running. The power button proved useless, so I ended up having to use the reset button.
<br />
It started fine in safe mode, and continues to do so, but will not start normally. It's the same every time, fine till the logo (which is wierd colours with lines through it), then nothing. Booting with the 'last successful setup' gets me nowhere either.<br />
<br />
System:<br />
Microsoft Windows XP<br />

Pleeeeeeaaaase help, as I really really need it for study...<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>- Is it booting successfully in safe mode?<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>: This seems like some driver on your computer is corrupt that is not allowing you start in normal mode. So, please try logging into low resolution mode.
</p>
<div><br />
I’d suggest you to go to advanced boot menu options again by pressing F8 key on your keyboard continuously before the windows logon screen appears</div>
<div><br />
In Advanced boot menu options, click on ‘Enable low-resolution video (640x480)’ to start your computer in low resolution mode.<br />
<br />
Check if you are able to start computer in low resolution mode.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2</strong>: Update display drivers from safe mode.</div>

            <p>Hello Zac,</p>
<p>Since your computer is booting all well and good in safe mode, then it's most probably either a virus or driver problem.
</p>
<p>Have u installed any new devices or made an upgrade before the issue occured? If so, then try removing all new programs, drivers and devices you installed before the issue occured. Uninstall any unneded drivers until u find the culprit.</p>
<p>I don't think it's a hardware problem since you can start it in safe mode, but you should check the insides of your computer just in case (check if all the cables are in their proper places, etc).
</p>
<p>If you have system restore turned on (by default you do), then try restoring to an earlier restore point (start system restore from safe mode).
</p>
<p>Try running an antivirus full system scan (dont do quick, do a full one) from safe mode (if you don't have an antivirus program already installed try downloading a free one (like Microsoft Security Essentials or MalwareBytes Antimalware (free version of
 malwarebytes is only for scanning). </p>
<p>If none works then try running sfc /scannow from command prompt or sigverif.exe, to verify that all the system files were not changed.
</p>
<p>If none of the solutions work, then do an in-place upgrade to Windows XP (upgrade Windows XP to Windows XP, I know it's odd, but it works almost always if it's not a virus problem, and you will not lose any files or programs in this case (but if u have viruses
 they will come too&nbsp;:P). </p>
<p>Tell me if this fixed ur problem XD</p>
<p>Your's sincerely,</p>
<p>Calasan Marko</p>

            Hi Alfa,<br />
<br />
Sorry for not getting back to you sooner. I have bought a laptop now, and I just found this topic again (took a little bit of doing lol).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I tried running it in low resolution mode, that seemed to work fine.<br />
<br />
I updated the display drivers and at first it seemed to be working. But when I tried to restart- same problem. Will only start in safe mode or low resolution mode :/<br />
<br />
<br />
I just now tried to start it again. Now I'm getting a new message: 'OC fail, please enter setup to change OC fail setting'. There's two options- press F1 to continue or press Del to enter Bios Setup.<br />
<br />
I've done a little Googling and apparently OC stands for Over Clocking. I'm not overclocking so I don't know what the go is with that.
<br />
<br />
I'm about at my wit's end with this thing :S<br />
        </p>

            Hey Calasan,<br />
Sorry I took so long to reply.<br />
<br />
I hadn't installed any new hardware or software, or made any system changes beforehand. That's what's got me baffled, everything was the same as normal, running fine, and then all a sudden it decides playtime's over.<br />
<br />
I thought at first it might have been a virus, so I ran every full scan I had through the computer. Malwarebytes, Avast and even Spybot Search and Destroy (not actually a virus scanner though I don't think lol) but it came up clean every time.
<br />
<br />
I tried system restoring to an earlier time (the day before it started acting up), but still no luck.<br />
<br />
I checked all the cables and things inside, everything appeared A-okay there.<br />
<br />
I didn't get a chance to try the command prompt thing you mentioned, or reinstalling the OS disk.
<br />
<br />
Now I'm getting a new problem when it boots. When it gets to the screen where you can press F12 for boot settings etc., it gives me this message: "OC fail, please enter setup to change OC fail setting". Below that it says I can 'press F1 to continue' or 'press
 Del to enter Bios Setup'.<br />
I'm not Over Clocking, so I don't know why this would be an issue :S<br />
<br />
I'm about ready to take it to my local IT repair shop and fork out for them to look at it instead. Man I wish I knew more than just the basics about these things :/<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help though Calasa, I greatly appreciate it :)<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
Zac<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>It sounds more like a faulty graphics card to me, possibly caused by overheating. Is it passively cooled (no fan)? Or is it fan cooled? If the latter it could be choked up with dust. Cleaning it may solve the problem but permanent damage may already have
 been done. Can you cross test with another graphics card?</p>
<p>Before cleaning or swapping the graphics card, power down the PC as best you can (if it's even powered up!), disconnect from the mains and take antistatic precautions.</p>
<p>Tricky</p>

            Hi Tricky,<br />
<br />
The graphics card is passively cooled. It's a NVIDIA GeForce 7300 SE/7200 GS. Unfortunately I don't have a spare graphics card to test it.<br />
<br />
Ultra-stupid question time: how should I power down the PC now? At the moment it's sitting on the Bios Setup screen, should I just disconnect the power cord?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Zac <br />

<p>At BIOS there should be no harm in just pulling the cord. Or just hold in the power button until it shuts off.</p>

    <title>Serious performance issues &#40;DPC lag&#41; and lots of the error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> death butt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Serious performance issues &#40;DPC lag&#41; and lots of the error Event ID&#58; 11 atapi. &#40;sort of resolved&#41;</h2>
                    <p>EDIT: I've given up on figuring out the exact problem here. I installed Win 7 on the working drive (C:). Interactions between Win 7 and the problematic disk (D:) such as navigating the directory or copying files, slowed up the OS, but otherwise it works
 fine. It's either some weird hardware issue that doesn't show up on SMART, an incompatibility with Win 7, or something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mother recently upgraded from XP to Windows 7 32-bit on her computer and complained about it being slow. I'm checking it out while visiting but can't figure out the exact issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, the symptoms. The computer is very slow to boot/log in and for the first 15+ minutes of operation. The mouse lags and has choppy movement, menus and programs take forever to load, Flash videos have glitchy audio and laggy video, etc. It also slows
 down when doing things like opening programs. The event log has tons and tons of these Event ID: 11 "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The driver detected a controller error on \Device\Ide\IdePort0" errors, with the qualifier 49156.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the setup. It's a Core 2 Duo with 2GB RAM, so the specs are sufficient. There are two physical hard drives. One (C:) is a smaller SATA drive which holds the XP installation and the Windows boot loader. The second (D:) is a bigger IDE drive (Western
 Digital Caviar SE WD 2500JB 250GB 7200 RPM 8MB Cache IDE Ultra ATA100/ATA-6 3.5' Hard Drive) which is connected as a slave to a CD/DVD drive which holds the Win7 installation. I've tried plugging it in as master (and changed the jumper accordingly) with no
 effect. It also has an NVIDIA GeForce 8400 GS, but I don't think that's relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done some investigating and found that the source of the performance drop seems to be related to system interrupts and high disk usage. When the slowness is at its worst, Resource Monitor says that one of the two CPU cores is running at or near 100%,
 almost entirely from system interrupts. It also shows that D: is sitting at 100% activity with a disk queue length that frequently goes over 5, 10, even 20-30, all the while reporting a total transmission rate of 1-2MB/s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also downloaded DPC Latency Checker V1.3.0 and found that its reported DPC lag correlates very strongly with performance, disk and CPU usage, and the noise coming from the hard drive (I'm assuming head movements). A full ten minutes after the desktop loads,
 DPC checker reports a consistent latency between 30,000-60,000 microseconds. I've seen the absolute maximum go above one second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the computer is allowed to idle long enough, it can start becoming responsive. The DPC lag, CPU usage, disk activity, and queue length approach more reasonable values. However there are still frequent spikes above 2,000 microseconds and anything like
 launching a program makes it shoot back up. I've followed the DPC Checker instructions of disabling various devices one by one until the problem goes away, but haven't had any success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I booted into XP, which works fine and doesn't report any errors even when copying to/from the D: drive and ran a full Check Disk (Phases 4 and 5 included) on the disk and the event log showed no errors other than 319 file records that didn't point to existing
 data or something. There aren't any bad sectors or anything. After that I also got Windows 7 to run chkdsk on boot but the first couple phases were running much more slowly than they had in Win XP so I aborted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have looked at the SMART status with smartctl, but all the values read okay and the drive reads as having 'PASSED' the health check. I haven't run the long test yet, however, only the short test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, sorry if that was overly verbose, redunant, or confusing. I don't know a whole lot about Windows on a technical level and don't know what might be relevant. I don't know where to go from here in terms of troubleshooting. My feeling is that there's
 either something wrong with the drive that SMART isn't picking up, or there's a driver issue with the HDD or maybe even some other component. If it's something wrong with the drive I can wipe the C: drive and reinstall Win7 on there, but I'd like to know what's
 going on first.</p>

            <p>I'm facing the same problem. I was using a Windows 8.1 and on upgrading to Windows 10, my Kaspersky Internet Security was removed. I re-downloaded it and installed it and on doing that, my laptop keyboard and touch-pad stopped working. I had to uninstall
 it for them to work again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found an update for Kaspersky Internet Security on their support site but will still test it as the current version I had has clearly an incompatibility issue there, even though it didn't appear on the check up prior to the Windows 10 update.</p>

<h2>            Is product key required for clean install of windows 10 pro version 1511 build 10586 on currently installed windows 10 pro build 10240</h2>
                    <p>Hello community,</p>
<p>Currently I've my systems upgraded to windows 10 pro build 10240(not a clean install). Now that Microsoft have released Windows 10 pro ver 1511 build 10586, I'm planning to do a clean install with new release.</p>
<p>My queries</p>
<p>1- On doing a clean install from activated old windows 10 pro version to newer release will it have problems with product activation?</p>
<p>2- I need to update 4 systems to latest release and so I require offline installer. Will media creation tool give latest version?&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps
 below and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>Open Personalization by clicking the
</span></span><strong><span>Start</span></strong><span><span> button, and then clicking
</span></span><strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong><span><span>. In the search box, type
</span></span><strong><span>personalization</span></strong><span><span>, and then click
</span></span><strong><span>Personalization</span></strong><span><span>.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the theme that you want to change to apply it to your desktop.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do one or more of the following:</span></p>
<p>
<span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To change the background, click
<strong><span>Desktop Background</span></strong>, select the check box for the image that you want to use, and then click
<strong><span>Save changes</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To change the color of window borders, click
<strong><span>Window Color</span></strong>, click the color that you want to use, adjust the intensity, and then click
<strong><span>Save changes</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To change the sounds for the theme, click
<strong><span>Sounds</span></strong>, click an item in the
<strong><span>Sound Schemes</span></strong> list, and then click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To add or change a screen saver, click
<strong><span>Screen Saver</span></strong>, click an item in the
<strong><span>Screen saver</span></strong> list, change any settings that you want to change, and then click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Your revised theme will appear under My Themes as an unsaved theme. If you want to come back to your unsaved
 theme later, make sure you save it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>When you have a
 computer with good graphics capabilities, Aero helps your system run faster (all programs are cached into the video card, so when you move a window, the OS doesn't have to ask applications underneath to "please redraw everything again", which eats up your
 processor cycles.&nbsp; Plus, Classic mode uses an older technology known as GDI for drawing all the windows on the screen, which is old (from 1989) and frequently causes applications to crash, hang, or Blue Screen.<br />
<br />
In addition to the performance boost, Aero gives you all the great features such as previews from the taskbar.</span></p>

            Hi, I am the VP of Engineering of Wowd. I am sorry to hear that you have had trouble with that installer, but I don't think it is ours. The Wowd software definitely does not ask you to change the Windows mode or any other Windows setting. The only&nbsp;user
 prompts during installation are&nbsp;to accept the&nbsp;EULA and to specify installation directory.&nbsp;The program itself is written in Java and the entire UI is run within a web browser window, so we have no direct interest in the Windows UI settings.<br />
<br />
Are you sure you got a genuine Wowd installation file? Did you download it from our site? Is the file signed by "Wowd Inc."?<br />
<br />
If so, please get back in touch with me in this forum or via email to 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and we will arrange to get access to your installer file in order to investigate what happened.<br />
<br />
-Bill<br />

                    I save the pic files but when I attempt to open them in my pictures or other programs, they are either unpresent in my documents lists, or I get a "invalid file" message.&nbsp; I am using Windows 7 but had the same problem with XP.&nbsp; Also couldn't save the file

            .PHP is not an extension I recognize. &nbsp;I am thinking it is specific to the program you are using to create it. &nbsp;I would check to see if there is a "save as" option in the File Menu. &nbsp;If so, save it as a picture file (extensions will be something like:
 .jpg, .bmp, .png).
<div><br />
<div>Maybe you could edit your question to name the specific program you are using.</div>

                    <p>Hello,&nbsp; I've been having an issue where my computer will BSOD upon waking it from sleep. It's not every time that it happens, but it happens enough for it to be a problem.</p>

<p>The minidump file &nbsp;referenced the USBXHCI.SYS :</p>
<p><br />
<em>BugCheck 44, {ffff960dff51f5e0, 120c, 0, 0}</em></p>
<p><em>*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for win32k.sys</em><br />
<em>*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for win32k.sys</em><br />
<em><strong>Probably caused by : USBXHCI.SYS</strong> ( USBXHCI!Isoch_Transfer_CompleteCancelable+1f1 )</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Did the start of the issue coincide with any software or hardware change related to USB?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the error may be caused by a Focusrite driver&nbsp;which have been known to cause the MULTIPLE_IRP_COMPLETE_REQUESTS (44) error such as in&nbsp;the following topic:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/multiple-irp-requestsirql-not-less-than/4dc0ba98-83d9-491c-98c4-264de3ae195c">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/multiple-irp-requestsirql-not-less-than/4dc0ba98-83d9-491c-98c4-264de3ae195c</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try uninstalling and reinstalling the Focusrite drivers.</p>

<p>I'm afraid I've put off getting this solved for too long and now I can't remember when it started.<br />
<br />
However, now I know this Focusrite Interface (Scarlett Solo 2nd Gen) has been nothing but a source of BSODs on two different systems on two different versions of windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My workaround for now will be to unplug my interface after I put my system to sleep. Might help with the BSODs until I get a new interface. Thanks for the help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Curious though, could this also be caused by a powered USB hub?</p>

<h2>            RAC Task Error In Task Scheduler</h2>
                    <p>I'm getting an error when I go into Task Scheduler where RACTask has a problem with its contents. I cannot locate anything on RAC within folder RAC as suggested by other solutions, the folder is simply blank. When I use file explorer, I can locate a RACTask
 File but cannot understand what's wrong with it. I tried locating RACTask.exe in my System32 folder but with no luck. The task does somehow have records of it running successfully, which is all the more confusing. I have pictures and the RACTask file that
 doesn't appear within Task Scheduler, but file cant be posted... Here's what I'm seeing (Sorry about the Dark theme)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice How there's no RacTask.exe</p>

            <p>Hello Atul, I have a very similar problem to Kyle's issue. I can navigate to the RAC folder in task scheduler, but it contains no tasks, not even hidden tasks. I am getting an error message when I open task scheduler, and if i navigate to "C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\RAC",
 it shows a RacTask file. The folder "C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\Event Viewer Tasks" is empty.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>the error from task scheduler:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The selected task "{0}" no longer exists. To see the current tasks, click Refresh.</p>

<h2>            Event viewer-- What is going on in your computer</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Basic
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><p>Event viewer is the integrated logging system of almost all things that happen in (and on) your computer.&nbsp; There are literally hundreds of categories and thousand of logs.&nbsp; It is vital in helping those who want to know how the system works and what is going
 on to help fix computer issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest problem with Event Viewer is that it is really confusing There are lots of warnings, errors, and other information, and without knowing what it all means, you may think there is something wrong when there is not and the reverse is also true.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">It is so confusing that scammers use it to help convince users they are infected.</span></strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you prefer we look at your logs see the instructions for how at the bottom of this wiki.&nbsp; Often we will see things you do not and have software to help us analyze them</strong></p>
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><p>To open event viewer <span>Press the <strong>Win key + "R"</strong> and type eventvwr&gt;enter&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>The below applies primarily to Win 7, win 8/8.1 &amp; win 10 but is also applicable to vista.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Event viewer is divided into 3 panes.&nbsp;
</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The left hand pane is called the <strong>folder view</strong> and you can find all&nbsp; the different event logs, and the views that can be customized with events from many logs at once.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The middle pane displays a <strong>list of events</strong>, and clicking on any of them will display the details in the preview pane.&nbsp; You can double-click&nbsp; them to pull it up in a separate window&nbsp; This can be handy when you are looking through a big set
 of events and want to find all the important things before digging deeper</p>
<p>
</p><p>The right pane is a <strong>quick access</strong> pane for doing things like clearing logs, creating custom views, filtering, or even creating a scheduled task based on a particular event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should clear event viewer logs <strong>only when you are not having problems
</strong>or after you have fixed one.&nbsp; They grow quite large and no-one wants to look through thousands of events.&nbsp; You can clear them by clicking on the log you want to clear (for example application) then clicking clear in the quick access panel.&nbsp; You can
 also right click the log&gt;delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dbd23c1c-1cd8-4af9-b07d-18ba65c3d38d" /><br />
</p>
<p>The middle pane can be <strong>sorted </strong>by <strong>date, level, source, event ID, and category</strong> depending on what you are looking for,&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The date and level are the more important.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Y</em></span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>ou want to know what is happening now (date) and the level (how severe).&nbsp;
</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Levels can be one of four.&nbsp; <strong>Information, warning, error, and critical error.&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>Obviously you are most concerned with error and critical errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>To </strong><span><strong>provide us with your Event Viewer administrative logs by following these steps:</strong></span>
</p>
<span>
<span>
<div>Press the <strong>Win key + "R"</strong> and type eventvwr&gt;enter</div>
<div>
<p>Expand <strong>Custom Views</strong><br />

    <title>Java Uninstall Problem&#58; &#34;The installation source for this - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> corkster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Java Uninstall Problem&#58; &#34;The installation source for this product is not available. Verify that the source exsists and that you can access it.&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I'm having a bit of trouble trying to uninstall Java so I can reinstall it. I keep getting this error message:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The installation source for this product is not available.&nbsp;Verify that the source exsists and that you can access it." When I try to find the installation package to uninstall. I'm the only person on my Windows Vista Ultimate laptop and I am the administrator
 on the computer. I can't seem to find anything when I search for it while uninstalling. When I go to 'Computer &gt; Local Disc (C:) &gt; Progam Files &gt; Java' I can see a whole bunch of files, but I can't find the installation package with the 'Installation Pacakge
 .msi' at the end of it. I can find 'install.rdf'</p>
<p>I was wondering if anyone can help me find the source for Java so I can uninstall and reinstall so my Java works properly.</p>
<p>Java was uninstalled before when my brother's Elluminate Program (Online Meetings For His School) and I guess when it was reinstalled something went wrong but I have 2 Java programs. One by Oracle and one by Sun Microsystems Inc. and the one I'm trying to
 install is the one by Sun Microsystems Inc.</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

    <title>Activate Microsoft Solitaire Collection after Windows 10 reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vasterror  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activate Microsoft Solitaire Collection after Windows 10 reset</h2>
                    <p>Installed the free upgrade from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 Pro and was disappointed to lose Chess Titans, but such is life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I had to reset Windows 10, and am in the processing of re-installing applications removed by the reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now, Microsoft Solitaire Collection does not work.&nbsp; I click on the icon in the start list, but nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a big game player - I have serious work to do - but sometimes when I am stuck, it is nice to take on a different challenge for a little while.&nbsp; Getting my mind off of the current frustration can sometimes be enough of a break to see a new perspective
 when I return to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Losing Chess Titans was a blow, and I have not found an adequate replacement.&nbsp; But I have made do with FreeCell and Spider, both of which do require some analytical thought and pattern matching.&nbsp; But now I don't even have those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>C'mon, people!&nbsp; Give me a break!&nbsp; What must I do to recover that small, but essential diversion?</p>

            Здравствуйте! 
<br />
<br />Попробуйте устранить ошибки «синего экрана»:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/ru-ru/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/ru-ru/help/14238/...</a>
<br /> проверьте оперативную память и видеокарту, и обновите драйверы:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/ru-ru/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/ru-ru/help/402844...</a>
<br />+
<br />Попробуйте выполнить проверку на ошибки и восстановление системных файлов.
<br />
<br />Для этого нажмите правой кнопкой на меню Пуск, выберите командная строка (администратор). Или "Windows PowerShell (администратор)".
<br />
<br />В открывшемся окне напечатайте Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth и нажмите Enter. 
<br />Команда начнет выполняться, нужно подождать(иногда команда может выполняться и 30 минут, в это время может показаться, что всё "зависло")
<br />
<br />Обращайте внимание на пробелы в командах!!!
<br />Затем напечатайте sfc /scannow и нажмите Enter.
<br />
<br />
<br />Удачи вам!

<h2>            lenovo toga tablet 2 won&#39;t &#34;install windows&#34; after refresh</h2>
                    <p>I got a Lenovo yoga tablet 2 for Christmas and it worked well for the first couple months but in February it started working slow and the system recommended a refresh where it I wouldn't erase my pictures, videos or music. So I refreshed it then it restarted,
 it turned on to the LENOVO screen and said "Welcome." Then it said "setting up a few more things" with a percentage going up. When it reached 100% a window comes up saying "windows could not complete the installation. to install windows on this computer, restart
 the installation." And I have done so but it still continues to do this. It charges, I have tried holding the restart button, but nothing happens. I have looked online for the same problem but found nothing. Any solutions?</p>

<h2>            Error 0x87DD0017</h2>
                    
<p>To begin with, I am on a university connection and unable to change any settings of the actual network. However, this was never a problem on my Xbox 360. My NAT type is open, and "Test network connection" works and gives me no errors. However, "Test multiplayer
 connection" gives me the Teredo IP error. If I try to sign into my account it gives me the 0x87DD0017 error, rendering my One a useless box because apparently you can't play games without being signed in to an account. I am able to install games and download
 their respective updates just fine. In "Detailed network statistics" it's showing a download speed of 93.21 Mbps with 0% packet loss, but for upload speed and upload packet loss it is blank. I feel this has something to do with it.</p>

<p>Are you guys using Sky Broadband at all?</p>
<p>If you are I've just put a guide to fixing the issue on: forums.xbox.com/.../1749555.aspx</p>
<p>It's a problem with Sky Shield picking up login.live.com as a phishing site.</p>

<h2>            DNS is Strict&#47;Moderate help</h2>
                    
<p>I&nbsp; have a NetGear Model CGD24G and the last few days my Xbox Live has been telling me I have a strict DNS. I tried multiple things to fix it, includinng turning on UPnP, and even using my Laptop as a wired network instead of my normal wireless one. I continue
 to have a strict DNS except when I used my laptop to hook up to XBL I had instead Moderate DNS. I'm trying to get it to open, but I'd rather not have to use a wired Network. Please, any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hey mate, please try <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/978847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this guide</a> for DNS error messages. However, if you're getting a message about your NAT being strict, you'll need to check
