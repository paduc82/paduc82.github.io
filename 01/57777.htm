<h2>            windows 10 aes2501b device disconnected</h2>
                    <p>This is in reference to the post&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware-winpc/windows-10-aes2501b-device-device-disconnected/bf112a3f-4049-4408-9b37-45fc90d5a1fb that made me solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution in there did not work for me, but the statement about device not offering the&nbsp;<span>ability to turn off power management was not true in my case. So I just unchecked the "Allow the computer
 to turn off this device to save power" and the annoying sound disappeared.</span></p>

            Hi Briny
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />Check if its working...
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isnâ€:tm:t fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. Itâ€:tm:s possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you donâ€:tm:t have any. If you donâ€:tm:t have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=outlet+tester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=s...</a>). Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system wonâ€:tm:t be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. Slackâ€:tm:s Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.
<br />
<br />10. Replace Charger or Battery Module
<br />
<br />Ultimately, if you donâ€:tm:t see any improvements after trying all the above, then itâ€:tm:s maybe best that you replace either the charger or battery itself. This will require contacting your laptop manufacturer and placing an order. Batteries and the chargers are not necessarily cheap, especially if its an older system. But, if you have no choice, its something you will just have to do to get your system back in working order.

<h2>            Windows 10 screen zooming issue.</h2>
                    <p>I installed windows 10 on my computer. My monitor is 1920x1080, and this setting is correct in display. the text/apps items are on the far left (100%), and the magnifier is also at 100%. I have also update my driver to its latest setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, my desktop is still zoomed in. &nbsp;Icons appear just off the screen, as well as my taskbar show the very tip but the rest is off the screen. I have no idea what my issue is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also set up a dual monitor, it works fine. Until I unplug my primary monitor. Then the second monitor persist with the same problem. If anyone can help me please do. I am very frustrated. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Xbox One X Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> declaredfiber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One X Problems</h2>
                    Why does the Xbox One X system have so many issues? Every time I try and do anything on my console theres something wrong. I purchase all of my X consoles brand new from the Microsoft Store. Its just the Xbox One X console itself. This is supposed to be
 the most powerful gaming console in the world. Seems to be an overclocked Xbox One S to me that runs unstable. It may play some games better. But at what cost. It doesn't run cool. Heat is still a factor in the x console. That rules out longevity. Guess its
 only as good as the warranty. Thats why its best to buy the accidental coverage witch is an extra 50 bucks. Returns are still a hassle too. In&nbsp; my opinion the Xbox One X system is definitely not worth the upgrade and not worth the price. It mys well be called
 the most power disposable gaming console. I don't recommend anyone saving up for this console. You will end up disappointed.

            Console gets hot in a short time and starts to sound like a jet about to take off. I have to restart my console in order to load a digital game. I have plenty of room around my console for ventilation. My room stays cool too. Im constantly having to restart
 my console. I know its not good to keep restarting it so much.

<p>G'day,</p>
<p>In my opinion, the XBOX1X<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> is definitely</span> worth upgrading to, especially if you are still on a XBOX360. You will not be disappointed!&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">XBOX
 1 X details</a></p>
<p>You mention "many issues". What are they? Hardware or software related?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had my XBX1X since Day 1 release back in Nov. 2017 and have had no problems with any part of the hardware. True, there will always be the odd manufacturing fault that slips past Quality Assurance, like anything else made, but these would be at a minimum
 and not something with "all brand new purchases".</p>
<p>Are you sure there is not anything wrong with your&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/browse/xbox-one/networking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Network</a>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in Insider Previews so expect some issues with <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/system-update-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OS software releases (latest)</a>, but have never had hardware failure.</p>

            Just because a console gets warm doesn't mean it's going to break. It matters how the console handles and dissipates that heat.

<p>How many XB1X's are connected to your network? Are they a wired connection or do you connect all of them via WiFi?</p>

    <title>start button unresponsive in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> molly-coddle  say:</h3>
<h2>            start button unresponsive in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from 8.1 to Windows 10 on 3 December 2015 with no apparent problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since 10 December I find that: </p>
<p>
</p><p>the Start (Windows) icon at bottom left is unresponsive with both left and right clicks. The Windows key on the keyboard is also unresponsive. So I can't shut down at present</p>
<p>
</p><p>icons have disappeared from the taskbar</p>
<p>
</p><p>the time and date have disappeared</p>
<p>
</p><p>The task view icon is present and responds to a right click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was an auto upgrade about two days ago but don't know if that is the cause of the above problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clues how I might remedy the situation? Many thanks.</p>

            <p>Okay, So i realise this is a few months old, But i get the same issue.</p>
<p>I have since found an easy way to remedy this, it does not take the problem away but it will correct it.</p>
<p>When the windows button and search bar become unresponsive.]</p>
<p>Press ctrl-Alt-Del, -&gt; Processes -&gt; search for "settings" and end the task, it appears this freezes and causes the taskbar to become unresponsive, tried it 10x now and it works everytime for me.</p>
<p>Let me know if it helps you guys</p>

            <p>Killing the Settings process did not work for me. &nbsp;The Windows Key and the Start Button are still non-functioning for me, even after a Restart. &nbsp;I can access the right-click menu on the Start Button, and am able to start Task Manager that way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: Eventually none of the buttons on my Task Bar worked (after killing the Settings process?), I couldn't start any programs. &nbsp;Right Clicking on the Start Button and selecting Shutdown only took me back to the desktop. &nbsp;I finally did an emergency shutdown
 (held the power button down for 10 seconds) to shut it down. &nbsp;After powering back on things seem to be back to normal (I hope).</p>

 I rename the old bcd file and although I run the appropriate command “<span>bcdboot c:\windows /l en-us /s V: /f UEFI” when I search for the BCD, it doesn’t appear anywhere.
</span></p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It&nbsp;may be that your are not booting properly with the repair\installation media...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experience with the Access Denied message you describe happen when a UEFI machine is booted with media in a "Legacy" mode, or vice\versa... Especially if using a bootable DVD...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What worked for me was to use the specific type of repair media for your machine... A DVD does not usually qualify for that, but can sometimes be used...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My workaround was to access Boot Options at the Manufacturer's (POST) screen...</p>
<p>F9, F11, F12, or whatever your machine uses, and look for Specific boot devices...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example... "UEFI Optical Drive" or simply "Optical Drive".... "UEFI Flash Drive" or simply "Flash Drive"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If using UEFI Bios, select the "UEFI"&nbsp;device, and if using Legacy Bios, select the standard device...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the commands I use from the command prompt available on the bootable Repair\Installation media...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BOOTREC /FIXMBR, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>
</p><p>BOOTREC /FIXBOOT, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>
</p><p>BOOTREC /REBUILDBCD, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be best to unhook any additional drives other than the OS drive, but not absolutely necessary...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... Do not reboot between commands... run all three before rebooting...</p>

<p>SLance, thank you, but I’ve already passed these initial steps. &nbsp;The first issue to resolve is why it won’t let me complete the bootrec /fixboot. &nbsp;I get the all to common - Access not allowed</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the steps I included above were what I attempted to fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It didn’t resolve it. &nbsp;I was told I needed to rename the BCD directory, but it won’t allow me to do that either. &nbsp;So I’m starting again. &nbsp;I’m guessing this has to do with a recent update from MSFT which is when all this started. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am suggesting is to not use the previous steps at all...</p>
<p>There should be no need to do all that stuff...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot to the command prompt and simply run the commands...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned... Not selecting the proper UEFI boot method will cause the Access Denied error... I'm sure there are other reasons as well, but that simple issue drove me nuts for days...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... Which build are you currently running ?</p>

<p>First, thank you so very much for your rapid response! &nbsp;I’m running the latest version I could find via Microsoft and load onto a Flash drive. Not sure what that actually is though as there is no indication of what version it is. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can run 2 of the 3 bootrec commands you suggested, but as many have experienced, the “/fixboot” command consistently provides the “access denied” message. &nbsp;I have tried renaming the bcd directory and creating a new one which did not work either. &nbsp;I just
 ran Chkdsk as well and saw a number of corrupted files that were either fixed or deleted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is hard to say what is going on with the ChkDsk… It could be bad spots on the drive, or files that became corrupted somehow... Obviously, there is a possibility that is the root cause of your problem, but probably not...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just finished up a clean install of the latest public build 17763.1...</p>
<p>This is what would download from the Create Media site...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine was set up for Legacy Bios, and I needed to switch it to UEFI to better duplicate your problem... It's getting late and I will not be able to more until tomorrow...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest trying one thing in particular... Use a tool called RUFUS to create a flash drive from the ISO you downloaded...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure RUFUS is configured to create a flash drive specifically for UEFI Bios... It should look similar to this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note the "Partition Scheme" GPT, "Target System" UEFI, and "File System" FAT32... These are critical to avoid the Access Denied error when attempting Fix Boot... As I mentioned, there are other possible reasons for the error, but this is one possibility..</p>

<p>Additionally, the new RUFUS tool looks a little different now, but the most important challenge is where/how to find/download the latest Windows. &nbsp;When I look at the “boot selection” the only options available are&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>non bootable</p>
<p>free dos</p>
<p>disk or ISO image (Please Select). &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would not even mess with the DiskPart stuff... I think Volume 3 that you posted should be "EFI" not "ESP.", and should not have a "period (.)"... That may or may not be an issue..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wrong about the boot media configuration causing the Access Denied error for "FixBoot"... From what I can tell, this was caused on my machines by a glitch in the BootRec commands on all Windows 10 builds since 15063 (1703)… I had forgotten about that
 as I rarely need the BootRec commands..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The wrong boot media configuration causes the "RebuildBCD" command to have issues... It will detect a OS, but when selected returns a "Not Found" error...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A problem I have encountered is that now that I have made it past the FixBoot error, the RebuildBCD is saying "0" Installations found, and I don't have a clue as to why...</p>
<p>
</p><p>But to get past your Access Denied problem, you will probably need to get ahold of a 15063 (1703) or earlier ISO...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will see if I can get around the " 0 Installations Found" message I am currently getting... It might be something inherent in build 17763 (1809)..</p>

<p>Ok. &nbsp;Thanks. &nbsp;And the “.” Are not in the system. &nbsp;It’s a glitch with the editor on this board. &nbsp;When you space over, it automatically puts in a “.”. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, unless you can find something more about it... I think it would be easier to just reload the O/S. &nbsp;But to do that, I’m guessing I need to delete the existing one as everytime I try to go down that road, the system tells me it’s already installed
 and tries to get me to update it... which, of course, fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any suggestions on how to do a clean install? &nbsp;I’m going to have to figure out how to back up my data first via the command prompt.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In order to use RUFUS you need to have an existing ISO to browse to...</p>
<p>It will not download one...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The site to Create Media for Windows 10 will allow creating a ISO instead of creating a Flash Drive or "Upgrading"...</p>

</p><p>You need to download and run the tool, or just select "RUN" instead of "Save"..</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are legitimate ISO's available from 3rd party sources... The downloads actually come from Microsoft as the links are redirected to their servers...</p>
<p>
</p><p>One is available through a downloadable tool that does not install from Heidoc.net..</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can copy\backup your files through the bootable command prompt by simply entering Notepad...</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Enter NotePad into Command Prompt and hit Enter...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on "FILE" Tab and select "OPEN"</p>

<p>Hi Zululand,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p><em>"BLUE COLOURS ARE COMING UP FROM BEHIND MY PICTURES AND ICONS"</em></p>
<p>Does this happen anywhere else besides the Desktop, where your icons are?</p>
<p>Here's an article about reinstalling drivers:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></p>
<p>Check out the 'manually install drivers' section specifically.</p>
<p>Even if the driver says it's OK for the display adapter, I would reinstall it.</p>

</p><p>Hey, I also have this problem. I'm sick of having to type in the PW every time. Plus there's another thing, which is quite scary. My laptop turns on itself late at night when I'm sleeping. This happens every night, even if I shut down or press and hold the
 power button to kill the computer. When I wake up, the laptop is on and the fan is running, which means the processor is working. But the display is off. Weird. Scary.</p>

 sleep now, until I wake it up. Thanks again.

            <p>Hi Olivier, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Does the issue persist on all the games?</p>
<p>2. Are the other applications opening fine?</p>
<p>3. Is the computer booting quickly to the desktop? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adjusting the Visual effects, indexing options, power settings, performing a disk cleanup and using ready boost are some of the tasks that you can undertake to increase the speed of the computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform steps from the link mentioned below and see if there is an increase in computers performance.

            Well, the most applications go as they do normally, but games ex. League Of Legends, Dishonored, Glare, CoD MW2, ... are running with an average FPS &lt; 20, that's quite annoying if you buy a nice laptop and can't play on it :S&nbsp;

            <p>I'm having issues with games in Windows 8.1 . The first try to update Windows 8 went so badly that I had to reinstall Windows 8 , then update to Windows 8.1 , giving me a fresh system , then reinstall everything , using the newest drivers for everything
 .&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Team Fortress 2 from Valve software I have gone from 90 FPS in Windows 8 to 21 FPS in Windows 8.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn , I have gone from 85 FPS with everything maxed out ( highest detail ) in Windows 8 , to 4 FPS with everything set to minimum in Windows 8.1 ( At highest detail I was getting .05 FPS according to Fraps ).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Al other programs work just fine . Voice communications ( Ventrilo and TeamSpeak ) suffer no problems . MS Office runs like a charm . Only games , which go full screen , seem to suffer under Windows 8.1.</p>

            Same problem for me with similar drops.<br />
<br />
Everyone gives me a run around and I've tried it all.&nbsp; It's dual boot, so I format drive and do fresh W8 install -- same problem.<br />
<br />
It's drivers, tried multiple ones -- same problem.<br />
<br />
It's software -- fresh install, no additional software other than drivers and game.<br />
<br />
It's temps -- temps are fine, nothing has changed with my hardware since having 80+ on Windows 7.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I've came to the conclusion that Windows 8 is garbage and no one actually knows why these FPS drops happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm tired of getting the run around so I'm switching back to Windows 7.<br />

            I've got a problem with games on W8.1 too. Back on W8 everything was fine, BF3 was running perfectly, now on 8.1 it's a miracle if I get 40 FPS. ..

            <p>I'm running a quad core AMD Phenom Black edition 3 Ghz processor .</p>
<p>I'm running 8Gb of DDR3 1066 Ram </p>
<p>I have a Samsung 840 Pro SSD as my system drive , several Sata 3 drives as data and backup drives and 2&nbsp; 500GB Sata II drives in Raid 0 formation for my games .</p>
<p>&nbsp;NOTHING is overclocked and temperature monitors rarely have my CPU going over 48 C and GPU temps ( thanks to the 3 fans on my Nvidia GTX 770 ) rarely reach 50C, and that is only when I am running something like Batman Arkham Origins with everything maxed
 out .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now , under Windows 8 , I "was" getting 75-85 FPS in Final Fantasy XIV:ARR , then I updated to Windows 8.1 and suddenly was maxing out at 12 FPS . So I decided to go BACK to Windows 8 . I did a fresh reinstall ( wiped the main drive , zeroed it out so
 I would have no potential conflicts ) of Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I then updated everything , all Windows updates , the newest drivers for everything , cideo , sound , keyboard , mouse , EVERYTHING .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fresh install of Windows 8 , fresh install of FFXIV ...... max out at 12 FPS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go "WTH" ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to try going WAY back and installing Windows 7 x64 Pro . Fresh install , yada yada ....... 90-100 FPS in Final Fantasy XIV:ARR ..... and this is with EVERYTHING Maxed out . Stressing the card out as much as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I like Windows 8 . I don't love it , I don't hate it , I like it . I do hate that it apparently has been designed to be gamer UNFREINDLY .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now with Valve software porting games over to Linux boxes , and me being able to find what little office software I need in open source , I am begging to question my brand loyalty .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have owned copies of Windows 95 , Windows 98 , Windows 98 SE , Windows ME , Windows 2000 , Windows XP , Windows Vista x64 AND X32 , Windows 7 , and now Windows 8 .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does Microsoft have an anti gamer campaign going on ? Are you WANTING to drive computer gamers away from the PC platform ?</p>

 using and it was the right card (7520s have two GPUs: an onboard Intel and a discrete Radeon).&nbsp; Others are having the same problem with different machines.&nbsp; It's not the driver.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally found advice online to run the program in compatibility mode for Windows 8 or 7.&nbsp; Tried this and... Yes!&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp; Sort of.&nbsp; The FPS improves tremendously, but the program will only run in&nbsp;windowed mode, so there's a big
 blue banner all the way around my game.&nbsp; No full screen in either 8 or 7 compatibility mode.&nbsp; So my conclusion, since the program&nbsp;runs fine (almost)&nbsp;in compatibility mode,&nbsp;is that this is indeed Microsoft's bug.&nbsp; I really don't want to roll back.&nbsp; I'm not
 thrilled with 8, but 8.1 is better and I've gotten used to the interface now.&nbsp; I see all the stuff Jessen P suggests.&nbsp; Unfortunately it's all red herrings or dead ends for this problem.&nbsp; What we need is a patch to 8.1.&nbsp; When is the patch due out?</span></p>

 update. Surely the great Windows 10 Pro should have been able to detect this.</span></p>

            Windows will install drivers if they are newer or a higher version of the one you have, or if the manufacturer (the company that built it) includes it in their updates.&nbsp; What makes you decide that the old/outdated/lower version you have is better?&nbsp; Is
 yours newer or higher-number versioned?

    <title>Colorful Static Screen After Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> natalia brown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Colorful Static Screen After Update</h2>
                    Hello. I have recently just installed the newest update for Windows 10. However, there is an issue I find to be very annoying. Every time I open my computer, and it is not asleep, instead of the lockscreen (Windows Spotlight or otherwise) there is a bright,
 colorful static screen that flickers when I move my cursor (Which is a static, distorted&nbsp; square). I can move my mouse, click things, type, etc, but the screen is just static. I have to restart my computer manually every time. The other previous updates didn't
 have this problem. Is there a way to fix it? Thanks!

<p>I suspect you would be prompted which one to Install if you do a custom Install.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>It looks like printer is not working for few apps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
1. Do you get any error message? <br />
2. What is the complete/exact error message? <br />
3. When you say ‘e-mail’, do you refer mail app? If yes, is this issue confined to mail and reader app?<br />
4. Was it working before? Are you aware of making any changes to the computer prior to the issue?

<h2>            No option to create DVD on &#34;Create Recovery Disk&#34;</h2>
                    I am trying to create a "Recovery Disk" for my new Windows 8 installation (no installation media available).&nbsp; When I launch the "Create Recovery Disk" function, it only gives me the possibility of creating a "USB drive", but there is no option to create
 instead a recovery disk on a DVD, as you could do on Windows 7 (there was a hyperlink on the drive selection window dialog to click when you wanted to create the Recovery Disk on a DVD drive).&nbsp; Why am I not seeing that option with Windows 8?<br />

            The computer is a Dell XPS 420.&nbsp; It does have a DVD R/W.&nbsp; As I explained, though, the "Create Recovery Disk" function only appears to "see" the hard disks (I haven´t inserted a USB drive, because that´s not an option I want to use), and I have tried with
 and without a DVD disk inserted in the DVD drive, but it doesn´t show up either way, nor there is a link on the Create Disk dialog to "Create DVD", as there was on Windows 7.<br />
