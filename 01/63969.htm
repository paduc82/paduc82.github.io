<p>I'm pretty sure you can't use a web cam on the xbox one, only Kinect if you're broadcasting via the xbox one. I'm pretty sure if you have an Elgato or something you might be able to use a web cam with that, I'm not sure how that works though.</p>

<p>^^ &nbsp;Yea, Elgato has a simple button while broadcasting that will allow you to use your webcam. &nbsp;Your laptop (or labtop) needs to be pretty beefy though. &nbsp;I have an i7 with 16 GB or RAM... might be slight overkill, but ya never know.</p>

<p>Don't be cheap, get a Kinect. People may moan about paying the extra $100, but I'm happy with the investment and fun the Xbox 1's Kinect can do, make clips, voice commands, voice chat, console video chat, scan QR codes instead of entering redeem codes, gesturing,
 and play certain games with Kinect features. Kinect is truly a next gen device, better than using your webcam. I also have a Hauppauge HD PVR2 which I use to make Xbox 360 and Xbox 1 Youtube videos. I pretty much don't use Twitch except for when browsing the
 Dashboard and Store and there's some videos others have made when I look up games.

    <title>Windows &#39;Blue&#39; Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oh my goodness  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows &#39;Blue&#39; Update</h2>
                    <p>Sorry Microsoft,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've viewed the Windows 8 leaked update 'Blue'... Why are you spending money doing this incredibly poor update? (as well as your useless advertising for Windows 8)? The Blue update is&nbsp;completely worthless as long as you maintain METRO as the front end of
 Windows. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why&nbsp;is there no-one at Microsoft realising this fact? Windows&nbsp;8 is an UTTER&nbsp;failure. (way worse than VISTA)&nbsp;Your tablets are sub-standard. (Both RT and PRO) and failing to sell at any appreciable rate. (The public perception of Microsoft is at an all time
 low after the launch of Windows 8 and the sacking of Sinofsky. I agreed&nbsp;with you that the idiot had to go, but it was an admission that you'd mucked&nbsp;it all up. (And that has been proven to be the case.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Windows store apps are unbelievably poor. The BBC&nbsp;(for goodness sake) asking to remove the&nbsp;ONLY app that gets their information (Because even the BBC sees&nbsp;Windows 8&nbsp;as a&nbsp;failure&nbsp;(not worth developing for) and below their standards!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why isn't there someone at Microsoft with enough balls to admit that Windows 8 is a complete and utter disaster? You spend millions on dreadful advertising, promoting Windows 8, developing ridiculous extensions to a pathetic, front end. (I'm supposed to
 be impressed that I can reduce the size of a tile?, something I NEVER WANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE?!!!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, the only people I've witnessed looking at a Windows 8&nbsp;PC are pensioners, looking to upgrade their computers, totally bemused by the new operating system (they are given unbelievable **** by the inexperienced sales staff that have no clue either.
 I really need to get on to trading standards about the poor quality advice the morons in these shops give... (Driven by the quality(?) Microsoft training - no doubt!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone with an ounce of knowledge of computing&nbsp;would condemn Windows 8.&nbsp; Truly dreadful...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may kid yourselves that Windows 'Blue' will solve all your problems, but I'm sorry, no, you won't. It's a worthless endeavour... The leaked video only enhances my hatred of this grotesque operating system&nbsp;you have created. It isn't even worthy of that
 name. It should be non-operating system..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as you provide the sub-standard user interface and (lets be honest... pathetic app store (the number of apps does NOT equate to QUALITY))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you're looking forward to oblivion...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think you understand exactly what the Blue update is all about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This update contains the most requested features and existing feature updates, with a few bug fixes mixed in. This is all based on customer feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what Microsoft refers to as the New Normal. Usually feature updates and new features were not implemented until the next full version of Windows was released on a 3 year release cycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Regards</p>

            <p>Here's what worked for me and probably what you need to do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open an elevated command prompt (press windows key, type cmd right click the application and run as administrator)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each of these commands will take some time, but feel free to use your system as normal while they are running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>run the command sfc/ scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>regardless of what corruption is detected/ undetected, fixed/ not fixed--&nbsp;make sure youre connected to the internet and&nbsp;immediately run the following commands one after the other:</p>
<p>
</p><pre><p>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth</p><p /></pre>
<pre><p>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth</p><p /></pre>
<p>You may retest the original issue at this point but I recommend moving straight to the final step; insert your windows installation media. Don't run anything from the media, but make sure it is&nbsp;accessible&nbsp;and run the online image repair command replacing
 everything after 'Source:' with the location of your media. If you're using a&nbsp;disk, for&nbsp;example, and the&nbsp;drive is labeled 'D:' then replace 'C: \test' etc. with 'D:' and run the command:</p>
<p>
</p><pre><p>Dism /Image:C:\offline /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:c:\test\mount\windows</p><p /></pre>
<p>If you're using a disk in drive D: the command will look like this:</p>
<p>Dism /Image:C:\offline /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:D:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After repairing your image, run the automatic troubleshooter for windows update again and check for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing these steps I was able to install all updates including the ones which failed previously. I really hope this helps and sincerely apologize if it does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a software engineer, IT professional, tech support specialist or a Microsoft employee, but this is what worked for me after a lot of troubleshooting.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To run checkdsk /f /r only on drive G, you may use the following command:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Chkdsk g: /f /r</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>Important: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more information on chkdsk, refer to the Microsoft article below:</span></p>

<h2>            On Screen Keyboard on multiple monitors</h2>
                    <p>How can you lock the on screen keyboard to the main display? for instance on a surface tablet i want to use it to type when i have multiple monitors plugged in. At the moment it moves to each display where i need to type but i just want the keyboard to remain
 on the surface display</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>My initial thoughts were that this would not be possible with the setting with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because it is a use case I have not encountered before I thought it wise to challange my position and go have a search around Google and see if was true.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out you might be able to do what you want , but only using a 3rd party software tool. I'll include the link below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea if this will work or not, but the software is free (limited) or $30 or so for the full set of tools on offer. I don't know if you can get where you want to be on the free version or not.</p>

            <p>Hello Mehran,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you made any changes to your computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try following article and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Services fail to start and you receive an Error 1079 on a computer that is running Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows 2008 R2 or Windows 7<br />

<h2>            Software protection service won&#39;t start up</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently tried to update my Windows 8 laptop to 8.1. After some failed attempts and further searching I found that my version of Windows does not have the update available. &nbsp;The problem is in my many attempts I changed my Windows account type from local
 to microsoft account online. After that my software protection service won't startup and when I go into my services to start it up manually I get the error 1053. &nbsp;</div>
<div>Is there anyway to fix it without reinstalling windows?</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<p>As to what it thought fixed, as of the same date, the only thing I can immediately identify is some files (not logs) written to Catroot2.</p>
<p>Without running Procmon again, I can't yet confirm if does the same thing over and over.</p>

<p>If it fixed anything, then I imagine it wouldn't come up with same result when run three times in quick succession.</p>

<p>To fix &nbsp;update installation, that is.</p>

my last reply to Mark Stockdale</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know if the Answer in that thread is still valid, so we may be pursuing a red herring in that respect.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, now that I have re-read the first page I imagine not.&nbsp; It really was a one-time information thing.&nbsp;
 The first poster who indicated that they had a different issue with the same symptom should have been when the thread was locked with the suggestion to any other such users to start their own thread with their own details.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want help with your No Start Menu symptom specifically I think it may be worthwhile starting a parallel thread where we try my workarounds and do some diagnosis specifically about that.&nbsp; For example, you could start with my Narrator method.&nbsp; As I
 said that is what worked for me (and others I suggested it to) during the preview.&nbsp; In that case I speculated that there was a problem with getting the XAML unpacked and re-cached as the user's Tiles but I have seen no comment from anyone about what the real
 facts were.&nbsp; I just know that the Narrator method is what I tried and it worked.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This looks much better than I remember from earlier tests.&nbsp;&nbsp; Publisher details show I used
</p>
<p>Windows Update Diagnostics 9.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>The method I used to assess how it was done was to filter in ProcMon with</p>
<p>Category Is Write</p>
<p>and then summarize Command line counts.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Doing that things look OK I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oops.&nbsp; No, it's still the same goofy list of regsvr32 commands that it has always been.&nbsp; Now even more obsolete than ever.&nbsp; To see this use&nbsp; Operation Is Process Exit and look at the Detail field.&nbsp; Whenever the Exit Status is nonzero that is a sign of unthinking
 reuse of obsolete ideas, some which once were valid and some which were never valid.&nbsp; Same old.&nbsp; Same old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if the fact that the script cannot finish cleanly because of these errors contributes to our symptom.&nbsp;&nbsp; OTOH it looks as if the troubleshooter just forces this procedure on us without knowing whether it is really necessary, so that could account
 for that part of the symptom anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW I did not have any updates which needed to be applied.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks like we both had the same result so I think that this whole idea is a red herring.</p>

<p>It would have to be a real email address. You are able to create a new email account specifically for the xbox by going to
<a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.live.com</a>. This will kill two birds with one stone per say. Will give you both a live id and a new email account. :)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to clarify if you have granted permission to use your microphone in Skype. To check if the permission for using the Microphone is granted to the Skype app, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1) Select System Preferences from the Apple menu.<br />
<br />
2) Click the icon labeled Security &amp; Privacy.<br />
<br />
3) Click the Privacy tab at the top.<br />
<br />
4) In the left hand column, click on either Camera or Microphone to manage app permissions.<br />
<br />
5) Tick the boxes next to apps for which you’d like to grant access to the mic or cam.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also suggest to test it out if this is happening on Skype for Web through this link:
<a href="https://web.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know the updates. </p>

<h2>            Live Mail &#34;message cannot be foud&#34;</h2>
                    Im using Windows Live Mail on Windows 10. Pop account I think. After a day or two of being in my inbox, my emails give me a "Message can't be found" message. I cannot delete emails if there are more than one in a cluster and have to delete each one singularly.
 Then the next day when I turn on my computer these deleted mails return and I have to delete them all over again. Im really getting tired of this

            You know, cluster. As in a grouping of more than ONE? When you have groups of multiple messages with the same heading they get put into a cluster with one being the op and the name the cluster has been put under. You click the top one and the entire cluster
 gets selected. Windows doesn't list messages with the same title individually, they get put into little clusters.&nbsp; Every mail program ever made does this.&nbsp;

<p>Try a different Mouse and a different USB Port.</p>
<p>Try the Win 7 Troubleshooting which resides in the control panel.</p>
<p>code 52 generally relates to a Driver Error or a bad digital signature / outdated signature for the driver.</p>

<p><span>Hi reh56,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></p>
<p><span>If you have a DVD drive and a compatible DVD decoder installed on your computer, you can use
<span>Windows</span> Media Player to play a DVD-Video disc.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Open the
</span></span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span><span>
 Media Player DVD troubleshooter by clicking the </span></span><strong><span>Start</span></strong><span><span>
 button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type </span></span><strong><span>troubleshooter</span></strong><span><span>,
 and then click </span></span><strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong><span><span>.
 Click </span></span><strong><span>View all</span></strong><span><span>, and then click
</span></span><span><strong><span>Windows</span></strong></span><span><strong><span>
 Media Player DVD</span></strong></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span>The Blu-ray Disc format is not supported in
<span>Windows</span> Media Player. To play a Blu-ray Disc, you need to use a non-Microsoft program that supports Blu-ray playback and a device capable of reading Blu-ray Discs.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Also make sure you have all the codecs installed for Windows Media Player.</span></p>

            Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I just built the a new pc last week and installed a LG Blu-ray Disc Rewritter WH08LS20.&nbsp; I know that Media Center wont play blu rays but since this drive is supposed to also play dvds, I thought DVDs would play correctly.&nbsp; Windows
 says the devise is working but then inicates an potenial issue with the driver which seems stange.&nbsp; I have latest drivers but LG does not even show this drive in their support sight.&nbsp; When I did the procedure you showed me above, it says I do not have a DVD
 devise.&nbsp; The drive I have plays DVDs on media center (sort of).&nbsp; The dobly sound and the center channel does not work.&nbsp; Center channel works fine playing back recored tv.&nbsp; The drive does not work on dvds at all when I try to use media player 12.&nbsp; I have a
 couple more days to try this before I need to get a RMA from New Egg and send it back.&nbsp; Any other ideas?

<p>First off, the original Xbox LIVE went down back in 2010 for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>Secondly, I am an original beta tester under another account which got hacked and shortly thereafter banned a few months or so back. Because of that, I created this account to keep playing.</p>
<p>Third and last, if I still had Re-Volt and the servers were up I'd definitely be up for it though!</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>There were many reason why the old Xbox Servers were shut down. 1 being that the only game that was played on it at that point was Halo II. 2: it cost money to keep those servers up, and since the last game for the original Xbox was released in like 2007,
 why spend money on something that isnt making money. 3. They put those resources spent n the old Live service into the NEW live service.</p>

<p>But how much money could those servers even cost? I mean you still see tunnel networks that offer access to them for free to this day. It's not as good though because you are connecting through system link. But even so. For many games, the only extra resourses
 that were really needed was for matchmaking lobbies which most games didnt even support and leaderboards which I can live without. Halo 2 did also gave a very strong community when the shutdown happened. It's also a game that could have continued to be even
 stronger if only they continued marketing it. Just think of the millions if people who have played Halo 3 and beyond but never got to enjoy Halo 2. For some reason though, console gaming suffers from a mentality similar to that of pop music. Only the latest
 and greatest are worth mentioning. Meanwhile, PC games see communities that last years. Also, you could take any one of good original games like Halo 2, Unreal Championship 2, Splinter Cell, etc, stick them on the marketplace as an XBLA title with dashboard
 advertising and they would see some decent success. While new versions might have achievements, is that what we should be dependent on when thinking about a good gaming experience?</p>

<p>The better thing to do would remake Halo 2, and rework the Multiplayer for the current Live service. It would most likely take less money in the long run than bringing up the old network again. I mean, just how many games would actually be played (besides
 Halo 2) if they brought the old network back up? Most likely not very many at all.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The Halo 2 community at the time the servers were brought down was the most played game on the network at the time. And i dont think it was more than a &nbsp;thousand at most at peak times. &nbsp;A dedicated community, just not numerous enough to warrant keeping the
 entire netwok up, just for one game that at that pint, was 5 or 6 years old.</p>

<p>Well perhaps you are right which means I would really hope they focus on some of these remakes next gen. Until Minecraft, no XBLA game was allowed to be above 2GB. One problem now though is while games can now be above 2GB, they cannot be priced lower than
 20.00.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>Through the years, I have seen a lot of people requesting things like Conker, Crimson Skies, Unreal and Mech Assault on the arcade. I however do not see people paying 20.00 a piece for these games. Some of those originals are timeless and I do believe that
 with the correct dashboard marketing and fair price, they could do well. Games like The Liandri Conflict and Splinter Cell - Chaos Theory could easily rival many of the current generation games if only their components had 360 support. UC2 was outperforming
 many 2005 PC games even and SC-CT was put together better than its PC counterpart even because both of these console games were built from the ground up for the original hardware.
</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>Now the biggest thing I think had to do with the lack of BC success was that once you entered the game, you couldn't access any of the features of the 360 network. Once you load a last gen game, its pretty much like you are only playing on tge original console.
 Something that shouldn't be nearly a problem next gen for compatible 360 games just as long as the next gen Xbox Live build still supports them.</p>

<p>We all have nice memories about old times when we played games. People wanna have this feeling back that they got from Halo 2 but even when there will be a Halo 2 Anniversary, it won´t feel like the old days. People don´t realize that.</p>
<p>You can wish all that back, it will never be like before. People will play Halo 2 Anniversary. They will buy it but it will die like the Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary server. They all went back to Reach. people will move to Halo 4 and Halo 5.</p>
<p>That´s what comes into my mind when I hear about "it was so much better/more fun before" remind me on grandparents talking or something, to be honest ;)</p>
<p>The community is here now, talk to all of them common. Not just the past. :)</p>

<p>Well perhaps you were a child just a few years ago but for most it us,it really wasn't that long ago. Keep in mind too that many PC games that are just as old, still have strong communities and even new gamers. What you are saying is a similar mentality
 as to how teenage girls listen to music. Only the latest Nicki Minaj and Justin Beiber song will do. This is timeless gaming here. Not boy bands or the latest fashion trend and people really need to stop looking at it that way. Funny though how when Battlefield
 3 released in 2011, the big promotion and part of the hype was based on PC maps that released over 6 years earlier. Even in movies. So much of what we are seeing now days are remakes of movies from when I was a kid.

<p>You don´t got what I say. No matter if it is 3 years or 10 years ago, it will never be the same like in to that time. We all have a game that we used to play while we had friends over and all that. But it can never be the same. That´s all I said. All your
 other examples, I will perfectly ignore.</p>
<p>I always see this post where people look for people from the past and this is cool. But I also see the same come up with example like "I was here from the beginning" and use that to look special in front of others. Some wanna abuse that or act arrogant.
 Good for you but why you keep forgetting that there are cool people from today too?&nbsp;</p>

<p>However I have one of the first Beta tester her at home. He don´t come around with weird music examples and all that.
</p>
<p>Sorry that I said what I think about old days. Didn´t know I am not allow just because I am not 50 or something..I will know for next time. Thank you.</p>
