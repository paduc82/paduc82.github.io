<br />
No, you can only have one install of Ultimate per license. You can buy an Anytime Upgrade to Ultimate for your computer.<br />

            <p>No, that copy of Windows 7 Ultimate is already licensed for another computer, you will need to purchase a Anytime Upgrade license for your Windows 7 Home Premium installation.
</p>
<p>First, make sure the edition of Windows 7 you are upgrading from is already activated (if its not you will run into complications and you might have start all over by doing a clean install). Click Start, type Anytime Upgrade, click the option to purchase
 a key. Wait while the Anytime Upgrade page is loaded, click the Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade to buy it.</p>
<p>Click Next, fill out your contact information (it is important you do this, since the product key will be emailed to you as a backup just in case you need to reinstall it) enter your credit card information, click Next to begin the upgrade, wait while the
 key is verified, accept the license agreement, click upgrade, wait while the software upgrades, (it might take 10 minutes or more depending on if updates are needed), your computer will automatically restart, after restarting, Windows 7 will notify you its
 updating the computer, the computer will restart one more time automatically and the upgrade will be completed, a windows will pop up notifying the upgrade was successful and your computer is ready to use, click close, you should be upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate
 your files, programs and settings preserved, proceed to activate Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>

<h3> krishodder  say:</h3>
<h2>            LifeCam VX-2000 installing error. Help&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Installed Microsoft LifeCam VX-2000 on my emachines laptop and it worked fine the first night, used it for maybe five minutes and that was it. Came home from work and it was missing from my desktop/start menu. Okay, so I installed it again.<br />
<br />
It has not worked since.<br />
I can't find any viruses.<br />
I have used software to remove the lifecam completely and any leftover files before restarting my computer and retrying the software but to no luck.<br />
<br />
I get this error:<br />
<strong>"LifeCam.exe has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available."<br />
</strong><br />
<em>Sometimes</em> followed by this error message:<br />
<strong>"The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000006). Click OK to terminate the application."<br />
<br />
</strong>It gives me troubleshooting information but nothing seems to help. I haven't bothered with the advanced material because I am not 100% sure as to what I am doing and don't want to ruin anything else.<br />
<br />
Can someone, anyone, tell me what I am doing wrong here?</p>

<p>Hello and thank you in advance for hopfully an answer to this most (what would appear to be simple problem. The &nbsp;Cursor size has been changed to being massive , by a computer technician. To the extent of not being able to see where the exact place&nbsp; the cursor
 is. I have scrolled through the forum to no avail. Someone else has posted the same question but no&nbsp;correct answer. On my own I have tried the windows help but only gives information on how to change the ms-dos cursor, this is not the problem. It is the cursor
 when typing anywhere anytime eg: Notepad or even windows explorer.This makes editing extremely difficult. &nbsp;Using Microsoft Windows XP, Home edition, version 2002 service pack 3. Thank you so very much</p>

    <title>After Win 10 Upgrade still showing Win 8.1 OS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don boomer  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Win 10 Upgrade still showing Win 8.1 OS</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Win 8.1 to Win 10 in mid August 2015. I received all updates for Win 10 until early November 2015, but did not, and have still not, received the Win 10 Version 1511 update. While trying to do some self analysis, I came across the following
 by going through these steps / links:</p>
<p>open CONTROL PANEL</p>
<p>click on SYSTEM</p>
<p>click ADVANCED SYSTEM SETTINGS</p>
<p>in the ADVANCED tab, under STARTUP AND RECOVERY, click SETTINGS</p>
<p>look under SYSTEM STARTUP\DEFAULY OPERATING SYSTEM</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is showing WINDOWS 8&nbsp;on this screen!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is so&nbsp;even though the SYSTEM screen when opened indicates the edition is Windows 10! And, there is no other option to select at this screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously not correct. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This appears to be why I am not receiving the Windows 10 Version 1511 upgrade. How do I change / correct the DEFAULT OPERATING SYSTEM at the screen location described above?</p>

2. How did you install windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to go to System configuration by <br />
a. Press windows + R.<br />
b. Type Msconfig.<br />
c. In the boot tab and check if windows 10 is set as default OS and also check if you have windows 8 OS entry as well.

            <p>Thank you for the response. I will answer your queries, but as you will see from my answers I will require more specific assistance from you.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I had a Windows 8.1 PC for several years. In June or July 2015 I received the GET WIN 10 icon on my PC. Around mid August 2015 I clicked on Get Win 10, and from there the download and install happened "automatically" for the upgrade to Win 10.</li><li>Using your steps I opened the System configuration, and discovered the following:<br />
a) in the boot tab Windows 10 is NOT set as the default. In fact, it does not even appear at all<br />
b) Windows 8 is shown as both the default and OS. Once again Win 10 is not even shown as an option.</li></ol>
<p>Now that the system is clearly not showing Windows 10 whereas it does show under ALL SETTINGS\UPDATE&nbsp; and SYSTEM in the Control Panel, the question is simply how do I fix this problem?</p>

            <p>Dear Microsoft / SG. You offer a very basic process to check PC status, and then offer to receive more enquiries if the issue persists. I respond, seeking more assistance. Your response - NOTHING!</p>
<p>There is a very basic problem with the MS Update and Upgrade process, yet you do nothing to assist users nor even provide acknowledgement the problem exists. You offer no timeline when users might expect a fix to the obvious known problem. You continue to
 leave users the impression that is they, ie the individual user, do not know what they are doing or that they are the problem. The reality is MS is the problem. Good corporate governance in today's day and age should tell you it is best to get out in front
 of issues, not hide behind some corporate blog site that is obviously not monitored nor intended by MS to provide any real useful information. Really, really sad performance, MS.
</p>
<p>My real sincere offer of suggestion to MS, and I do mean to help not simply criticize - shut down this blog site if you are not going to use it to provide useful answers. Sincerely, Don.</p>
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; "<em>from admin to user account</em>" - No, you changed an Admin user account to a Standard user account.&nbsp; They are both types of user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; Only Admin user accounts can create new user accounts.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi jammerdog,</p>
<p>According to the Sony e-support website: <a href="http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-list.pl?mdl=DCRHC36&amp;SelectOS=42" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-list.pl?mdl=DCRHC36&amp;SelectOS=42</a>&nbsp;Windows Vista &amp; Windows 7 already have the correct drivers for your handycam. However, you can always click on the above link, select your operating system and download the drivers again.
 If you then open Device manager, select your handycam (you will probably find it under imaging devices in device manager)and right click on it. From the drop down menu select Properties. In the properties window select the drivers tab and check to see if the
 driver version you downloaded is 'higher' than the one already installed. If the version number is the same as the one showing in device manager then you do not need to update the driver. If the number is higher then right click on the handycam option again
 and, from the drop down menu, select 'update driver software'. Follow the wizard to install the new drivers. IMPORTANT: Ensure that you create a system restore point 'before' updating any drivers.</p>

    <title>Sys Image Issue with crypt32.dll and gm.dls - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sys Image Issue with crypt32.dll and gm.dls</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I'm have a windows 10 system image corruption issue from a month or so ago after system update. After running SFC and DISM it found a problem with crypt32.dll and gm.dls and could not repair them. I downloaded the iso for the version I am running and mounted
 it and then ran "Dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth /source:wim:E:\sources\install.wim:1 /limitaccess" and I keep getting this error "Error: 0x800f081f</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The source files could not be found.</p>
<p>Use the "Source" option to specify the location of the files that are required to restore the feature. For more information on specifying a source location, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=243077.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The gm.dls is the driver that is critical to me. I can physically see it in location at: Acer(C:)/Windows/SysWOW64 .</p>
<p>I suspect my registry is corrupted and don't have the skill set to go further. Meanwhile I can't use my expensive piece of music software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any suggestions.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I haven't been able to resolve my Windows problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me summarize, but first I would like to thank Janeane, Vega and Karla.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only problem I have with my Windows installation is with my Band In a Box application. It initially worked fine for several months and then I started getting the aforementioned Application error. The application partially works now, but it can't use
 the large library of Midi files. I've been working on this problem for over 2 months. Working with their Tech support on the application side and using my limited knowledge of Windows and info on the Web. It's clear to me I have a Windows problem as verified
 by the SFC tool. I am unable to fix it using the DISM tool I keep getting the error " Error: 0x800f081f &nbsp; &nbsp; The source files could not be found."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have a restore point before this problem started and I have not desire to reinstall image and reinstall all the applications with their licenses at this time. That's why DISM seems like the perfect solution. I ran DISM well over 10 times. I also
 check the drive for bad sectors and didn't find any. I really don't have the skill set to deal with the registry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically I'm finished. I bought this software to work on my musicianship. Hopefully there will be a future Windows update that deals with the area WINDOWS\SysWOW64\drivers and that will clean it up or I'll need to replace my new desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sincerely thank you for your time.</p>
<p><br />

<h3> twilo123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headset&#47;Mic Not Working</h2>
                    <p>recently my headset mic stopped working on xbox one.&nbsp; i have Astro a40 with m80 mixamp (similar to microsoft adapter).&nbsp; it works fine if i straight cable it to my iphone and make a phone call.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>i have original xbox one (500gb drive black box)</p>
<p>i have original xbox one controller (no 3.5mm headphone jack.&nbsp; just microsoft proprietary input)</p>
<p>the m80 mixamp does light up when plugged in.&nbsp; mute button lights up when i push it.&nbsp; audio level lighting works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have tried play with xbox settings audio options (uncompressed was on by default when it worked for the last 1+ year).&nbsp; nothing works.</p>
<p>i have tried another xbox controller and same issue</p>
<p>i never updated my old controller because i was afraid it would break the audio.&nbsp; it worked great for over a year.&nbsp; now that it is broken i went ahead and updated the controller.&nbsp; still doesn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>at this point it's either:</p>
<p>
</p><p>xbox one update</p>
<p>mixamp m80 broke</p>
<p>
</p><p>any suggestions on xbox one side?</p>

<p>Hello Twilo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>here is the support link you requested for <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/assign-controller-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
associating account with controller</a>. Also it could be an issue with the adapter like Ackis stated can you try a different adapter?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<h2>            Reduce size of favourites Bar - Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    <p>I have not used IE for years, but from my initial use of Edge, I am quite enjoying it, the only problem is, as I am working from a Laptop, I only have a fairly small screen, and I am used to having a favourites bar on my screen. Adding the favourites bar,
 below what is already there, really occupies a lot of the screens real estate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Icons seem excessively big especially when compared to competitors like chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to reduce the height of these bars, to bring them&nbsp;more in line with the likes of Chrome?</p>

            I concur. Its really disappointing. Also the url does not fit in with the tabs. IE was more professional and neater and compact. Also all your icons wont fit in across the page. Very disappointing.

<p><span><span>Thank you for that information.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please be advised that Android 4.4 is no longer supported by Skype. With that being said, what we highly suggest for you
 is to update your supported OS for you to be able to get the new Skype for Android.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Regarding the Skype Beta, we can’t guarantee that it will work properly since it is still beta. Beta, meaning still on process to improve
 services. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Should you have further questions, do not hesitate to contact us back.

<h2>            Someone keeps changing my DNS</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow my DNS keeps changing. I have my PC on a network and the dns is pointed to the server's IP.&nbsp; When starting ie I'm taken to a virus site telling me I need to call them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I correct the dns issue by deleting the factious entries that&nbsp;they have added and search the registry as well where I delete the entries associated with the bogus IP addresses.</p>

<p><span>82.163.143.176</span></p>

<p><span>82.163.142.178</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The problem goes away and everything runs perfect. However, the issue comes back occasionally. No one else on the network has this problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is there anyway to stop this permanently</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>MSE says the PC is virus free</span></p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can be related to the browser that you're using rather than your network. As an initial recommendation, you can reset your Internet Explorer browser to when it was first installed on your PC. This can be useful for troubleshooting problems that&nbsp;may
 be caused by settings changed after installation. Note that resetting Internet&nbsp;Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Close&nbsp;all&nbsp;Internet&nbsp;Explorer windows. Select the <strong>Tools </strong>button, and then select<strong> Internet options</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Advanced </strong>tab, and then select <strong>Reset</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Reset Internet&nbsp;Explorer Settings </strong>dialog box, select <strong>
Reset</strong>.</li><li>When Internet&nbsp;Explorer finishes applying default settings, select <strong>Close</strong>, and then select
<strong>OK</strong>. Restart your PC to apply changes.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need additional assistance, do let us know. We'll be glad to assist you further.</p>

    <title>Xbox Profile Disappeared - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> midgethunter93  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Profile Disappeared</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, A game I was in the middle of froze. So I turned off my xbox and and turned it back on and&nbsp;my&nbsp;profile was gone. I've searched the forums and I havent come across anything that says 'exactly' how you fix this. Ive tried to download my profile and thats
 when I got the 8007045D error code. So then I checked my storage for corrupt files but there was nothin there. It still had the same amount of 'GB free' from before it all went *** up but everything on the HD says 0KB. Then I tried clearing the cache but that
 did nothin and I used some code to delete all the updates and re-downlodaded them and still nothin. I tried usin a USB but it wouldnt let me configure it so im all out of ideas. I just want&nbsp;a definitive answer as to what i can/should do to get my profile back.
 Thanks in advance...</p>

 to the new one knowin that the current one is corrupted? Also before I commit to buyin a new HD is there anythin else i can try to fix the current one? Thnx for the help.</p>

<p><strong>Delete profile from your console</strong></p>
<p>1) go to <a href="http://www.xbox.com/accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/accounts</a> &nbsp;&amp; click on Sign in at upper right - if you can't sign in then ** STOP: DON'T ** delete your profile. Please call Xbox Support
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/XBLnumbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/XBLnumbers</a> Option 2 for help with your account. If you can sign in, delete &amp; redownload your profile on your Xbox this way:</p>
<p>2) Go to Settings - pick System - choose Storage - pick All Devices - choose Gamer Profiles</p>
<p>3) pick the gamertag choose Delete, and pick Delete Profile Only.</p>
<p>This deletes the profile but leaves saved games and achievements. Now, re-download your profile.</p>
<p><strong>Re-download</strong></p>
<p>1) Tap the silver Xbox Guide button</p>
<p>2) Select Download Profile (and if you don't see it, press the blue X button to make sure you're not signed in) and proceed with Profile Download.</p>
<p>3) Enter the Microsoft Account addresse for your Xbox LIVE gamertag when asked.</p>
<p>4) Enter the password for the Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>4A) If your account is an Xbox LIVE child account, the parent’s Windows Live ID &amp; password is required as well to download your profile.</p>
<p>5) Pick the storage device for your profile (choose Hard Drive if you have one, or Memory Unit if you don't have a Hard Drive).</p>
<p>6) When the download completes you will be asked if you want the console to remember your password. If it's your home console, I'd say yes, otherwise I'd think carefully about leaving my profile unprotected on somebody else's Xbox!</p>
<p>7) Sign in, and retry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the redownload fails, then use a USB Flash Drive formatted as a Memory Unit as per
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/usb-flash-drive</a>&nbsp;and then download the profile to the USB Flash Drive instead. You can also move your offline game saves and any
 other profiles to the Memory Unit instead of using a special cable.</p>

<p>Firstly this exact thing has just happened to my sons xbox as it crashed while it was doing a game update for BOPS2. &nbsp;Secondly that answer does not apply because</p>
<p>1. Profiles are shown to be 0kb which means it can't read them</p>
<p>2. You can redownload due to the 8007045D error.</p>
<p>So before I format the thing are there any fixes?</p>

</p><p>I would like you inform you that Windows Defender gets automatically disabled when any third party anti virus is installed in the computer. I suggest you&nbsp;to uninstall all the antivirus software installed and check if the Defender gets enabled.

            <p>Folks all speculation about Windows 9 is exactly that, pure speculation.<br />
<br />
IF&nbsp;and WHEN Microsoft releases a Windows 9 there "may" be a public preview. However unless</p>
<p>Microsoft changes their currently existing policy the age of the beta's are gone.<br />
<br />
</p>
Hope this helps.

<strong>Be still my beating heart</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>Microsoft’s</strong><span>&nbsp;next
 version of the Windows operating system might be shown off at a press event for 30th September.</span></p>
<div>
<p>
Windows 9, currently codenamed “Threshold,”might not be called “Windows 9” and will add a number of new features and UI changes.&nbsp;Microsoft’s Cortana personal assistant will be included, the Charms bar will be gone and a new miniature Start Menu is set to be
 debuted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
A preview version of Threshold is expected to be <strong>made available to developers as early as October of this year</strong> which works with a potential late September announcement.</p>
<p>
Microsoft really does need to pull its finger out and get rid of the cursed Windows 8. For those who have never used Windows 8, it is an operating system which dumbs down your computer so that it behaves like a tablet. (<strong> I have a dumb computer and sort
 of llike it that way. I can add all the SMART stuff I want anyway.</strong>&nbsp;ED. PP PS - I like start page tiles...}</p>
<p>
It might have had a good underlying operating system, but to the practical user it made Vista look good and gave no reasons as to why anyone would upgrade from Windows 7.</p>

    <title>Distorted Graphics in Solitaire and Mahjong - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffrysimmons  say:</h3>
<h2>            Distorted Graphics in Solitaire and Mahjong</h2>
                    
<p>Microsoft Solitaire Collection and Microsoft Mahjong installed on a Windows 8 PC. Both apps working flawlessly since last year, but as of yesterday I noticed graphics issues. When the apps are first launched, everything appears to be normal. But when I actually
 attempt to play any of the games, the cards and background appear distorted in the Solitaire Collection; and the backgrounds behind the tiles are distorted in Mahjong. I hadn't &nbsp;used either game collection for about a week (there were no issues then), but
 I did notice that they were both updated during that time. &nbsp;Both apps are now version 1.7.0.30918&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things I've tried to fix this that haven't worked:</p>
<p>1. Uninstalling and reinstalling the apps.</p>
<p>2. Running the apps troubleshooter: results state display driver might be out of date. I have a ATI x1650 graphics card and the display drivers installed are the latest available. Plus I've never had this issue with the apps in the past using the same driver
 and hardware.</p>
<p>3. Checking system event logs for error messages related to the apps - no errors noted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since this is a recent issue, I'm thinking that the updated apps are not interacting with my system in the same way as the old ones and that there is nothing wrong with my hardware. To test this I'd like to try uninstalling the current versions of the apps
 and installing older versions. How can I do this? Any other suggestions on ways I could troubleshoot or dig for more information (in specific system logs, for example ...) would also be appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Dead Rising 3 boots me to Dashboard</h2>
                    Got my Xbox One last night and played Dead Rising 3 til around 4am, it worked fine. The following afternoon I went to play Dead Rising 3 when I was continuously getting booted back to the dashboard after around 2-3 minutes. What was strange was I was able
 to play the game perfectly fine OFFLINE. After 4 hours of playing offline I tried to play online again and was still experiencing the same problem as before. I don't know what gives, but this is *** after I spent almost $600.

<p>I too have had this problem. The problem only occurred for me once I reached the garage shortly after the diner. I play after the cutscene where they explain the chips with GPS that are implanted in the Zombies, a few minutes afterwards, game boots me to
 dashboard... I won't say I dislike my investment of an xbox and two games.. with 12mo's of live.. But I'd like to get some use out of this shiny brick. &nbsp; &nbsp;-Thanks</p>

<p>G'day all! Let's try a few basics to get those games running. First, shut down the console by pressing its power button for several seconds. Then start it up again.</p>
<p>If your games continue to misbehave, try cycling your network hardware. Unplug modem, router, and console for 2 solid minutes, then restart each one at a time.

<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10 and now I find that I cannot open certain e-mails in Outlook&nbsp;2010.&nbsp; Some work okay while others give me the rror message that Outlook has stopped working and will shut down.&nbsp; I&nbsp;even tried clicking on the email to forward
 to another account, but the same message still appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I poked around the internet for solutions but have been unable to find one that works.&nbsp; I tried sfc/scannow, but it showed no&nbsp;errors and thus nothing got fixed.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. Unfortunately the issue remains unresolved. i must be clear about 2 things. First, Outlook 2010 was working fine before I upgraded to Windows10. Second, I can open Outlook, my emails show up in my inbox, and I can open certain
 ones. The problem comes when I try to open others, and that is when I get the error message that Outlook has stopped working and will shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my dilemma. i hope this helps.</p>

<p>Alright, in an attempt to end all these constant threads about the salaverry, <br />
let's make it simple enough.<br />
<br />
The salaverry position is a ground position <br />
where you're basically making an inverted crucifix and lock one arm inbetween <br />
your legs and the other arm you're holding onto - leaving one of your arms free <br />
to pound the pinned man's head, mostly either using hooks or elbows. The only <br />
thing your opponent can do is to try to transition free - and if you reverse <br />
that transition you end up in the postured full mount. Which is why this <br />
position is so very scary and powerful.<br />
<br />
It's performed by being in the <br />
side control and holding <br />
<br />
<span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><b>L1 + Minor <br />
Transition</b></span></span> on the PS3.<br />
<span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><b>LB + <br />
Minor Transition</b></span></span> on the Xbox.<br />
<br />
<br />
In Career Mode, it's <br />
called <b>Transition to Salaverry Top</b> and can be learned at:<br />

<p>I just did it with jon jones in the demo no problem.</p>
<p>gain side control then hold LB,straight down on the right stick and turn counter clockwise.</p>
<p>you can also go from mounted position into the crucifix by just using the transition but not holding the LB button.</p>

<p>@PhDPeddler - You have to have your opponents back and be in side control. Then you just hold down LB and do a minor transition to put them in the crucifix. Hope that helps</p>

<p>You don't need to learn any move for transitioning into the crucifix. I went to camp to learn how to throw elbows from the crucifix and that's all. As long as you have BACK side control, the LB+Minor Transition should do it.</p>

            Hi <strong>JS72,<br />
</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Thanks for posting on Microsoft Answers!</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><br />
1. Customizing System Restore settings:</strong><br />
<strong>Cleaning restore points:<br />
</strong>•&nbsp;Under Windows Seven, it is now possible to clean directly all restore points, without disabling the protection system.
<br />
•&nbsp;In Control Panel (Control Panel), and then System Security (System and Security), click System (System).
<br />
•&nbsp;In the left pane, click System Protection (Protection System). <br />
•&nbsp;After ascertaining that the protection system on the C drive is activated (On), click on Setup (Configure)<br />
Delete all restore points: <br />
•&nbsp;Under the heading Disk Space used (Disk Space Usage), click Delete (Delete), then click Apply (Apply).<br />
•&nbsp;All restore points are deleted.<br />
<br />
<strong>Remove restore points except the most recent:</strong><br />
•&nbsp;It is always possible,&nbsp;to keep the last restore point created: <br />
•&nbsp;In Computer (Computer), right-click on C, then Properties (properties), click Disk Cleanup (Disk Cleanup), then clean the system files (Clean up system files)<br />
•&nbsp;which shows the More Options tab (More Options)<br />
•&nbsp;By clicking on Clean (Clean up) under System Restore and Shadow (System Restore and Shadow Copies), restore points will be removed, except the most recent.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>In Windows 7, you can configure the type system restore desired. <br />
</strong>•&nbsp;In the configuration of the Protection System Settings heading restoration offers 3 options:<br />
•&nbsp;Restore system and earlier versions of files (Restore system settings and previous versions of files)
<br />
•&nbsp;Only restore earlier versions of files (Only restore previous versions of files)
<br />
•&nbsp;<strong>Disable Protection System (Turn off system protection)<br />
</strong><br />

&nbsp;<br />
<strong>2.</strong> <strong>To delete files using Disk Cleanup</strong><br />
If you believe that the Disk Space is still high then I would recommend you to use the Disk Clean up.<br />
The following procedure cleans up files associated with your user account. You can also use Disk Cleanup to clean up all the files on your computer.<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Disk Cleanup by clicking the&nbsp;Start button. In the search box, type Disk Cleanup, and then, in the list of results, click Disk Cleanup.
<br />
2.&nbsp;In the Drives list, click the hard disk drive that you want to clean up, and then click OK.<br />
3.&nbsp;In the Disk Cleanup dialog box, on the Disk Cleanup tab, select the check boxes for the file types that you want to delete, and then click OK.<br />
4.&nbsp;In the message that appears, click Delete files.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For additional help refer to the articles below:<br />

<span><br />
Hope it helps.<br />

    <title>Windows Firewall on windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrick j foley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Firewall on windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I recently returned my windows 8 laptop to factory setting to solve a problem with the Windows Lumia phone drivers, which it solved.</p>
<p>I re installed my Norton security program, which is working fine. my problem is that after installing some windows updates, the Action Center warns me that the
<strong>"Windows Defender"&nbsp;</strong> &amp; <strong>"Windows Firewall"</strong> are switched Off. I was able to re activate the Defender OK, but I am unable to switch on the Firewall, When I go into - Control Panel - Windows Firewall to try to do so a yellow banner
 advises that&nbsp;</p>
<p>"These settings are being managed by vendor application Norton Security" and I can't do anything to get rid of the Action Center warning.
</p>
<p>Can anyone please help.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to all .</p>
<p>Pat Foley.</p>
