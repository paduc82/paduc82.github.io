<p>You could try a USB drive, but I've never had luck with AMD type motherboards doing that. How about another IDE drive? Put the files on the IDE drive from the manufacturer's CD, if possible.</p>
<p>The RAID driver utilities seem to only like copying files to floppies. Let me know if you find anything else works.</p>

<p>I meant that the only RAID disks I've used have been on AMD/Asus motherboards. I have no experience with Intel RAID arrays.</p>
<p>Do you have an old IDE disk available to try?</p>
<p>Other than that I would say it looks like you'll need a floppy drive. You should be able to find someone who would give you one for the asking. I have at least two in my trash pile that work just fine.</p>

            thanks. I ended up purchasing a floppy disk drive. Now I have another problem loading the Intel Matrix Storage RAID drivers. I made the floppy disk containing the 64bit drivers, went through the windows xp installation, hit F6 to install the drivers, contacted
 Intel to find out which are the correct driver to use for the chip-set, setup&nbsp; loads the drivers and then I get the famous blue screen of death....0x0000007B error. Intel suggested updating the BIOS, I did that and still get the BSOD.

<p>Sounds like a driver issue. For whatever reason, Windows isn't reading the disk properly.</p>
<p>What RAID configuration do you have? Striped, Mirrored?</p>
<p>Did you get all the way through the installation, or did the BSOD error happen during the first restart?</p>
<p>If you got through the installation, you might try the Recovery Console. Look for information in the forums about using that to fix a system that won't boot. I've seen that happen a couple times with a new installation of Windows XP.</p>

<p>The "F6 Disk" that contains the drivers needs to have both INF's, CAT's, and the sysfile and txtsetup.oem, &nbsp;for all Intel chipset drive controllers.&nbsp; Iastor.inf and IaAHCI.inf - very important 2 have both.&nbsp; and your Intel chipsset drivers too...</p>

<p>Hello EsonB2,</p>
<p>Windows XP setup may be using the outdated drivers it has built in rather than taking and installing the drivers you are giving it via the F6/floppy route.</p>
<p>You may have to use a program like nLite to slipstream the latest drivers into a custom installation disc.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Family Features - impossible to give parental consent despite providing payment card details</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having set up 3 new Microsoft Accounts for my children when they log in on our desktop PC (using the latest version of Windows 10 Pro) they are being prompted with a Family Features popup window to "Sign in so you don't miss out" with the message "You need
 to sign back in to your Microsoft Account so you can send your parents requests when you want more screen time or need permission for certain apps or sites".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we've followed the prompts but been unable to complete the process successfully</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dialogue box says -&nbsp; "Please re-enter your password" - they re-enter it</p>
<p>Dialogue box says -&nbsp; Ask a parent to help with this part - I successfully sign in with my Microsoft Account credentials</p>
<p>Dialogue box says - Let your child use their Microsoft Account online? - I click Next</p>
<p>Dialogue box says - Let your child use their Microsoft Account online? - I click Next (leaving the "My Child can use third-party apps" checkbox checked or blank - makes no difference)</p>
<p>I am prompted for my payment card details - Microsoft already has my card details but if I enter the same details again I am looped back to the same page asking for the same details again. If I try a different card the same issue occurs - I am looped back
 to the card payment screen. I have no choice but to Cancel.</p>
<p>If I check I&nbsp; can see any new card I add has been added to my Microsoft account so the credentials were accepted but still I could not finish the consent process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time my child logs into their account they are prompted with the same Microsoft Family Features - "Sign in so you don't miss out" pop up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very annoying but I can't find a way to fix the issue and I can't find a support number that will allow me to raise a ticket or speak to someone. So I am hoping someone at Microsoft can investigate and/or advise me what to do to provide the consent
 I am trying to provide.&nbsp;</p>

            You do know that when setting up Family Safety, each child needs to be under 18 years, with a Microsoft Account setup and added under Start &gt; Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family &amp; other people, right?
<br />
<br />Please let me know you have gone through all the following steps:

<p>Hi Andre,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your links. Yes, I have followed all the steps and in my own "Family &amp; other people" section of Settings I can see all 3 childen's accounts. They are all referenced as "Child" and "Can sign in".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The issue is that when they do login with their Microsoft accounts they are prompted every time with the requests I referenced in my previous post. It accepts their attempt to then sign in, my own signing in but then prompts me with the payment card screen
 which refuses to accept anything I try (existing card or other cards) and just loops back or errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it may be a bit like the issue in this post...<br />
</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_family/child-account-keeps-asking-for-parent-permission/181355b1-6f34-4623-ae97-3aaf00f636ca</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I can't find a way to ask Microsoft to set up my choosing an existing card as that poster mentioned that solved it for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Hi Jonathon,
<br />
<br />Well, the solution seems to be you have recreate the account or try signing into your Adult account, then change your region settings to outside the US so you are not prompted.

</p><p>This is really helpful. Being UK based on reading your linked post I do seem to be experiencing exactly what the others have noted. I've checked my PC and all region/language settings are UK, I've checked my online MS account and that is also set up as UK
 also the same for all children (PC and online) all are showing UK.... but I'm stuck in an infinite loop of what now appears to be asking me for a

            I don't want to keep paying money to skype for a service that I do not use often. Is there an alternative service to Skype?

<p>
</p><p>As stated above noone can find my Gamertag on Xbox. If you try to look for my Gamertag you'll find none&nbsp;
</p>
<p>And I don't see the problem. I have everything set to public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a really big problem while trading items in games, I have to add everyone but they can't add me. Just if I send them messages they can add me and they see my Gamertag.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
To address your concern, provide the answers to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried unplugging the microphone then plugging it again? If yes, does the issue persists?<br />
</li><li>Have you tried using a different device and got the same result?<br />
</li></ul>
<p>In the meantime, make sure that your microphone drivers are up-to-date and is compatible with Windows 7.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

<p>I have linked the LAN to my WiFi, and I am able to get YOUTUBE, BLOOMBERG, PICASSO, but nothing else. Do I need to get an External Media Player, or would an External Hard Drive do, and if so could I still download music and movies on to the external hard

<p>If you're getting these problems, Windows 7 came preinstalled on the computer, and you haven't installed/updated any drivers yourself then the issues are probably caused by hardware. It is not uncommon for new hardware to fail; in fact if hardware is going
 to fail it will usually do so quite quickly or go for years. If this describes your situation, call the computer mftr.'s tech support. If you *have* updated/installed drivers - particularly for the network adapter - roll them back to the ones that came with
 the machine to test.</p>

<p>Set of test utilities for DIY computer builders:</p>
<p>Note: If you are OverClocking or use any automatic overclocking BIOS features, Intel EIST or Turbo Mode (Disable it),&nbsp;<br />
then drop back to the stock speed as a starting point.</p>
<p><strong>First try running Memtest86+,</strong> this runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or<br />
confirm if your one or more of your memory sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours, if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />

<p>The gdrv.sys file is related to Gigabit's "Dynamic Energy Saver Advanced" program, whatever that is. Got a Gigabit motherboard? Here's a KB article about the Stop Error:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/325672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/325672</a></p>
<p>Mr. Stuart gave you some awesome links but I'm wondering if this is all about drivers. Do me a favor - boot with a Linux distro on a live CD or USB key and see what happens. Run it for a while. If you do have a Gigabit board, you might also want to check
 out some hardware forums to see if there are known issues with Windows 7 and that particular board.</p>
<p>I like Knoppix best for testing because it already comes with so much on it but if you have Ubuntu lying around that will do the trick too.</p>

<p>Having built a number of Gigabyte system one consistant weak spot is the memory slots. Using the A slots are usually not a problem but if you populate both the A and B slots then you&nbsp;have a problem child on your hands as the SPD values are no longer correct
 and the GMCH voltage needs to be increased for starters. Gigabytes DESA is more commonly found on the newer core i7 and i5 boards.</p>
<p>That's why running Memtest85+ is a must.</p>

<p>It ironic that today I was just bringing a recently built PC online. Its a multi boot system with XP, Windows 7 and Vista. After installing XP I used Gigabyte's driver CD. Part of the list&nbsp;of drivers and software is the Dynamic Engery Saver utility. I choose
 not to install it, at least not for now.</p>
<p>For the record I used all of the test utilites and some of the analysis software mentioned above.</p>

<p>I've not run Memtest86+ yet - I am having some difficulty getting it copied to make a bootable disk.&nbsp; The read me file suggests imaging the disk as a burn option, but I am not able to find such an option.&nbsp; Is that the best way, make a disk, or can it be
 run from the hard drive?&nbsp; Interesting, I got a blue screen Memory_management message this a.m.</p>

<p>You're probably burning the disc as data and not as an image. No, it can't be run from the hard drive; you must boot from the CD but this is not hard. Here are instructions:</p>
<p>You can test the memory yourself. I like Memtest86+ from <a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.memtest.org</a> . Obviously, you have to get the program from a working machine. You will download the .iso to make a bootable cd. You want the pre-compiled bootable ISO (.zip). Unzip the file you download by double-clicking on it and drag the contents
 out. You will now have a file called memtest86+-4/00.iso (the version number may be different). You can delete the .zip file now. Put in a CD-R disc and start a third-party burning program such as Roxio, Nero, or the free<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ImgBurn</a>
 (unless you have Windows 7 which can burn .isos natively). You will need to burn the file as an image, not as data. Refer to your burning program's Help if you don't know how to do this.<br />
<br />
Leave the CD-R in your optical drive and restart your computer. When you restart the computer you will see messages:<br />
<br />
1. Possibly a message that says something like "Press F12 for temporary boot menu". If you have this message, press that function key. Use your arrow key to select the CD/DVD drive and the computer will boot from the Memtest86+ CD you made.<br />
<br />
2. If you don't see a message about a boot menu you will need to go into the BIOS to change the boot order. This message will say something like "Press F2 to enter Setup". Press that function key and you will enter the BIOS. Find the section about boot and
 change the boot order to CD/DVD drive first, hard drive second. Save your changes and exit Setup. The computer will boot from the Memtest86+ CD you made.<br />
<br />
The test will run immediately. You can remove the CD while the test is running. Then boot with the media you made (you may need to change the boot priority in your BIOS so that the optical drive is the first boot device). The test will run immediately. Let
 the test run for an hour or two - unless errors are seen immediately. If you get any errors, replace the RAM.</p>

<h2>            Surface Book - Whenever I move the hinge the keyboard, mouse and USB devices stop working</h2>
                    I have a Surface Book and every time I move the hinge, adjust the screen or move the device the keyboard, mouse and anything attached to the USB or Surface Dock will not work. Sometimes it will recover after a few seconds other times I need to detach and
 attach the dock. I have tried cleaning the contacts with alcohol and compressed air but it does not seem to help. It makes it really complicated to do any work with the Surface Book on your lap or if you need to move the screen. I have a lot of Skype for Business
 meetings and I use a Jabra USB speaker and if someone bumps the table we will miss whole conversations as S4B pauses the conference call. Any ideas on how to fix? I am running the latest OS updates.&nbsp;

<strong>two-button shutdown</strong>. To do this, press and hold the Volume-up button and the Power button on the your Surface at the same time for 15 seconds and then release both of them. The screen may flash the Surface logo, but remember to continue holding
 down the buttons for 15 seconds.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking in via email. I usually have to do a two button reset a couple of times a week whenever the keyboard does not come back or the PC will not restart from Sleep. It does not seem to help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not been able to go to the MSFT store yet. The closest one to me is over an hour away so I will have to take a half day vacation to go and have not been able to get the time yet. Does Best Buy count as a Microsoft Store?</p>

<h2>            Feedback about Feedback Hub - it doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I was trying to post some feedback (about Remote Desktop not working after installing Windows Creators Update).&nbsp; I want to report this issue to Microsoft as it is important.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I posted the issue to https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/windows-10-creators-update-and-remote-desktop/c0b192fc-e6ff-42bd-91d9-59a967ffaa9a&nbsp; but was asked to move it to another forum.&nbsp; I tried to do that but the community
 page did not work I kept getting "Oops something went wrong".&nbsp; Pulling my hair out I thought I'd try the Feedback Hub - that didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Why is there no easy way to provide feedback.&nbsp; Really why?&nbsp; Providing feedback should be easy one button and perhaps a single category selection.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Here's an idea: Make the feedback hub easy to use or a community site that does work:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>My experience with Feedback Hub:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially I couldn't sign in it wanted to change the way I log in to my whole system (I don't log in to Windows with Microsoft account)<br />
Then I need to change privacy settings before it can use - change some privacy setting to Enhanced?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; It does not explain to restart after making that change<br />
Now the Feedback hub app is stuck on login in - the animation icon has been displayed for 10 minutes to sign.&nbsp; I'm using a fresh out of the back Surface Book.&nbsp;&nbsp; So where should I post feedback about Feedback hub?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried again back in the community forums, only to discover now that my account has been blocked.&nbsp; Seriously?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;I had only tried to post a question and move it as instructed.&nbsp; I have now created a new account and returning to community.&nbsp; Hoping
 to get some joy here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feedback hub is still stuck and there is no apparent way to change the account used by Feedback Hub app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a real disaster - I've wasted an hour trying to help Microsoft out.&nbsp; Please someone from Microsoft get in touch and help me out.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>If you're using an Xbox 360, each account will need to have it's own gold membership.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>On the Xbox One, one person with a gold account can designate one Xbox One console as a home console so that all users on that console can utilize the gold services. For more on how to set that up, check out this page.

            <p>My GPU is NVidia 8800gtx 768MB onboard ram. THe card is very powerful and still quite capable of running many current games at decent resolutions, etc..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I checked the windows 8 compat. list and as I recall, it passed ok. I'd have to recheck to be sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>^ this seems to indicate that 'maybe' resetting IE10 settings may help. It seems the crashes don't happen during gaming, just during ordinary computer sessions where I have IE10 ( not metro UI side of windows 8 though ) running on windows 7 side. Maybe this
 is all I needed to do, we'll see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That website also showed me that my GPU should work fine under windows 8, although it clearly got no 'works fine' ratings, but whether&nbsp; or not that would have any impact on anything is another question; prob. not but who knows ? By comparison if you check
 the windows 7 tab a download is required, but not for windows 8; no idea about that, but that is a difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My 8800gtx IS a tad old, but I doubt ? its so old ( latest GPU's from NVidia are in the 6xx range I think) that it would cause any compatibility issues ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I think Im back to having no idea for sure, yet, why Im getting these display driver issues. I'll hope the IE10 settings I made in NV control panel do the trick to stop the TDR's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't feel that NVidia is giving me very good advice, therefore I came here for verification.</p>
<p>I was told by a&nbsp;someone there , to use windows 7 given I dont' recall having any crash issues there, but that 'might' just be because the problem started occurring after I upgraded to windows 8 which means it might just be a coincidence that the gpu started
 acting up after I upgraded; stranger things have happened ? ;)) I don't have such severe issues that I need to revert to windows 7, plus&nbsp; I purchased this windows 8 pro already, and I'd be throwing money away by giving up; no intention of doing that ( plus
 I like windows 8,though I kinda miss AERO ).</p>

            <p>Hi Lee</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reasons for the TDR failure are many and varied. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to the TDR component being added the system would simply&nbsp;suffer a general crash, eaxh time the GPU failed to respond in the set timeout period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a procedure that you can use to extend the TDR timeout. This will make the error less likely to occur.</p>

            <p>THanks for trying to help, but I really would rather have a direct solution, than trying to second guess this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was told winDBG would narrow down the error, but you are telling me that its simply not good enough to determine the faulty hardware/software ? If you aren't sure, maybe you could refer me to a different Microsoft rep that knows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, and while he admits he is NOT a direct employee of Nvidia ( though he claims they offered him a job there ), I was given&nbsp; this information, verifying as noted above by me, its only a 'workaround', and not a solution which I would rather have ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"&nbsp; There are some Windows registry keys to adjust the TDR timeout delays but they're really more of a workaround than a solution.<br />
<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I honestly do not recall having these issues in windows 7, or as I noted earlier, maybe ( its possible I guess) my GPU is going bad and did so around the time I switched from 7 to 8. Total guesswork, but at this juncture, and without a direct answer by Microsoft
 as to what precisely is causing the problems on y end,&nbsp; I have little choice but to guess it seems ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far , all Ive' done is reset ( as noted) IE with the hopes that will fix things, and if it does not, I will then try your suggestion, though honestly I'm not inclined to want to go that route given as noted by NVidia 'helper', its a definte workaround,
 not a solution.</p>

            <p>Ok thank you for clearing some of that up I appreciate it, and it is a great relief knowing that for win8 users such as myself ( though it obv. makes a lot of sense) there is no upgrade fee, thank you Microsoft ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really appreciate the verify on the likelihood my issue is that gpu can't keep up therefore its crashing. I wish I knew what feature of windows 8 is causing this &amp;/or its just that the GPU is defective, or going bad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyway to verify this, or is my best shot to just get a new card and see what happens ( a slightly better one)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One last thing. ,while playing very intensive games like say WoW or Diablo 3, I never get crashes. I don't think wow has ever crashed, maybe diablo 3 did once but that was about it, and I don't recall getting a driver error/restart.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You say windows 8 is more resource intensive, is that the metro side ? If so I don't really use that side much lately, honestly really never did, but its very nicely done just the same.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some things to check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Look at all of the programs that are set to start when the computer boots. Press the WinKey+X to display the System Menu and select Task Manager / Startup Tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look for programs that are not required that can be disabled. This includes programs that can be started manually when they are needed by the user. To disable a program, right click the program and select the Disable option. Some startup programs can use
 an inordinate amount of resources and these resources are not available to the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. </p>
<p><span>You might also want to ask on the Nvidia&nbsp;forums if any other users are experiencing the types of errors you are seeing on Windows 8 with that particular device.</span></p>

<h2>            Webcam access blocked</h2>
                    <p>I'm on an international training and really need full use of my webcam but something is suddenly blocking it and I can't find out what or why. I still have use of audio and my camera lights up to show that it is working but my Internet Security flags up
 the message "webcam access blocked" and I'm not being seen. I've looked into my Internet Security and checked all the relevant boxes that give permission but it hasn't solved anything. I'm not a geek. I would just like to have my camera functioning properly
 again. Any suggestion as to how I might be able to do that will be much appreciated.</p>

            Thank you Ramon for responding to my plea for help, I really appreciate it. The webcam was working perfectly before I consented to allow my Lenovo computer to run its own systems check. It was after that that the problem seemed to occur. The article you
 recommended didn't help because in following its procedures I simply got the&nbsp;"webcam access blocked" message again. However I have since had more luck getting in direct touch with my Internet Security provider and they have just guided me through a process
 which has solved the problem. Thank you again for responding.

    <title>How can I block Windows app data Usage&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martinistripes  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I block Windows app data Usage&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Recently I was on ship without access to the internet and decided to use roaming data to send and receive a few important emails using outlook. Vodafone charges me £3/MB and I expected my emailing to use 4 – 5 MB at the most (bearing in mind outlook doesn’t
 automatically download images and I get very little spam). Being a fairly tech savvy guy I disabled background data usage on my phone and app updates. Then I went into Windows, disabled windows update completely and changed my Microsoft account for an offline
 one convinced that would stop any metro apps from downloading content. I then disabled a few things in my taskbar from checking for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After feeling sure I was prepared, I turned on my roaming data and wifi hotspot, connected my laptop and opened outlook. Outlook downloaded approximately 10 emails, then I quickly wrote and sent two replies (text only). Within minutes my phone started receiving
 sms messages at a rate that became worrying. I checked the messages from Vodafone and to my horror I’d racked up over £100 of data usage. I disconnected and checked my phones usage. Sure enough it had all gone through the wifi hotspot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After checking the task manager I’m fairly sure the majority of it was used by the metro news app. It seems switching to an offline account doesn’t stop apps from connecting. So what’s the answer? Do I have to uninstall all metro apps to stop this happening
 again?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It’s also frustrating that when I’ve gone to use some of these apps offline, they’re totally useless. The news app has sometimes displayed nothing telling me there was no connection,
 when all I wanted to do was view previously downloaded stories. Same with Currency Converter Pro, I want to check the rates but it shows me nothing, instead of showing me the rates when I last had a connection.</span></p>

    <title>Marvell AVASTAR Bluetooth Radio Adapter keeps getting disabled after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karl z  say:</h3>
<h2>            Marvell AVASTAR Bluetooth Radio Adapter keeps getting disabled after extended sleep on Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>I looked at many of these posts, but my issue only occurs when my computer goes to sleep (perhaps hibernates? Not sure how Windows 8.1 works now). I did a
<a href="http://karlz.net/blog/index.php/2014/12/26/sleeping-bluetooth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Sleeping Bluetooth">
blot post here</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://karlz.net/blog/index.php/2014/12/26/sleeping-bluetooth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://karlz.net/blog/index.php/2014/12/26/sleeping-bluetooth/</a>) to outline exactly what is happening, but in a nutshell, 1) the computer is either put to sleep
 or goes to sleep for an extended period, 2) I wake it up usually by pressing the power button, 3) now Bluetooth is disabled, so my Bluetooth mouse won't work. I enable it (which causes my mouse to work immediately), restart Device Manager so that I can get
 the Power Management tab under properties for my Marvell AVASTAR Bluetooth Radio Adapter and don't allow my computer to turn off this device to save power, but at some random point in the future it will happen again. It doesn't happen every time.</p>
<p>I will keep an eye on how long the computer is asleep each time this happens. Today it was asleep for about 8 hours.</p>

    <title>Prevent Windows Updates and Virus Scans from slowing down computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vse-jlindquist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Prevent Windows Updates and Virus Scans from slowing down computer</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop that sees infrequent use. Sometimes it doesn't get used for a week or two at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, every time that we need to use it, it's a huge hassle because we can't get any work done. The computer immediately realizes that it hasn't scanend for updates or viruses in 2 weeks and then proceeds to use all of the computer resources to get
 it done. It makes everything else unbareably slow - and this is a computer intended for graphic design work (it has a 2ish-year old Intel i7, Nvidia GPU, and at least 8GB of RAM).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates/scans often take<em> forever</em>. There have been times where we just have to leave the computer plugged in on a counter for the entire day while it goes through update after update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to prevent this from happening? I never had these kinds of problems with updates on Windows XP / Windows 7, but the updates on Windows 10 just seem to take all the resources and prevent anything else from running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Spelling</p>

<p>I am using Windows Defender, and I have changed the active hours several times trying to find something that works. I need my computer to be available when I need it, and that isn't always the same time of the day. The scans seem to run whenever they are
 missed, which is often. The active hours are set for all the time except late night, and the computer is asleep during those hours.</p>

    <title>Blue screen of death when dual monitoring - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blue screen of death when dual monitoring</h2>
                    When ever I connect a secondary monitor using an HD15 cable, and go to screen resolution (Control Panel\Appearance and Personalization\Display\Screen Resolution) and click on detect, the computer crashes and blue screen of death shows up. After the computer
 restarts, everything works fine until it goes to sleep, and then when I try to wake it up, just a black screen shows up on both monitors. What is going on here??<br />
I only have these problems when dual monitoring. Also the first monitor is connected using HDMI. My system is i7 2.8 GHz quad core with 8GB ram and graphic card GeForce GTX 660. Thanks

<p>Split from this thread.</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sorry for jumping in like this but we are also facing this issue at my company.</p>
<p>I our case the SIP address is not the same as out primary SMTP address.</p>
<p>Is it mandatory to have the two address the same in order to get this to work?</p>
<p>Or is there another way to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>hi allistair,</p>
<p>based on my understanding, this issue you are experiencing is that mapi information is showing that mapi is unavailable and some items are not synced between skype for business and outlook. if anything is misunderstood, please correct me.</p>
<p>to get items sync between them, the sip address needs to be the same with primary smtp address. so please follow the steps to let these addresses match:<br />
1. login to <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">exchange admin center</a>.<br />
2. navigate to recipients &gt;mailboxes &gt;select the user and click edit.<br />
3. select email address and change the sip address and the primary smtp address to let them match.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=60219558-c238-4425-b611-9e59ec668db2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d60219558-c238-4425-b611-9e59ec668db2" /></a><br />
then wait for serval minutes, re-login to skype for business and outlook with the same account to check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>if the issue still occurs, please try the workaround in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3147130#bookmark-fixitformealways" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if there is still no improvement, for further investigation, could you provide the following information:<br />
1.&nbsp;screenshots of skype for business configuration information via 
private message.<br />
2.&nbsp;do all users encounter this issue?<br />
3.&nbsp;to narrow down the network issue, try another network environment, such as 4g or home network.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />

<p>hi allistair,</p>
<p>thanks for the error messages.</p>
<p>i notice the sip address and smtp address doesn’t match. please change then to match.
<br />
if the issue persists after matching them, besides providing other answers to these two questions mentioned above, please try to create a new outlook profile to narrow down the profile issue.<br />
here are the steps of creating a new outlook profile:</p>
<ul>
<li>navigate to control panel&gt;mail (view by large icons)&gt;show profiles&gt;add… </li><li>add a profile and click ok. </li><li>input the smtp address and password to setup. </li><li>after setting up the account, click <strong>prompt for a profile to be used</strong>.
</li></ul>

<p>Sorry for the long delay, I am still having these issues.</p>
<p>I do not have access to the Exchange Admin Center, because my company has out-sourced the O365 solution to a 3rd party.
</p>
<p>I have forwarded your to them and they are validating it.</p>
<p>As for your suggestion to try another network, while I am on another network this issue I do not have this issue.
</p>
<p>However, only a few people on my network has this issue. </p>
<p>We have mixed installations, for a small group of "test" users we installed Office 2016 through the Office.com portal.</p>
<p>For the rest of the users, we used the MS deployment tool. The "test" users do not have this issue and the rest do.</p>
<p>I then prepared a new laptop installed Office 2016 though the portal and then logged on with my credentials and the issue still occurred. Then using the same local pc account, I logged in with one of the "test" users account and the issue was gone. I tried
 once more with my account and the issue returned.</p>
<p>I have tried the workaround but that has not completely solve the issue. The error message disappeared, only there is still no syncing between the SfB meeting tab an my calendar.
</p>
<p>When I clicked on the "View more in Outlook..." link in the "Conversations" tab it did open the "Conversation History" folder in Outlook.</p>

<p>Hi Allistair,</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and efforts on this case.</p>
<p>For moving forward, could you help me confirm the following points?<br />
1.&nbsp;About” As for your suggestion to try another network, while I am on another network this issue I do not have this issue. However, only a few people on my network has this issue”, did you mean this issue still occurs on another network on some users?<br />
2.&nbsp;As the issue didn’t happen on the “test” users, are the any differences between your account and these “test” users accounts?<br />
3.&nbsp;Please let admin provide screenshots of SIP address and SMTP address of the same affected user. To protect your privacy, send these screenshots via the link https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations.</p>

<p>Hi Sophia,</p>
<p>I received this mail on Saturday again, I thought that I had already uploaded the requested info to the filetransfer site. &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>1. Outside of our main domain we do not this issue. I should note that our exchange domain is not integrated/linked/synchronized with our AD domain. Also the functional level of our AD domain is server 2000, whereas the exchange servers are 2016.</p>
<p>2. The only difference between the "test" users and the rest is the installation method. All the accounts were created at the same time and in the same way. The task of the test users was to test the impact of upgrading from office 2007 to office 2016</p>
<p>3. Please see the uploaded file. If this is not the info you need I will ask our admin to provide the screenshots &nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Allistair</p>

            We have managed to solve the issue. In the end we discovered that we were missing CNAME records (for auto-discovery) in our internal DNS. &nbsp;After added the records outlook and Skype started syncing again.
