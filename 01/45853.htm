<h2>            upgrading form windows 7 home premium to windows 10 and at welcome screen to click next mouse and keyboard do not respond</h2>
                    <p>i am trying to upgrade to windows 10 32 bit on a compaq presario sr1829nx with the AMD64 3400+ and have 4 gigs of ram.</p>
<p>i have tried bot ways to do the upgrade. from on line and from the media creation disc. doing this for a friend.</p>
<p>using a usb mouse and keyboard. start the upgrade, which takes forever, then it finally gets to the screen with the welcome and the users name and the next button, can not use the keyboard or the mouse. i have even gone into the bios and disabled the PS/2
 mousse, and even disabled the legacy USB and still the same thing. i get to that welcome (user name) and and it asks if this is who i am, and has the next button, and have no mouse or keyboard.</p>
<p>now funny thing is before everything starts to do the upgrade get the report that everything is good for the upgrade, but still the same result. no mouse and keyboard. don't even have the mouse indicator.</p>
<p>would this mean that the PC is not even able to run windows 10?</p>
<p>even after your compatibility check saying it would run windows 10 that maybe it wont.</p>
<p>oh, and it has a 150GB hard drive that is a PATA drive, not a SATA drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: this is during the install. so i can not get to anything past that first screen asking the info to finish the upgrade install.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well, you have made it thus far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would not disable legacy USB support, re-enble that option, then try connecting to another USB port.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a PS/2 port and mouse, try using that to finish the installation. You should be able to call up the on screen keyboard when you need to enter information.

            <p>already tried all of that. do not have a PS/2 mouse or keyboard or access to one. i have tried all of the suggestions for disabling the USB legacy, and that did not work, also tried to disable the PS/2 mouse in the bios and still none of that worked.</p>
<p>sad part is i can get windows 10 64 bit to run on a unsupported Mac Pro with no problem, but trying to get it to upgrade on a PC that originally had XP then windows 7, and it wont even let the mouse and keyboard work to finish the install. have tried both
 online upgrade and also did the media creation tool also.and still no good and getting mouse and keyboard to work to finish install.very sad that it would not carry over the USB drivers that worked in windows 7</p>

            <p>not sue if this will work since the install is not complete. it was still on the install. it had eh screen that had the user name in the upper left corner, then below that said if not you click here, then in the bottom right area is the next button. problem
 is can not click on any of that or even Finnish the install because the mouse and keyboard which are USB wont work.</p>
<p>they work fine in windows 7 which was on before the upgrade, and also work in the bios, but when win 10 does the install, they quit working. it is like win 10 destroyed the usb drivers. and can't continue with install</p>

            <p>well i have decided to call it quits trying to install Windows 10 32 bit on the PC i am working on. going back to win &amp; home Premium. guess win 10 just don't want to have usb Keyboard and mouse drivers to work with that old a PC. even after turning off the
 PS/2 ports, they still wont work. there are 7 USB 2.0 ports and none of them will work when you do the upgrade. thanks Microsoft, some people do õt have the money to go out and buy the latest and newest models on the market. Not like with Apple, you can still
 have a 2006 model and upgrade it to work with the newest operating system.</p>

 64 bit right now on the Mac Pro 2,1. they just might find a way to do it..</p>
<p>But as for eh Compaq Presario SR1820NX I went and loaded Windows 7 32 bit back in it. it is mainly going to be used as a stand by for the one who owns it that also has a laptop with Vista on it.

<h2>            Surface Book 2 frequently asks for Bitlocker Recovery Key</h2>
                    <p>In the past few days, when starting my Surface Book 2, I am frequently being asked for my Bitlocker Recovery Key. Sometimes I force reboot a few times and sometimes I correctly enter the key and then reboot. After a couple of reboots the computer will launch
 Windows. I have not changed anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a sign of impending hardware failure? Is it a setting? Any ideas on how I can solve?</p>

            Hi Richard,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for bringing this up. Glad to know that you were able to retrieve and use the recovery key for the device BitLocker. It seems that frequent appearing the BitLocker page caused by hardware or software issue. To understand the issue better, let us know
 more details by answering the following questions:<br />
<br />
• What's the current Windows 10 OS Build of your Surface? To do this, type <em><strong>'winver'</strong></em> on the
<strong>Search</strong> bar/<strong>Cortana</strong>, then hit <strong>Enter</strong>. This will show the Windows build and version installed on Surface.<br />
• Have you tried scanning your Surface Book 2 using Windows Defender Security Center?<br />
• Can you confirm if the device has the latest updates installed?<br />
<br />
To help solve this issue, we suggest that you scan your device using <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4013263/windows-10-stay-protected-with-windows-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Defender Security Center</a></strong>.
 Go to the app then select <strong>'Virus &amp; thread protection'</strong> and click
<em><strong>'Scan now'</strong></em>. If that doesn't help, download and run the <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong>. It is a self-healing tool which looks for potential issues
 and fixes them, as well as ensures your device is completely up to date. To tool takes about 10-15 minutes to run. Once you run the toolkit, kindly follow the on-screen instructions.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let us know by replying to this thread. This way, we'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as we can.

            Hi, landonblaine:<br />
<br />
When the option <strong>Store and display recently opened items in the Start menu and the Taskbar</strong> is unchecked and grayed out, it is a symptom that&nbsp;two Windows policies are applied to your system.<br />
<br />
Open Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) and browse to this key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer. If there is a registry value
<strong>NoRecentDocsMenu</strong> set to 1, delete it. If there is a registry value
<strong>NoRecentDocsHistory</strong> set to 1, delete it as well.<br />
<br />
Repeat the same steps in the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer (it may not exist).<br />
<br />
Restart your computer and see if the problem is solved.

<h2>            Forza Horizon - The game gets stuck at the &#38;quot&#59;Xbox 360&#38;quot&#59; screen when starting the game on the Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>The game gets stuck at the "Xbox 360" screen when starting the game on the Xbox One. Tried all the suggestions by the Ambassador, including uninstalling and re-installing this nearly 10Gig downloadable (took 2+ hours download time on Cox Cable) game. The
 results were the same - stuck at the "Xbox 360" screen trying to start the game. I'm playing on a manufacturer refurbished Xbox One bought direct from Microsoft. Can this be fixed? Please advise.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi SwordofWhedon,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>You're a genius! It worked! :)</p>
<p>I went offline before starting the game and it worked. It required that I download my profile before allowing me to play the game. Good thing the Xbox One allows us to toggle to the signing screen so I can connect and download my Xbox 360 profile. The signing
 in took a few tries and about 15 minutes before it was successful. Once it signed in the downloading of the profile was pretty quick, less than 5 minutes.
</p>
<p>Thanks all for your help and patience.</p>
<p>See you in game. :)</p>

<p>Try starting the game while disconnected from the internet. Make sure you also delete your local saves and let the game itself restore them from the cloud. Best of luck!</p>

<p>My machine completely crashes when I run Microsoft Publisher 2010. If I uninstall the graphics drivers then it works fine but when they are reinstalled the system crashes. If I use a difference graphics card then the system does not crash.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I narrowed down the problem to Dolphin Supernova visual imparement software which is installed on the computer. It installs something called a Video Intercept Driver. If this is removed, then the system does not freeze when running Publisher. I have contacted
 Dolphin and they are aware of the problem and their developers are attempting to resolve the issue with a new update. It crashes with version v11.56.</p>

            <p>It is not recommended to turn off Volume Shadow Copy. It manages and implements Volume Shadow Copies used for backup and other purposes. If this service is stopped, shadow copies will be unavailable for backup and the backup may fail. If this service is
 disabled, any services that explicitly depend on it will fail to start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you still want to disable Volume shadow copy than follow the steps as below:<br />
<br />
1. Press the Windows + R, type services.msc and press enter.<br />
2. Locate the service "Volume Shadow Copy" and right click and click "Stop".<br />
3. Close Services windows.</p>

<h2>            Controller</h2>
                    Ok at random times, my controller will disconnect from my xbox. It has been doing this for roughly 2 weeks now. This had made my gaming experience on xbox a little harder as i will often die on shooter/fighting games due to this problem. The disconnection
 lasts only for a few seconds but it still is really annoying. Someone please fix this or let know how to fix this/what is causing this problem.

The forums will not show your Xbox One gamerpic, and there is sometimes a delay in the website fully showing this. This thread is over a year old. If you need further support, please post up a new thread detailing what you're running into and troubleshooting you've completed.

<h2>            Nvidia Geforce Go 7300 compatible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This GPU is&nbsp;listed as compatible when running the Upgrade assistent, as well as having a&nbsp;green marker on the Microsoft Windows&nbsp;Compatibility Center.</p>
<p>After install of Win 8 the GPU driver is&nbsp;only supported by the basic Windows driver - updating drivers doesnt help.</p>
<p>The links at the Compatibility Center&nbsp;are both to Nvidias Japanese website&nbsp;- no other Nvidia website list a compatible driver (current or legacy) for this GPU for Windows 8. There is however a legacy driver for Win XP, Vista and Windows 7, i.e. 179.48.&nbsp;
 Windows 8 is not listed as supported.</p>

            I have similar problem with my Geforce Go 7200 driver on my HP dv600 notebook. When I try to install Windows 8 x64, on the first screen the mouse pointer trails distorting the screen and there is a lag between the pointer and tabs. I managed to install
 W8 with these boring screens and tried to install Go 7200 Windows 7 drivers but it failed. Although they claim Go 7200 is compatible, it is not. This is related to the marketing policy of manufacturers (in this case HP and NVIDA) Because they want to market
 new notebooks with new Windows versions.<br />

<h2>            Upgrade to Windows 10 stuck in Scanning and repairing drive &#40;G&#41;&#58; 62&#37;</h2>
                    I accepted the upgrade to Windows 10 and scheduled the upgrade for a certain time&nbsp;thinking that I would be home and able to observe the process. However, when I got home the process had been running for some time and&nbsp;the message "Scanning and repairing
 drive (G): 24%" was displayed. Drive G is a secondary drive. When I went to bed the percentage was 62%, and now the following morning it is still 62%. I had one hell of a problem when I upgraded to Windows 8, and it cost me a small fortune to fix. What do
 I do?

                    Is there a reliable, clean and genuine windows registry cleaner for win7 that checks &amp; removes orphan entries of un-installed programs?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It should not be a program that can make mistakes and corrupt my PC. It is something that I would like to run periodically and clean my system. I believe unwanted registry entries do slow up my system and unfortunately, I have to periodically run maintenance
 on my windows machine for improving performance. It is never like it was when I bought it.</div>

            <p>No, I have never heard of a realiable, safe&nbsp;registry cleaner for Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do you think you need a registry cleaner? Are you having issues with your system, receiving error messages, or having system/program crashes? If so, I think it's much better to address and resolve the problem than blinding trying to fix an issue with
 a registry cleaner. Personally, I do not recommend their use and in far to many cases cause new/worse problems than they fix; only my opinion.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The registry in Windows 7 pretty much takes care of itself; the removal of empty keys and the like only slows it down slightly - you need a very good stopwatch to even tell!<br />

            Hi Michel, 
<br />
<br />The latest drivers for this model on dells website is for Win 7, which could be part of the problem. 
<br />
<br />Let’s give windows troubleshooter a shot. Click start, type “troubleshoot” and launch it.Find Bluetooth and run the troubleshooter, see if it can find the issue. 
<br />
<br />Click start and type “Device Manager” - and select it from the list of results. Do you see Bluetooth on this list? If so, 
<br />
<br />Next, click on start, and type "services" and right click and run as admin. Find any and all bluetooth services, and make sure they are started. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

            <p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your prompt response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uploaded the files to my One Drive as you requested. There are three files:</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 Name: eventvwr-SystemLog 31-01-2017.evtx<br />
Link: <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhP2wMXsIvIEgVYD_Oarh84wH8cO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhP2wMXsIvIEgVfhrDmujkFikL3E</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 Name: msinfo32-System Summary 31-01-2017.txt<br />

https://1drv.ms/t/s!AhP2wMXsIvIEgVhrPkk_QXn4WNRG</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>These files were generated shortly after the upgrade failure on the 31-01-2017 (which ended about 5:25 pm) and the methodology you provided was used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to capture some video of this process to verify the comments in my question. When I started the Windows Upgrade Assistant it provided the information that I was running Windows 10 version 10586 which will be updated to version 14393.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted an upgrade earlier in the day starting around 11:30 am and running for about 2 hours - obviously the event files above would also include that attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By way of further information for you:<br />
Please note that just prior to these upgrade attempts and based on the contents of the thread 'Windows 10 Anniversary Update won't install -- How to diagnose':
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I tried to update my Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller driver but it was already current at version 9.1.402.2015 dated 02/04/2015</p>
<p>2. I updated my Nvidia GeForce GT 520 driver from 353.82 to 369.09</p>
<p>3. My NetTcpPortSharing service was already Started in Automatic mode. The Log On Tab 'Local System Account' was already checked.</p>
<p>4. As regards NVIDIA Update Service Daemon, this was not evident in Services and thus I could not make any changes to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you need anything else at present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

            <p><span><span>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this
 tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions and run in normal
 mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Please make certain you uncheck the box before Enable free trial of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Premium.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please upload a copy of the report on what it found as a shared file to your OneDrive and a post a link here.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download ADWCleaner to your Downloads or Desktop folder, right click select Run as Administrator and upload a copy of the report produced to your OneDrive. Remove all that it finds.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Before running ADW Cleaner close all open programmes. When ADW Cleaner is run four options are offered. Click Scan. You can review the results by clicking Log File or each or any of the
 Results tabs. To remove all items, click Clean and reboot the computer. On restarting an ADW Cleaner window opens. Select Log File, and click File, Save As to create a report of what has been removed.</span></span></p>

<h2>            SKYPE CAN&#39;T ACCESS YOUR SOUND CARD</h2>
                    <p>hello community,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am new to working on a PC Windows 10 Pro. When I use skype to call, the person at the other end cannot hear me. I can hear them. I have checked all microphone settings, restarted twice and I'm still not hearing the person on the other end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The message I get when I call ECHO is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>CAN'T ACCESS YOUR SOUND CARD&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skype needs to access your computer's sound card to make calls. Try restarting your computer to help skype find your sound card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mic is stet to: Microphone Array (Realteck High Definition)&nbsp;</p>
<p>and "automatically adjust microphone settings"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help! Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            I’d suggest downloading classic Skype and use it to see if that corrects your problem. 
<br />
<br />1 ) Go to <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a>
<br />
<br />2) Click the drop-down arrow in the blue download button
<br />
<br />3) Select Get classic Skype
<br />
<br />4) Run the downloaded program

    <title>Friend Banned From Xbox Live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trewillz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Friend Banned From Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, I have a friend. In short I'll call her D. D has been banned permanently because of friends of her ex that repeatedly reports her account. I hate that they do it and she has been chat banned on numerous occasions in the past. I know there is no such
 thing as a false ban because they're investigated. She does use strong language and have anger issues but she was *** by her cousin and one of her boyfriends for seven years of her life and her family treated her like s***. Even blaming her when they found
 out. So all she knows is this personality and I've been working on fixing it because I'm that guy. Anyways, her ex's friends are using that knowledge of her personality and just are randomly reporting her to get her banned.</p>

<p>Although it is right in the terms of technicality, does Microsoft do anything to ensure that he people who reported the account actually have interacted with the accused account? Me and a few friends play with D daily and all she does is play with us and
 we have not been bothered. We've been supporting her all this time. Are people just able to make random accounts or tell their friends to report someone just to get them banned or does Microsoft actually take that into consideration? I know this wouldnt matter
 for hackers banned because if they get caught by any means that's just fine.</p>

<p>But someone should not be able to report you for language when they've never heard you talk in the first place.</p>

<p>A common misconception is that a certain number of reports will result in an automatic suspension. According to the myth, even if you haven’t done anything wrong someone can get you suspended by encouraging players to file many complaints. This is completely
 untrue.</p>
<p>XBLPET investigates complaints and takes each report into consideration when making an enforcement decision, but a certain volume or frequency of complaints doesn’t guarantee a suspension. They take an evidence-based approach to enforcement and take numerous
 factors into account when considering issuing a suspension. The context around the content or activity is particularly essential and drives our decision-making process. Simply put, there is no magic formula that instantly results in a suspension.</p>
<p>Despite what some may claim, XBLPET will never ever ban anyone “for no reason”. Suspensions always occur as a result of a specific Code of Conduct violation.</p>

Des que je veux lancer l'un ou l'autre j'ai le droit à une redirection direct sur le store avec uniquement le choix "installer" j'ai pourtant bien les jeux présent sur la console. J'ai donc essayé de réinstaller Gone Home il se trouve que un doublon s'installer, j'ai annulé ce dernier et j'ai eu le droit à la suppression du premier. Donc j'ai testé de redémarrer la console, de l’éteindre puis de la rallumé, et de l'éteindre en appuyant 10s sur le bouton centrale. J'ai également testé de déconnecter et reconnecté mon profil rien ne change.</p><p>J'avais hâte de testé la Beta de Battlefront 2, je ne pourrais pas car je ne peux joué que le weekend et je ne possède pas la fibre, je ne peux donc pas me permettre de télécharger à tous vas.
