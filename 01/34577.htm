<h2>            Flashing Xbox symbol</h2>
                    
<p>OK I've searched and searched and haven't found an answer. While watching Netflix or streaming video, every so often there is a flashing white Xbox symbol on the top right of the screen, what on earth is it for??</p>

<p>Google is your friend. &nbsp;Anyway on reddit some people had the same issue, do a hard reset (hold down power button till the system turns off [about 6 seconds], then let it sit for a couple minutes before you turn it back on)</p>

<p>Hey Mopar! Usually the white logo in the corner of the screen is to indicate the Kinect "hears" a command. It could be that it heard a word that sounded like "xbox" or that it is just actively listening if there is noise in the room.</p>

<p>Hmmm odd, it doesn't look like the kinect prompt when you say Xbox...its just the little X symbol and flashes briefly. To me it looks just like a notification, interesting that its literally a mystery :)</p>

<p>Since a couple of days I have a problem sort of like this. The X symbol doesn't go away anymore when I play video's using the 'play to' function or play a rented video on Xbox Video. &nbsp;It doesn't flash or flicker it just stays there. I did a hard reset like
 four times but it's still there. Please help me out, I can't find any solution on the net.</p>

<h2>            USB keyboard not detected</h2>
                    <p>My old PS2 keyboard was fine, but whatever I do my computer will not locate my new Microsoft USB keyboard on startup. I get the error message "keyboard error or no keyboard present,"
</p>
<p>I currently have two keyboads on the go, one to start the computer up and the other to type with. It's stupid.</p>
<p>Any help would be gratefully received, though I am sure I have missed the obvious solution.</p>

            <p>So - if I understand correctly - your problem is that BEFORE Windows boots, your USB keyboard is not detected?&nbsp; After it boots - it is and you use it to type?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so - your problem could be a simple BIOS setting (nothing to do with Windows) or a lack of support for USB devices at boot.&nbsp; Cannot say without knowing more about the computer (make/model of the system as a whole OR the motherboard - dependent on whether
 it is a Third-Tier machine (Dell, IBM, HP, etc) or a piece-meal system put together by you or a friend/etc.<br />

<h2>            Rise of the Tomb Raider, deer and rabbits do not spawn</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all.&nbsp; I bought RotTR at Christmas and played it through a couple of times.&nbsp; Very good.&nbsp; On the second or third play-through I noticed that there was a problem with some animals not spawning, no deer, no rabbits or not many rabbits, wolves didn't spawn.&nbsp;
 Basically anything that gives hides.&nbsp; This makes 100% completion virtually impossible.&nbsp; The deer spawning problem could make Baba Yaga impossible to finish unless there happen to be deer carcasses around.&nbsp; I posted this problem on the Square Enix forums but
 nothing seemed to happen; there were, however, comments that it was starting a game in a save slot other than number 1 and IIRC (this was in February) I started another one in save slot 1 again and the rabbits appeared.&nbsp; I left the game alone but having a
 bit of spare time started up again.&nbsp; I've started the game about six times and got to the bottom of the first zip-line in Soviet installation; I've tried slots 1, 2 and 3 but in none of the cases have any deer or rabbits appeared anywhere, apart from one stag
 right at the start.&nbsp; I have deleted the local save data and restarted but that didn't do anything.&nbsp; Does anyone know a way out of this situation?&nbsp; I've posted again on the Square Enix page but there's no reply yet and as far as I can tell Microsoft are actually
 the firm supporting this game.&nbsp; Anyone know how to fix it?&nbsp; Cheers.</p>

<p>Thanks for the idea but yes, I've tried variants to no avail. &nbsp;If I reload the 100% complete saves then the deer and rabbits appear without fail at certain locations - notably rabbits at the end of the first zip-line in Soviet Installation and both throughout
 Siberian Wilderness. &nbsp;In the new saves - all six - they do not spawn even with fast-moving around between camps. &nbsp;Nothing doing.</p>
<p>By the way, sorry for the repeat post, I looked earlier and the first post I made yesterday had not registered after 12+ hours so I redid it. &nbsp;They're both there now. &nbsp;Ho hum.</p>

<p>I have had a discussion with Microsoft support who stated that since the problem is within the game it is outside of their support and the developer is responsible. &nbsp;I have had an e-mail from Square Enix support to state that Microsoft support this game,
 not Square Enix. &nbsp;Where does this leave me, the customer? &nbsp;Please would someone who knows what the situation really is answer - it's very frustrating.</p>

 say, sounds like pass the buck. Getting to MS Tech service is ridiculous have tried for hours.

            FYI. I have tried all the fixes suggested to no avail. I finally got thru to&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;and a tech worked on it for well over a hour. He came to the same solution that TWC tech came to. It IS the Win 10 program and at this time there is not a fix for it.
 This only happens to some and not to everybody. I was told that Microsoft will continue to work on it as there are others with the same problem and they will send thru an update when and if the solution is determined. In the meantime switch to a different
 mail program that will work. This is a good example of why I was very reluctant to install a new program from Microsoft because of past problems like this with them.

            <p>MS had this fixed until the build right before the summer of 2016. Ever since then Outlook mail will not send email when running on Wi-Fi or via cell networks (for phones). This is an issue with laptops and phones. Going on 9 months with no fix out there.
 I am running build 15051 on the slow ring of insider updates. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a Microsoft Windows issue. As they had it working for the first half of 2016, then it broke.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one randomly sign out</h2>
                    <p>I have a Xbox one S with a Kinect and it keeps randomly signing me out. I will be&nbsp;playing a game or watching a video or&nbsp;be&nbsp;browsing the Xbox store and randomly get a notification&nbsp;saying "Bye name! Sign in using a controller" then get sent back&nbsp;to the main menu of that game. I then will&nbsp;have to log back into by account and re-start the game.&nbsp;This issues has been present for months and is very random and not constant at all. I can play for 12 hours over&nbsp;the course of a&nbsp;week and be fine. Then&nbsp;one day get kicked off 3 times in a 4 hour time window. Or I&nbsp;get kicked off once and log back on and I&nbsp;am fine for the rest of the day. Trouble shooting done thus far</p><p><br /></p><p>*Deleted my account and re-downloaded it.</p><p>*Under setting and Sign-in I&nbsp;set my preference to No Barriers. I thought the kinect was just not seeing me and logging me out.</p><p>*Changed my Microsoft Account password</p><p>*Checked my Microsoft account

 </blockquote> <p>I have a Asus router with AC1900 Dual band.&nbsp;(Model&nbsp;RT-AC68P) I have 3 Xbox Ones in the house and my little sister and Brother do not have this problem. My sisters is using wireless, whiles my brother is wired in over Ethernet.&nbsp;I use to be wireless and now I&nbsp;am using this Power over Ethernet adapter witch&nbsp;still did not solved my issue.&nbsp;When I&nbsp;run a network test on my Xbox I get 30mbps Download, 8mbps upload, 0% Packet loss, MTU 1480, and Latency at 104ms.&nbsp;We do have a lot of devices connected though as my parents have started getting new smart home stuff like a door bell and security cameras as well as some other stuff. So it is possible, but I dont believe it is the issue because my other Xbox's and accounts do not have this issue.</p>

<h2>            Hard drive says it&#39;s full when it shouldn&#39;t be.</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 Pro installed on a Boot Camp partition on a MacBook Pro. &nbsp;The partition is 50 GB in size, and it says there is only a little over 1 GB free. &nbsp;However, when I examine the folders in the C: directory (the Boot Camp partition), their sizes
 sum up to only about 22 GB. &nbsp;I checked the disk for errors and bad sectors, and it was fine, and I even defragged the computer, even though that that shouldn't have been the problem. &nbsp;I don't know if there are hidden files in Windows, but I used command prompt
 to look at the contents of the C: directory and found no extra files.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I'm wondering why half of my hard drive is inexplicably filled up.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, I don't believe this is the cause of the issue, but 18 of the 22 GB that actually SHOULD be filled on the hard drive are Ubuntu installed using Wubi.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for your help.</div>

<p>Hello Wesley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There may be a number of reasons for this type of issue to occur. We would like to know more information regarding this issue so that we can isolate the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did this issue start to occur?</li><li>Did you make any changes prior to this issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I suggest that you make sure that your computer is up to date by checking for updates manually to&nbsp; make sure that there is no incompatibility issues between the version of your Photos app and Windows 10. You can refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to check for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other option is to perform a Repair/Reset. To do this, just go <strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; Apps &amp; Features</strong>, look for the said app and click
<strong>Advanced options</strong>, click <strong>Repair/Reset</strong>. Once done, reboot your computer and check if it is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, if the troubleshooting does not work, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028054/windows-10-repair-or-remove-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">uninstall and reinstall

            <p>Hi Vijay,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the Bluetooth headphone?</li><li>Which application are you using to play the music?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try these steps and check if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>If your computer is having problems playing sound, try using the Playing Audio troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common problems with your volume settings, your sound card or driver, and your speakers or headphones.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Refer to these steps to Run Audio troubleshooter:</span></font></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>a. Type <b>troubleshooting</b> on the <b>start screen</b></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>b.&nbsp; Click on<strong> Settings. </strong>Under <span>
<strong>Hardware and Sound</strong></span> </font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>c. </font></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>. Click
<span><strong>Troubleshoot audio playback </strong></span>and run the wizard.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font><strong>Method 2:</strong></font></span></p>
<div>Check to see if your&nbsp;Headphone is set to be used as the default communication device instead of the default device.<br />
<br />
If so, make the headphone default, so that Windows will use them only when they are plugged in.</div>
<div>You can also try disabling whichever one you don't want to be playing.<br />
a. Right click on the speaker icon in taskbar and select “volume control options”.<br />
b. Place a check mark on "All devices currently playing sound".<br />
c. Make sure you have "The default communication device unchecked".<br />
d. Place a check mark on the Bluetooth earphone.</div>

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter not working after Windows 10 November update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>my Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter worked fine on Windows 10 Lenovo until today I installed the Windows 10 November update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I now press Windows + P, I can still select&nbsp;"connect to a wireless display" and see my TV as wireless display as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I connect now a connection is still made (showing connected on my pc), but my TV display remains black.</p>
<p>When I move the mouse, the TV display remains black but I can see the mouse pointer move on my TV display.</p>
<p>MS Groove Music says that it cannot find an audio device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a while, my TV display goes back to "ready to connect".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MS wireless display adapter app doesnt give me any option (to update adapter firmware for example) and it only says that I am not connected - I did de- and re-install the app.</p>

            <p>Hi Joy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter bought in MS Store beginning of July of this year (model 1628).</p>
<p>I have a lenovo thinkpad x1 carbon type 3448.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the Lenove website I downloaded the Intel Wireless Display for Windows 10:</p>
<p>http://support.lenovo.com/de/de/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-x-series-laptops/thinkpad-x1-carbon-type-34xx/downloads/DS105775</p>
<p>Version 6.0.44.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>With my Windows 10 november update, I cannot right click the downloaded exe and choose "run in compatibility mode" but you can choose "troubleshoot compatibility", then I choose "try recommended settings" (... test run program using recommended compatibility
 settings): "Windows compatibility mode: Windows 8"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I select Test the program: Intel's Wireless Display Setup Wizard appears and runs until Intel WiDi shows: Install Wizard Aborted:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- This platform is not compatible with Intel WiDi</p>
<p>- Your processor is not compatible with Intel WiDi</p>
<p>- Your wireless driver cannot find or load necessary components for Intel WiDi</p>
<p>- Your graphics driver cannot find or load necessary components for Intel WiDi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can only exit the wizard and the install has failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then checked the Intel web but I think they offer the same driver version at</p>
<p>http://downloadcenter.intel.com/detail_desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;DwnldID=25153&amp;lang=deu&amp;wapkw=wireless+display+adapter+windows+10&amp;_ga=1.63990191.140765293.1449003674</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the driver anyway and here I was able to right click, goto properties and run in compatibility mode - I tried for Win7 and Win8 but it returned the same error as noted above. I also ran the troubleshooter with the same results as noted above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then from the Intel side, I also tried an older driver (version 5.1.38.0)</p>
<p><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/de/download/24692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/de/download/24692</a>, but run into the same problems as described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<p>In terms of the basic gametypes, it would probably be Team Deathmatch, unless you aggressively pursue all the tags/pick up your own tags.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If you're good you could make use of games like Demolition, but I think even that is only half EXP compared to Team Deathmatch... you'd have to go over double your normal killcount in a comparable time, though the extra kills would help you hit challenges
 quicker.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I'd say Team Deathmatch, personally, though Kill Confirmed could beat it, as I said.</p>

<p>Someone else might have different thoughts and you might also consider using a Tactical Insertion, because with practice (particularly if sniping) you could get your own tags very easily and reliably.</p>

<p>I like to play Domination. Its a free 150 pts for taking a flag. Then if you stay in the area (roaming, not camping) and defend the flag then the kills come to you. You also get extra points for defending a flag.

<p>[quote user="ChainSmokingBob"]In terms of the basic gametypes, it would probably be Team Deathmatch.[/quote]</p>
<p>Usually, I think your posts are pretty spot-on Bob, but I think you're really missing the mark here. In Team Deathmatch the main activity driving your XP is killing an enemy. In objective games, you still get the same XP for killing the enemy but you also
 get additional XP for completing objectives (flag capture/defend, bomb plant/defuse, kill confirm/deny). Furthermore, Team Deathmatch stops after a given number of kills so there is a limited amount of XP that can be earned through kills. In objective games,
 the game isn't over until the objectives are completed or time runs out which results in a lot more kills/deaths - which results in more XP earned. Given all the extra XP to be gained in objective games - I just don't see how you could think that Team Deathmatch
 is the best game for ranking up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I've read, as well as from my own experience, the best way to rank up is playing a run'n'gun style in Kill Confirmed while using the specialist strike package. Playing this way will net you a good amount of kills per game, a lot of XP from confirms/denies,
 and extra XP for earning additional perks/specialist package from killstreaks. Of course, winning also helps as the match bonus at the end of the round is bigger when you're on the winning team.</p>

<p>Well, thanks man, first off.</p>
<p>________</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>1) "In objective games, you still get the same XP for killing the enemy but you also get additional XP for completing objectives (flag capture/defend, bomb plant/defuse, kill confirm/deny)".</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In most objective gametypes, EXP from killing someone is halved from 100 to 50, which is a major point for my opinion... you're swapping EXP from killing people for EXP from picking up tags/capping flags/so on. Team Defender's Double Points for holding the
 flag? Doubled from 50 to 100, which means that much of the time in that gametype (assuming teams of equal skill) you're losing half the EXP for a kill. Domination? Same thing. That's fine if you can do one of the following:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>a) Double your kills.</p>
<p>b) Hold onto the Flag (Team Defender) for long enough or earn enough additional points from objectives (Domination)</p>
<p>c) A combination of the two.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Now, the OP said they were a fairly casual, more chilled out player, so I was thinking more along the lines of reliable, straight-up EXP. If you kill someone in Team Deathmatch, blam. That's it. That's all your EXP. If you want to earn as well in Team Defender,
 you'd better make sure the above conditions are being met. If you want to earn the same in Kill Confirmed, you'd better make sure you confirm all your kills, which doesn't happen often, or that you compensate for it by denying kills or picking up your own
 tags. This is easier than Team Defender, certainly, comparable to a good run in Domination. Kill Confirmed, if you pick your tags up twice and confirm or deny a kill for every kill you get, isn't a bad idea and is certainly going to be better in the long run.
 If you're aggressive and successful at doing so, you can kill players, confirm the kill, enter a battle, deny your team's tags, kill and confirm more kills --or just confirm kills-- AND move on, but you've got to be successful. If you're not, you're only undercutting
 yourself. If you're not but you are collecting your own tags, well... you'd better hope you can do it one, two or three times each game and in my experience, that isn't overly likely. If you're a good rusher, it's a profitable gametype.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Even in Domination, you won't necessarily make many kills that qualify for Defend a Flag or Attack a Flag (or whatever... I can't actually name it correctly at the moment). Capping a flag is fairly good EXP, but that's only enough to compensate for the halved
 EXP of three kills. Not a problem, because between captures, defends/offenses and a moderate/low killcount, you're certainly able to balance out the loss, but again, it isn't certain.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If you're really not an effective killer/not into killing, then capping and making worthwhile kills is a good way to get EXP, particularly if you feel you need a break, but unless you're well positioned (for the bonus kill EXP) or actively capping, again,
 you're losing out on EXP that kills should be giving you as standard. You can certainly get good EXP out of Domination, but you'd have to be playing properly (or doubling your killcount in the same amount of time as a comparable Team Deathmatch game (or two,
 since Domination is often longer)).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I just feel that getting all your EXP from one standard source is more reliable, therefore more regular. If you're having a bad time shooting, then, well, you might have to change to get decent EXP for obvious reasons, but otherwise I think it's a good shot.</p>
<p>________</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Demolition I don't like in the slightest, but there are a few problems with this as an example of an excellent gametype to play for EXP.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>1) EXP is halved, as is standard. You need twice as many kills in Demolition as you do in Team Deathmatch. That's 40 for 20, obviously, and 30 for 15. It's harder to achieve than it seems, particularly since as you get better, you've only got to double a
 larger killcount.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>2) Killstreaks are limited in this gametype... Assault Killstreaks are not going to be called in often. Support is fine, obviously, but Support doesn't pay out much anyway.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Specialist will get you somewhere with EXP... but you won't be stringing them together very well, which limits EXP gains. I think if you're good you can obviously kill people going for the objective, but you still have to double what you can get in Team
 Deathmatch and I'm not assuming the OP is better than everyone else, because EXP wouldn't likely be a problem if that were the case.</p>
<p>________</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I have solid reasoning... I'm not saying, by any means, that my opinion is right. It's simply my opinion. I just did think it out fairly well. I'd be interested to see what you think and why that's the case, because it's a very interesting discussion, I
 must say.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Personally, I tried a few gametypes during the Double EXP weekend and I really thought Team Deathmatch was the way to go. Kill Confirmed was good but you can't always deny your own death and it really does rely on collecting plenty of tags... I found that
 difficult without running around with my MP5.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Demolition I just got rocked in but deaths were at an all-time high and I saw a single AH-6, likely out of one of the four or five Care Packages that were called in.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Domination I didn't like.... lots of kills... but halved EXP, even with the points to cap and the specially-placed kill points... :S It'd be good if you were defending/attacking for enough of your kills to double it to standard TDM EXP AND capped enough
 points to make up the rest, then ideally make a profit. If the game is longer, you've also got to have a better Domination game than it seems, because you're accommodating for more than one Team Deathmatch game.</p>
<p>________</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I'd say that the OP could make good use of Domination for the non-Kill EXP if they ever get bored of whatever they normally play, provided it's kill intensive, as I do acknowledge that it's good for EXP if kills aren't a key component. There may also be
 better alternatives for a similar gameplay experience but I don't have enough experience to name or go into any.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I apologise for the slightly disjointed post by the way... It strings together as I thought of it in some parts, which isn't ideal to read.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>(Also, I know that Kill Confirmed is supposed to be the way to go, but again, that's fairly skill-intensive and you do have to be rushing. It doesn't pay out well otherwise).</p>

<p>The majority of the time I play TDM and run Specialist. Look at your stats and find out what your top 3 ARs are by their K/D. Then use those and do the challenges for all the attachments for each given weapon. Run the 2 Attachments proficiency as soon as
 you unlock it, so you can knock out 2 things at once. Once your weapon hits level 30, switch to your next best AR. I usually skip the shotgun and launcher attachments, mostly because I end up dead trying to use them.</p>

<p>It is definitely an interesting discussion!! :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind with Kill Confirmed is that you get points for confirming the kill regardless of whether you or your teammate grabs the tag (if you grab it 100 points for you, teammate grabs it 100 points for you and 100 points for them). So even
 non-rushers can benefit from the extra points that a confirmed kill gets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Team Deathmatch the game ends after one team gets 75 kills. That's a total of 7500 points that could be earned by players on the winning team. In Kill Confirmed, the game ends at 65 confirmed kills. That's a total of 9750 points that could be earned by
 the team (65 * 150 points/confirmed kill). This doesn't take into account that kills can be denied or neither confirmed or denied. It also doesn't take into account that if kills were always confirmed by a teammate (as opposed to the actualy killer) the total
 number of points per confirmed kill is actually 250. These additional factors means that in most, if not every game, the total number of points to be earned by players on a winning team in Kill Confirmed will far exceed the total number of points that could
 be earned by players on the winning team in Team Deathmatch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, one thing that hasn't been mentioned yet is air support. Regardless of what game type you're playing take some extra time to shoot down UAVs/Choppers/etc... is a great way to boost your XP.</p>

 reconnects after a few seconds.</p>
<p>My internet connection (Sky fibre optic) does not appear to be dropping (I do not face these same issues with other wired/wireless connections). I have checked the security logs on my router and it appears to be just the connection between the xbox (ethernet
 port 1). See below.</p>

<p>I have tried replacing the ethernet cable and changing the port on the router that the xbox is connected to but this has not helped.</p>
<p>The xbox is on a static IP and I have opened all relevant ports. NAT is Open.</p>
<p>The router is a Sagem FaST2504n (F@ST2504n) from Sky.</p>
<p>If anyone has any suggestions, your help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>I have used wireless tonight and do not appear to be having the same issues. Do you think it could be an issue with the Ethernet port on my xbox console?
</p>
<p>I have tried a number of different ports on my router and still had the same problems with each so I don't think the router is the problem.

            <p>Unfortunately it sounds like your Xbox One console may need to be repaired. You can continue to use wireless, but if you want to use ethernet I recommend requesting a repair on your Xbox One console. You can do that by getting in contact with our chat or phone support agents by visiting our&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a>&nbsp;page. I'm sorry for any inconvenience this may cause!</p>
<p>Feel free to post back and let us know how everything goes! :)</p>

            <span>Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: msconfig and when it appears in the Results box above, right-click and choose "Run as Administrator".<br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue. Then see what is on the Startup tab.&nbsp;You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used the Utility.
 Usually this will be blocked by Windows Defender and you'll need to allow it so you can then tick the box that says in effect, "don't bother me about this again".<br />
<br />
Important - Do not use the System Configuration Utility to stop processes. Use Services instead and do not stop any services unless you really, really know what you're doing.<br />

<p>Hi there 
<span>Meghmala</span> !</p>
<p>I have already looked at the first link and that is not the problem.</p>
<p>In the second link</p>
<p>method 1: didnt work</p>
<p>method2: didnt work: it kept saying that it was not a valid command and stuff</p>
<p>method 3: i am running on a laptop so there is no other drives to use</p>
<p>method 4: i have had that type of prob lem with other programs and know how to fix it, this is not happening with my current problem</p>
<p>method 5: i tried this to no avail.</p>
<p>method 6: zoo tycoon automatically installs the files and you cant choose the destination folder: probably because the game is an expansion pack.</p>
<p>method 7: all the files on the page to download didnt work, i had to run a few of them as admin but they just said that my computer doesnt need the update</p>
<p>method 8: this is the one im confused about. i downloaded the software and ran it and as the instructions said, i clicked 'remove' on the zoo tycoon 2. but a popup said that it would not work properly and i would have to reinstall all the versions. i dont
 want to do that. NEED REASSURANCE ON THIS ONE.</p>
<p>method 9: that is not the problem and i do have sufficient internet cnnection</p>
<p>method 10: i have done the instructions but still have to restart my computer.</p>
<p>method 11: i am in Australia.</p>
<p>the only thing that might seem to work is method 8 but i am worried about the fact that my game wont work properly.</p>
<p>thankyou for helping in the fist place but your answer didnt fix my problem.</p>
<p>do you have anything else in mind?</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

<p>Tried deleting it on my 360 and re downloading it (which it did fine) but on the website it's still showing as £9.99? I'm guessing this is what is effecting the remastered versions price?</p>

<p>I have been having the same issue (I believe). &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am currently using a shared Xbox Gold membership from my roomate's Xbox live account. &nbsp;My main gamertag is the owner of the Xbox 360 version of Castle Crashers, and it is not a gold account.</p>
<p>After chatting with live-chat support for a couple hours, we have come to this conclusion. &nbsp;The Behemoth is the game publisher, and they decide who can download their game, for what price, and subscription requirements. &nbsp;They have specifically chosen to
 only allow members who have both: 1. purchased Castle Crashers for Xbox 360 and, 2. have an active Xbox Live Gold membership - to purchase their game at the "FREE" price.</p>
<p>Another thing that should be noted is that a large amount of users are having difficulties getting their "FREE" discount, even when they meet all of the requirements.</p>
<p>One of Xbox Support Chat's Managers stated the following to me: "You can let him know that Behemoth's looking into this and have him try for a couple of hours or much better for at least 24 hours."</p>
<p>Lastly, I have left a support ticket with the Behemoth about the issue that I'm having, and have seen posts on their website from users regarding your issues.</p>
<p>So, there you have it folks. &nbsp;We'll have to sit back and wait on a response from the Behemoth.</p>

<p>The account you are currently using had to have purchased the original game to be eligible for this upgrade offer. &nbsp;Playing the game on an account that hasn't purchased the game does not activate this offer.</p>
<p>Hope that helps clear up the issue! :)</p>

<h2>            Insultes, menaces de mort</h2>
                    
<p>Bonjour,</p>

<p>J'ai appelé le service client qui m'a redirigée vers le forum afin que l'on s'occupe de mon cas. On m'a conseillé de rédiger un message avec le gamertag de la personne en question dans le but
 qu'un modérateur intervienne.</p>
<p>Depuis plus d'un an, une personne du Xbox Live (dont le gamertag est&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>[Edité par l'équipe de modération]</strong>&nbsp;) me harcèle. Il émet envers moi des propos sexistes, des insultes horribles
 (contre moi et ma famille), etc... il a même menacé de pirater mon compte, de me frapper et de me tuer. J'ai déposer de nombreuses plaintes contre lui, mais celles-ci se sont révélées inutiles. De plus, je ne suis pas la seule dans ce cas, car il a insulté
 et menacé de pirater le compte de mes amis à plusieurs reprises. J'aimerais, si cela est possible, que mon gamertag ne lui soit pas communiqué afin qu'il n'y ait pas de représailles.</p>

<p>Je vous prie de bien tenir compte de mon message et j'espère que vous pourriez faire quelque chose pour moi,</p>
<p>Cordialement.</p>

<p>Bonjour ,</p>
<p>Déjà la délation est interdite ici donc le modérateur va masqué son gamertag.... eh oui</p>
<p>Ensuite bloque la communication, met lui une appréciation négative et vu que tu as déjà porté plainte (sur la console je présume?) dit a tes amis de le faire aussi !</p>

<p>Salut,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tu as donc hélas perdu ton temps en postant ici car le support téléphonique dans son infinie incompétence semble de surcroît ignorer :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Que la délation est interdite sur les forums Xbox. </li><li>Qu'il n'y a aucun support officiel sur les forums locaux. </li></ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Donc lorsque le support technique te dirige vers les forums, il faut comprendre les forums US (oui c'est induit hein...), tu peux prendre connaissance de ce
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/26/t/19139.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
post</a> du support officiel&nbsp;qui détaille comment procéder dans le cas que tu décris.</p>

<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ATTENTION : l'incitation&nbsp;au dépots&nbsp;de plaintes infondées est&nbsp;passible de sanction, infondées car tes amis ne subissent, (peut-être), pas de harcèlement de la part de cette personne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Donc, comme conseillé par les autres contributeurs de ce topic, il faut bloquer les communications avec cette personne, j'ajouterais qu'il faut absolument éviter de répondre de quelque manière que ce soit aux messages de cette personne.</p>
<p>Enfin, d'éviter toute possibilité de contacts avec cet individu autant que possible, inutile par exemple de l'avoir dans sa liste d'amis et/ou d'accepter des invitations de sessions dans lesquelles il est.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p><p>I have a problem using the Xbox One Wireless Controller + Wireless Adapter on my PC. Here is what happened so far... The controller worked for almost a year now without any problems.</p><p>Some time ago&nbsp;I updated my Win10 and a couple of weeks after that I tried to play a game with my Xbox One Wireless Controller. However the Controller couldn't connect to the wireless adapter anymore. So I tried to update my drivers using&nbsp;the 'Xbox Accessories' App. It recognized the Controller and started the update via the wireless connection. Unfortunately the update process was interrupted and failed to finish successfully.&nbsp;</p><p>I tried again, but the App can't recognize the controller anymore. At the moment&nbsp;I can connect the controller to the wireless adapter&nbsp; (the lights don't flash anymore and indicate a valid&nbsp;connection). The wireless adapter is recognized by windows and seems to work properly. However the controller is neither recognized by windows (ca

            Hi pcpilot,<br />
<br />
First at all... Ctrl is not necessary in that combination... Alt+PrtScn is responsible for catching active window. (I understand this is not a laptop, and you don't have additional Fn key).<br />
<br />
Can you check something... Try to use On-screen keyboard: Press <strong>WinKey+R</strong> &gt; type
<strong>osk</strong> and press enter &gt; Select some window &gt; After that select On-Screen Keyboard window &gt; click from there:
<strong>Alt</strong> (it should highlight it), and click <strong>Print Screen</strong> &gt; Open some graphic editor and check what you are going to paste.<br />
<br />
Does the Alt+PrtScn work with On-Screen Keyboard?<br />
<br />
Windows 7 also contains one additional way to a catch print screen: Press <strong>
Start</strong> &gt; <strong>All Programs</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessories</strong> &gt; <strong>
Snipping Tool</strong> &gt; Pressing an arrow next to the <strong>New</strong> button you can select the type of the snipping.

It might be the reason... at least is worth to check how it behaves without KVM switch, if you have such a possibility.<br />
