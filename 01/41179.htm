<h2>            Gesture not working after Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone, after my Asus Q553 laptop went through the creativity update, i realized i could no longer scroll, right click using two fingers, or basically use more than one finger with my touchpad as i was able to do before. I have attempted a simple restart,
 also i decided to modify and fix the smart gesture application, and completely uninstall and reinstall it using the installer on the Asus website, however nothing has worked. I don't know of any other options that could fix it. The program is installed and
 I see a process in the task manager from the Asus smart Gesture, ("Asus Smart Gesture Loader"), but the icon on the task bar at the bottom of my computer is missing which shows how many fingers are being used on the touchpad at a time. Also, the touchpad refuses
 to disable from pressing fn+f9 which is supposed to toggle it on and off. How can I fix this problem?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why you are unable to do some activities after the Creators Update. To resolve this issue, we recommend that you go back to your previous version of Windows. Kindly visit this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and click on <strong>Go back to your previous version of Windows</strong> to see the steps. After that, try to check if the gestures are working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you do have any other concerns.</p>

            <p>I had this problem too.</p>
<p>To solve this i went to the asus support page https://www.asus.com/support.</p>
<p>I entered my model number, selected my model in the list the site gave me and then i went to the support tab (button in the upper-right corner near overview and specs.).</p>
<p>There i clicked on the "driver &amp; tools" tab and specified my precise model number and my os (you can find these infos by right clicking on the windows start menu button and then on "system").</p>
<p>At this point, you should get a list with little (-) buttons in front of each item.</p>
<p>Before doing anything else here, please check the version of "ATK package " installed on your computer.</p>
<p>(to check this, open the windows start menu and click on the gear on the left side, then click on "applications" and scroll down until you find "ATK Package" click on that and it will reveal the version number just below the program name).</p>
<p>Now you can go back to the web page and click on the (-) button in front of "touch pad". You should see something like this "<span>ASUS Smart Gesture (Touchpad Driver) &nbsp;[Please
 update ATK Package V1.0.0020 or later in advance]".</span></p>
<p><span>If the version number specified in this line is higher than the one you saw just before, please reply to this message.</span></p>
<p><span>But if the version number specified in this line is lower, you are lucky and you can click on "Global", download and save the file.</span></p>
<p><span>If it doesn't promt you where you want to save the file it will likely save it in your "download" folder. (if not reply to this message)</span></p>
<p><span>When the download is over, open the folder your download is in and double click and the file wich should be named something like this "</span>SmartGesture_Win10_64_VER409"<span>.</span></p>
<p><span>If it prompts you to choose a program to open this with, just select windows explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>Then click on "extraction" and/or "extract all". (just over the folder path)</span></p>
<p><span>Now double click on "setup".</span></p>
<p><span>The next step is to choose the "Repair ASUS Smart Gesture" option in the freshly opened window and click "finish".</span></p>
<p><span>If you get any error message post it as a reply here.</span></p>
<p><span>When setup is complete it should ask you to restart your computer. Do so directly (click "yes") or remember to do it later and click "no".</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem persists after restarting your computer, please tell me.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>p.s. Since this is my first post on</span> "answers.microsoft.com<span>" please consider telling
 me wether or not this was too detailed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>p.p.s. I usually speak french so sorry for any misspelling or grammar mistake.</span></p>

            <p>I actual figured out how to fix it last night. I did try downloading the ATK package before but that did not work. For those who are still having the issue, this is what I did:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first searched "update device drivers" or "driver manager" from the cortana search bar. When that opened, go down to mice and other pointing devices. Now, here, you SHOULD see one listing underneath it that says "ASUS Touchpad." In my case, it did not
 show. You are going to have to determine which listing (if you have multiple) is working with the touchpad or a mouse if you had use one prior. It may say something along the lines of "ASUS Support Device." If this is your case, right click on the driver,
 and select "update driver", but select to browse for drivers on your computer, not automatically. Then select "Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer." Here you should be able to select "ASUS Touchpad". There may be multiple so just select
 the most recent. </p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point you should regain 2 finger right click gesture and the smart gesture icon should reappear in your dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If everything works again, great! However if ASUS smart gesture is still not recognizing gestures, even though it is in the dock, continue reading.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I uninstalled Asus smart gesture by going into the settings--&gt;apps--&gt;Asus smart gesture--&gt;uninstall. I found the Asus smart gesture software on the Asus support page and downloaded that. HOWEVER PREVIOUSLY TO INSTALLING THE ASUS SMART GESTURE
 SOFTWARE, you are going to need to go into program files and delete (or move) the remaining program files for the smart gesture software out of the program files folder. These should be located in This PC--&gt;OS (C:)--&gt;Program Files (x86)--&gt;ASUS--&gt;ASUS Smart
 Gesture. I recommend moving the entire folder into your documents instead of deleting it just in case. Just a reminder this occurs after you uninstall the original smart gesture software. At this point, you should be able to install the Asus smart gesture
 software you downloaded off of Asus' support page. After the computer reboots it should fix all issues with the gestures and your computer should be functioning normally again.

<p>Is your Windows Live Mail set to automatically compact? The default is every time the programme has been opened 100 times. To manually compact you change the 100 to 1 and close and reopen Windows Live Mail.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did you follow the steps provided in the earlier post?</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are you referring to Mail app?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide more information to assist you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot send outgoing mails from Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, the steps didn't work.</p>
<p>I am using Outlook 2010, My computer is an Acer, Aspire/V5 with an Intel Core i7 - 3537U CPU @ 2.50 GHz. 8.00GB of Ram and 64-bit Sys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Laptop came with a shadow of Microsoft 365 Home Premium which I loaded for a months trial.</p>
<p>I didn't like it because it didn't have Outlook as one of it's programs.&nbsp; So I decided not to use and tried to remove it from the Laptop.&nbsp; I've tried removing it 3 times without success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I loaded back up my licensed version of Office Home &amp; Business which had Outlook 2010 as part of the suite. However, my Outlook 2010 is fine for receiving emails bit will not send them even though I have correctly set up both of my receive (pop.ntlbusiness.com)
 and transmit (smtp.ntlbusiness.com)</p>
<p>settings.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I worked together with Virgin Media on this as I did with&nbsp;Norton (who supply my firewall and Anti-Virus software).&nbsp; They both&nbsp;said that&nbsp;the fault was in the area between&nbsp;Microsoft and Norton. The Fault I am getting is as follows:</p>
<p>Outlook sending error 421 reported error (0x800CC67) </p>
<p>The server responded: 421 aamtaout 02-winn,ispmail.ntl.com</p>
<p>connection refused from [95.69.95.6] (my outside IP address)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you in a position to advise me and help get this fault fixed?</p>
<p>I would be extremely grateful for any assistance you can give.</p>
<p>If it means a vendor meet to get it sorted then that's what we'll do</p>

<p><br />
There's no evidence of any fault. You are trying to access a VirginMedia SMTP server while connected to
</p>
<p>the Internet via a Portuguese mobile Internet service provider. VirginMedia will only allow this for authenticated users, and possibly not even then.
<br />
<br />
You will get best results using your ISP's SMTP server, but if you have good reason not to, try using smtp.virginmedia.com with authentication (full email address and password) and&nbsp;TLS on port 465. If you see an error message with these settings, please post
 it in its entirety.</p>

            Hi Rick.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />For USB drive not detected issue, first try steps here:  <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/solved-usb-device-not-recognized-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mspoweruser.com/solved-usb-device-not-r...</a>
<br />
<br /> Update your Chipset and USB drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, HP Serial Number, or Dell Service tag from the sticker on PC.
<br />
<br />  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />If no newer or this doesn't help, then go to the USB category in Device Manager, open each Enhanced, Hub and Host controller, from Driver tab select Roll back if available, or if not choose Uninstall.  
<br />
<br />If your keyboard and mouse are USB, first program the power button to effect the needed restart after Rolling back or uninstalling the driver.  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do to choose Shutdown. 
<br />
<br />Run the System File Checker from <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>.  If the SFC cannot repair broken files in 3 attempts, check the image file integrity using DISM from Step 10 of this checklist:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br /> You can check which Updates were installed just before this happened, then uninstall them at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History - look first for installed drivers.  Then you can hide these Updates using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened, then check for Updates using the Hide Updates Tool to block the Updates offered:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

    <title>Pre-installed Windows 7 Home Premium - OEM Keys - Retail keys - Keys - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Pre-installed Windows 7 Home Premium - OEM Keys - Retail keys - Keys on COA label on bottom side of notebook.......MESS&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>In 2011 I purchased a MSI CX 640 notebook. Windows 7 Home Premium came with it and pre-installed. With that I would think I had purchase a license to the operating system and the right to use and re-install it if I so required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last four years this tinkerer has gone through many configuration on the laptop, including Linux, Windows 8 and 8.1 and Windows 10 Technical Preview&nbsp; etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fast forward to today and I learn of the offer from Microsoft of a free Windows 10 copy for owners of genuine copies of Windows 7. So, all I have to do is go back to the original genuine Windows 7 Home Premium I own and I will be able to reserve my copy
 of Windows 10, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not so fast, accomplishing that might not and certainly turned out not to be so simple at all.
</p>
<p>I have had multiple long phone calls with Microsoft, who finally dumped the hot potato in the hands of MSI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSI&nbsp; I need to say was helpful at first, they sent me for free and quickly the 2 recovery disks I needed that SHOULD have allowed me too go back to square one just as I wanted.</p>
<p>Should but actually did not. The recovery fails with an error that seem to imply the process is looking for a non existent disk 3. MSI is stumped, all they have are those disks and the simple instructions they send with them. Beyond that they are totally
 in the dark and "don't want to go to the dark".</p>
<p>
</p><p>One representative however, suggested that if I could get my hands on an OEM copy of the operating system I certainly would be able to install it and use the key I have on the bottom COA label of my MSI notebook to activate it. Sound logical I think, so
 I go to work on it. Another detail I have to mention is that tht key on the COA label is kind of worn like they all are sitting unprotected a.t the bottom. But I can take a high resolution photo and with some digital magic improve it to a point where hopefully
 I can read almost all of it and try to guess at the characters that are still in questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or so I thought, in reality it is not working which leave 2 possibilities.</p>
<p>I am either not guessing right (possible but not probable in my opinion, after all the tries I had) or that is NOT an OEM key or if it were has now been canceled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am also guessing that is NOT a retail key, tried that with a retail copy of the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So where does all this leave poor me, owner of a Windows 7 genuine Home Premium license I apparently cannot use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope one of you readers can help me figure that out and I hope my work and tribulations (I am a very determined guy) can also help some of you in this if you are also in my shoes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One final comment from the common sense me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I buy a product, be it OEM, retail, or gift of God I SHOULD receive with it all the licenses, numbers, keys, permissions, instructions, ten commandments necessary to have access to that product at any time and without hassles.</p>
<p>That seem to apply to most of our purchases doesn't it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOT TO THIS ONE OBVIOUSLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; MICROSOFT??????????</p>

            <p>Why not just reinstall Windows 8.1 or simply use the opportunity to upgrade from the Preview of Windows 10 to the final release for free.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will I be able to upgrade from the Windows 10 Insider Preview to the final release?
</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you will be able to upgrade from the Windows Insider Preview to the RTM build for free.</p>
<p>Company officials have noted though if you join the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso-update?os=win10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Latest confirmation:</p>
<span>
<p>When asked if there would be a cut off date for Insiders before Windows 10 reached RTM, Microsoft's Gabriel Aul stated that preview builds would continue being delivered up until the final release.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"We expect to keep flighting builds to Insiders all the way up to RTM. More details to come, but no cutoff planned."</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>After upgrading, you can switch to the Stable Channel. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, your best option is to get retail Windows 7 Home Premium media and use the COA key to reinstall and reactivate. Learn more:</p>

    <title>disable authentication&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> irinashanko - philips van buren  say:</h3>
<h2>            disable authentication&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We just upgraded to Win10. But this upgrade destroyed the authentication settings we managed to establish in Win8.1. Now we can't get it to work anymore. The case is that we have 3 computers in a small "office" network, all behind the same router/firewall.
 One of these 3 computers runs a mailserver servicing the entire "network". But since we installed Win10, none of the other computer can access their mailboxes anymore. Neither are their calendars updated. Because they cannot connect to the one machine that
 runs the server! The problem is the authentication process. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever we try, everytime we get an authentication error. What on earth changed from win8.1 to Win10?? Since we are all behind the same firewall and IP-address we would like to disable the entire authentication process. There really is no need for such
 a "feature" for 3 computers standing in the same room, a few feet away from eachother. Home Group is not&nbsp;the answer for us because it is limited to sharing only certain files. It does NOT allow us to connect to the&nbsp;mailboxes on the server, nor does it update
 the calendar on the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously the Microsoft people live in an entirely different World than the rest of us cosmopolitans. At least Microsoft could implement
<strong>an option</strong> to disable the the authentication between computers within the same local network, behind the same router, using the same domain and the same IP-address. It seems that Microsoft's motto has become:
</p>
<p>"why make it easy for our customers when we can make difficult..."</p>

    <title>Windows 10 No Internet Access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timewarrior66  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 No Internet Access</h2>
                    <p>Hello, so recently I built a new computer 2 months ago or so and worked perfectly fine could connect to the web all that fun stuff. Then today, out of the blue I couldn't connect, at all. Network troubleshooting said 'ethernet' doesn't have a valid ip address
 or something along those lines. I have followed many guides to try and rectify the situation and nothing. The guide on this link (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues) I have followed step by step and it seems
 to work mostly fine, but certain steps like even resetting ipv4 and ipv6 tells me it fails and access is denied. Even using 'ipconfig /renew' I get an error. It's something like "An error occurred while renewing interface Ethernet: an attempt was made to access
 a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions". Now I would also like to point out that when I first turn on the computer during user login there is network access but the moment I log in the internet stops on it. A window pops up saying something
 about access to a socket is denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And before anyone asks if I turned stuff off and on again. Yes, I have. The router/modem is fine as all the phones in my home are connected and using it fine, the other laptop and desktop in the home are connected, the PS4, roku player, and smart tv are
 all connected to it, even the 3DS is connected to the network but the computer isn't. This issue is perplexing me. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>About your issue, have you tried putting the internet cable in your PC to other devices just to check if it is working? Because the issue is your PC is looking for an IP address so it means you don't have a connection or your modem is not giving connection

            It wasn't the wire. it was something wrong with the OS. After trying every solution I could find, I finally decided to reset Windows 10, despite not wanting to reinstall every program. But It was the OS itself. So, problem..... solved....?.....<br />

</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Run the System File Checker tool</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></p>

<p><span>Type the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2: Run the Microsoft Safety Scanner.</span></strong></p>

                    <p>I do not wish to change to Edge, I am happy with Google Chrome which has always been stable on my pc until the last updates to Windows 10 were made recently.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I am prompted every time I switch between sessions to choose Edge over Google Chrome.&nbsp; This
 is bordering on harassment and certainly not serving its customers well.&nbsp; Because I have disabled Edge, Google Chrome keeps crashing (not responding) &nbsp;on Windows 10 to the point that I can almost no longer function on this pc.&nbsp; Please does anyone have a solution?&nbsp;
 I will not be bullied into changing my web browser.&nbsp; Best Wishes</p>

<h2>            Reconnecting - your connection is poor</h2>
                    <p>I am using MacOS "High Sierra" version 10.13.1; the "new" Skype version 8.10.0.4 and voice calling version 2017.22.01.54</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am traveling in a country with poor internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a short length of time during video calling a continuous dark grey box in the middle of my video screen is displayed, which says "Reconnecting - your connection is poor". &nbsp;This box cannot be moved, accepted or deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I have found to remove the box is to restart Skype. &nbsp;This notification box reappears a short time later after the restart. &nbsp;Is there another way to move or remove this continuous notification other than a restart? &nbsp;I know the connection is poor,
 I don't need a continuous reminder.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Max,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you’ve encountered regarding the <strong>Fresh Paint </strong>is may be caused by some files or components that are missing on the system. To sort out your concern, we’d like to know the following information:
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>On what particular activity did you encounter the issue?</li><li>Were there any changes that happened prior to the issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li><li>For clarification, what is the make and model of your device?</li><li>Which version of Windows are you using?</li><li>Have you installed the latest update on your computer?<br />
</li></ul>
<p><br />
To check for the latest update, go to<strong> Windows Update</strong> by clicking
<strong>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security </strong>and click <strong>Check for updates</strong>. It will scan and install all the latest updates available for your device.<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Note: </strong>You may check the version of Windows that you are using by clicking
<strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>Winver</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</em><br />
<br />
On the other hand, we suggest that you reset the <strong>Windows Store</strong> app. This process will reboot the program to its working state and help the app related to the program to work properly. To do this, you may click
<strong>Start</strong>, type <em><strong>WSReset</strong></em> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>. Once it’s done, the Store app will open, and then check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Additionally, you may turn off <strong>Use a proxy server </strong>from the <strong>
Settings</strong>. This setup will connect the app directly to the Internet to avoid having connectivity or loading issue.<br />
<br />
We're looking forward to your response. <br />
</p>
        </p>

<p>I'm having this issue too. My Windows is up to date and I've reset the Windows Store to no avail. &nbsp;If I go into settings I already have use a proxy server turned off.</p>

<p>I am having the same issue. Re-installed the app and did the store reset thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening on all my Windows 10 computers that have been updated. They are all up to date and have all the latest builds and the 'Inspire Me' tab has disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume it is something MS have done to the app or something like that if that's the only thing a lot of people are experiencing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any chance it can be restored in the app?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

 HP sent me to a MS Fix It and did what they recommended in the registry by deleting an exe entry and retried the HP install and got the same error.&nbsp; Everything else on my PC works fine just can't get this new printer to install fully.&nbsp; HP says it’s my OS problem

<p>Usually all you have to do is pause the slide show by hitting the space bar, and then the backspace key and it will show you the file you paused on, in wlpg you have to click on return to gallery but it will still show you that file.</p>

<h2>            Acer Aspire S7 upgade to Windows 10 fails</h2>
                    <p>Over the lat few months I have tried several times to upgrade my Acer Aspire S7 to Windows 10. Today another 2 times, to see whether I could get it to work. All the initial work, including downloading and preparation works fine. Then The circle of the real
 upgrade comes up and nicely counts unto 75%. Then it does a reboot that crashes, and does a restore to Windows 8, which goes flawless.</p>
<p>Anybody the same experience? Anybody an idea what to do to solve this?</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting back the results.</div>
<div><br />
I suggest that you download the Windows 10 ISO image from the following link and then try to install Windows 10.
<br />

<div><br />
Before installing Windows 10,<br />
1.&nbsp;Disconnect any external devices attached to the machine like gaming controllers, USB keys, external hard disk, printers, non-essential devices etc,.<br />
2.&nbsp;Update all the drivers on the system to avoid compatibility issues with Windows 10.</div>

            <p>As long as you file a complaint on those people, the enforcement team will investigate them and take action. However, if they are performing a denial of service attack that is done through your internet and not Live (you would need to alert your ISP). So unless they've actually done something over Live, the enforcement team cannot ban them.</p>

            <p>I had serious repeated problems with Microsoft doing updates and turning my PC off without warning, or sometimes without waiting until the weekend.</p>
<p>I complained through March 2016 (last 13 March) and warned them of legal action, due to losses in my Forex trades which run 24/7.</p>
<p>There has now been no auto-upgrade since mid May, BUT my PC shut down on 6 June, between 6.00p.m. and 9.00 pm Brisbane Australia time, as though there had been an upgrade/shutdown.</p>
<p>Utterly frustrating, and I have no clue yet as to how this happened.</p>

<p>Previously I had Windows 7 Ultimate x64. FIFA 14 ran smoothly on it. Now I have installed Windows 8 x64, but it does not run the app. It says that msvcr100.dll is missing, though it is present. It have re installed MS Visual C++ Redistributable x64 but nothing
 happens. I pasted the msvcr100 in fifa directory and ran the app. It then gave a 0x000007b error. I re installed the app several times with different dvds but it gives the same error always. Please give a solution as soon as possible.

            <p>Hi Sahwez, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the steps that you have tried to resolve the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>From where exactly have you install MS Visual C++ Redistributable x64? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try uninstalling Visual C++ and reinstalling the&nbsp;latest Visual C++ version and check if it helps. Also make sure that you install all the latest updates through Windows Updates. After installing these updates, you may go ahead and
 install the program to see if that helps.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Uninstall Visual C++:</p>
<p><br />
a. Locate and then remove the existing <strong>Visual C++ </strong>installation. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: There are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.<br />
<br />
b. In <strong>Control Panel</strong>, open the <strong>Programs and Features </strong>
item. To do this, click Start, type appwiz.cpl in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
c. Locate <strong>Microsoft Visual C++ </strong>in the list of <strong>installed programs</strong>.<br />
d. Click <strong>Microsoft Visual C++, </strong>and then click <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Step 2: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try to download and install MS Visual C ++ Redistributable x64 from this article provided.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>64Bit: Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x64)&nbsp; </strong>

<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, let's check if there is any corrupted system files present on the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: <br />
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also run SFC scan to check if there is any system corrupted files.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not find any errors while running SFC scan, you may try to install FIFA 14 in clean boot state to cancel out all the cause of third party conflicts.

            Hi Hitesj.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />A Pentium is a somewhat weaker processor that probably cannot benefit much by increasing RAM to the optimal 6-8gb, although you can consider that option by running the Crucial Memory Scanner to see what your upgrade options are:  <a href="http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/</a>.  But even if you double the RAM you might see the Resource Monitor max out the CPU with only a fraction of RAM being used, and you want these more in balance.  Examine those graphs now to get familiar.  
<br />
<br />It becomes more important than ever that you have the best possible install of Windows 10.  What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />You can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />On that system the 32bit version of Windows 10 would be much faster, the processor would handle it better and with 4GB of RAM it would be ideal . . .

            Hi hitesj6a
<br />
<br />By default MS Office installs the 32bit version regardless of Windows Bit type, it would be very rare for MS Office to be installed in 64bit
<br />
<br />On your Desktop, open a new file in Word, then go to File - Account - About Word
<br />
<br />At the top of the resulting dialog, is it the 32bit or 64bit version of Office installed?
<br />
<br />Either way, 32bit/64bit Office will be compatible in most cases, with the very rare exception in some very complex Excel and Access files . . .

<br />
<br />Then yes, in all honesty you should backup your data and clean install the 32bit version of Windows. This will mean you will need to also re-install all 3rd party software including Office, but it will be worth it in terms of performance . . .

            <p>Hi again, I've actually found a workaround. its not a solution to the issue by any means but it works for what i require.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i leave my SDXC card in my camera and then transfer my photos via usb directly from the camera to my computer the SDXC card works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue must be something to do with windows 8.1 not fully not being able to read SDXC cards via an external or internal card reader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its a pretty basic function that really should not be an issue this day and age, im aware many others are having the same problem after updating to windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had i not found this workaround i would be pretty damn angry now with Microsoft for messing up such a basic function - Adam</p>
