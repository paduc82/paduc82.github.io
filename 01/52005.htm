<h2>            Task Host is stopping background task</h2>
                    <p>Recently, using Windows 10, when I power off I get the Task Host Window.<br />
Message:&nbsp;Task Host is stopping background task (\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceDirectoryClient\RegisterUserDevice)</p>
<p>I have to click Shut Down Anyway.</p>
<p>Don't know if this is a "feature" of the last update, but have seen the shutdown bug posted for older O/S..</p>
<p>What is the fix?</p>

</p><p>It seems that there's a background app that prevents you to shutdown the system. It may not be exactly the Task Host itself, of if ever, we may suspect that&nbsp; this Task Host is completely related to any background program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the things that you can try to Isolate the problem:</p>

</p><p><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows 10">PerformClean
 boot</a></span></p>&nbsp;- At this boot state, your system will only run important Microsoft services and drivers. Thus, it also disables Microsoft application that are not necessary for the system to run.&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>You can also try to perform <strong>Power Troubleshooter</strong>:&nbsp; Go to <em>
<strong>Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Power</strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please understand that the steps are like to help us isolate the issue. These are yet to be the concrete fix, but should help.&nbsp;<em>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform
 me by replying to this post.</em></p>

<p>Marc Cai,</p>
<p>ran Troubleshoot for Power and no problem was displayed.<br />
Decided to run Troubleshoot for several other options.</p>
<p>When running Troubleshoot for Store App, saw a quick display about bout changing Temporary files.</p>
<p>Then it just ran for a long time, as if in an endless loop.&nbsp; Thus I cancelled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only "Apps" I use is the Calendar and Solitaire Collection (which now and then put up and Ad that states I can avoid the Ad by "Tapping Here", but I use mouse and have to Click which does not eliminate the Ads).</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW If I follow Microsoft agents recommendation to do a clean install are there procedures in place where I can a compensation to repurchase the software that came with the PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most all, thanks for your effort to solve the problem.</p>
<p><span>Still getting shutdown message.</span></p>

<p>It appears the source of the problem is Portable Device (phone ZTE Z820).<br />
Tried to update the driver, but after 45 minutes (as lengthy as the Troubleshooter).</p>
<p>I could not Cancel, X (Close), or close from Task Bar.<br />
Had to use Task Manager to end/close window.<br />
Driver date: 6-21-2006<br />
Version: 10.0.16299.15<br />
Signer: Microsoft Windows.<br />
See picture for Events.<br />
BTW it would help if the Error Message identified the device.</p>

<p>Thanks for the update, and I'm sorry about the long delay. It seems you've isolated the issue quite well. But can you tell us if you tried to update the dongle driver via Device Manager? If so, we're afraid that the method will not completely work with the
 device since it will check only the Microsoft server for recommended drivers. Since it did not work, please check the device's website, for they should have the up-to-date and branded driver for the exact device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you successfully downloaded the driver and installed it, please feel free to update us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the installation freezes, please try to install it <em>on clean boot</em> state:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows</span></em></a>.</p>

Tried to update the driver, using the Device manager, but after 45 minutes (as lengthy as the Troubleshooter) all I got was as far as the Searching window and the progress bar continuously moving.</span><br />
I will check the device web site and post my finding.</p>

<p>Marc Cai,<br />
I am still working toward a solution.<br />
In doing so, I have become aware that when I connect the Z820 to the PC using USB that I get a sound notification but NO display/visual notification.&nbsp;<br />
I have to verify the connection using File Manager.</p>
<p>Also, when I r-click on the Z820 device I Do NOT get an option to eject the device as I do with a flash drive.
</p>
<p>I can read/write to the portable device. Its as if Windows is connect to the portable device but not connected (in certain instances). It's Looking more like a Microsoft problem than the device manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: 9/8<br />
Cannot find updated driver.<br />
I get the Task Host message whether I attach Z820 or not.&nbsp; I get the "error" message every time I shutdown.<br />
Hope Microsoft can find a solution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marc,</p>
<p>the Z820 was just the symptom of the problem. The initial indication arose when I tried to play a video on the Z820. I have since found using Troubleshoot that there was a conflict (2) updates for compatibility for PowerDVD program.<br />
I am now at the stage that I cannot uninstall PowerDVD, either using Setting/Applications (#1) or Control Panel Program (#2). Nor can I run File Compare to compare the files installed on the problem computer with another computer (#3) for which it runs OK.
 I can open PowerDVD from short cut or directly (via File Manager) but it does nothing but refresh it's screen. In addition, I cannot reinstall the program over existing program. The Install Shield Wizard display "The system cannot find the path specified".</p>
<p>Seems similar to the what's encountered using DOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there<strong> ANY</strong> way to remove the current program?<br />
I hope you can suggest how to handle this one program problem without having to involve all the other programs because of one program.</p>

            Hi Alan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The syntax is wrong on the command to unlock the built-in Administrator as there is no space before the forward slash.  Follow the steps below which put that repair in context of recovering lost Admin rights, likely due to account corruption.
<br />
<br />If you have lost Admin rights then try these steps leading up to if necessary creating a new Local Account which sometimes is the only way to escape Account Corruption in Windows 10:  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Run box, copy and paste in netplwiz, press Enter.
<br />
<br />Highlight your account, then click Properties, then Group Membership tab.  click on Administrator, then Apply, OK, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try this:  <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrative-rights-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrati...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try taking ownership of the affected files or folders to see if this suffices.  Use this handy tool that adds Take Ownership shortcut to your right click context menu:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing helps try creating a new Local Admin Account to sign into to see if it works:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If you can't get the rights to do this then use whichever method works here to enable the hidden Built-in Administrator to be used only in emergencies:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a> 
<br />
<br />It may be necessary to create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC to access the Command Prompt without needing a password:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Startup Options, first try System Restore to a point before this.  If that fails then choose Command Prompt to follow the step above to access Built-in Admin Account.
<br />
<br />Sign into Hidden Admin account, see if you can use netplwiz now to elevate the account.  If not try another of these methods: <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-account-type-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then set up a new Local Admin Account, sign into it, move your files over, set it up, hide the Hidden Admin Account, when ready delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello my name is Brad and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I wanted to assist fixing your issues with restoring access to your system. 
<br />
<br />Before you run this tool, PLEASE create a backup of your registry and System Restore point. 
<br />**This is a dangerous procedure so please proceed with caution** 
<br />
<br />To reset your permissions, you need to do the following: 
<br />
<br />1. Download the "SubInACL" tool directly from Microsoft at this link: 
<br /><code><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a></code>
<br />2. Run the setup and install "SubInACL" tool. 
<br />3. After doing that, go to the C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Resource Kits\Tools\ directory. 
<br />
<br />4. Create a new "Notepad" file there and paste the following code: 
<br /><pre><code>subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE /grant=administrators=f
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CURRENT_USER /grant=administrators=f
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT /grant=administrators=f
subinacl /subdirectories %SystemDrive% /grant=administrators=f
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE /grant=system=f
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CURRENT_USER /grant=system=f
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT /grant=system=f
subinacl /subdirectories %SystemDrive% /grant=system=f</code></pre>
<br />
<br />5. Click "File" &gt; "Save as" in Notepad. 
<br />6. Now set the save location to <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Resource Kits\Tools\ </code>
<br />7. Set Save as type to "All Files". Enter <code>reg_fix.bat</code> as the file name. 
<br />8. Now click the Save button. 
<br />9. Now start Command Prompt as administrator and type <code>cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Resource Kits\Tools\</code> and press enter 
<br />10. After you switch to the Tools directory, enter<code> reg_fix.bat</code> and press Enter. 
<br />
<br />If you are able to complete the process successfully this should resolve the permissions errors, please let me know if this helps.       
        </p>

</p><p>I a a bit green on some computer issues as i have never had so many problems with a computer...I suppose all this New Tech might not be as good as the old days mate..Anyway this is where i am at,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Download the "SubInACL" tool directly from Microsoft at this link:&nbsp;</span><br />
<code><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a></code><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>DONE</strong></span><br />
<span>2. Run the setup and install "SubInACL" tool.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<strong>DONE</strong></span><br />
<span>3. After doing that, go to the C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Resource Kits\Tools\ directory.
<strong>DONE - Opens CDM</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span>4. Create a new "Notepad" file there and paste the following code:&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>NOT SURE HOW TO DO THIS</strong></span><br />
</p>
<pre><code>subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE /grant=administrators=f
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CURRENT_USER /grant=administrators=f
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT /grant=administrators=f
subinacl /subdirectories %SystemDrive% /grant=administrators=f
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE /grant=system=f
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CURRENT_USER /grant=system=f
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT /grant=system=f
subinacl /subdirectories %SystemDrive% /grant=system=f</code></pre>
<p><br />
<br />
<span>5. Click "File" &gt; "Save as" in Notepad.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>6. Now set the save location to&nbsp;</span><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Resource Kits\Tools\&nbsp;</code><br />
<span>7. Set Save as type to "All Files". Enter&nbsp;</span><code>reg_fix.bat</code><span>&nbsp;as the file name.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>8. Now click the Save button.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>9. Now start Command Prompt as administrator and type&nbsp;</span><code>cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Resource Kits\Tools\</code><span>&nbsp;and press enter&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>10. After you switch to the Tools directory, enter</span><code>&nbsp;reg_fix.bat</code><span>&nbsp;and press Enter.&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p>Clicking "Try again" brings up the same message. The only other option is "Close." There is no error code or number.</p>

<h3> 5mith90  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keys &#91;1, 2, A, Z &#38; X &#93; not functioning</h2>
                    <p>Several times the keys would stop and resume functioning where signing out and back in would solve the issue. But now it's done for.</p>
<p>The system <strong>does</strong> detect when I press the keys but doesn't show any output or respond the way it should.</p>
<p>I know this because the keys on their own do nothing but pressed together type out something else entirely.</p>
<p>Example pressing 'Z,X,A &amp; Backspace' together types out 'd/'. Other combinations exist. Anyways... I also happened to accidentally delete the keyboard driver and cant find it anywhere online (Asus k45vd laptop). Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S: I had to type this whole thing with the on-screen keyboard =/</p>

            You can try updating the BIOS, if you havent from the ASUS site, <a href="https://www.asus.com/Laptops/K45VD/HelpDesk_Download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.asus.com/Laptops/K45VD/HelpDesk_Dow...</a>
<br />I did not see the driver for the keyboard. You can try to scan for hardware changes in device manager. It should find the driver also after a reboot it should be detected. If it not working with a driver installed, it can be the actual keyboard that is not working.

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t load certain things anything.</h2>
                    <p>Sorry if it's posted in the wrong forum.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the title states, for some reason, Windows just appears to refuse to work on the laptop I primarily use. The laptop (An Acer from approx. 4 years ago) managed to upgrade fine, no problems until today. I restarted the computer because of something (I honestly
 forgot) and it loaded up a black screen with only the mouse cursor showing after the startup process.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the method I learned a while back (The bogus monitor fix), and it literally broke my resolution settings, not to mention that anything I opened up refused to show up properly (as in, I could see it in the taskbar, but nothing would show up on the
 desktop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't want to go get a new computer or anything like that, anyone know a useful fix for this? Also, as a note, it appears to be the Bogus Monitor thing (I have my laptop hooked up to an Envision monitor).</p>

<h2>            Unlimited World Subscription changed to Unlimited Belgium subscription</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Unlimited World subscription was changed without any notice from Skype or request from my side, to a Unlimited Belgium subscription and this while the same price is maintained, hence less for the same money!</p>
<p>Can you re-instate the Word unlimited subscription that I had for years now?</p>
<p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>In addition to this issue, I also get "windows explorer" (explorer.exe) and sometimes " Internet Explorer" &nbsp;(iexplorer.exe) "has stop working errors" and whenever I watch TV (be it Clear QAM, OTA or Analog Cable) it goes BSOD after about 3 minutes.
 All my devices/latest drivers are recognized by 7 RTM (Ultimate) based from the device manager window and their properties and I have all the updates including the latest installed. I am running out of ideas and is getting ready to go back to XP unless someone
 here can help me figure this out. By the way, playing mp3's also crashes my system.............. Thanks.</strong></p>

<p>I decide to go back to my&nbsp;old reliable XP Pro and&nbsp;submitting this post now. I didn't touch any hardware or change any settings in BIOS and yet of course, NO BSOD's. I think 7 has an issue making old hardware work in it's environment despite recognizing them
 and having "native"&nbsp;drivers for them or recognizing the drivers from manufacturers using the search prompt. (I didn't have to use the "compatibility wizard" though). I guess I would&nbsp;have to build a new system with all hardware Windows 7 certified.&nbsp;I wasted&nbsp;a
 little over 2 weeks trying to make this work and now back to XP..... On the other hand, my laptop which originally came with Vista is&nbsp;running on&nbsp;7 flawlessly. Of&nbsp;course&nbsp;all it's hardware are Vista certified so&nbsp;no issue there.....&nbsp;Anyway, thanks for responding.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
P.S. Memory test by the way, showed no error whatsoever......<br />

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Kernel Data Inpage Error</h2>
                    <p>For a couple of days now, I've gotten the blue screen with Kernel Data Inpage Error (spaceport.sys). I spent time searching around for solutions and found I need to provide the DMP files, which I've located, but I'm currently on a separate computer posting
 this as my affected computer will usually shut down a few minutes after Windows boots up (if it even does), so it may be a while until I can upload the links. but is there anything I can do in the meantime to help fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

Be sure to check with the System Maker's Support (Motherboard Maker for custom<br />
systems), their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums (if any)<br />
about any known issues. Be sure to update the<strong> BIOS, low level chipset drivers,
<br />
and the other major on-board and separate device drivers</strong>. Those alone may
<br />
resolve some or all of these issues.<br />

<strong>BCCode: 7A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000007A</strong><br />
<br />
The primary causes of this error are virus/malware, drivers, memory, and disk corruption. And there can even be combinations of those so a thorough check of all is required. Added possible causes are hardware errors such as damaged motherboard or other hardware.

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update&nbsp;all drivers and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView -&nbsp;set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names (and BIOS and chipset drivers).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created
 the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version
 info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure
 it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all
 memory tests fail to show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Minidump is of no help so you will need to perform all the methods in my previous<br />
reply.<br />
<br />
<div>BugCheck 7A, {fffff6fb400000b0, ffffffffc000000e, 86251880, fffff68000016000}</div>
<div>Probably caused by : ntkrnlmp.exe ( nt! ?? ::FNODOBFM::`string'+1b96b )</div>
<br />
ntkrnlmp.exe is a Windows component which means something else drove it into Fault.<br />
<br />
=======================================================<br />
<br />
McAfee could well be the cause or be involved in this issue.<br />
<br />
BTW I would uninstall McAfee and then run its maker's Removal Tool to prevent trouble<br />
causing remnants. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus<br />
and despite all the hype out there it is a true superstar (as is the Windows Firewall).<br />
<br />

<p>Compré el juego Call of Duty Black Ops II y al descargarlo mas o menos al 60% sale error de "No es posible descargar" y lo quita del menú de las descargas, &nbsp;intento descargarlo de nuevo pero sale error otra vez. &nbsp;Llevo así una semana y no puedo. &nbsp;Ya desconecté
 la consola de la fuente y de todos lados pero nada. &nbsp;Reviso en el DD y el juego esta ahí pero con icono de &nbsp;! &nbsp;en amarillo y 6Gb de 6.5Gb que debe pesar el juego, &nbsp;lo borro e intento de nuevo la descarga, llega al 60% y se detiene de nuevo. =/ &nbsp;Solicito de
 su ayuda por favor con esta desagradable situación.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ok</p>
<p>vuelve a buscar esa descarga en tu HDD</p>
<p>borrala si es que esta y tiene el circulo amarillo</p>
<p>ahora en las opciones de HDD busca borrar cache de a consola </p>
<p>borralo 3 veces </p>
<p>revisa una vez mas que no aparezca la descarga en tus juegos </p>
<p>intenta volver a descargarla</p>
<p>esta es la solucion a las descargas interrumpidas</p>
<p>otra cosa que tambien falla es que te pueda faltar una actualizacion a tu consola</p>
<p>muchas veces NO es la consola es tambien el proovedor de internet o tu modem que puede estar desconectando</p>
<p>tu HDD tiene capacidad suficiente para descargar el juego???</p>
<p>hay varias cosas pero empieza haciendo lo que te puse al principio</p>

<p>hey..! hello, Well yes to my suprise it did let me load a vers of xp on it, and at the moment i've managed to get . win 7 home premium sp1 on it.</p>
<p>while i was looking for support/downloads. i ran across some kind of "fix it" program. It diagnosed and offered a lot. and steered me towards HP site. i probable should have bought their service. i didnt hold it at the same value. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;i really was hoping that it would be much easier. the desktop guts were surprisingly very clean. and i needed just some thing that could connect to the web. and was atleast... well better than the Goodwill Electronics devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp; If you could help any ..Fantastic. but starting to think i might offer to donate it.</p>
<p>Im just currently not in a good enough economic state to do much. &nbsp; Although any help is apprieciated. &nbsp; THKS.&nbsp;

            <p>I've seen a few reports of this machine running Windows 7, but in order to get reasonable performance, you'll probably have to max out its RAM.&nbsp; Click the Start Orb, type msinfo32.exe and press Enter to see how much RAM is currently installed.&nbsp; This machine
 can take up to 4 GB of DDR PC2700 or PC3200 RAM.&nbsp; See <a href="http://www.hp.com/ecomcat/hpcatalog/specs/emeapsg/99/D530SERIES.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.hp.com/ecomcat/hpcatalog/specs/emeapsg/99/D530SERIES.pdf</a>&nbsp; and <a href="http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/compatible-upgrade-for/HP-Compaq/d530-series-all-form-factors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/compatible-upgrade-for/HP-Compaq/d530-series-all-form-factors</a></p>
<p>If it's running OK with the drivers built into Win 7, that's probably the best you can hope for.&nbsp; You can try looking at the web sites of the manufacturers of individual hardware components, but I doubt you'll find much, if anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't pay for any fix it or driver finder service.&nbsp; These usually cause more problems than they fix.</p>

</p><p>Based from your issue, it is highly possible that you are logging in to a different Skype account, it might be possible that you are logging in to a Skype-Microsoft account. Can you try to download this

<h2>            unexpected-store-extension</h2>
                    <p>I too have upgraded, from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and intermittently get this error message. My computer restarts in the ASUS screen but that means nothing to me. I can recover only by physically turning the computer off and on again. When I restart Windows
 10 beings to update and I think this only happens on Wednesdays (UK). Is it coincidence that this is usually upgrade day?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mote important, to a computer illiterate how can it be cured?</p>

            <p>Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a couple of links on using OneDrive (SkyDrive):</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time</p>

            <p>Hi ZigZag,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response!&nbsp; It seems to be most often associated with function of the Nvidia graphics card, though I'm sure you'll be able to tell me more with the info below.&nbsp;

            <p>Thank you both, but unfortunately the problem has persisted.&nbsp; After a restart, I opened NVIDIA GeForce Experience and the program froze, followed by BSOD.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to the latest BSOD Minidump:</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/u/s!AlRHsYmzhyy_ll8605-o1HzKnwtu</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloaded the appropriate files linked above from dell.&nbsp; Installed using a custom installation to ensure a "clean installation" of all NVidia components.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation showed success message, though this was the same version before and after the installation.&nbsp;
</p>

            <p>Still not resolved, thank you both for your patience and support here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've removed the device driver through Device Manager, and completed another clean installation using the most recent Dell NVIDIA drivers.&nbsp; I've also removed McAfee (would you recommend an alternative?). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a restart, the driver still reads as version 10.18.13.5923 (Date 12/21/2015).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try and recreate another BSOD, though it looks like everything is still the same.</p>

    <title>Taskbar, Display Settings, and Personalize Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> quinnredfield  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar, Display Settings, and Personalize Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I just updated my computer from Windows 7 to Windows 10, and now I cannot get the Start or Search buttons on my taskbar to respond at all. I cannot open the Taskbar Settings either, but programs will launch from the Task Bar at least, so it's not totally
 frozen. <br />
<br />
Also, when I right click on my desk top to go to Personalize or Display Settings I receive an error message reading:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"This file does not have an app associated with it for performing thi8s action. Please install an app or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Apps Setting page."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone explain this error or help me get the Start and Search working on my taskbar?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I have already tried looking for Windows updates and uninstalling Avast as well as restarting Windows Explorer via the Task Manager.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you have any ideas. Thank you!</p>

            Hi  QuinnRedfield,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. Seeing so many issues, I think repair upgrade would be the best option for you. But before that you try 1 &amp; 2 also -
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Reinstall Start Menu
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below and paste into Powershell &gt; Enter &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -Name Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperienceHost | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />2. CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to start Task Manager
<br />Locate Windows Explorer in Processes tab and kill it
<br />
<br />3. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br />
