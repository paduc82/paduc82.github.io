                    <p><span>I'm trying to change my PCI 2.0 x16 to run at x16 instead of x4<br />
<br />
</span><span>If HDMI is in PCI-E port 2 "Geforce GTX 960" it run at x16 while PCI-E port 4 "Geforce GTX 960" run at x4</span><br />

<span>I want both port 2 and 4 to run my GPU's at x16 , i have try'd contacting MSI "which is my motherboard" for support but did not help and i have try'd using the PCI-E 3.0 patch but that did not work either.<br />

    <title>High DPC Latency issues with Windows 7 64 bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shaggy1  say:</h3>
<h2>            High DPC Latency issues with Windows 7 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; I've been having some issues with my pc (Gateway DX4820, Intel G43 Express chipset) freezing up and shutting down.&nbsp; Found out it's from high DPC latency spikes.&nbsp; I've been pulling my hair out for weeks trying to figure this one out.&nbsp; I've tried everything
 I could find, to no avail.&nbsp; Usbport.sys, ataport.sys and ntoskrnl.sys are the normal culprits, although others do appear in my traces time-to-time.&nbsp; Disabling my usb ports stops the spikes for a moment, but then they reappear.&nbsp; Power options set to High Performance.&nbsp;
 Indexing turned off.&nbsp; All drivers up-to-date.&nbsp; BIOS up-to-date.&nbsp; DPC average about 200 after a reboot, and for no noticable reason can start to grow.&nbsp; Sometimes the pc can run for hours without issue.&nbsp; Other times only for a few mins.&nbsp; I need a stable platform
 as I use this thing for work as well as personal use...&nbsp; any suggestions?</p>

            <p>I found this while looking for solutions to my own issue with DPCs constantly taking up about 15-20% of the CPU on a Mac Mini I turned into a small server [2K8 R2 SP1].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem was with "USBPORT_Xdpc_Worker" in USBPORT.SYS.&nbsp; I found another thread for a Vista 32 system that ultimately fixed their issue by setting all processer power states to 100 percent.&nbsp; That exact fix didn't apply to my particular situation, since
 I had configured for "High Performance", but I decided to go through the rest of the power settings within that to see if anything else was there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even in "High Performance" power mode, the USB Selective Suspend option was enabled.&nbsp; I set that to Disabled &amp; immediately the mouse started tracking smoother.&nbsp; I fired up Process Explorer &amp; the DPC/Interrupt usage is about 4 percent every so often, but
 mostly closer to 0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something to consider perhaps.</p>

                    Hey Microsoft Engineers!!!&nbsp; I'm getting a message out of the blue that Windows firewall won't allow certain features of file name 'wuapihost'. File name: wuapihost.exe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot find any info on what this is.&nbsp; It says it's publisher is Microsoft Corporation.&nbsp;
 There's another question in the Community asking the same question but not Microsoft experts have addressed what this is.&nbsp; Can any of you guys help me by letting me know what it is so I can decide whether to allow it through my Firewall or not.&nbsp; I really like
 the security features in these latest iterations of Windows by the way, both in 8 and in 10.&nbsp; I'm running 10 pro on my Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; 10 is awesome, good work all!!&nbsp; Thanks for helping me with this.

            <p>Same problem and question here (Microsoft Windows 10 and Surface Pro 3). JamesWIN, you are completely right to ask about the Windows Security Alert. I also request an answer from Microsoft. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.&nbsp;I think&nbsp;Wuapihost.exe is a legal system file&nbsp;hosting Wuapi.dll (Windows Update Client API). I allowed access, without running into problems. Windows Defender (full scan) did not report any problem too. I&nbsp;conclude the security&nbsp;warning&nbsp;is a bug. Nevertheless,
 Microsoft should confirm that it is safe to allow access through the firewall.</p>

<p>sorry, but I ment for the system setup password, when win 7 is restarting. .</p>
<p>As soon as win 7 is restarting you press F2</p>
<p>and then you get the system setup access.</p>
<p>I cant reset password.</p>
<p>in this term, what should I do in order to cancel win 7 setup password.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
<div>You write "As soon as win 7 is starting I press F2". Did you perhaps mean</div>
<div>"As soon as the PC is starting, I press F2."</div>
<div><br />
<div>I ask this question because Windows does not process F2 at boot time, only F8. This makes me suspect that you are talking about a BIOS password, not a Windows password. You need to reset it by entering it when prompted, then specifying a blank password.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you cannot remember the password then you have two options:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>If this is a desktop PC: Remove the motherboard battery for 10 minutes.</li><li>If this is a laptop PC: Return the machine to a service centre.</li></ul>

<h2>            What are the possible causes of a date modified time stamp to change&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Scenario - User scans a doc yesterday and notices that the date modified has changed today when she logs in. File is stored on drive C: and no shadow copies are enabled.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are assuming the contents of the file haven't actually changed, but I can't rule that out at this point.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is that the user was NOT on her workstation when the date modified time stamp indicates.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What events actually trigger the date modified stamp to change?</p>

            It could also be that your virus or security scanner automatically scanned the file. &nbsp;Many scanners will mark a file so that it knows it's already been checked.

<h2>            Dell Inspiron 1721 Win 7 ultimate upgrade over Vista ultimate. ATI Raid Driver problems. </h2>
                    
<p><span>I am installing Win 7 Ultimate over Windows Vista Ultimate for my sister.&nbsp; Although I am dismayed at her having to pay
 200 more on top of the money that she paid to buy Vista Ultimate (for which she gained Bitlocker and the ability to join domains &lt;and did not need&gt;, I have the following problem:&nbsp;&nbsp; She paid a lot to gain a little and there are still problems in installing
 the OS.&nbsp; It would be good, at least, since she paid the price to have copies of the disks sent to her in addition to the download (which I am working with)<br />
<br />
I'm trying to install the Windows 7 </span><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>32-Bit</span></a><span> upgrade on
 my </span><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Dell Inspiron</span></a><span> 1721 laptop and I get an error that
 says that I need to update my ATI AHCI Compatible RAID </span><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Driver</span></a><span>.
 I went into the Update Device Drivers as suggested in the instructions and tried to upgrade that driver, but it says I have the
</span><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>latest driver</span></a><span> for it. So I tried restarting my laptop
 and ran the upgrade setup again, and got the same error message.<br />
<br />
Can you advise me on how to solve the problem.&nbsp; She has spent a lot of money and, at least, deserves to have it work!</span></p>

You need to check with System maker (Dell) and possible AMD/ATI as they write the drivers.<br />

<h2>            Xbox One S controller - buttons not registering presses every time</h2>
                    <p>I've just bought myself an&nbsp;Xbox One&nbsp;S controller (mainly for its Bluetooth support) and immediately noticed that, while playing,&nbsp;I had to repeat button presses occasionally. This was particularly apparent with the B button so I started digging and found out&nbsp;that when I press the button slightly off-center it will often not register the press despite making an audible click. This side-effected can be mitigated by hitting the buttons harder, however in my regular 'soft' style I must say it is quite annoying.<br /></p><p>As I wrote, the issue is most apparent with the B button, however I am able to reproduce it on AXY&nbsp;buttons as well. This makes me wonder if it something "normal" with the S controller. With my old Xbox One controller, I don't observe the problem...</p>

 problem does not exist in other programs (i.e. &nbsp;Full Screen in Media Player is just fine).

                    <p>Original Title: Signing in with Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my computer starts, it goes to the sign-in page. &nbsp;My problem is that there are two options in the lower left hand corner. &nbsp;One option has my name with my e-mail address under it, and the second has just my name. &nbsp; I have an error when the screen comes
 up that says the password does not match. &nbsp;I have to click on the account with my name and e-mail account, then type my password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sign-in option with both my name and e-mail address is my administrator account, so it is the default account. &nbsp;I don't even know where the second account that just has my name came from, but I want to delete it so signing in will just require my password
 instead of all the other steps.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Jos,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you forgot the password that you use to sign in to services such as Outlook.com.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>First, check to make sure that Caps Lock isn’t on, because passwords are case-sensitive. If you’re sure that you’re using the right password but still can’t sign in, your account might be compromised.
</li><li>To reset your password, go to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=238656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Please post in case you have any further issues, we are happy to help you further.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>windows vista will not synchronize with internet time server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timothybunn  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows vista will not synchronize with internet time server</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows Vista Business SP2 and Norton Internet Security on a Lenovo T61.&nbsp; All updates for Windows, Norton and Lenovo have been applied.&nbsp; When I try to synchronize with an Internet time server I get the error message "An error occured while synchronizing
 with time.windows.com" I tried each of the other listed time servers and still&nbsp;get the same error message.&nbsp; I have reviewed the firewall configuration in Norton Internet Security and w32 time and port 123 are enabled.&nbsp; I have tried synchronizing with both
 Norton Internet Security Firewall on and off with the same results.&nbsp;I have googled the internet and&nbsp;searched Microsoft for a solution.&nbsp; After reading all&nbsp;the relative posts I have tried the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>running Adminstrative Command Prompt</p>
<p>net stop w32time</p>
<p>w32tm /unregister</p>
<p>w32rm /register</p>
<p>net start w32time</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each executed positively.</p>
<p>This did not resolve the problem.&nbsp; I then ran:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>w32tm /config /update</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This executed positively.</p>
<p>This did not resolve the problem. I then ran:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>w32tm /resync /rediscover</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This responded with "The computer did not resync because no time data was available"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then ran:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>w32tm /query /status</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This responded with "Last Successful Sync Time: unspecified"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Local Group Policy Editor shows the following for Computer Configuration/Windows Administrative Templates/System/Time Service/Time Providers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Configure Windows NTP Client&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not configured</p>
<p>Enable Windows NTP Client&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not configured</p>
<p>Enable Windows NTP Server&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not configured</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, it does not appear that my computer time has ever synchronized with an Internet server.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need any additional information, please provide specific instructions on how to obtain it and I will provide it.</p>

            <p>From time to time I checked to see if I could resync to internet time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of the blue windows started resyncing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only change&nbsp;that I can think of is that AT&amp;T reset AT&amp;T Communication Manager to the default settings shortly before it started working.&nbsp; This tends to confirm my opinion that this was a communication problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PROBLEM SOLVED !!</p>
