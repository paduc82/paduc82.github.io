<h2>            BitLocker Secure Boot error after installing Linux Mint</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a windows 10 professional laptop. A few days ago i had installed linux mint on the same device in a dual boot configuration. The installlation has altered the UEFI boot to include the boot loader menu for linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that every time i boot in the windows partition, the bit locker screen comes asjing me for the key. I do have the key, but it is very annoying to key in every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can some one suggest a solution to fix this without having to reset the PC as i need bot the verison sof the OS</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>Hello Yasir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the prompt reply, however, the above link does not address my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I'm able to boot into bot Linux and windows. The Linux grub loader is working fine and I get to see Linux &amp; Windows options for booting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. My issue is that when I choose Windows boot from the grub bootloader, I get the bitlocker error screen where i'm supposed to input the key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I do have my keys, but it is not possible to input this every time I choose to log on to windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried so far</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Changed the order in the UEFI boot</p>
<p>2. During boot, when the bitlocker error is shown, I hit escape and go into repair mode. I input the keys and then windows says its fixed, however on subsequent boot it still asks for the keys</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your patience and would appreciate any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Arun</p>

<p>Its not about it being good or bad. Its about being able to make my own mind up. R18 is need cos not all games are for childs, I know this might sound really stupid i know. But there not. and games that childs shouldnt be playing need a r18 on them. Not
 like GTA4, where some retard in a office come up with the great idea of changing it from a 18+ to a 15+ so all the kids could go out and buy it.</p>

    <title>Double click pen for sending screenshot to OneNote 2016 not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> questioningguy12345  say:</h3>
<h2>            Double click pen for sending screenshot to OneNote 2016 not working</h2>
                    I recently started having a problem where if I try to double click and send to one-note, instead of getting the normal box for screen clipping, the box now has a red border. The screen shot i try to take does not do anything, as no dialog box comes up
 anymore telling me where to send the screenshot anymore. However, if i go to onenote 2016 and to insert and then screen clipping it will work then, and I do not get the red box but get the normal box instead. I have checked my pen settings and they are all
 the same, send to one note 2016 on double clicking. I have also made sure that the dialog box appears to tell where the screen clipping should go.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I had updated to the new windows, so based off an old thread that advised uninstalling the update I uninstalled the update. After uninstalling the update, I was still having the my send to onenote 2016 functionality.&nbsp;

    <title>Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop keyboard stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> corndogger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop keyboard stopped working</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop package about 2 weeks ago and all was fine until today when the keyboard started to become very unresponsive (I would have to press a key numerous times for it to&nbsp;register)&nbsp;and now there's no response at all. The separate
 numeric keypad still works so it can be the transmitter and the batteries should be fine as the expiry date is 2019. Any ideas on what the problem might be?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the keyboard is dead what's Microsoft's replacement/return policy like. Of course the store I bought it from only had a one week return policy and I had no issues the first week. :-( I love the keyboard but if this a wireless related issue that's a huge
 drawback for me. I want to be able to type without having to worry about whether or not the keystrokes are being recognized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TIA</p>

            Same here.&nbsp; It's been very frustrating.&nbsp; Wish they had a Bluetooth or cabled version.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I tried the following with little to no success:<br />
1 - disable 2.4Ghz radio on wireless router. <br />
2 - set iType.exe and iPoint.exe to Realtime priority in taskmgr<br />
3 - move USB receiver closer to the keybaord.<br />
4 - Uninstall MS Keyboard Center, its not required.<br />

            Thanks for the suggestions Stephen but no luck. The fact that the numeric keypad works for me strongly suggests it's the keyboard itself that is the issue. Does your numeric keypad work?

            It would be great if you could try the numeric keypad and mouse. If they work it would pinpoint the keyboard as having issues.

            I too have had this problem... went through all of the troubleshooting tips and still no workie. &nbsp;I am an I.T. professional and a Senior Technical Consultant, so this troubleshooting stuff is very basic and simple, though I understand why MS needs this
 to be done before replacing. &nbsp;The difficult part for me is that I have more than one of these Sculpt keyboards, and have swapped them back and forth to troubleshoot this, and I use these $85 keyboards on all of my computers, and I've gotten the run around
 on getting it replaced. &nbsp;The keyboard has a 3 year hardware warranty, but Microsoft said to go back to the vendor, who in turn told me that they have a 60 day return policy at which time the Microsoft 3 year warranty should be honored by Microsoft. &nbsp;Between
 my work and home, I buy thousands of dollars in Microsoft products every year, including Microsoft 365 for all of my employees... but I can't get one of these keyboards replaced? &nbsp;Really?!?!?

            <p>I bought the Sculpt not even two weeks ago and the keyboard no longer responds, however the mouse and keypad still do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've performed the Troubleshooting steps (reinstalling new batteries, trying different USB ports, moving possible interference devices away) and the keyboard works not even 5 minutes and it goes into a non responsive mode.&nbsp; I attempted to contact Hardware
 Support but they have unique EST hours:</p>

<br />
7. Close the Command Prompt Window.&nbsp; Open the Accesschk folder on yoru desktop (if it has been closed).<br />
<br />
8. Double click on Accesschk.txt (the text file), this should open Notepad.<br />
<br />
If this does not help, <br />
<br />
1. Please download the subinacl.msi file from the following link and save the installation patch onto the Desktop:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e8ba3e56-d8fe-4a91-93cf-ed6985e3927b&amp;displaylang=en#AffinityDownloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e8ba3e56-d8fe-4a91-93cf-ed6985e3927b&amp;displaylang=en#AffinityDownloads</a><br />
SubInACL (SubInACL.exe)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Please go to the Desktop and double click the downloaded file.<br />
3. Please select the C:\Windows\System32 folder as the Destination Folder during the installation. Later we will use this tool to reset the permission settings on the current machine.<br />

&nbsp;<br />
@Echo =========================<br />
@Echo Finished. <br />
@Echo =========================<br />
@pause<br />
&nbsp;<br />
6. After pasting the above commands, please close the Notepad window. Choose "Save" when you are prompted to save the file. Type "reset.bat" as the file name and choose "Desktop" from the left panel as the save location.<br />
<br />
7. Refer to the Desktop and right click the reset.bat file, then choose "Run as administrator."<br />
<br />

&nbsp;<br />
NOTE: It may take several minutes, please be patient. When it is finished, you will be prompted with the message: "Finished, press any key to continue".</p>
<p>Note: About some driver update installation procedure, we also received this error code, please reroute this kind of case to Vista System Team, because, it may regard for third party programs
 structure.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Check for the updates after this.<br />
<br />
Hope this information is useful.</p>

<h3> aussiamy1  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I log OUT of my GMail account from Edge in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>I have managed to add several Gmail accounts that I manage to my Edge "Mail" app.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I am UNABLE TO SIGN OUT of the accounts!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is problematic because I need to&nbsp;access Google Drive in some accounts and I cannot do so when I am logged into multiple Gmail accounts.&nbsp; In other words, I need to be able to log out of my personal email in order to access data on Google Drive from the
 other email account I'm managing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this can't be done (as is apparently the case in Windows 8) I will be unable to use Edge and will have to use Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Why do I get &#34;mscms.dll is not a valid windows image&#34; on everything I try&#63;</h2>
                    I am working out the kinks from the hard drive swap in my Dell E310. The original tested "ready to die" so I have installed a new one. I bought the back up disc for XP Pro when I bought the computer. I loaded the os onto the new drive and did the updates
 (80 or so). I regularly get the message " The file or dll C:\WINDOWS\system32\mscms.dll is not a valid windows image." &nbsp;What now?

            I corrupted my mscms.dll file on purpose and could not get any message about it even though I know it is corrupted - maybe I did not try hard enough.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know some other mscms.dll related errors, but they are different.<br />
<br />
Tell me what you are doing to regularly get the message because I would sure like to see it.<br />
<br />
After reinstalling and applying the 80 or so updates, was one of them Service Pack 3?<br />
<br />
If you are not sure what SP you re running, click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK to see your system information and Service Pack and what does it say?<br />
<br />
If the rest of your system is working fine, you can use Explorer to navigate to the c:\windows\system32 folder and rename your suspicious mscms.dll file to a name you can remember (like:&nbsp; mscms.bad).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Then if your Windows File Protection is working properly, it will notice the missing file and quickly and silently replace the missing file with a backup copy.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Wait a few seconds...&nbsp; then press F5 in your Explorer window to refresh the view and see that the file was replaced and you would have the mscms.bad and a fresh copy of mscms.dll.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You should see a message like this in your Event Viewer System log:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64002<br />
Description:<br />
File replacement was attempted on the protected system file c:\windows\system32\mscms.dll. This file was restored to the original version to maintain system stability. The file version of the system file is 5.1.2600.5627.<br />
<br />
Reboot and see how things look now.<br />
<br />
I can also send you a SP2 or SP3 version of mscms.dll file via my SkyDrive and you can rename your suspicious file and replace it to see if that relieves your condition.&nbsp; You could have some mismatched setup there.<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Fifa 15 Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Tried downloading the first update for my Fifa 15 game, the xbox reached 100% completion on the download then wouldn't finish. It would just switch between 100% and queued. Really frustrating cause I cant play until the download is finished.</p>

<p>Hey there Elljams 15,</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear about the downloading issue you've been experiencing. I would first suggest to try out these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Power cycle</a></span><span>&nbsp;your Xbox One console.</span>
</li><li><span>Once the console is off completely, unplug all cords from your console.</span>
</li><li><span>Leave everything unplugged for a few minutes.</span> </li><li><span>Plug your console and cords back in and turn it on.</span> </li><li><span>Check your Network Connection. (Settings &gt; Network &gt; Test Network Connection)</span>
</li><li><span>Sign back into to Xbox Live and try the downloading the update again.</span>
</li></ul>
<p>If those steps don't seem to do the trick, post back to let us know!</p>
<p>Hi <span>OP Titann, xsrkix, </span>and<span> Underhoundd</span>,</p>
<p>Thank you for being descriptive and bringing this to our attention.</p>
<p>I can assure you all that this has been bubbled up to the appropriate teams and is being investigated. For updates, please check

<p>Their are enough threads being made on this forum and the ea forums to show that their are problems with many people unable to make the main menu screen without the games freezing or crashing back to the home screen. The usual fixes are NOT working. This
 needs to be addressed soon as their should not be errors like this will all singing all dancing new expensive game consoles .</p>

<h2>            Network folder is empty, cannot see other computers on network</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 on a PC with an Ethernet network. PC cannot see other computers on network. Its "Network" folder is empty. That's the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried rebooting PC and router. No fix.</p>
<p>Tried deleting&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Network\Config, as per suggestion found on Internet. That key doesn't
 exist. No fix.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Tried uninstalling&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">network
 adapter, then scanning for hardware changes, as per another suggestion. No fix.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
Tried doing a restore point. Success...for a few minutes. The "Network" folder looked normal. I could see other PCs on the network. I could even click on them and see their file systems. But...<br />
<br />
When I went to another PC and looked in its "Network" folder I could see the problem PC, but when I clicked on it, I couldn't connect to it. When I went back to the problem PC, its "Network" folder was empty again. Back to square one.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</span></p>

            Hi Omkar,
<ol>
<li>Are you trying to search anything using webpage?</li><li>Does bing search show up when accessing the internet?</li><li>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
</li></ol>
<div>I would suggest you to run the performance troubleshooter as the first step. If the issue still persists, please disable the Add-ons and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Run the Internet explorer performance troubleshooter:<br />
</strong><br />
d. Type â€œ<strong>Troubleshooter</strong>â€ in start page<br />
e. Select â€œ<strong>Programs</strong>â€<br />
f. Click on â€œ<strong>Internet performance</strong>â€ and follow the instructions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Method 2: Run a online scan</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Note:</font></span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. During this 10 days, it will remove all the virus infected files and folders. I suggest you to create a backup of your data and
 then Install Microsoft Safety Scanner.</p>

<h2>            Not getting IP Address on Wi-Fi interface after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 and after the upgrade the Wi-Fi interface is not getting an IP address. When I scan I can see the wireless networks but after connecting , never get an IP address. I tried various options as mentioned in different forum but still
 no access. I also installed another USB wireless card and that too showed the same issue. There was no such issue before the upgrade.</p>
<p>Any suggestions that can help to resolve this issue or downgrading windows is the only option ?</p>

<p>I have a widescreen laptop so I move the taskbar to the left to have more vertical space. I was wondering if there is a way to flip it over so that the start button is on the bottom and all the little notification icons are on the top?</p>

<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Unfortunately you cannot flip the task bar to make the start menu button appear at the base. It is by design. If you move to
 left or right, in either case the start menu button will appear on the top left or the top right corner of the taskbar.</span></span></p>

            Hi Yountmg.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Sometimes it takes a few weeks for Updates to catch up and sort the Updates, since it's simultaneously doing the same thing on over a billion devices.  I've never seen it not, unless the Updater itself is dysfunctional which we can check now.
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt by typing CMD in Start Search, right click result to Run as Administrator, copy and paste or type the following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) Complete Guide to Managing Updates after Version 1803: <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-update-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-up...</a>
<br />
<br />6) If Updates still won't run go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            how do I download pictures from a polaroid photomax fun flash 640 digital camera&#63;</h2>
                    I have an old polaroid photomax fun flash 640 digital camera. Still works! After taking all the pictures, I tried to download them, but Windows says I need to set associations to proceed.&nbsp; I think that means I need to assign a program to run the software,
 right? Or do I need to download a driver from the net? Can anyone help me?

====================================<br />
When the camera is connected via USB and turned on...if <br />
you go to...Start / Computer...is the camera recognized with <br />
a drive letter? It may say something like "Removable Disk"...

                    Installation of latest bunch of updates causes following BSOD during boot on my computer:<br />
<br />
STOP: c0000021a {Fatal System Error}<br />
The verification of a KnownDLL failed System process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0xc000012f (0x0097b260 0x00000000).<br />

I tried to install it twice, and got same error.<br />
I also successfully installed new versions of microsoft mouse and keyboard drivers via windows update just now, so my winupdate itself is not broken.<br />
chkdsk sez everything is ok with system drive.<br />

                    <p>I am running windows 7 64 bit freshly installed on a new computer, I have downloaded essentials to use live mail. The first time I opened it it worked fine, next time I booted up the computer Live mail would not work, just tells me "live mail has stopped

 Please help as its doing my head in!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, I,m sure that others out there are having the same issue (tried both essentials 2011 and 2012)</p>

            <p>Hi Frankie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with Windows live mail. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should. I appreciate all the troubleshooting you tried on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the antivirus program installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might occur due to third party conflicts on the computer. I suggest you to perform a Clean Boot on the computer and check if Live Mail works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To&nbsp;know how to&nbsp;place the computer in Clean Boot I suggest you to follow the below link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Reset the computer back to Normal Mode once you are done with the troubleshooting by following the section "<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</span></span>"
 from the same article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with the results. I will be glad to help you further.</p>

<p>When you see this message, a crash report will have been written to the event log. The report will contain clues to what's wrong., so this is the first place to look to try and find the cause of the crash.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Type <strong>eventvwr</strong> into the start search box and press <em>Enter</em>.
</li><li>In the left-hand pane,&nbsp;expand <em>Windows Logs</em> and then select <em>Application</em>.&nbsp;In the list at the top of the centre pane, look for the
<em>Error</em>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2f5s39ew-bn1305.files.1drv.com%2fy2p1rf03L9tKecMT6QzE7Z6XHf7Sgaiz0cu0AD2tNFo6FhwwrEEFTkq3bcVl35ZH4eDW3O4V6aymS8-U50rbErA3vmfwkQt7Pf_tzrqVtrMMlOqzplxuP51bKffXZDsyVNF0Y5MaPfVS_mdrxzM2Zf6KQ%2fRed-!-error.png" />&nbsp;entry at the time of the
 crash. </li><li>Select it in the list, then towards the bottom of the right-hand pane click <em>
Copy </em>â–¶ <em>Details as text. </em>You can then paste the result into your reply here; someone will hopefully be able to make some sense of it.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If - as is often the case - the problem is with a device driver, like that for the display adapter, then repairing and/or&nbsp;uninstalling and re-installing the program won't help (although replacing NIS by something less aggressive might). Let's see what the
 crash report says first.</p>

            <p>Hi Frankie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response and keeping the status updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above error indicates that there are bad sectors on the drive. Reinstalling the Windows would resoIve the problem. I also suggest you to run a chkdsk on the computer and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To run a&nbsp;cskdsk on the computer please follow the below&nbsp;steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click <strong>Start</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Type: <strong>CMD</strong>, from the results, <strong>right click CMD. </strong>
</p>
<p>3. Click <strong>'Run as Administrator'.</strong></p>
<p>4. At the Command Prompt, type: <strong>chkdsk /r /f</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem persist, boot to the Windows 7 desktop, insert your Windows 7 disc, when the setup menu appears, click the option to do an
<strong>Upgrade </strong>over the current installation. Your personal files and settings will be preserved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please post in case you have any further issues. I will be glad to help you.</p>

            <p>If these accounts worked before and now none are working, then check for antivirus interference (see
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3</a>).&nbsp; You can try removing a mail account, closing WinMail and then compacting and repairing the database (see

<h2>            what is the proper way to fix this error, 0x81000037</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had this error when I was trying to backup last night.&nbsp; When I did my research and found all these ideas about the reparse points, while they were good, I am still not sure how to fix this.&nbsp; Specifically,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-- for example, per this answer: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973455#workaroundissue12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973455#workaroundissue12</a>&nbsp;in DOS, CMD dir /al /s command listed all these 'junctions' by file names, but it is not obvious to me where I'd find these mounted volumes so I can delete them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it is now I can't even do any system restore, as I now run into error 0x80070057</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help.&nbsp; Thx.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the reparse points to a location that contains any compressed file format (multimedia files, .zip
 files, and so on), you receive this error message.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>To work around this problem, remove this reparse point from the library, and then run the backup wizard
 again.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / System Tools / Disk Cleanup.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the drop down menu, select the drive you want to clean up and click OK. The drive will be scanned.</span></p>
<p><span>c. In the next window, select the Clean up system files button.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Select the drive again and click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>e. In the next window, select the More Options Tab. In the System Restore and Shadow Copies section,
 click the Clean up button and click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>f. In the next window, select the Delete Button.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>This will remove all of the temporary files and all but the latest System Restore Points.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>rse point, select the absolute path of this location from the Windows Backup configuration user interface.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>hey Abdul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your tip, I did the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) I did a full scan via Microsoft Security essential and removed a virus, Exploit:Java/CVE-2012-0507.AA</p>
<p>2) I did a full system restore to a week prior to yesterday</p>
<p>3) I also did a checkdsk</p>
<p>4) I did what you suggested above.</p>
<p>I just reran the backup and it still failed on this error, 0x81000037.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you suggest, please advise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey Abdul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp; Upon more research I found out that my JAVA folder has this virus:&nbsp;
<span>
Exploit:Java/CVE-2012-0507.BA</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Threat/Encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?name=Exploit%3aJava%2fCVE-2012-0507.BA&amp;threatid=2147656815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Threat/Encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?name=Exploit%3aJava%2fCVE-2012-0507.BA&amp;threatid=2147656815</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>which was detected by MSE and I removed it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so what I did next is:</p>
<ol>
<li>completely deinstalled Java 6</li><li>manually deleted all entries from <strong>C:\Users\User\AppData\LocalLow\Sun\Java\Deployment\cache &amp; 'systemcache'</strong></li><li><strong>I then reinstalled Java 7.</strong></li></ol>
<p>I then reran the backup and she is fine now.&nbsp; It was very annoying.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an aside, is there an OFFICIAL way to fix issues like this that you can share with the community, instead of having folks research and try different things?&nbsp; Thanks for your followup..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LF</p>
