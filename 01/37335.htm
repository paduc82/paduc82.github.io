<h2>            Color Management of external monitor Windows 10 not permanent</h2>
                    Color Management calibration/profile for external monitor is&nbsp;disabled or lost&nbsp;in Windows 10 after disconnecting (when traveling) and reconnecting my (same) external monitor again. How to make this setting for the specified&nbsp;external monitor&nbsp;permanent? I
 am running on an&nbsp;Intel 3150 graphics accelerator with the Persistence&nbsp;key disabled in Task manager Startup, so it is not the&nbsp;Intel protocol&nbsp;resetting my display settings.

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thanks for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As per your query, I suggest you to try the below steps and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>First connect the secondary monitor and then run the color calibration tool. Then with the secondary monitor connected, follow these steps:<br />
a) Press <strong>Windows key +X</strong>, select <strong>Control panel</strong>.<br />
b) Change the view by option on the right top to large icons.<br />
c) Click on <strong>Color Management</strong>. <br />
d) Against device, select the secondary monitor and check, "<strong>use my settings for this device</strong>".<br />
e) In the bottom, highlight a profile and select "<strong>set as default profile</strong>".<br />
<br />
Save changes and check if the issue persists. Let us know the results for further assistance.</span></span></p>

            <p>I have been doing exactly that all the time but there is no "Save changes" option in Color management Windows 10.
</p>
<p>I will give it a try again to see if this is permanent or that it&nbsp;sometimes lose the settings after disconnecting the monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frank</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: It seems to be working now after I connect my 2nd monitor the color is adjusted, maybe I forgot to "Set as default" on the first page of Color Management, still recommend that MS adds a Save button to that program.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>My friend and I are getting killed everytime we leave &nbsp;the container with sykes.I am the host so I have sykes and am concentrating on the soldiers in front, It is mainly my friend who is unable to crouch or take cover and is shot from the soldiers on the
 building to the right of the container as you leave. Are we doing something wrong or are we just bad? Anyone help??</p>

<p>Having just finished the campaign,I'm having a hard time remembering this part.That said,my guess is that the two of you should divide the enemies between you.You take those in front ( you have Sykes in one hand and a pistol in the other,right ? ) and your
 buddy should shoot those in that building on the right.I haven't had the chance to play it co-op,but I think it should work.</p>

<p>I almost rage quit and snapped the disc in half after about twenty+ attempts at this solo on elite. After quitting for a day I tried again and got it after about another half dozen attempts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things you MUST do. - take out the two directly in front coming at you from behind that concrete barricade first and quickly - you simply MUST drop them. Then at least one, preferably both of the two on the high right before they get out of your turning
 arc (you can even try nailing them first) and then the one that drops down, you MUST nail him too. Then keep shooting dropping as many as possible but remember to prioritse as I listed above because they are MUST MUST MUST kills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you get the call to go left (and you're pretty sweet then... I think), but while you're crouched there nail the b@stard on top of the container about your 1 o'clock long (he's got a wicked gun) and all the other stragglers you can before you get the
 call to move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you're moving to cover just keep dropping them as best you can (but again I think you're pretty sweet from here with the beginning as I described in paragraph 2 the most difficult part).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you keep failing I bet it's either the frist two coming straright at you or the two, three high right that's nailing you. If you don't nail them it's all over.</p>

Neither she nor the second person&nbsp;I chatted with could help or offer any suggestions for how to proceed.</p><p>My order meets all the promotion's requirements (not pre-order, I&nbsp;own an xbox one, it's my first time purchasing, I'm trying to buy from the xbox store, and it's during the offer period). I'm able to add the console and free game to my cart, but I&nbsp;can't get the expedited shipping&nbsp;promo code to be added to my cart so I'm either adding the shipping costs or left with standard shipping. That's not that big a deal, but I&nbsp;want to make sure the rest of the promo still works.&nbsp;</p><p>Can someone please assist?&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hey Gordon, does this happen on all browsers?

Update the display driver from the PC or Display device Support Downloads web page.

At Settings &gt; Display &gt; Screen Resolution make sure highest resolution is set. 

Feel free to ask back any questions, and let us know how it goes. I'll keep working with you until it is resolved.

 my second xbox live account it said my "dBluRxD" account was online and my bia and info was all gone and all that was on there was a location. It says "Hong Kong SAR" I looked that up and SAR means Special Administrative Region. I have no idea what this means
 but also when i look later today now it says offline and shows nothing but Hong Kong SAR. My friends list will not show up. I sent microsoft a email buy no response yet. Im just wondering if thats normal for a locked xbox live account. It seems wierd that

<h2>            Red Dead Redemption Backwards Compatible Keeps Crashing</h2>
                    
<p>So I think this has something to do with DLC.</p>
<p>I put my RDR disc in on Friday night, set it installing and then loaded up a multiplayer game. &nbsp;Loaded fine, but when I go to the 'Outfitters' page it just loads and loads. &nbsp;I tried several times, same thing. &nbsp;I read on a forum somewhere
 from a while back that if you have purchased the Undead DLC and deleted it, then this will crash the 'Outfitter', presumably because there are characters there from that now deleted DLC.</p>
<p>So, I searched for the Undead DLC and installed it, then noticed that there were about 5 other DLC 'ready to install', installed them all and now it crashes on the title screen. &nbsp;I've deleted everything and reinstalled it all, but
 still crashes on title screen when it's trying to load the DLC.</p>
<p>I saw something in another thread about differences between Undead Collection and Undead Pack but I can't remember which I bought. &nbsp;I'm just selecting the stuff it lists as 'ready to install' under the 'Manage game' page.</p>
<p>Anyone had similar trouble or solution? &nbsp;Is there an official page I can ask this question to developers of Red Dead or Xbox?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,</p>

<p>The way to get around this is to quit out of the game. Make sure that everything is closed out. Restart the game but DON'T go to multiplayer. Instead, load up the single player (not undead nightmare, just normal single player) and when you load into the
 single player, press the menu (start) button and go down to Multiplayer. Select "Xbox Live Private Match" and load into a private match. From there, you can go into the outfitter at any time you want and even load into an online multiplayer game without infinite
 load times. Any time your game crashes, revert to this method. ALWAYS go into multiplauer THROUGH a single player xbox live private match setup first.</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/049cef66-6249-49fc-b818-3ff44e4ced35" title="ManojKrMaharjan">
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that last 30 days of Skype conversation histories <em>(messages, calls and other data)
</em>are only saved in our servers. Any history older than 30 days will be saved on the device's local drive, depending on your history settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you update to the latest Skype for Windows 10 app, old conversations will not be carried over. Moving forward, new conversations will be saved from the cloud for 2 years from the date of installation, so you can access it when signed in to Skype on any
 supported devices/platforms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your comment about the latest Skype for Windows 10 is duly noted and will forward to our developers for them to review.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps! Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

            <p>The netio.sys implicated in the crash is a Windows driver involved in networking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However the driver that is likely causing the crash is the mfehidk.sys:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>fffff880`02d39718&nbsp; fffff880`00a6e29cUnable to load image \SystemRoot\system32\drivers\<strong>mfehidk.sys</strong>, Win32 error 0n2<br />
*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for <strong>mfehidk.sys</strong><br />
*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for <strong>mfehidk.sys</strong><br />
&nbsp;mfehidk+0x6e29c</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mfehidk.sys is a McAfee firewall driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest to uninstall McAfee and see if the blue screen errors resolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider alternative security software such as Windows 8 built-in antivirus (Windows Defender) and firewall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you may want to update the Realtek network adapter driver there is a Windows 8 driver in the following link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to remove icons from main desktop when pinned to taskbar</h2>
                    
<p>I pinned icons to taskbar, but they remain on the main screen when I do.&nbsp; Now I have an even junkier looking monitor screen.&nbsp; I thought when you pin the icon to the task bar by moving it, the icon will disappear from the main screen.&nbsp; Why do I end up with
 2 icons, one on the main screen and one on the taskbar?&nbsp; And how can I get rid of the icon on the main screen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hate windows.</p>

<h2>            BSOD - atikmdag.sys &#38; Crtitical Structure Error</h2>
                    <p>I installed Win10. I installed a game which kept causing a BSOD with&nbsp;atikmdag.sys. I fixed the issue by copying the&nbsp;atikmdag.sys DLL from ATI to System32 drivers folder. The game launched after that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, now the computer keeps crashing with Critical Structure Error BSOD, and the solutions for them suggests upgrading driver for ATI which again takes me back to the first issue.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
atikmdag.sys is the ATI Video drivers so check with their support, on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues. Update the drivers if available and if there are no never versions it may be necessary to revert to an older
 stable version. Also it is very important to check with the game maker's support and forums as the games put a lot of stress on the system which can cause BSOD.<br />

<br />
=========================================================
<p><br />
Does the system have RAID? If so that is also&nbsp;very suspect.<br />
<br />
This error is usually a driver&nbsp;issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though it could be others.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software issues&nbsp;can also cause the error. When you get to the driver section
 of the troubleshooter use my generic&nbsp;methods below and then return to the troubleshooter if needed.
<br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti- spyware/security programs.<br />

</strong></p>
==================================================<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;<strong>set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers </strong>- update&nbsp;those without
<br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p><br />
====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p><br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable</p>
<p><br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. <br />
Also check with&nbsp;MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can <br />
analyze it.</p>

Hope this helps. <br />

<h2>            joystick calibration</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first installed my joystick it had a calibration under a settings tab.</p>
<p>I then installed the joystick drivers and it's gone.</p>
<p>I uninstalled the device from devices included software drivers and reinstalled it and it doens't seem to help.</p>
<p>I tried shift ctrl clicking properties and didn't see it there either.</p>
<p>Tried accessing it by joy.cpl tried launching a command prompt with admin and then launching joy.cpl</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have looked at forums and see not solution.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>I figured it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This isn't something anyone should do but I went in uninstalled drivers, uninstalled the joystick, deleted temporary internet files(after finding a pointer to them in registry).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I went in to regedit (back it up and you might be able to recover if you screw up, but be aware you delete the wrong thing in here it's bad so make sure you&nbsp;are not about to ruin your livleyhood)&nbsp;and removed most referances to the cyborg. There were
 two main trees that I think did the real work, each one branched out at "joystick" and I removed the entire group by deleting joystick and all sub categories. I did this twice but didn't pay attention to where they were located :P(too many years screwing around
 with this stuff to have the proper amount of caution I guess). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way I found it all was to search for cyborg (the name of the stick) then "F3" through and each time made a choice: (1)&nbsp;if it looked like settings (usually has a folder path or more than one key relating to the joystick) I deleted the category it was
 in with all content. (2)&nbsp;If it looked like a link or a history item (usually mixed in with stuff that doesn't look related) I deleted just&nbsp;the single entry&nbsp;. If it's located in a folder that doesn't make sense like has a hashed name I usually leave it alone.
 Once I saw "joystick" then alot of related settings I was pretty sure that was it and deleted it all. normally youll find two groups of the same thing one in local maghine the other in current user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that I re-added the joystick letting just the windows drivers load. Ran the calibration (like the first time)&nbsp;which worked fine then updated the drivers which caused calibration to dissapear again... So once it s out of calibration ill do it all over
 again...</p>

<h2>            Disable Low Memory Notification&#63;</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">I have a Lenovo computer that is a CORE windows 8.1 version and I am a gamer. well I just
 recently got a new video game and every so often I get this "Your computer is low on memory you need to close this progrm: The Game i'm currently playing" well I click cancel, the reason that is annoying is because it closes my game and brings it up. Well
 after it did it the second time I went to my task manager and checked my memory and my memory was fine, it still have a good 20% left to use. I want to disable this notification, is there any way I can?</span>

            <p>Hi JimmithyWeav,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It must be difficult when things do not work as expected. Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue. Perform the steps provided here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this issue specific to a game? </p>
<p>
</p><p>When your computer doesn't have enough memory for all of the actions it's trying to perform, Windows and your programs can stop working. To help prevent information loss, Windows will notify you when your computer is low on memory. You can also learn to
 recognize the signs of low memory and take steps to prevent the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To enhance performance, it is good practice to put the paging file on a different partition and on a different physical hard disk drive. That way, Windows can handle multiple I/O requests more quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer this article to find more information regarding the issue</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the issue is specific to a game, I would suggest you to refer the steps mentioned by '<strong>Arcan3 replied on December 9, 2013</strong>' in the article provided.

<p>
</p><p>You may also update the display driver to the latest by visiting computer Manufacturer website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also check if there are any errors are listed in Event viewer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Event logs are special files that record significant events on your computer, such as when a user logs on to the computer or when a program encounters an error.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>To open view the logs please follow the steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Press <strong>Windows key + W</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Type "<strong>View Event Logs</strong>" on the Start screen and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>

    <title>Thumbs.db...why is it showing up&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denmarfl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Thumbs.db...why is it showing up&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Running Win7; 32bit.....</p>
<p>Just recently have I seen the Thumbs.db appear on my desktop and other folders. I have read&nbsp;several thread which leads me to believe Thumbs.db being created and displayed is a "Normal". However, I have been running Win7 for almost 2 years and I have just
 started seeing Thumbs.db Icons over the past&nbsp;5 months. Having written that, seeing the Thumbs.db has had to start due to something changed on my PC...which believe me, I have not done. One thread outlined a registry change which I really don't want to make
 the suggested Registry Modification suugested.....and; I did look for the Files that needed to be chnaged and in my Version of Windows; those files\Folders did not exist.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Once again, the Thumbs.db Incons have only started to appear the past&nbsp;5 months....and my Win7 32bit has been installed for 2 years....something got changed unknown to me...and I would like to find out what...and change it back the way it was prior. Restore
 back to a date prior to when this started is not an option.&nbsp; Every time it appears on my desktop and I move it to the recycle Bin.....it eventually re-aapears on the desktop.&nbsp; I have not moved any Photos, etc to the desktop.&nbsp; I do have my Folder Option VIEW
 set to show hidden files\folders and do not want to change this setting......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There must be a reason thumbs.db is appearing and surely other than a registry....Folder\View setting Change....make it stop showing up on the desktop.</p>

            <p>Yes, it was wandering a bit.</p>
<p>I've been trying to understand the issue better by forcing the creation of thumbs.db but I have been unable to do so.&nbsp; As the setting is mentioned in the internet discussions of the subject, I have tried setting &amp; also clearing
<em>Windows explorer, Tools, Folder options, View, Always show icons never thumbnails</em>.&nbsp; I have also tried changing the folder type to picture, documents etc but that only results in desktop.ini file being created.</p>
<p>The thumbs.db files that were already on my system remain in place but no new ones are created.&nbsp; So I looked at the ones already there.&nbsp; I can believe the explanation that they are caches of folder thumbnails to speed up display of folder contents but I
 could not find that reflected in the date stamps of the files.&nbsp; There are some folders that I know were created specifically to put in&nbsp;sets of photos [tax returns, say] all at the same time and neither the folders nor the files have been changed since.&nbsp; But
 the date stamp does not match.</p>
<p>I have deleted a couple of my thumbs.db files and they stay deleted even after a reboot - this is not the behaviour you are finding.</p>
<p>[<em>Later edit - you might want to see this thread </em><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-desktop/cant-permanently-delete-shortcuts/1e8fd362-e455-477f-8783-d5f47360843f"><strong><em>Can't
 Permanently Delete Shortcuts</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;- it makes me wonder whether you have had any other problems deleting files/shortcuts from the desktop</em>]</p>
<p>As I am not going to be any use to you directly, I can only suggest posting&nbsp;a new question &amp; put it in a slightly different way.&nbsp; When you've posted, close this thread with an explanatory comment &amp; a link to the new thread.</p>
<p><u>Question -</u> &nbsp;</p>
<p>thumbs.db file on desktop cannot be deleted - only appeared in last 4 months</p>
<p><u>Description -</u></p>
<p>Win7x32&nbsp;</p>
<p>Folder options set to show hidden files &amp; show system files - settings made 2 years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Folder option <em>Always show icons never thumbnails</em>&nbsp; - Set [or not set, as the case may be &amp; consider noting that this was also 2 years ago if that applies]</p>
<p><strong>thumbs.db file appeared on desktop 4 months ago &amp; cannot be deleted</strong> [if I delete it then it just reappears].&nbsp; There has been no known system change to explain the appearance of the file.</p>
<p>Desktop folder set to type Documents / Pictures / Music / Videos as experiments but thumbs.db remains undeletable.</p>
<p>I cannot simply hide system files&nbsp;as I need them always visible because*...&nbsp;</p>
<p>1&nbsp; How can I delete thumbs.db file?</p>
<p>2 Why did it suddenly start appearing 4 months ago when the settings had not been changed in 2 years?</p>
<p><em>* I do think you will need to include an explanation of having system files visible as hiding them is such a common system protection setting to have.&nbsp; If you don't include an explanation then the new thread is as liable to wander off the point as this
 thread did.</em></p>
<p>Best of luck,</p>

<br />You can use Group Policy to block automatic updates. This ensures updates are downloaded/installed only when you want them:

            Regarding the issue, I would like to let you know that controlling Windows updates is somewhat difficult in Windows 10, but you can see the options here: <br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a><br />If you have Windows 10 Pro , Methods 4 and 5 are the best way to resolve this as Windows would always ask you to before downloading updates.<br />Another way would be to use a 3rd party app like Stop Updates10. which allows you to disable Windows 10 Updates with a single click.<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-updates-windows-10-stopupdates10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-updates-win...</a><br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.<br /><br />Standard Disclaimer: <br />There are links to non-Microsoft websites.

<h2>            WIndows 10 UI</h2>
                    I have been using Windows 10 now since July when it was released. I was wondering if I am the only one that thinks that the Windows 10 UI is dull and plain ugly? I have used Windows 7, 8, and 8.1. Windows 7 hands down has a better look and feel to the
 UI in my opinion. I am fairly disjointed that Windows did not take the time to make the graphical interface of Windows 10 more appealing. I have been hoping that Windows would make some upgrades to the look over time, but it is not looking as though this is
 going to happen. I know that this is my personal opinion, however I would like to know what your thoughts are as well.

            <p>Looks like you and I are out of step with the times. The flat and boring look started with Windows 8 and was inherited by Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to take a somewhat educated guess and say that flat and boring uses less processing power and memory than Windows 7 style and also less battery. Those are important considerations when you have an operating system that's also supposed to run on
 a phone or tablet.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>

</p><p>You cannot install Skype for Business. Office 365 for home doesn't include Skype for Business. But Skype for Business users can search for and IM with everyone who users Skype. For more details, please follow the link below:</p>

<p>I will definitely be getting WRC, love my rally games (miss the good old days of Colin McRae). I see there is another rally game due next year too, Sebastien Loeb Rally Evo. What with Forza 6, new Need for Speed in November, and the fact I'm still loving
 Forza Horizon 2 (set my heart on the complete all 168 championships achievement), we've got a great range of driving games to choose from!</p>

 successful build, i click yes. Then an error box opens saying unable to start program it cant locate the exe file . Any suggestions?</p>
<p>I get this error MSB8003</p>

<h2>            Windows Store won&#39;t install apps with error 0x80248014</h2>
                    <div>
<p>The Windows Store on one of my devices running Windows 10 has gotten into a strange state where I'm unable to install any apps. I have a second device using the same account which installs apps no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app starts to download then immediately tells me "Try that again See details". The error code is<strong> 0x80248014&nbsp;-</strong> I've tried wsreset, renaming the software distribution folder and various other suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At one point after looking around on http://account.live.com I saw several entries for the same Surface Pro 3 device, attached to the following Windows Builds:</p>
<p>
</p><p>10.0.10130.0</p>
<p>10.0.10162.0</p>
<p>10.0.10166.0</p>
<p>10.0.10240.16391</p>
<p>10.0.10240.16394</p>
<p>10.0.10240.16399</p>
<p>
</p><p>I subsequently deleted most of those incase it was related, however this doesn't seem to have helped either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the following PowerShell script to re-register the new Store and check if that helps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In the Search box, type <strong>CMD</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Right click on <strong>Command Prompt</strong> and choose
<strong>Run as administrator</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In the command prompt, enter the following command:</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register

            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've put together a batch file with the various methods I've found around here in the forums and other sites to fix the Store and&nbsp;Windows Updates.</p>
<p>I'll explain this in&nbsp;simple terms for the benefit of the not so tech savvy.</p>
<p>I've tested on a test machine&nbsp;and ultimately on my own PC and it's "safe", as in it won't break anything, as all the tasks sort of reset the state of certain services and resetable cached content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put a together this batch&nbsp;file (something.cmd)&nbsp;with the following&nbsp;:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><strong>net stop appidsvc</strong><br />
<strong>net stop bits</strong><br />
<strong>net stop cryptsvc</strong><br />
<strong>net stop msiserver</strong><br />

<strong>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</strong><br />
<strong>net stop appidsvc</strong><br />
<strong>net stop bits</strong><br />
<strong>net stop cryptsvc</strong><br />
<strong>net stop msiserver</strong><br />
<strong>net stop wuauserv</strong><br />

<strong>Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak</strong><br />
<strong>bitsadmin.exe /reset /allusers</strong><br />
<strong>netsh winsock reset</strong><br />
<strong>shutdown -r -f -t 1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I run this every other day and use the pc as usual.</p>
<p>*** This has to be run with Administrator rights and as such you need to right click the file and select "Run as administrator" and when you get a notification to run the file, click yes.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Results:</p>
<p>I have seen improvements in the reliability of Windows Updates, but the Store besides "broken" is still at version &gt;<em><strong>Microsoft.WindowsStore_2015.7.1.0&lt; and not &gt;</strong></em><strong><em>Microsoft.WindowsStore_2015.8.12.0</em></strong><em>&lt;.</em></p>
<p>This is what I mean by "broken":</p>

<p>Actually, nevermind. Turns out I had a bad registry key related to some other things I've been testing that was breaking the store.

<p>
</p><p>Please disregard this thread, problem solved!</p>

<p>What was the registry key? I'm having the issue as well.</p>

<h2>            Error 0x80070079</h2>
                    Hello all,<br />
<br />
I have a 32GB Surface with Windows RT.&nbsp; Disappointingly the 32GB version only has 14.5GB free space, so I put one of my 64GB MicroSD cards in to increase the storage space.<br />
<br />
When I try and create a folder on the newly formatted SD card, I get an error:<br />
<br />
Error 0x80070079:&nbsp; The semaphore timeout period has expired.<br />
<br />
I have applied all the updates, so everything is up-to-date.&nbsp; I have tried to format the card on the tablet, but this doesn't work.&nbsp; The card is formatted as FAT32, and has some avi and epub files on it.&nbsp; It works on my Windows PC, which is where I formatted
 it and copied the files.<br />
<br />
I have another MicroSD card, exactly the same, which also doesn't work.&nbsp; The only thing I can think of is that the Surface doesn't support MicroSD XC cards, which would be a pity considering the price.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help with this one?<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
<br />
Mark<br />

            Poking around I found this:<br />
<br />
http://forums.sandisk.com/t5/Mobile-memory-professional-cards/Sandisk-Ultra-64gb-MicroSD-Wont-format/td-p/284884<br />
<br />
Seems there was a bad batch of these cards produced by Sandisk.&nbsp; Looks like mine were in the batch, and I bought 5!&nbsp; They don't like being constantly re-formatted, so you have to pick one, stick it in a device and leave it alone!<br />
<br />
I'll play around with it for a bit anyway.<br />

    <title>Why is mouse keys not working&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why is mouse keys not working&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I would like to use windows mouse keys to use my keyboard as a mouse, but I have not been able to get the feature to work.</p>
<p>I am able to enable mouse keys without any problems, but pressing the numerical keypad buttons does not move the mouse pointer at all.</p>
<p>I can see the mouse keys icon in the notification area of the windows 7 taskbar, and am able to switch between the left and right mouse buttons using the / and - keys on the keypad, but that is all I can do.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas about what I can do?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Jason</p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found the solution to my problem. Mouse keys was actually working, but I did not realise it because my mouse speed setting was on minimum. Although it seemed that nothing was happening when I was pressing the numerical keypad keys, the mouse was in fact
 beginning to move, but only very slowly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have adjusted my mouse settings and now mouse keys is working properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jason</p>
