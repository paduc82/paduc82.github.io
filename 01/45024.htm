<h2>            &#34;Your privacy settings prevent chat with some people&#34; Xbox chat vis console</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so I'm using the Xbox windows 10 app to talk to my friends on a Xbox console. The problem I'm having is that when I'm in a party I can't talk to some people because of the problem "Your privacy settings prevent chat with some people". I've looked up
 how to fix it and everything says I need to do it from a Xbox. Is there any way to do it from my PC?</p>

<h2>            Why am i getting banned by xbox for something so stupid&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ok so yall ban me for 2 weeks for apparently modding the game when i play the xbox one. So since it said i was cheating i guess that counts as a modder trolling me and deranking me!!!! cause if so yall really need to fix how yall ban people because thats really stupid when im getting trolled &nbsp;by modders and its not my fought if i go into domination then there is a XP lobby or instantly dying. so if yall read this UNBAN&nbsp;me im not waiting two weeks for modders messing with me and im not making new account to play. so if yall dont fix the stupidity yall have for banning my account then i guess i switch to better servers the PS4 cause i dought they will ban me for something like that. why have backwords capataible when people on 360 all mod old cods and we cant help it. so if yall dont fix this then im done. so yall better fix my account before i snap.</p>

    <title>Driver IRQL not less or equal - BSOD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrkleft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Driver IRQL not less or equal - BSOD</h2>
                    A few times in the past few days I've randomly got the dreaded blue screen with it saying "Driver IRQL not less or equal" and it's driving crazy.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The laptop is a Toshiba Satellite L850-1LK, 8 GB or RAM, Intel i3 processor and it's running windows 8.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've updated all the drivers but have got the error since. I'm not particularly computer savvy so I don't really know what to do from here.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I see quite a few people attach "mini dumps" to their posts but not being very good with a computer, I'm not sure what these are or how to get them on here.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be lovely.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the SkyDrive or other file
<br />
sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps copy
<br />
them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there. (This is NOT<br />
likely to help a lot on a new build).<br />
<br />
Zip or upload the contents of C:\Windows\minidump&nbsp; (Only AFTER you have performed<br />
all the initial suggestions at the top of this reply and IF the BSOD issues persist).
<p>Use SkyDrive to upload collected files<br />

===========================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: D1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000D1<br />
<br />
</strong>Think Video drivers mainly though it can be others. See the driver section in my generic
<br />
bluescreen troubleshooting methods below. BIOS, low level chipset drivers and <br />
antivirus/antispyway/security programs can also cause this.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: D1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000D1</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Bug Check 0xD1: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL <br />
<br />
</strong>The DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL bug check has a value of 0x000000D1. This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code</strong> </p>
<p><br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p><br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p><br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
<p><strong>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Parameters</strong> </p>
<p><br />
The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Cause</strong> </p>
<p><br />
A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high.</p>
<p><br />
This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.</p>
<p><br />
If the first parameter has the same value as the fourth parameter, and the third parameter indicates an execute operation, this bug check was likely caused by a driver that was trying to execute code when the code itself was paged out. Possible causes for the
 page fault include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The function was marked as pageable and was running at an elevated IRQL (which includes obtaining a lock).</p>
</li><li>
<p>The function call was made to a function in another driver, and that driver was unloaded.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The function was called by using a function pointer that was an invalid pointer.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p><br />
To begin debugging, use a kernel debugger to get a stack trace.</p>
<p><br />
If the problem is caused by the driver that you are developing, make sure that the function that was executing at the time of the bug check is not marked as pageable or does not call any other inline functions that could be paged out.
<br />

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<h2>            Remote Access to my desktop from an Android Tablet</h2>
                    I would like to access my desktop through the remote desktop protocol in windows 7 professional from my Lenovo thinkpad tablet. &nbsp;I have tried other remote applications (logmein, splashtop), but they are too slow. &nbsp;How can I set my tablet to connect with
 the desktop. &nbsp;I have seen how to do this from another laptop, but I can't figure out how to start it from the tablet.

            I would ask that you provide more information about your system and your video components so we can take a look at things (or you could just start trying things and hope you get lucky).<br />
<br />
What is "the program" you are closing that sometimes leaves the images on the screen?<br />
<br />
Have you had this problem "forever" or did it just start happening recently?&nbsp; If recently, on or about what day would you say this started happening?&nbsp; Microsoft updates came out on 10/11/2011 and if you accepted any video driver updates from MS, I can say that
 accepting MS driver offerings is generally not a good idea.&nbsp; Were things working fine prior to 10/11/2011?<br />
<br />
Note that if you boot into Safe Mode, only the XP default video drivers will be loaded (640 x 480 resolution and in 16 colors) and not your regular video drivers.&nbsp; Things you see will actually look much worse if they work at all.&nbsp; I think you wold be happiest
 to get things working when you boot your system normally, yes?<br />
<br />
If sfc /scannow fixes your issues, I will send you (or your favorite charity) $100 American.&nbsp; You can buy some good motorcycle paint for $100!<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
Now provide a few more details:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />
<br />
This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.<br />
<br />

How to Adjust your monitor's brightness and contrast</a> . You will find there a section how to adjust brightness automatically using adaptive brightness.<br />
<br />
You may also need to go to your laptop manufacturer website and look for a drivers. It might be necessary if you want to use keys on your keyboards to decrease/increase brightness.<br />
<br />
Depends on what Graphic Card do you have, go to its manufacturer website and see is there any software for controlling your graphic card. That kind of software may automatically adjust brightness when you unplug your laptop. It might be ATI Catalyst Control
 Center.. but everything depends what graphic card do you have, you need to find graphic cards manufacturer website.<br />

<p>Hi Deb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message that you encountered when attempting to add your printer device means that the printer's driver is either incompatible with the operating system or it is possibly damaged or incorrect. For us to provide better assistance, we would like
 to ask for additional information. Please answer the following: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What build and version of Windows 10 are you using?</li><li>Have you tried uninstalling the printer software then reinstall it back to check if the same issue will occur?</li><li>Can you please provide us a screenshot of the error message?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response. </p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to delete all print jobs from print queue:<br />
<br />
a. Go to Start, Control Panel and Administrative Tools. Double click on Services icon.<br />
b. Scroll down to the Print Spooler service and right click on it and select Stop. In order to do this, you need to be logged in as Administrator. At this point, no one will be<br />
able to print anything on any of the printers that are being hosted on this server.<br />
c. Next you need to go to the following directory: C:\WINDOWS\System32\spool\PRINTERS. Delete all the files in this folder. This will clear all print queues (itâ€™s a good idea to<br />
first make sure there are no other print jobs being processed on any of the other printers on the server because doing this step will delete those jobs also)<br />
d. Now you can go back to the Services console and right-click and choose Start for the Print Spooler service.</span></p>

<p>You have to stop the spooler first:</p>
<p>Open a Run window (Windows Logo key+R), type cmd and press Enter. Now type or copy/paste these commands, which are in capitals for clarity only:</p>
<p>NET STOP SPOOLER and press Enter<br />
DEL %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\SPOOL\PRINTERS\*.* and press Enter<br />
NET START SPOOLER and press Enter<br />
EXIT and press Enter</p>

<h2>            windows7 media player windows-64bit&#47;OS&#61; wmploc.dll is not designed to run</h2>
                    <p>I have un installed and re installed media player several times from the add features area.&nbsp; I get the</p>
<p>error message&gt;&gt;c:\windows\system32\wmploc.dll is either not designed to run on windows or it contains an error</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have windows7 64-bit installed and have followed the process to uninstall and reinstall the media player using the add features etc.</p>
<p>I did a clean install of the 64-bit O/S and all else is working fine : I also tried a windows 7 repair this did not fix the problem</p>
<p>I do not know why it refers to a file in the system32 when i installed a clean 64 bit O/S</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also tried&nbsp;using the download from Microsoft website that validated my O/S to be genuine</p>
<p>&nbsp;and gave me a password key to install&nbsp;media player 12 same results ( I tried this because I could not find the way to extract the file</p>
<p>from the windows 64-bit O/S&nbsp;media disk</p>

<h2>            Xbox One stuck at 50&#37; and crashes during factory reset</h2>
                    <p>My Xbox One has recently been getting slower so I decided to do a "Keep&nbsp;my games and apps" factory reset . However, during the process, it&nbsp;loaded up to 50% and then shows&nbsp;the "Something went wrong" screen. I tried&nbsp;restarting the console but to no avail. I then proceeded to do other methods, such as trying to do the "remove everything" reset, holding down the power button and even using the USB stick but all failed. Is&nbsp;there any way to&nbsp;fix my console?</p>

<h2>            PRINTER WILL NOT PRINT FROM COMPUTER</h2>
                    My printer is "offline" and I cannot get it online, and therefore I cannot print from my computer.&nbsp; I can print from the printer fine but whatever I type on the computer (documents) they will NOT print and I get an error message "turn on your printer,
 printer is offline).&nbsp; My printer IS on and stays on 24/7 using the "sleep method" but "awakes" very rapidly when I need to use it.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,<br />
1. Are you getting this error when you open System Protection?<br />
2. Are you aware of any changes made to the computer, prior to the issue?<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:<br />
Step 1: Safe mode<br />
</strong>Boot your computer in safe mode and check for the issue.<br />
Start your computer in safe mode<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a><br />
<strong>Step 2: Clean boot<br />
</strong>If you do not face the issue in safe mode, then put your computer in clean boot and check for the issue.<br />
How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
Note: Once you have determined the issue by using the clean boot procedure, please follow step 7 in the article to set your computer back to normal startup.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>Perform a system file checker scan and check for the issue.<br />
<strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong>Run a virus scan on your computer and check.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
Note: The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />
<br />
Important: While performing scanning on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when scanning tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.<br />

            <p>1. Are you getting this error when you open System Protection?<br />
Yes.</p>
<p>I tried the safe mode and the system protection option does not appear. After a while McAfee
</p>
<p>give me a warning saying my computer is at risk. I pull the plug on the modem. A McAfee&nbsp;window appears and says it is starting to turn the scanning option on but it just spins the little circle.&nbsp;Circle never stops spinning.On to Method 2&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have done method 2. Although I right click on run as&nbsp; administrator it still denied me access to the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to Windows 7&nbsp; hard drive C and changed access setting at cbs.log. Still denied access</p>
<p>&nbsp;Did this several times. finally got the file open. it was blank. I opened it in various programs. still blank. I finally presses shift-A and it highlighted about 10 spaces. The properties of the file says it is 1502 kb in size..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have previously run McAfee but will now try option three.</p>

            <p>I tried everything but nothing worked. I even went into DOS and found a file that was support to tell me which files windows couldn't fix. I detached my backup drive which also has a copy of windows 7 on it and the error message went away. Well I will &nbsp;boot
 off the other drive and if it still gives an error message at least I know all the things I can check</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello Atharva,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL error in Windows 8 is displayed as a dreaded Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). Just like other Blue Screen of Death errors, IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL errors arise from corrupt software installations, corrupt system files, incompatible
 or inappropriate device drivers and faulty hardware devices.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>What is the complete blue screen error message that you are getting on your screen?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Did you make any recent software or hardware changes to the computer?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Are you able to boot to the desktop?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ol>
</ol>
<p><span><span>If you are able to boot the computer, then I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1: Run Memory diagnostics</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Memory diagnostic tool will check and fix any issues with the computerâ€™s memory. You can refer these steps to run this tool.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press Windows key +X, select Control panel</span></li><li><span>Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons</span></li><li><span>Click on Administrative tools and select â€œWindows memory diagnosticâ€ and follow the prompts.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;If issue didnâ€™t get resolved try method 2,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 2: Update BIOS and chipset drivers</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This issue could also be caused due to outdated Basic Input Output system (BIOS) or chipset drivers. I would suggest you to visit the manufacturerâ€™s website to download and install the latest BIOS and chipset drivers.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Important: </span>
</span></strong><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>If you are unable to boot the computer, then I would suggest you to perform an Automatic repair. The Automatic repair can detect and fix the issues that prevent the computer from starting normally. You will need the
 Windows 8 disc to perform an Automatic repair. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 3: Automatic repair </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps given below to do automatic repair</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>When your computer starts, wait for the manufacturer logo to check the option for boot menu, it will usually be F12.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Restart the computer, keep pressing the Boot menu option key to enter the boot menu and change the boot option to CD\DVD ROM</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD". Press any key.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </span>
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click Repair your computer in the lower left corner</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on Troubleshooting, advanced option and then click Automatic repair.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>If issue still persists try method 4</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 4:&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span><span>I would also suggest you to refer the articles given below</span></span></p>

            Hi David.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps what I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I'm assuming you made two partitions:
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Click start &gt; right click computer &gt; click manage</div>
<div><br />
<div>On the left hand side click "Disk Management"</div>
<div><br />
<div>From here you can see your partitions, right click on the other drive and click mark partition as active</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you didn't make partitions and have two separate hard drives, this may or may not work, but I guess it wouldn't hurt to give it a shot, right?</div>
