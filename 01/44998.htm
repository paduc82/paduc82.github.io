</p><p>I have used Visio for decades, and still find Visio 2003 to be stable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked if any Bluetooth plugins are enabled as per online suggestions, and there are no Bluetooth plug ins</p>
<p>

            Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed on both laptops? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Visio 2016
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn‚Äôt resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you‚Äôll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.

<h2>            Mail App Deleted Folder Still won&#39;t sync properly with Outlook.com &#40;Web&#41;</h2>
                    <p>After the now 5 updates to this App (march 2017)... My Deleted folder still won't sync properly with Outlook.com (Web).</p>
<p>Deleted items do go into the Deleted folder in the App, and they will empty from the App... but they ALL flood back to the Apps Deleted folder.&nbsp; When I go to Outlook.com - I see the Deleted items ARE in the Deleted folder, but they don't empty, unless I
 manually empty them.&nbsp; The Win 10 Mail App never had this problem before these March updates came through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this one Folder to sync fully?&nbsp; Other Mail apps sync 100% with Outlook.com, including the App on my phone.&nbsp; So, it's not a server issue or an Outlook.com issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see there is a way to sync individual Folders with the Mail App in Windows 8, but not Windows 10 Mail App.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

            <p>A lot of issues started happening in the Mail and Calendar app (since the 3/7/2017 update). I'm not sure if Microsoft is already aware of these issues. (I've seen some threads saying that that have no issues in the premium version)</p>

            I mean the Outlook.com Premium account (the one with no ads). I haven't tried it myself, but I read some thread where they don't have sync issues when connecting an Outlook.com Premium account. I'll try to find the thread again~

                    <p>After update to Windows 10, my installed Visual Basic 5.0 will only work with the standard toolbox. When trying to add a new&nbsp;component &nbsp;from Project/Components like Microsoft Common Dialog Control, the message "Permission denied" will pop up. The new component
 will thus not be added to the tool box. This worked well in Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>

    <title>Video stutters on Surface Pro 2017 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seandp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video stutters on Surface Pro 2017</h2>
                    <p>I have downloaded movies from the MS Store.&nbsp; I use the Movies and TV app to watch them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I also download movies from Netflix to watch when flying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have noticed is that during these, without streaming, in airplane mode, the picture stutters, stops for 1-2 seconds, etc. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've researched it thoroughly trying anything I can to fix it...doesn't seem to do a damn thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Talk about frustrating.&nbsp; I dumped my iPad Pro because I needed to use the Pivot Tables on Excel for work.&nbsp; Now, I am thinking I'll need to carry two devices...one for work, and one for entertainment.&nbsp; This does not look good for MS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else run into that issue? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the 2017 MS Surface Pro, 8G Ram, i5, 256 GB Memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on this would be great if someone had this issue and doesn't now..</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, it only happens on downloaded movies.&nbsp; When I stream video or movies over wifi, there's zero issue at all.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Virtual Keyboard crashes and disappears in Windows 10 Tablet Mode</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The virtual keyboard that appears in tablet mode on my Windows 10 (2in1 lenovo yoga730) laptop randomly crashes and disappears, showing only its outline. This doesn't fix until I restart the laptop, but after a while of using tablet mode, the keyboard will
 crash and disappear again. Is this a driver issue, considering my laptop is new and in regular mode it's quite flawless? I really need the tablet mode to work as my work requires it. Can Microsoft please assist?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            Hi Musa.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok so I just checked the processes tab in Windows Task Manager (while tablet virtual keyboard is in invisible, non-responsive, crashed state) and I found 2 processes which I thought might be relevant: i)
<strong>Microsoft Text Input Application</strong> (its properties option shows this name: InputApp_cw5n1h2txyewy)and ii)
<strong>Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel</strong> (TabTip). Because I myself felt it was a 'crash' (i.e. the virtual tablet keyboard disappears randomly and just wouldn't reappear except with a pc restart so that's what I meant by it crashing) I thought
 if I END these processes and then have them restarted by thereafter going to tablet mode again, maybe the keyboard would finally appear again?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I tried terminating the 2nd process first, thereafter ending the first process that I mentioned seems to have done the trick: when I then went to tablet mode, the virtual keyboard finally came back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But clearly, the software/process behind this virtual keyboard is very unstable as it seems to crash quite easily, even without the laptop doing anything heavy. What should I do about that?</p>

<p>Hello!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried sfc /scannow. No errors were found. I will look into the rest of list, but considering I just purchased the laptop, can there really be missing files requiring a repair/reinstall of windows? Meanwhile, I posted another reply here with screenshots
 which gives some clue as to where the problem might be, if you could kindly see that?</p>

</p><p>I thought you were seeing an outline?&nbsp; Now it sounds like you may be seeing normal functionality and not understanding how it works.&nbsp; FWIW I think the TK is intentionally ephemeral.&nbsp; E.g. it closes at the slightest touch of a real keyboard's keys.&nbsp; Do you
 have a real keyboard attached when this is happening?&nbsp; Also, what exactly are you describing by "non-responsive"?&nbsp; Not coming back when you tap in an input field?&nbsp; Or not coming back when you try to click

 so it might be what you are seeing, but as soon as I tried to investigate (carefully avoiding using my real keyboard) that overlay disappeared. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The second process you found&nbsp; tabtip.exe&nbsp; is the one that I wanted you to use as a diagnostic.&nbsp; However, I now think that the&nbsp; TabletInputService&nbsp; service (which is an svchost.exe) is the real guts of this
 thing.&nbsp; When I use ProcExp (instead of Task Manager) to look at the task structure it is clear that tabtip.exe is started by that service and so killing the service would probably kill both.&nbsp; In fact, I think I sort of proved that by trying to stop the service.&nbsp;
 Note that after the stop attempt that both are running and both have different PIDs.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I don't know what you would need to do to get both back otherwise.&nbsp; So far, killing tabtip.exe as I described has been sufficient to demonstrate how the process works but I still don't know what exactly
 the TK window needs when it is open.&nbsp; It's not just tabtip.exe because normally that process remains running after the TK is closed, by whatever of the multiple ways of closing it is used.</p>

</p><p>By nothing happens, I mean literally nothing. If there is an otherwise clickable object in that transparent region, clicking on it will not do anything. By clicking on the TK sign on the taskbar, I can make the outline disappear (i.e. the invisible ghost
 keyboard is invisibly popping out) and then the whole screen is interactive again. If I then click on the TK sign on the taskbar or some text input field in order to trigger the keyboard to pop in, the outline reappears with the region below it transparent
 but uninteractive. The only fix is a pc restart. Other people have had this problem too, from what I read online.</p>

</p><p>OK.&nbsp; So, the hang state of the TK persists even when the TK window is closed.&nbsp; Did you try killing the TabletInputService Service?&nbsp; (Or just stopping it the way that I demonstrated in the other thread.) &nbsp; Repeated here for convenience: &nbsp;

<p>I actually did that in an Administrator Windows PowerShell window but the syntax is the same if you want to do it in an Administrator Command Prompt cmd window instead.</p>

<p>Hi Musa.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the laptop is new, I would contact Lenovo under the included one-year Support, Repair and replacement warranty.&nbsp; During this time they must either get it running properly, repair or replace it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's important for such highly technical problems
 that this be done soon so that if it's repaired or replaced you can make sure the repair or replacement is sorted before the one year expires.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
The checklist is designed to make sure Windows is working correctly, optimized and maintained best.&nbsp; If there are no broken system files and drivers fully up to date, then there's no point in doing the Repair Update unless you have a newer version in which
 case it's the most stable method to install it.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I have the same problem and symptoms, except of the keyboard becomes fully invisible without any faint lines. And sometimes after that (approximately from 20 seconds to a minute or more) the keyboard recovers (it seems like something restarts its process).
 While in crash it seems like the keyboard continues to overlay the screen under itself (while being fully transparent), so I can't tap on any elements under it. But the upper part of the screen (which is not overlaid) continues to accept any taps. I bought
 my tablet (other model than yours) several months ago, and all were fine several weeks. But it seems that after some update the problem appears - it is about two months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The temporal solution for me is to place the shortcut to the&nbsp;<span>TabTip.exe</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ink\TabTip.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>on the upper part of the desktop and run it after each crash.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>PS. Ahh, and one more thing... This virtual keyboard (Windows 10's <span>TabTip</span>) is very, VERY slow and laggy. My previous tablet with Win 8 32 bit, 2 GB RAM and Atom 1.33 GHz from 2013 year had much, MUCH faster and responsive virtual keyboard. Why
 did you (Windows team) do it so bad? Even cheap Chinese Android smartphone has a better default virtual keyboard than yours. Sorry guys, but this madden like hell. "Wanna fast typing? - Not with us." And now another critical bug with keyboard. These two problems
 make your virtual keyboard completely useless.</p>

<h2>            Right Clicking in Windows Explorer does not work and then crashes.</h2>
                    Whenever I right click on a folder, file or simply anything in the windows explorer, it crashes (Windows Explorer is not responding) and it restarts.<br />
Even in safe mode this happens.<br />
I have done many scans with many different programs and nothing seems to be found.<br />
Left clicking works just fine, but it is right clicking that does not work.<br />
It is not the mouse for the laptop's mouse-pad's right click does not work either.<br />
I have tried using the shell extension viewer, disabling all non-Microsoft extensions, and the problem still persists.<br />
Right clicking works everywhere else, on the desktop, in internet explorer/chrome, and even in other programs; It is only windows explorer that does not work.<br />
<br />
I cannot seem to find the problem and I really need help with this.

            This is what the report gave me and I have no idea what it means or what to do.

Remarks: * The program probably hangs because there is an infinite loop, very long loop, or recursive calls.

            <p>There were several fairly recent bugchecks reported and it may be beneficial to take a look at the minidump files from these crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available via MediaFire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there were recurring application errors involving Asus Rotation Desktop so I would suggest to uninstall, at least temporarily,&nbsp;Asus Rotation Desktop.&nbsp;</p>

Here's the minidump file.<br />

And the Asus Rotational Desktop only crashes when I open it, I never open it anymore.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer the below question to assist you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you referring to task view feature "Multiple desktops" in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, please be informed that you cannot have apps/programs automatically startup in&nbsp;different desktops.
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/multiple-desktops-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/multiple-desktops-in-windows-10</a>#</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you open a lot of programs at once, this feature allows you to keep them organized.
</p>
<p>i.e., you can move apps between multiple desktops. Once you restart/sign-out, the applications on all these desktops will be closed. The opened files/programs will be closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may provide your suggestions in the feedback app. </span></p>
<p><span>It will be directly referred by our <strong>developer‚Äôs team </strong>for further improvement.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Start, enter the phrase Windows Feedback, and then select Windows Feedback.</li><li>See if someone else has given similar feedback by entering the topic, such as Microsoft Music.</li><li>If you find similar feedback, select it, add any details, and then select Me too.</li><li>To narrow your search to a specific category, pick the category that most closely matches your feedback (so it gets to the right people quickly). For example, for feedback about the Music app, select Apps &gt; Music.</li><li>If you don‚Äôt find any similar feedback, select New Feedback, and choose a topic from Select a category and then select a subcategory.
</li><li>Enter your feedback (the more details the better!), add a screenshot if you can, and you're done.</li></ol>
<p><span>Hope the information helps, do reply if you need further assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

    <title>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL while clean-installing windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom&#225;Â°sou‰çek  say:</h3>
<h2>            DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL while clean-installing windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I updated my laptop via standard update process from Win 7 to Win 10. Then I decided to do clear installation, so I created bootable USB using Media Creation Tool, booted it... I got to to point where I changed the HDD sectors and reformated it in order
 to install Win 10. Then I clicked "next."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen "copying files (0%)" showed up for 2 seconds and then BSOD with message DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (with no specific file) popped up.</p>
<p>Any suggestion what to do? Since i formatted the HDD, it's impossible to boot up the old version. As I searched for solution, it seemed that the error could be caused by ESET's antivirus (previously installed), but could it (since the HDD is formatted)?
 And if so, there would be "no readable files" to modify on formatted HDD, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>Generic replies <em>always</em> help. I asked the question because I searched the web and did not find any solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately I managed to solve the issue even without the help like <em>"Where can I download Windows 10? -- On the internet! Wow, how&nbsp;helpful..."</em> or&nbsp;<em>"If you experience a blue screen error when upgrading to Windows 10, setup will automatically go
 back to your previous version of Windows."</em></p>
<p>Since there was no previous version (as stated in my question), none of the links helped.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So for people, who would be having the same issues, here is how I solved it.</p>
<p>I created Ubuntu live USB, booted it in "<em>try it</em>" mode. Using it's system tools, I formatted the laptop's HDD. Then rebooted with Microsoft's Media Creation Tool. It, as always, created 3 additional partitions (2x16MB + 1x100MB)&nbsp;for some system stuff
 but in the next step, the BSOD showed up again. For some weird reason, it restarted and booted from the USB again (never happened before) and then I went through the process once more. But in this case the Media Creation Tool created only one system partition
 (500MB) and then it got through the installation process flawlessly.<br />

            <p>Seems like you got it working. I am having the same problem and I had previously formatted the &nbsp;hard drive in order to clean install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How did you format the hard drive with Ubuntu?<br />
I've tried it too with no luck.</p>

    <title>Windows Media Player won&#39;t run - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frcraig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player won&#39;t run</h2>
                    I've just upgraded to Windows 8.1. &nbsp;I prefer Windows Media Player 12 to the music app, but when I try to run Windows Media Player, the "Welcome to Windows Media Player choose initial settings" window pops up. &nbsp;Whether I choose recommended settings or custom
 settings, when I click "finish" the window immediately pops back up. &nbsp;I can't get further than this.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So far I've tried removing and re-installing WMP in Control Panel/Programs and Features/Turn off Windows Features. &nbsp;I've run the troubleshooter, which doesn't report any problems. &nbsp;I've deleted the Media Player folder as per some of the tech suggestions
 on here. &nbsp;I've added a registry string to run wmplayer.exe as System Administrator.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In searching for the problem on the internet I found a posting from one person who said Microsoft Tech support told her the problem was caused by a corrupt user account profile, and the tech created a new profile and migrated her files which fixed the
 problem. &nbsp;That is over my head, and I can't see how that would prevent WMP from getting past the initial settings screen. &nbsp;It only takes a second after clicking "finish" for the window to pop right back up, but if I do a quick screen capture, in that second
 or two in between there is a message saying "building windows media library".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions on how to get WMP going?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Craig</div>

            <p>Hi Flakburst,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check with the manufacturer for the compatibility of the game and also for the assistance on the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the game is not compatible then you may run the game in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may refer the article for more information:</p>

                    <p><b>Xbox One S&nbsp;Controller / Play &amp;&nbsp;Charge Kit</b></p><p>Afternoon, I've recently replaced 2 original Xbox One consoles&nbsp;with 2 Xbox One S consoles, I kept my original genuine </p><p>Play &amp;&nbsp;Charge Kits (3 of them) and my Lunar White Controller.</p><p>I took the genuine Microsoft batteries out of my old controllers and installed in my new Xbox&nbsp;One S&nbsp;controllers.</p><p>The issue I appear to be having is the Xbox One S controllers vibrate when I plug in via the cable but the LED does not light up orange to say charging or white to say charged.&nbsp; The batteries / cables work fine in my Lunar White Controller but don't appear to work with the Xbox&nbsp;One S&nbsp;controllers.&nbsp;</p><p>I've updated the firmware on the controllers but this doesn't help, I'm currently having to switch the batteries in to my Lunar White Controller to&nbsp;recharge.</p><p>Any suggestions and is anyone else experiencing this problem?</p><p>Many thanks,</p><p>Nick.</p>

            <p>I've never had an issue as a result of letting Disk Cleanup delete all that it finds when doing a '<em>basic'</em> scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I also run the <em>'Cleanup System Files'</em> (Windows Old, etc.) option after an upgrade or large update such as 1607,&nbsp;
</p>
<p>as this is where the larger amount of disk space is likely to be recovered.</p>
<p>However, I also make a clone of my Windows before a major event such as 1607, so these files
</p>
<p>are not as important to me as they would be if I had no backup of Windows. </p>
<p>Generally the Cleanup System Files option should not be used until you are certain Windows and your software
</p>
<p>are all functioning properly. A couple of weeks is should be long enough to discover any major issue.
</p>
<br />

            Dear Microsoft the problem with Minecraft W10 described above happens even for adult accounts. Of course I've tried also with child account with required permissions. The same happens in both cases. So it's not related to child's account settings if adult
 account cannot connect to the multiplayer servers. Please do something with it.

<p>Same here... I got ARK to play with my friend since he has a xbox one. I tried to change the settings by creating a family with my friends account because I the Xbox Settings page wouldn't even open when I wasn't in a family. It just redirected me to the
 page where it tells me how to change my accounts privay setting. Please fix this soon Microsoft.</p>

            Same thing happening for me - for at least half a year now. Should it help in anyway: when attempting to save any changes the first time, the requests results in a 404 Conflict with the Message "Call to Privilege Settings Service resulted in a conflict.".
 Trying to save changes after that, won't result in any errors, but no settings are actually changed after reloading the page.

            <p>If its a retail full or upgrade version, you can transfer it to new motherboard and reactivate by telephone.</p>
<p>If its an OEM license (which means it came preloaded with the old motherboard, you cannot transfer that license to a new motherboard). OEM licenses are not transferable.</p>
<p>If its a retail upgrade version of Windows 7, the computer you are transfering it to must have a previous full version license (XP or Vista)</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 crash just after log in</h2>
                    Just upgraded my hp dv9000 laptop from vista to 7.&nbsp; System starts up just fine and get to log in screen, but when i log in it crashes.&nbsp; when i restart into safe mode this problem does not occur.&nbsp; An event report pops up with the following info:<br />
<br />
<br />
Problem signature:<br />
&nbsp; Problem Event Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BlueScreen<br />
&nbsp; OS Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.1.7600.2.0.0.768.3<br />
<br />
Additional information about the problem:<br />

&nbsp; BCP1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0000000F<br />
&nbsp; BCP2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 000201CC<br />

the fact that this only happens in normal mode but not safe mode leads me to believe this can be easily repaired.&nbsp; Any help in resolving this situation is greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            You can try a new user profile, and if it works, delete the old one. You upgraded so it's&nbsp;possible to copy the data from old to new, if you want to try it.<br />

<p>Usually the birthday skin packs are only released onto xbox live for a limited time (around the birthday of Minecraft). &nbsp;Keep an eye on the for the next birthday of Minecraft, chances are the skin pack will be released again at that time.</p>

<p>Need help rescuing my Win 10 O/S and data from a failing hard drive in my Dell Inspiron 5559. Hard drive O-O-O DST Long Test error code 2000-0142 Validation 85679. How can I back up the entire bootable drive and load it on the replacement drive? The current
 drive still boots and operates with intermittent errors. I have an external 2 TB drive and want to locate suitable&nbsp;1 TB replacement drive for the laptop. It is 6 months out of warranty.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Markus.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If the drive is failing,  I'd replace it with an SSD which is the best Upgrade one can have - lightning fast, faster than a new higher-end PC without one.
<br />
<br />The problem with imaging the  old drive over is if there are bad sectors it could have damaged or missing data or System Files.  You can try it but ultimately you may decide to do the superior Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To transfer an image use the best and most flexible free imaging app Macrium here: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            Do yourself a real favor and settle for a 500GB SSD instead of a 1TB HD!  The price should be in the same range, but the perceived performance boost will be unbelievable. Many SSD drives come with a tool to help do the migration.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise in general what you need to do is use an "image copy backup" tool that creates a bootable USB drive.  You make an image copy backup of your current setup to your external USB HD.  Install the replacement drive, then boot using teh Bootable USB you created for the backup tool and restore the image from the backup to newly installed drive
<br />
<br />Google for "windows 10 migrate to ssd", I got lots of hits with specific instructions.

<h2>            User is not provisioned in Skype for business</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've got a few users who can not be provisioned in Skype. They've got E3 licenses with Skype plan2 checked. They used to be provisioned on local lync server years ago. Now the local lync server has been decommissioned for more than a year. These uses has
 sip address in attributes and I've removed it from the attributes and synced to online users for 24 hours. But they are still not showing up on Skype users list.</p>
<p>How can I manually provision the user?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Lydia</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>these users are not provisioned on Skype for Business because as you said they used to be configured for use with On Premises</p>
<p>It seems the decommissioning process has not been done following the best practices, meaning their AD account still have reference to the on prem environment</p>
<p>You need to manually clean the value on all attribute used by Lync/Skype for business before being able to enable them for Skype for Business Online</p>
<p>1 unassigned the Sfb license on Office 365</p>
<p>2 synch with AD</p>
<p>3 clean the attributes</p>
<p>* msRTCSIP-DeploymentLocator</p>
<p>* msRTCSIP-FederationEnabled</p>
<p>* msRTCSIP-InternetAccessEnabled</p>
<p>* msRTCSIP-OptionFlags</p>
<p>* msRTCSIP-PrimaryHomeServer</p>
<p>* msRTCSIP-PrimaryUserAddress</p>
<p>* msRTCSIP-UserEnabled</p>
<p>* msRTCSIP-UserPolicies</p>
<p>* msRTCSIP-UserRoutingGroupId</p>
<p>4 synch with Office 365</p>
<p>5 enable the Sfb license</p>
