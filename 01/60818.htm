<h2>            Money got deducted from my bank account but I didn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t receive Gold Membership</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased the 3 month Xbox live Gold membership. The payment went through with my bank and I am now £15 pounds poorer but I am still getting error messages when join parties because I don't have gold.</p>
<p>I purchased it on my xbox with enough money in my bank. I don't know why support wants me to post on a community forum when the problem is not fixable by anyone here because no one here is staff.</p>
<p>If possible could someone here give me contact details to actual microsoft staff because this is stupid.</p>

<h3> nikkiwright  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multi-colored shield that downloaded some security program and it&#39;s messing up my computer.</h2>
                    This supposed security program popped up while I was browsing, and started checking for viruses.&nbsp; I couldn't get it to stop, and now my computer is really slow and has to be rebooted all the time.&nbsp; It is a multicolored shield, with the same colors as Windows.&nbsp;
 I deleted what I could find in my programs, but every time I shut the computer down, it asks me if I want to install updates, and shows that icon.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me what it is and how can I get rid of it?&nbsp; I'm pretty technologically challenged so keep that
 in mind when answering :)&nbsp; I THINK I'm running XP, but it's an old work computer and I'm not sure.&nbsp; I tried to get that info by going to start and then my computer but it won't even let me do that.

    <title>Windows 10 Insecure Connection error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ginaw522  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Insecure Connection error</h2>
                    <p>Ever since updating to Windows 10 I constantly get Insecure Connection issues randomly with various websites. It can last 5 minutes, 5 hours or longer. Even Google comes up like this:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Your connection is not secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The owner of www.google.com has configured their website improperly. To protect your information from being stolen, Firefox has not connected to this website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does not matter if I'm using Firefox, or IE, it does it with both browsers on whatever website it decides to do it on at the time.&nbsp; Others with this issue had their date/year incorrect on their system, or were running Kaspersky antivirus. My date/year is
 correct and I do not run Kaspersky. I run Trend Micro, and I'm at my wits end with happening multiple times a day or week.</p>

<h3> jz91  say:</h3>
<h2>            Thousands of Security Events, hundreds per hour &#43; intense periodic lag, need some insight</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay so this is kind of two problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>About two weeks ago, I started experiencing major lag in all the video games I play.&nbsp; Not constant, but every few minutes.&nbsp; I have a decent system, my current specs are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>CPU: i7-6700k (3 years old)</p>
<p>GPU: Nvidia GTX1070 (6 months old)</p>
<p>RAM: 16GB DDR4 (3 years old)</p>
<p>SSD: Liteon 128GB (Windows only)</p>
<p>HDD: Seagate Barracuda 1TB</p>
<p>Mobo is proprietary I believe as it's an Acer Predator desktop, but I think I read it's a Z170 model</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I ran the IPDT and my processor was fine, no weird GPU spikes, RAM is a constant amount in low 50% in games, and drives aren't being pushed to full utilization. PSU was replaced. Crystal Disk Info shows nothing worrying in terms of my drives.&nbsp; Memtest86
 didn't appear to find any RAM issues. All drivers are fully updated.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>All of my temperatures are in normal ranges and everything is connected and clean in my case</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay.&nbsp; So now, after checking all of that, I started looking at other things, software related.&nbsp; I hadn't downloaded anything new so that couldn't be it.&nbsp; Ran a virus scan, didn't turn anything up.&nbsp; So I decided to check event viewer, which I rarely do,
 but I noticed I had <strong>thousands</strong> of security events, all from <strong>
one day.</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;I looked them up, but I'm not a programmer and couldn't even decipher the simplified explanation of what they did.&nbsp; However, I thought maybe the windows update KB4493509 may be causing issues, as that's roughly when the problem started.&nbsp;
 So I uninstalled it, cuz, I was out of ideas.&nbsp; Didn't seem to fix anything, and things actually felt more unstable.&nbsp; Restore wouldn't work, and when I tried do a sfc or dism, I was getting errors I couldn't get around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I reset windows, full wiped both of my drives, and started fresh.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The lag is still present</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm all fully updated again, but upon opening event viewer, I'm once again plagued with 1400 security events in the two hours since my reset.&nbsp; I did some looking around, and found other posts of people saying they felt that this was coinciding with reduced
 performance in their computers.&nbsp; Many of these are apparently a Logon Process called&nbsp;<strong>Advapi</strong>.&nbsp; I don't know what that is, but it's the only coherent thing I could relate between many of the entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d7baf0bb-78e6-49fa-b480-de53d9e75db7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d7baf0bb-78e6-49fa-b480-de53d9e75db7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have&nbsp;<strong>two questions I need an answer to...</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question One</strong>:&nbsp; &nbsp;What the heck are all of these security events?&nbsp; &nbsp;Are they cause for concern?&nbsp; In the past I'd looked in here and saw a few, but spaced out and definitely not a nonstop flood.&nbsp; How can I stop them, and is this Advapi something
 I need?</p>
<p><strong>Question Two:</strong>&nbsp; If the Microsoft masters here feel that this can't possibly be the cause of my issue, is there anything you could suggest I try next in the path of trying to fix my computer, which I've spent an enormous amount of time on
 the last couple weeks trying to fix?&nbsp; Please bear in mind that I'm not a programmer or anything and I'm not necessarily comfortable editing registry or anything without explicit instruction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for taking the time to read, and thank you in advance for any assistance you can offer me.</p>

<p>Security auditing is enabled by default in Windows 10, so you should expect to see thousands of these events, one after another, and that's completely normal. At the moment I have 32,145 of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By itself, the sheer number of events means nothing. They require context to be interpreted. For example, the audits are conducted against policies setup in the Group Policy Editor, so you would need to know what those policies are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not saying that what you are seeing is totally meaningless. It's just that by itself, and particularly the sheer number, you can't draw any conclusions. You would need much more analysis to understand what you are seeing</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can read about Windows security auditing on the internet, where it's all explained in detail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's more indicative is the "intense periodic lag" you are experiencing. If it only happens when you are playing games, that's more likely to be associated with the games, which can make substantial demands on your computer's resources, as you probably
 know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would do in your place is to either contact the games' technical support or (even better) post your question in their own community forum.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn't say your computer is 'done for' - not yet, at least. My computer turned 9 in March and it runs Windows 10 really well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's tempting to blame everything on Microsoft's updates - they've certainly earned it - but in truth that's not often the case. Windows PCs are built on many layers of hardware and software that come from different places, so it's not surprising (to me)
 that things don't always work well. Companies like Apple and Google have it easier: Apple, because they build their own hardware; and Google, because so much of the software that runs on a Chromebook is subject to Google's control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A wise developer once explained to me that all software has bugs, lots of them. There are some bugs a developer knows about and will fix; other bugs that they know about and won't fix - either because it's too complicated or it doesn't affect enough users;
 and many other bugs that they don't know about and can't even imagine until it actually affects a computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is definitely a reason for the lag you are experiencing; it's only a matter of how much effort you want to spend to uncover it. You might have to experiment with dozens of (carefully considered, not random) potential fixes until you find success and
 you may never succeed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When all else fails, a clean install is always a possibility. (A reset is a type of clean install.) A clean install
<em>a lot</em> of work if you want to do it really well. But, surprisingly enough, sometimes a clean install actually makes things
<em>worse</em>, because it eliminates legacy code that was helping a computer run better. That may be what happened in your case.</p>

<p>Oof, my computer is only 3 and going through this!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally I really don't blame Windows updates or anything haha, this was only a very obvious correlation between when the last update happened, and when my computer started experiencing issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>That makes sense to me, the whole not fixing bugs that don't affect a lot of users, and that some are undiscovered.&nbsp; &nbsp;Part of me is tempted to wait until the May update to see if this is all ironed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have expended a great deal of effort to figuring out this problem.&nbsp; As I said in the OP, I've tested all of my hardware individually to rule all of them out as the cause.&nbsp; I don't really think I've tried anything 'random', per se, as my uninstalling the
 update was based on a few different articles I'd read stating that the update had caused lag for users, that I could provide the links for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My choice to reset the computer was based on the instability experienced after uninstalling the update, the fact I couldn't system restore, and the fact that there was corruption I couldn't fix with sfc or dism, and was unable to get to a place where they
 could help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm more than willing to put the effort in to fixing this issue, but I've run out of things to try.&nbsp; Are there any more suggestions of things you think may help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also don't fully understand your last paragraph, as I'm unfamiliar with the term legacy code, or what it would do.&nbsp; I believe the type of clean install I did would be referred to as a factory reset?&nbsp; It wiped both drives clean, and then only put on Windows,
 basics drivers, and some manufacturer specific programs that were included initially.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really do appreciate all the time&nbsp; you've taken to help, and if there's anything more you can suggest, I would be so grateful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>It's not a matter of price; it's not possible to upgrade from Vista to 10. The only way to get to 10 is by buying it and doing a clean installation of it.</p>

<h3> mados123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Lifecam Cinema webcam, 1280x720 30fps&#63;</h2>
                    I have been using this webcam with great appreciation for the hardware but having to use the generic USB Camera driver to get the advertised 30fps at HD resolution.&nbsp; When will this camera be officially supported at the performance levels that are advertised?!&nbsp;
 It's not acceptable to have to use a work around that restricts the camera's ability to be used with the software it is designed to work with!<br />
<br />
This camera has tremendous potential.&nbsp; Please MS, do the right thing!<br />
<br />
Thank you.

            Hi mados123,<br />
<br />
a) Have you installed the latest drivers for the Microsoft Lifecam Cinema webcam?<br />
<br />
It is compatible with Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Some devices have drivers that you need to install yourself. If you download a driver that isn't self-installing, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
<strong>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</strong>
<br />
<br />
Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Security, and then, under System, clicking Device Manager.&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.‌<br />
<br />
In the list of hardware categories, find the device that you want to update, and then double-click the device name.<br />
<br />
Click the Driver tab, click Update Driver, and then follow the instructions.&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />

            Yes, I did do all that was suggested above before making this observation.&nbsp; The 30fps at 1280x720 isn't available using the latest MS Lifecam Cinema software and only is available using that workaround (generic USB driver).&nbsp; Is there an expected date of
 completion for the software/drivers to be up to par with the hardware?<br />

            I'm experiencing the same issue. 720p @ 30fps is not supported by the Microsoft drivers (yes, the latest ones). It was advertised as such, and that was the reason I purchased it.<br />

Here is a third-party publication confirming this limitation:<br />

            Same here on Win7 64-bit, i7 940 2.93GHz machine with 8GB of RAM. HD at 30fps is why I bought this camera. Now, if it would only operate as advertised, I would be happy. As it stands, I've wasted I don't know how many hours trying to get the piece of ____
 to work. Can I bill Gates?

            Is anyone able to provide any type of resolution to this?&nbsp; Especially from MS.&nbsp; The MS drivers do NOT allow for 30 FPS which is false advertising as many of us purchased this camera with the understanding it had 30fps.&nbsp; NONE of the resolutions are providing
 30FPS, I shouldn't have to hack the system up to get what was advertised to me.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Microsoft LifeCam software is optimized to provide the best customer experience for video capture. The LifeCam software will limit the frame rate from the Webcam to what is reliably achievable by the system. While a camera may be capable of achieving 30
 frames per second (fps) many computers are not capable of capturing video at 30fps at higher resolutions. This process has been established to ensure that users get the smoothest video possible with their different systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Ensure you have the most current version of the LifeCam Software, which is version 3.5 and available here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/download/download.aspx?category=ICE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/download/download.aspx?category=ICE</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Another option would be to use the Expression Encoder, Expression Encoder<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/download/download.aspx?category=ICE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> is available as a free download free allows users to select resolution, microphone, bit rate,

            I wonder what kind of computer is "capable" of capturing at 30 fps? Since clearly my Quad core with 6Gb cannot do it in W7 64bit. Could it be that this artificial limit is broken and doesn't work with any computer?

    <title>Windows 10 Multiple Monitor Alignment&#58; Unwanted Snapping &#38; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> h_zr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Multiple Monitor Alignment&#58; Unwanted Snapping &#38; Lack of precise placement</h2>
                    I have two monitors that vary slightly in vertical resolution: my first monitor is 1680x1050 and my second monitor is 1920x1080. I like to have them side-by-side with the top of the displays aligned. However, when I go to "Customize your display" and attempt
 to align the monitors vertically, because the resolutions are so similar they will always snap such that the bottom of both displays are aligned, and not the top (see image below). I have managed to align them properly by holding Ctrl to disable automatic
 snapping and dragging them into place in a pixel-perfect manner, but that tedious process only succeeds occasionally. Sometimes, even if it appears the two monitors are lined up, they may be off by just one pixel and I must retry again and again until they
 are lined up properly. Is there an easier way to properly align the monitors? Ideally I would like the monitors to snap by the top, or be able to adjust the relative placement of each display exactly as needed.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cba77d13-06a7-41ea-ad35-a1e42986990c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cba77d13-06a7-41ea-ad35-a1e42986990c" /></a>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience that occurs to you in aligning the displays in the moniors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret to inform you but unfortunately, this is the only way to personalize the display in such a way that the upper layer are aligned. You will have to drag the display as per the requirement.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do reply if you come across further related queries.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            USB Audio - Very Faint Sound</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to connect my Surface Pro to a DAC via USB.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the sound is barely audible over USB.&nbsp; No problems with the headphone jack, speakers or audio over the A/V
 output.&nbsp; I have tested drivers, troubleshooting, tried disabling and re-enabling USB audio connection, moved the audio sliders around, double checked everything.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?&nbsp; I was really hoping to connect the surface to my audio system but I would like to take advantage of the better external DAC I have.&nbsp;

<p>Hi spyaxman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most games have subtitle or language options within the game settings and some games while default the language setting with what is on your Xbox system settings. If you bought a redeemable code from the Microsoft store on your Xbox then the code will have
 been coded to represent the game that is available in your region. If the game does not have Pt-Pt then that is just what is available for that game as well as FH4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an FAQ regarding Xbox One Locales: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/locale-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/locale-faq</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure all of you language and location settings are set to your correct region and preferred language:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/system-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/system-settings</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any questions regarding the available Languages for either game I suggest contacting their customer support:

                    I used the windows 7 trial version which will expire in 24 days.&nbsp; Now I have bought the full version and I have a valid product key but cannot work out how to apply the new product key.

<p>You will have to backup whatever data you have installed and do a custom clean install. There is no upgrade path from the trial to the full version and you cannot convert it either.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>user accounts duplicated on logon screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> untz  say:</h3>
<h2>            user accounts duplicated on logon screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed Windows10 Enterprise on several laptops at work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For some odd reason, after the computer has been put to sleep, upon waking up (or waking up from hibernation), the logon screen suddenly shows duplicated user accounts for login.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Windows was first installed I had two options for logging in:</p>
<p>
</p><p>UserA<br />
Other User</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the scenarios described above, the screen shows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>UserA</p>
<p>UserA</p>
<p>Other User</p>
<p>Other User</p>
<p>
</p><p>The weird part is that the next time I hibernate the computer, upon waking it up THIS is what I see:</p>
<p>
</p><p>UserA</p>
<p>UserA</p>
<p>UserA</p>
<p>Other User</p>
<p>Other User</p>
<p>Other User</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I even have to restart the whole machine to be able to login again, beacuse if I restart it the "surplus" accounts are removed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw some users complainng about this happening in Windows7 - they removed biometric login options (fingerprint, facial recognition), and it was OK.
</p>
<p>My problem is that this image is installed using PXE boot. It's&nbsp;a completely plain image I'm working with here..no preinstalled software at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else experienced this with Windows10 on laptops?</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now tried another approach:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted the computer, "acted if" i was going to log in, but instead of typing the password, I wait and then it goes back to the lock screen. When hitting a key to get to the logon screen to type the password, a new user account duplicate shows up every
 time. Both for UserA and for Other User. I right now have EIGHT of each user accounts visible on the screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>untz</p>

            Hi DavidGuitard1,
<br />
<br />Have you recently updated your windows?
<br />
<br />I would like you to please see the below mentioned article, If it doesn't solve your problem please feel free to ask back any question. One more thing please, don't download any third party software for driver update of for system scan.
<br />
