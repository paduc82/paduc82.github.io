<h2>            Disable power button on console</h2>
                    
<p>Is it possible to disable the power button on the front of the Xbox One? &nbsp;My toddler loves to press the button and keeps turning the console on/off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Currently there is no way to do this but you can always suggest ideas to <a href="http://xbox.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>The only issue I think there might be with disabling it however is you wouldn't be able to do a hard reset if the console locked up. You would have to yank the power cable out which I can't imagine is good for it.</p>

<p>I have the exact same issue. My 17 month old son sees the power button lit up like a beacon attracting him to it even more :( I am shocked that you cannot choose what pushing the power button does = "power off", "restart" "nothing" , jesus my windows PC
 back in 1995 had those choices !! &nbsp;I am actually choosing just not to play the console for this very 1 reason, as many times he has turned it off mid game (not his fault. Bright shining light + younger child = hopeless)</p>
<p>I even tried electrical tape = nope. I tried placing a plastic panel over the front cut from an old dvd box = nope. The button is so stupidly sensitive you don't actually have to touch it, just glance your finger within 1mm of the button and it turns the
 console off.</p>

<p>you can try taping a thick fold of paper to the xbox it wont look pretty but it will keep the button from being pushed. make sure its nice and tight so the child can't pull it off. lol i baby sit a lot. i had to learn ways of keeping my console safe.</p>

<p>Lol the power button is unnecessarily overly sensitive. Honestly with how hot the system gets I'm shocked its own temperature doesnt trigger it without any physical help.</p>
<p>For me, my cats too often walk by the console regardless of where i place the system. The thing is their fur usually triggers it despite even when i can visibly see a reasonable gap between her coat and the console. So its moreso picking up more heat than
 physical sensory. Which in my opinion is a terrible concept for a power button on any entertainment device.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Technical Support Phone Scam - How did they get my cell number&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm so glad I look into this after the phone call from " tech support"!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Yesterday my computer was taking a long time to update so I turned it off to see what it was updating.&nbsp; 30 mins. later I get a call from a middle eastern guy stating he was from Microsoft and my computer was not sending or receiving updates. My first thought
 was how did he get my number? Its a new number? And to my knowledge not connected with anything online. And the last I spoke with someone about my computer it was with my old cell number. So I was confused and shocked&nbsp; someone contacted me about my computer.
 Well I guess luckily I wasn't feeling well "personal female issues" and I snapped!&nbsp;LOL&nbsp; The number was "unavailable" and I received&nbsp; 5 calls before his&nbsp; same day, so I ask was it him soliciting was it him calling all day?&nbsp;&nbsp;I barely let him talk but I did hear
 him ask if i was by my computer o he could show me what he was talking about.</p>
<p>And I was actually on my computer, so I told him I was and I wasn't having any problem. and if its not broken no need to fix anything and he was not getting into my computer. Then he hung up.&nbsp; So I'm</p>
<p>just wonder how did he get my new number and how did he know I did not finish updating my computer? I usually do let my computer do an automated update on it own, but I think now I will go in and see what's being updated. I always have protection on my computer
 I use Kaspersky&nbsp; and run aclean up one a week. but lately its been misbehaving, and I just thought its time for a new one, it is 3 years old. So am I to think someone already has some kind of access to my computer?
</p>

            <p>That's a scam and has nothing to do with Microsoft. Don't give them any info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They could have gotten your phone number in a million different ways. From being on a marketing list, to random dialing lists of phones numbers to malware on a friend's Android smartphone that has your number stored on it.</p>

<h2>            Skype call history</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>How come my skype calls placed through my ipad do no show on my iphone chat history. They appear as a recent call but do not show as part of the conversation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also Is it normal for all calls that are placed through skype ipad/iphone to not show on the desktop version of skype? I see that they are now showing on the windows 10 skype version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking for a way to export or show all my calls placed through skype, is there any other method other than screenshots? All of the calls have been used via iphone but have just realized that i can view these on windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Dolby Digital Plus audio driver is 7.6.4.9 and software expects version 7.5.1.1</h2>
                    <p>I have a Realtek ALC3661 and are running Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I installed the Windows 10 Anniversary Update on my Alienware 18 and, since then, I've had nothing but
<br />
problems with the sound panel.&nbsp; The biggest errors are that system sounds won't play when you've set them, and my Corsair Void Wireless has a setting for 8-channel sound, but is permanently inaccessible, even after uninstalling it and performing a clean reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, from what I've read, Dolby has a huge issue where it's incapable of updating itself when any audio driver is newer than the software it is compatible with.&nbsp; Problem is the factory driver for my sound card is 7.5.2.5, and I can't seem to find a new version
 of Dolby Digital Plus online I can simply install, to replace the existing one.</p>

            <p>As a new version of Dolby Digital Plus seems not available for download for the latest Windows 10 audio driver (7.6.4.9), I tried to patch the file ddpc.dll in order to skip the compatibility test between the Dolby application and the audio driver.</p>
<p>And it seems to work perfectly ! (with audio driver 7.6.4.9 and application 7.5.1.1)</p>
<p>Finally I was able to access the Dolby configuration screen again :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is the ddpc.dll file to install (as a replacement for the original) in the application folder (C:\Program Files\Dolby Digital Plus) :</p>
<p>http://dl.free.fr/tQJVSOxVJ</p>
<p>
</p><p>(if you don't trust me, compare this file and the original 7.5.1.1 version, you'll see than only 3 bytes were modified)</p>

<p>Last night we had the issue with the Realtek drivers not having Dolby Digital or DTS in the drop down list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our work around:&nbsp; VLC Media Player 64-bit 2.2.8</p>
<p>https://get.videolan.org/vlc/2.2.8/win64/vlc-2.2.8-win64.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>In VLC, Audio Menu&gt;Audio Device&gt;Select Device</p>
<p>And Tools Menu&gt;Preferences&gt;Audio&gt;Dolby Surround&gt;Set to On</p>
<p>

<p>I have been playing this game, and now for the second time the game gets an error (the screen freezes) so i turn it off. When i turn the Xbox back on and open the game, all my pogress is lost and gone! All i can do is start a new game...&nbsp; but still all the
 points for what i have unlocked remains. Why does this happen, and is there any way i have a chance of getting back to where i was in the game? Seems like there is one option only; to start all over again.......</p>

<h2>            KB4338818 fails to install - reference to staticcache.dat issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have&nbsp;2 domain controllers with Server 2008 R2 installed that&nbsp;we have recently attempted to patch and KB433818 is failing on both.&nbsp; We also have a TMG server with the same OS and that same KB installs with no issues.&nbsp; The error code returned is 80070020,
 but in looking at the logs, there is an error referencing an inability to create staticcache.dat.&nbsp; Searching in the Fonts directory shows no such file so we're assuming the complaint is that it is either missing or is unable to create it.&nbsp; Is there a known
 issue with this KB or has anyone else experienced this issue.&nbsp; Additionally, any workarounds or recommendations would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Veronica </p>

Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Screen resolution refers to the clarity of the text and images on your screen. At higher resolutions, items appear sharper. They also appear smaller, so more items fit
 on the screen. At lower resolutions, fewer items fit on the screen, but they are larger and easier to see. At very low resolutions, however, images might have jagged edges.<br />

<p>In the meanwhile I learned that the "PCI Simple Communication Controller" is only necessary for the use of an intern modem with an analoge telephone line .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not need such a modem , so I also do not need the driver for it</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>You have an issue with performing a back up on the computer. It can be difficult when something that is important to you does
 not work as expected. It is pretty simple and we are here to help you fix the issue. We will work as a team and get this sorted out.</span></p>
<p><span>Please answer these questions-
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the antivirus installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1-</span></p>
<p><span>You need to make sure that Volume Shadow Service is running.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the steps-</span></p>
<p>a) Click â€œStartâ€, type â€œServices.mscâ€ (without quotations) and hit â€œEnterâ€.<br />
b) Search for the <b>Volume Shadow Copy Service</b> and <b>highlight</b> it.<br />
c) On the left hand bar click on â€œStartâ€, highlighted in blue.<br />
d) Now, Right Click on the Volume Shadow Copy Service and select â€œPropertiesâ€.<br />
e) Next to â€œStart up Typeâ€, click on the drop down and select â€œAutomaticâ€.<br />
f) Click on â€œApplyâ€ and â€œOkâ€.<br />
g) Restart your computer.</p>
<p><span>Method 2-</span></p>
<p><span>I would have you disable the antivirus as well as the Windows Firewall and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the articles-</span></p>
<p><span>Disable antivirus software</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Turn
<span>Windows</span> Firewall on or off</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Note: Make sure you Turn On the firewall as well as re-enable the antivirus after performing all the troubleshooting steps
 since the computer might be at a risk of virus infection.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3-</span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to perform a Clean Boot.<br />
<br />
Placing the computer in a Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to perform the steps from the article-<br />
<br />
How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Note: You need to follow Step 3 from the article to get the computer back to Normal Startup after performing all the troubleshooting
 steps.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, refer the article-</span></p>
<span>Backup and restore: frequently asked questions</span>

            hey thanks for asking for help. it could be two thing 1. the power brick is now old and faulty, they have over heat sensors in them and they did in the day blow out causing shut down to protect Xbox console ,2. make sure all the fan exits are clear on
 the console hoover the air exits to remove dust ,this also causes over heat and shut down ,so clean or change brick .&nbsp;

 few others show up that way too and any of them do not show up in the sent folder when I reply......it just started to do this about 2 months ago.&nbsp; I tried to restore my computer to an earlier time but Windows 7 does not go back very far to enable me to do
 it.....how can I fix it?&nbsp; Exactly what are those triangles in front of some of my messages in the sent and delete folders? Help help,&nbsp; I can't stand this!</p>

<h2>            The cursor jumps whenever I play games or even check my email.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Cursor jumping </p>
<p>Hello,&nbsp; </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have Windows 7 professional and the cursor jumps everywhere when I try playing games, am online, or use pdf documents. I have sent my Asus laptop for repairs 5 times, and finally they sent me a replacement laptop. The replacement laptop does the exact
 same thing. The cursor jumps whenever I play games or even check my email. This gets very frustrating, because sometimes just deleting an email gets difficult. Obviously, it is not the laptop, but the OS. I have no idea what to do to change this. When using
 a mouse, the cursor does not jump, only when using the touchpad. I have tried downloading different drivers, uninstalling the touchpad driver and reinstalling it, updating my system, etc. I don't think there is anything I have not tried. I'm at a loss and
 very disappointed with my purchase of Windows 7 professional. Please help!</div>

            <p>Hi Krystal,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you facing the issue only when you are online?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try the following steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p><span>Method 1:
<br />
I would recommend you to check the touchpad sensitivity on the computer. There might be an application installed by Asus for this. Reduce the sensitivity and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>You may get in touch with ASUS support for further assistance:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.asus.com/ServiceHome.aspx?SLanguage=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ASUS Support</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p>
<span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to boot in safe mode with networking and check if the issue occurs.
</span></p>
<p><span>For further information, refer to the articles:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start your computer in
 safe mode</a> <span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</a></span></p>
<p><span>Step 2:</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue doesnâ€™t occur in safe mode with networking, you may perform a clean boot and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may refer the following KB article to put the computer in clean boot:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Make sure you put the computer back to Normal Startup once you are done with the troubleshooting.</span></p>

            Hi  boobailuo
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

<h2>            Moving from an HDD to a smaller SSD</h2>
                    <div>
<p>
</p></div>
<p><span>Unable to move from Seagate HDD (1TB drive with less than 200GB used) to smaller Samsung SSD (V-NAND SSD 850 EVO - 500GB). &nbsp;I downloaded Seagate
 DiscWizard, Macrium, and Clonezilla, but none will run. &nbsp;I bought the Samsung SSD when I started getting a message that hard drive is about to fail. &nbsp;Now the computer runs in safe mode. But in normal mode, it will freeze up after seconds or hours. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I made a system image with Windows before it started acting up. &nbsp;I also have daily backups made with Windows. &nbsp;Both the image and the backups
 are stored on an external drive. &nbsp;</span>I also made a Windows repair disk. &nbsp;The repair disk will not let me restore the image, saying the original disk is too large (The data is in a 900+GB partition that will not shrink (Defrag does not help).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>The Samsung Data Migration Software was encouraging, but it stopped at 83% both times I ran it. &nbsp;Each try took about 1 hour 50 minutes before
 the program froze ("not responding" message appeared). &nbsp;I waited 1 hour for it to respond each time.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks. &nbsp;I know have Macrium. &nbsp;When I open v6.1.1366_reflect_home_setup_x64, it says it is extracting files, then it says it is preparing to install, then nothing. &nbsp;The same happens when I open&nbsp;v6.1.1366_reflect_setup_free_x64. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the Task Manager and found neither application running, but for each of the above files, a process is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I am doing this in safe mode with networking, since when it is in normal mode it tends to freeze up.</p>

            <p>Image transfer is probably not going to work for you anyway.&nbsp; There is likely all kinds of corruption on your current disk.&nbsp; You sure don't want to re-install that corruption.</p>

            <p>Thanks, all. &nbsp;The suggestion of corruption on the HDD gave me the idea to restore the HDD back to a time when it was not acting up so much in normal mode. &nbsp;When I did that, it was stable in normal mode, so I thought maybe I could try again to reduce the
 partition size to restore a system image using Windows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I removed a few programs that would not be hard to re-install, moved more data files to a USB drive, and used the Disk Defragmenter in Windows. Then I used Windows Disk Management to shrink the partition. &nbsp;Unfortunately, even though I was using less
 than 60GB, it could not swould not shrink to less than 700GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a last resort, I tried the Samsung Data migration tool again. &nbsp;It did the job in under an hour. &nbsp;I replaced the HDD with the SDD in the case, and it booted normally (except that it took only 35 seconds instead of 3 minutes). &nbsp;Word and Excel open almost
 faster than I can double-click. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I used most of the tools in the Samsung Magician software to fine-tune the SDD and Windows settings. &nbsp;So far, all is well. &nbsp;Just researching if there is any way to confirm all is good without opening all files and programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>
