    <title>Can&#39;t get a legal Windows Professional 7 activated. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get a legal Windows Professional 7 activated.</h2>
                    Since 3 days there's a "this copy of windows is nog genuine" message on the lower right of my son's screen.<br />
<br />
When i go to the activation window i get the choice between <br />
<br />
-online activation<br />
-buy new product key<br />
-Retype key<br />
-other ways<br />
<br />
Online gives "the product key must be activated with new hardware". This one is true; as i had major crashes &amp; data loss when Windows Vista was released, i installed this 7 first on an older computer &amp; tried it over there. I had it installed on another configuration
 (which is now already junked, so the that one is out of service).<br />
<br />
Retype product key doesn't make any difference (which is normal)<br />
<br />
Other way's there's the good old phone activation, but when i end up there i get<br />
<br />
"an error has occurred"<br />
&nbsp;you can also contact microsoft by phone to help resolve this problem.<br />
code 0x80000048<br />
unable to find a detailed error description<br />
facility code is null<br />
facility error; 0x48 (72L)<br />
<br />
If i click that box away, i get a screen with the nearest location, where there's nothing to choose. There are just no locations visible there.<br />
<br />
If i click next i get the code 0x80000045 error, and then i get a phone number to call, which isn't even a european number, and i refuse to call intercontinental just to solve an error that Microsoft is responsible for.<br />
<br />
<br />
What can i do to get this license working? this experience really doesn't encourage me to switch my other pc's to 7...<br />

<h2>            &#34;Let Windows manage my default printer&#34; won&#39;t stay disabled</h2>
                    Despite the fact that we have turned off the feature in Settings, we are seeing this magically turn back on by itself.&nbsp; This can happen multiple times a week.&nbsp; This has happened on more than one Win10 computer as we switch between two different network
 printers.&nbsp; While I would like&nbsp;to know why it is happening, my&nbsp;ultimate goal is to find out if there is any other way to permanently disable this setting.&nbsp; Registry edit?

            <p>This step is not helpful at all! &nbsp;I do not have this issue with my Windows 7 to Windows 10 upgrades, but my new installation of Windows 10 systems when joined to the Domain start this behavior for all of my users. &nbsp;This is not acceptable in that depending
 on what document they are using they will need to send to another printer quite often during the day, then when they go back into another application suddenly their default printer is not the other printer. &nbsp;We know how to turn it off but the fact it comes
 back on after a restart is not helpful at all. &nbsp;I have made registry changes and those seem to change after a reset of the system back to their default settings again, so we need a permanent solution that does not require a Clean Boot, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC /Scannow shows all files clean, so I know it's not a corruption issue as much as it is either a Policy setting or a system setting. &nbsp;Windows 10 continues to be troublesome when joined to a domain for the domain users but along with PowerShell I'm fixing
 those issues as they arise, but this is one that we as Microsoft users need a solution to pretty quickly.</p>

            <p>The issue with changing default printers is caused by sharing printers on network. It's a bug that Microsoft fails to acknowledge and address. It's very simple actually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cannot share a printer, if you have multiple printers connected to your computer and you want one specific printer on your computer to stay as default.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you share a printer on your computer and then someone prints to that printer from another computer,&nbsp;</p>
<p>then the default printer will be changed to that printer. (That's it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn off print sharing and I guarantee if you have checked off (do not manage my printers for win 10). You will never see your default printer change again from what you have set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no simple way to deal with this. Essentially anytime you want to print from your computer that shares any of it's printers, you will have to change the printer selected, right click and make default prior to print or you may end up printing to the
 shared printer if a print job was sent last from another computer to yours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to fix this problem it is really annoying!</p>

            It is extremely annoying. Microsoft, can you hear us? Give us a setting that maintains the default.&nbsp; Why have a default printer when it changes every time you select a different printer.

            This is indeed extremely annoying, I set a default and I want it to stay as the default, that is why it is called a default!!!! My PC does not remember this setting and resets to the unwanted automatic setting on every reboot. Arghhhhhhh

<p><span><span>I would suggest you to try disconnecting the phone, uninstalling any current drivers for the phone, then reinstall Windows Media Player
 11 again. Install the drivers/ software for the phone from the manufacturer’s website and then re-connect the phone. The settings will be detected automatically and then check whether the issue is resolved.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Jittin,</p>
<p>You can check to see if the software is XP compatible.</p>
<p>If it is, you can perform a clean boot to make sure a startup program isn't causing a conflict:</p>

            These links are now dead.&nbsp; I need a way&nbsp;to get the MTP garbage working, as I&nbsp;cannot connect my Samsung Galaxy S2 to my XP service pack 3-version PC as a "media device" ever since the phone did an "upgrade" to Ice Cream Sandwich&nbsp;which&nbsp;has switched it to
 this MTP garbage&nbsp;(the way it connected&nbsp;before was as a USB connection, and it worked fine on "Gingerbread").

<h2>            Microsoft Flight Simulator X and Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I am a long time user of FS9 and previous versions but have not seen FS since Windows XP.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now with Windows 20 I would like to either start a discussion for those who still are interested or perhaps find out what is known about running<strong> FSX and Windows 10.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>SO FAR:</p>
<p>I am able to install FSX on this system.&nbsp; It defaults to /programs/x86 on the installation.&nbsp; Does it matter if it goes in either this file or /programs/Microsoft games/ ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default 737 looks okay and does have a 2D cockpit as well as functioning 3D.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I install SP1 and or SP2?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running<strong> Windows 10 on a new LT with a screen setting of 3840x2160
</strong>resolution and a zoom of 250% as recommended.&nbsp; This is right out of the box.&nbsp;How should I adjust the resolution to fill my screen or another larger screen both in windows and FSX?&nbsp;Does anyone have experience with these settings?
<strong>How high will FSX go?</strong> How can I get it to spread the entire distance of the screen on the LT?&nbsp; It seemed to work in FS9 almost automatically..&nbsp; Thanks for any and all feedback!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp; It is preferable to install FSX to the root of the drive you would use for it, (e.g. C:\FSX). &nbsp; The reason for this is because other folders in Program Files (x86) can inhibit FSX accessing its own files more quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp; After you install FSX, you need to start the Sim and take at least one flight, then exit FSX completely. &nbsp; Then proceed to install SP1 and do as above and exit. &nbsp; Then install SP2. &nbsp; Service Pack 1 was the first major 'update' for FSX (you can find
 out what was involved in that SP here): &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://flyawaysimulation.com/downloads/files/1950/microsoft-flight-simulator-x-service-pack-1/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Service Pack 2 is also generally installed, but could be optional if you choose. &nbsp; It mainly deals with Directx10 preview and Multiplayer issues. You can read about it here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://flyawaysimulation.com/downloads/files/2796/flight-simulator-x-service-pack-2/</p>
<p>
</p><p>And an important insertion into your fsx.cfg (which the ACES Team forgot to add when developing FSX), is to add the following: &nbsp;Under [Graphics], add&nbsp;HIGHMEMFIX=1 after the last entry in that section. &nbsp; This will stop parts of aircraft and some scenery from
 separating from each other. &nbsp; There are of course other tweaks, but this is the main (necessary) inclusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp; I can't speak about using a Laptop for FSX, as generally they don't perform well unless they are highly spec'd. &nbsp; In reference to screen resolution and zoom, I would think you would go into your FSX Settings &gt; Customize &gt; Graphics and look in the Full
 Screen Resolution box. &nbsp; Normally, the setting would be that of your Monitor/LT screen, but you can change the setting in FSX Settings to find the one most suitable for you (re: &nbsp;size, graphics quality, better FPS, etc.). &nbsp; For example, on my 24 inch monitor,
 I run 1920x1080x32 as my resolution, which is correct. &nbsp; However, if I was having trouble with it being harder on my frames, etc., then I could consider going down a couple of settings as a test. &nbsp; So FSX screen settings (to answer your question) will go as
 high as FSX will allow (i.e. the screen size options listed in FSX Settings) and remember, it is best to align both your screen settings and FSX settings at the same values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. &nbsp; If you're happy to fly default aircraft (e.g. B738), then you can improve the quality of the engine sounds by downloading (often, free) other more realistic ones than supplied by FSX. &nbsp; You can also change aircraft behaviour and some aerodynamic features
 in the aircraft configuration file, but don't touch this unless you know what needs to be done and you are familiar with the four forces that act upon an aircraft and their effect.</p>

    <title>Terms of Use redirect loop, unable to accept, and I refuse to lose - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shocksjw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Terms of Use redirect loop, unable to accept, and I refuse to lose this account.</h2>
                    
<p>I've looked around before posting, and I see that I'm not the first and only person to have this issue.<br />
<br />
Long story short, yes I have a parental management on my account, and my account is technically labelled as a 'child', despite my age now being far from it. When attempting to accept the Terms of Use, I am asked to enter the parental password. Now several years
 ago the email account which the parental management is linked to actually stopped existing. It was an ISP-related address, and so when my parents moved to a different country they made sure that the old email accounts were deleted. Now this raises obvious
 issues.<br />
<br />
The account no longer even exists, so naturally entering the correct password (Entering a wrong one still yields a 'Incorrect Password' response) only loops me back to the Terms. I've attempted a password reset, an Account Recovery, and even a higher-priority
 recovery via the Advocacy Team, which was personally escalated by the customer service rep that I spoke to (Who was incredibly helpful by the way), all of which have been unable to assist. I refuse to accept that because of matters outside of my control I
 am now unable to use this account. I have bought hundreds of pounds worth of digital property over LIVE, and to ditch the account would mean losing all of that, money that I spent in full trust that these things would not be completely lost due to matters
 that I truly cannot have predicted, prevented, or even controlled.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I understand if this may be a rare case, exceptional in many ways. I cannot do a password reset on the parental account because the account does not exist any longer, I cannot recover the account for the same reason, so am I really expected to accept it when
 I'm told that there's absolutely nothing that can be done? That I am expected to just shrug off the loss of so much value upon my account? Surely there's a way to simply remove my parental block internally, and help me out greatly?<br />
<br />
Please give me good news, because otherwise this is a fundamental flaw in the way this works, and I doubt I would be the only one to be put in this situation.</p>

<p>Greetings, ShockSJW. If the parental email no longer exists, then you will have to get in touch with the Microsoft Accounts team by filling out this form:
<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/acsr</a>. If you can answer the necessary questions to prove account ownership they can help you regain access so you can accept the Terms of Service and then move
 on to promoting your account. Please give it a shot and keep us posted on your progress!</p>

<p>I just attempted to recover, and their reply was to try a password reset and then an email would be sent to the account... This once again loops right back to the issue of the account no longer existing, as there's nowhere for the reset email to be sent
 to.</p>
<p>Is there truly no way that Support could simply, in the face of this issue and the limited options available, manually promote my account to Adult? I would happily supply details for the entire promotion process either over the phone or via a live chat,
 and surely then I could accept the ToS and resolve the issue?</p>

<p>I'm having the same exact problem ShockSJW. It's upsetting me quite a bit. I've bought over 30 expensive expansion packs, games, etc.. and I'm losing it because of something not even really a big deal anymore? There have been 30482048094 updates since I've
 used that Parental Control stuff, and not once did i need it... But now I do? Ridiculous.

<p>If you use the contact customer support you get to fill outi a form to validate who you are or at least your parents</p>
<p>Once validated As lomg As your contact email works you can reseti the windows Live id</p>
<p>That you give them</p>
<p>Your parental windows Live id doesnt expire</p>
<p>And for future reference keep the info upto date</p>
<p>no there is no manual way due to legal issues</p>
<p>you must keep your info upto date</p>
<p>you only can work with the live team at answers.microsoft.com and fill out their questions</p>

<p>I don't think you've even read the thread, sir.</p>
<p>As I stated in my OP, I've tried all those suggestions. I also made a humble request slightly further down that has been wholly ignored. This issue is still very much ongoing and I am still seeking support, but from now on I'd like to request that the official
 support I receive is actually informed on the subject matter.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Actually Shock, Mister Gwyther is official support, you see that S under his level? That means he is official. :) Anyway, I'm going to jump on this bandwagon and just throw this tip out there for all of you that are having this issue; unfortunately when
 you have tried every angle to get your account back and still have not been successful, there is nothing more Microsoft can do to help you get your WLID back! If you've already tried resetting your password, filling out the validation information, and called
 microsoft support team by going to this link <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../contact-us</a> then you have out done all of the troubleshooting steps and there is no other way! It's very unfortunate but you must create a new account! Thanks guys, and good luck! :)</p>

    <title>Touch screen not working after lid closed even after enabling in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Touch screen not working after lid closed even after enabling in device manager</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I know a number of people in the past have reported problems, particularly with ASUS laptops like I have, with the touch screen being turned off when the lid is closed and power is set to "do nothing". I had these problems as well and found on the internet
 that the touch screen can be re-enabled manually as a "USB input device" in the device manager. However, this time, that did not fix my problem. The touch screen does not work. The device manager also claims that all my drivers are up to date. I have tried
 resetting the computer a number of times to see if it will figure out that the screen is not, in fact, disabled anymore. Nothing changes.<br />
<br />
This is not a hardware problem; it is specifically a WIndows problem. I know this because I dual boot Ubuntu and the touch screen still works perfectly on that OS -- so it's very very frustrating that Windows refuses to recognize it or allow me to use it.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I managed to fix this &nbsp;-- upon further looking I found out the USB input device was being marked as "not connected" and therefore was only visible if I had "view hidden devices" turned on. Upon opening properties for
<strong>every </strong>USB input device, one <em>suddenly appeared as non-hidden</em> (though still claiming to be disconnected in properties) and therefore allowed me to enable it where this previously was not an option. This does not make sense, should not
 be a thing that just happened to me. But it did. And my touch screen works now, so... that's good at least.<br />
<br />
Really, I could not be making this up. Not something this weird.<br />
Well, my problem is solved; I hope this helps someone else... <em>somehow.</em>

<h2>            Automatically connect to VPN</h2>

Hi,</p>
<p>
I wonder if it is possible to automatically connect a certain (previously configured) VPN, when connecting to specific network.</p>
<p>
For example, each time I arrive my home and connect to "My_WiFi", I will be automatically connected to "My_VPN", but while I'm at the university and connect to "University_WiFi", I won't be connected to a VPN.</p>
<p>
Thank you.</p>

            I would suggest fully uninstalling the game, restarting your computer, and then reinstalling the game. This usually fixes most problems for me. If not, I would reach out to Microsoft Support.

<div>
<p>FIRST:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click your Windowss button or hit Win + R</li><li>Click the little cog 2nd from the bottom on the black bar ( Settings )</li><li>Got to Privacy settings, then Background Apps</li><li>Ensure that XBox App and Sea of Thieves is switched to On. ( My XBox App was off )</li></ol>
<p>SECOND:<br />
Also, if you Microsoft Store app is not 'ON' by default, you will not be aware of game updates. While the game will run to the main menu, you will never join multiplayer games as your game 'version' will not match the rest of the community. So turn you Microsoft
 Store On until such time as the game is running for you. Once up and running, I have turned the 'Background App' for this back to 'OFF'.</p>
<p>THIRD: Now with Microsoft Store open, ensure you have the XBox Identity Provider APP in you list of Microsoft Store apps, and that it is running and up to date ( I have an authenticator so this is required for me, not sure if it also provides cross
 platform ( PC to Xbox ) syncronisation so you can play online with your one account?</p>
<p>FOURTH:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the search button next to the Win Start button</li><li>Type in 'msconfig' and hit enter</li><li>This brings you to the PC System Configuration. Click Services. ( Ensure all Xbox related check boxes are filled whether they are running or not.</li></ol>
<p>Perusing to your Task Manager ( as above but type "Task manager and go to Services )should now show that several Xbox services are now working in the background such as:<br />
XblAuthManager<br />
XboxGipSvc<br />
XboxNetApiSvc</p>
<p>Some folks have also suggested that installing to your root drive (C:) solves issue you may incur installing to secondary or external hard drives.</p>
<p>Hope this helps and Good Luck.</p>

    <title>bannissement sur un seul jeu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zfunky blacky  say:</h3>
<h2>            bannissement sur un seul jeu</h2>
                    
<p>je me vois etre banni d'un jeu car apparamment j'aurai "trouver une faille dans le système".</p>
<p>Je vais vous expliquez ma situation,je joue a "Gears of War 2" il s'agit d'un jeu de tire mais ce jeu a de gros souçi de connection.<br />
Dans la salle d'accueil d'une partie en réseau,un hote doit être choi en raison de sa connection (débit,PING)
</p>
<p>l'avantage de l'hote:<br />
-il n'aura aucun décallage(latence du jeu)<br />
-il fera subire de gros dégat a ces ennemie<br />
-il sera plus résistant <br />
-...</p>
<p>depuis un certain moment je me suis remit a joueur a "Gears of War 2" et j'ai souvent été l'hote donc les autres joueurs (perdant) n'accepte pas de subir une défaite,vous pouvait vérifier mes stat de jeu depuis ces 3 dernier jours sur le site de Gears of
 War ensuite tapé mon Gamertag "Blackhouse059"</p>
<p>Maintenant je me vois dans l'imcapacité de profité du xbox live et de mon argent car j'ai beaucoup investie dans ce jeu.Celà ma beaucoup énervé car je me fait bannir pas parce que j'ai touver une faille mais part des joueurs qui n'accepte pas la défaite.Je
 n'en peut rien si ce jeu dépend d'une bonne connection. </p>
<p>Donc je voudrais savoir si votre bannissement est définitil ou momentanné ?<br />

            <p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Les bannissements de jeux ne concernent effectivement pas Microsoft, il faut donc se rapprocher de l'éditeur du jeu concerné pour connaître les tenants et aboutissants, en ce qui concerne ton problème, je te conseille d'aller sur cette page :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            RDP from Windows 10 to WIndows server 2012 disconnects very often, from XP works fine</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I am often working on my clients' machines using some kind of Remote Desktop program to connect from a distance. I never had any problems with it - and this is quite unique.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Setting: I am using a WIndows 10 home edition Dell Laptop (version 1703). To my understanding the windows 10 was purchased and installed by the vendor not by Dell. I have a VPN connection with the client using Checkpoint (either via client or with browser add
 on), and then I am using RDP to the server.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
First, I was surprised that when using windows 10, the domain admin had to allow my computer to connect by name - but we set it up and RDP is initiates the connection with the server properly.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Then, every time we are connecting, we keep getting disconnected every couple of minutes - sometimes more.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
strange thing - when connecting using Windows XP, we are able to work without disconnecting - using the same VPN, and connecting from the same office.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Things I tried:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
1) We went to the client's location, where he gave us a cellular modem and we tried to recreate the problem. The modem was using the same network that is the client's ISP and also has a relay right above his location. Strangely, we stopped experiencing disconnections,
 but every two minutes or so, we had a freezing screen. I suspect if the connection is not as great, these freezes end in a disconnect.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
2) I tried removing all of my printer drivers.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
3) I tried using RDP Connection manager.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
4) I tried copying the mstsc file from windows XP and run it on Windows 10 in compatibility mode with XP.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
5) I changed several computers (to be fair, all were Dell computes).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
6) I tried to connect using various networks and location.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
7) I tried connecting using a local user instead of a domain user.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
8) I took a widows 10 computer, reformatted it, and tried connecting with a "clean" system.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
none of the above resolved the problem, I have scanned the web trying to find a solution to no avail.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Thank you</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could be some changes on the Windows 10 computer that's causing a compatibility issue, reason for disconnection on Remote access. It could also be a setting that needs to be configured on both computers. However, we suggest that you post your query
 to one of Microsoft's website called TechNet. Simply click on the "Ask a question" button to post your query. Here's the link for the TechNet

    <title>Windows 10 updates for Home Edition, no control over automatic updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iuliusbarbu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 updates for Home Edition, no control over automatic updates</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Users payed for OEM included with laptops, payed for internet access, they deserve to have the choice to start or not an update. Is not only about scheduled restarts. Updates are starting without control, net bandwidth is brought to a halt, nothing else
 can be played or done online until is finished.</p>
<p>Last Windows 10 update to 1809, meant for me 6h to finish just to find myself with both GPU drivers disabled and impossible to update or unblock. Took other 4h to find the right working driver for Intel HD 4000, to be able to remake the Intel Nvidia graphs
 which as you know work together. Plus graphical on screen buttons missing for luminosity or sound. I am a visual impaired person, the brightness and gamma on the default monitor made impossible any work or further visual activity. I was smart enough to find
 solutions. My entire Sunday free time was lost. And I can continue.</p>
<p>People should have the right they payed for honestly to Microsoft and third party laptop manufacturers to CHOSE to star tan update or not and WHEN. At least to be able to document about changes that are being brought, to save or backup files BEFORE watching
 powerless how their device says "don't shutdown..." . In my opinion you are forbidding a natural right of free will while can anytime damage a private property.&nbsp; I could work very well on the preinstalled Windows 8.1 that came with the laptop. If the only
 choice to update ON DEMAND asks for pro license, this is incorrect. </p>
<p>Little by little may laptop disk space, net band, CPU and RAM resources became only a support of never-ending MS updates while also risking to have a complete stop and need to be reinstalled from scratch. I've read tens of posts saying same things, lack
 of any control, that got deviated on "ability to schedule restarts". Restarts that should never happen before asking if an update can be started first.</p>
<p>Please Microsoft consider this, honest paying users should not be treated like that. It is SIMPLE, do your job and allow us to CHOOSE to use it or postpone it. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One S Error - &#34;we were unable to find a microphone for these people&#34; - Appalling Support from Xbox</h2>
                    <p>All</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son has encountered the dreaded "we were unable to find a microphone for these people" error on his new Xbox One S, and which displays a permanent muted mic icon on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The console is only 3 months old, and I am already at a loss as to how to fix this problem, which is preventing him from talking online to his friends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The headset of course is fine (it works on other devices) and we have tried other headsets which do not work on this console either.<br />
</p>
<p>I have googled this issue extensively over the last few days and am horrified to learn the number of people who have the exact same issue. Hundreds, if not thousands, of threads and discussions on this particular problem. Some people have offered solutions,
 they work for some, not for others. None of them work for me. I have tried everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a complete loss. But also furious that, in all my online research, I have not seen a single response from Microsoft on this matter, no recognition of the problem, no proposed solutions. I find that disgusting. I'm also disgusted in myself for buying
 an Xbox when our PS3 never gave us a day of trouble in the previous 10 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anybody has any current information or the agreed stance on this problem, could you please share, much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>You mention trying different headset(s) however the mics on those all connect to console via the controller if they are wired headsets. In case the controller may be defective, have you tried using a different controller to rule that out as the source of
 your problem? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The other possibility that I can think of is that maybe your son has gotten a communication ban for inappropriate voice communication while using an older or different console (ie since you describe this as being a new console). Unfortunately I can't assist
 with checking that and you'll have to wait for a Microsoft Support agent to assist further if replacing the controller doesn't fix the issue.</p>

<p>Thanks for your response. I haven't yet tried a new controller, but I will as soon as I get my hands on one. I should have mentioned in my original post that this is the only thing I haven't tried. However, I must say, it is only 3 months old and my son
 is very careful and only plays about 6 hours per week.</p>
<p>Re the second possibility, no its not possible, this is his first Xbox; the previous console was a PS3 which belonged to me.<br />

<p>I found something that may be relevant to your case if you created a child account for your son.</p>

<p>Hey Gorm,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see you've done you've done plenty of troubleshooting, let's try to get this fixed. If a different controller gives you the same mute icon, we suggest you try a

factory reset</a> on the console as this could be software related.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let ask you guys, games like the crew (I think to buy it)&nbsp;or generally the games that they want a 24-hour internet connection , you can play on Xbox one or the PS4, without having monthly subscription (Xbox Live Gold, PS Plus) ;; Or want to have simple connection
 to the internet, regardless of whether you have subscription ;;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Get out of Safe Mode with non-functioning monitor&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Get out of Safe Mode with non-functioning monitor&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I was trying to troubleshoot a laptop with a malfunctioning monitor (nothing but grey and white lines). I was using an external monitor and put the computer into Safe Mode (in windows 10, through the configuration settings) not realizing that a) the
 external monitor will not work in safe mode, and b) the computer will continue to reboot into safe mode until the settings are changed, which is not possible because I can't see the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found another forum post with an answer to this question here: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/stuck-in-safe-mode-broken-screen/67067dc3-8039-4191-b451-52e731c0991f
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On that site the following text commands are advised:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows</strong> +
<strong>R</strong>, type <em>cmd</em> and press <strong>Ctrl </strong>+ <strong>Shift
</strong>+ <strong>Enter</strong> to open <strong>Command Prompt</strong> on administrator level.</li><li>Type the command below and press Enter.<br />
<br />
<em>bcdedit /deletevalue {default} safeboot<br />
</em></li></ol>
<p style="text-align: center">This command-line will remove safe mode as the default boot mode. Your PC will start normally on the next reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have tried this repeatedly with no success. Is there something else to these instructions which I am not understanding? Or any other way to get out of safe mode? Thanks for any assistance!</p>

<p>When I type the command cmd then hold down CTRL+Shift before hitting Enter it will pop the 'User Account Control' message box asking Yes/No authization with NO highlighted, so then I would need to click Left Arrow one tap to move the focus to the Yes button
 and then press Enter to approve opening the command prompt in administrator mode.</p>

<p>Winkey+R</p>
<p>Type cmd</p>

            Thanks, Mike P, but unfortunately this is still not working. I suspect your idea is on the right track though, there must be some little thing happening which I am not seeing, so that the commands do not go through....

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just gave this stuff a try to see what was happening...</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off... I didn't need the left arrow key, but that could vary by machine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I got was errors when entering simply cmd into the RUN...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried cmd.exe and it worked...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck with this..</p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<div>I got a problem on my Media Center which is called "Low Bit Rate Error".The blue screen of death is seemingly what it is called. I found the patch/fix which is found at:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=12783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/</a><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All good so far.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then try to manually run the the patch but I get the following message "Update not applicable to your computer". I have investigated the problem further and found the attached.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_update/message-update-not-applicable-to-your-computer/41c25b08-3c0e-4d7e-a121-3860c2e24549">http://answers.microsoft.com/</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All my research seems to be point at the Windows Update Installer service not being able to start because of an registry size limit. I have found the below link but am unsure
 in how I can fix the issue and it would suggest that I have to make the registery size unlimited.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any thoughts on the above and what I could do to fix the Installer to allow me to apply the patch. Is there an easy way to fix this in the computer?&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am running Windows 7 Ultimate.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance</div>
