                    I'm trying to install Video Card Drivers on Windows 7. When I first installed Windows 7 and installed NVidia Drivers everything was working fine for about a week. Now I can not get Windows 7 to boot with Video Drivers installed and display my desktop.
 As soon as it gets passed the Windows 7 boot logo my flat panel says no signal and turns off. I boot into safe mode and uninstall the NVidia Drivers and windows will boot just fine, but I have no video drivers installed. When I go into safe mode with that
 problem and I have windows troubleshoot it, it says that my video card drivers are up to date, but does not suport WDDM. I have tried almost everything I can think of different brands of drivers and I don't know how many different versions but they all end
 up with the same problem. I'm running the NVidia 7950 GT Video Card with a Asus P5B Motherboard with the latest video card drivers on Windows 7 Operating System.

            Go to the nVidia website, look in the archived drivers section and find version 182. Download and install these. Many folks have decided these are the ones to go with. Also ensure that your monitor is receiving the correct signal. There are probably buttons
 on the front, and you need to set the correct signal... ie where it's coming from, whether it's the VGA adapter, the DVI or the HDMI. If it's defaulted to VGA and you are connecting via HDMI, you will get the No Signal message.

            <p>There is something wrong with Windows Update part.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Thats a lot of updates to install. My recommendation would be to install the updates in batches, such 5 at a time, exclude hardware/driver updates. Avoid installing a combination of Microsoft Windows and Office updates at the same time. Also, try installing
 the small updates first. Avoid installing things like .NET Framework and SQL Express Updates.</p>
<p>Restart each time you install the updates (its a chore, but it guarantees a more reliable experience). Try starting out with Microsoft Office Updates for programs such as (Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint).</p>
<p>Another thing, try downloading the updates then install them. When prompted to restart, disconnect from the Internet and restart your computer.</p>
<p>Proceed with installing the additional updates.</p>
<p>If the computer continues to become non-responsive, try the following:</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>You can&nbsp; reset&nbsp; Windows Update components by running the Fixit on this page.&nbsp; But, if there's malware present, it will continue to reset the connection to the update servers:</p>

<br />
<span>
<p>Suggest you download and save the Fixit.&nbsp; Then configure the system to Clean boot prior to running it:</p>
<p>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista/Windows 7/8</p>

<br />
<span>
<p>Once the Fixit has been downloaded and the system booted to the Clean state, check to see that the native Windows firewall is now On if a 3rd party firewall was being used previously.&nbsp; Now run the Fixit and choose the Default mode.&nbsp; Restart once it's done
 and see if the system can connect to the update servers.&nbsp; If it can not, then run the Fixit again and choose the Aggressive mode.&nbsp; Restart when it's finished running and check for updates.</p>
<p>I suggest before shutting down and installing any updates, disconnect from the Internet first.</p>

<h2>            Highest Payout Races&#47;Drivatar Payouts</h2>
                    
<p>I've been playing Forza for about 2 weeks now.&nbsp; The redundancy of 5k and 6k per race is getting to me.&nbsp; Does anyone know which races or leagues yield higher payouts?&nbsp; Also, I've been absent for about 3 days and noticed my Drivatar only raced 5 races for
 about 2k, what's up with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel like a pimp...Car better have my money.</p>

<p>From what I've seen race payouts are pretty much the same across all the series. The best way to increase your earnings is turning off assists, upping the drivatar difficulty level and not using rewind.</p>

<p>I remember in Forza 3, the longer races yielded higher payouts...much higher payouts. &nbsp;I thought they would've considered that...on second thought, if they did that, I suppose people wouldn't need to purchase tokens with real money. &nbsp;I guess I'll have to
 scratch and claw the old fashioned way. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Freestyle mode seems to be the best option to earn more credits than Career. &nbsp;You can make the races longer, which leads to higher payouts and more AFFINITY and XP points as well. &nbsp;That makes my scratching and clawing a little easier. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Nobody ever needs to purchase tokens with real money. &nbsp;It's just ignorant people making up excuses. &nbsp;You're supposed to take time earning credits to earn cars; not get them all in a few hours.</p>
<p>The reason later races don't really pay more is because they aren't longer. &nbsp;At the start of the game you find yourself running two-lap races. &nbsp;That changes little as you progress. &nbsp;40% of the way into the game you still do two-lap races. &nbsp;Sometimes you
 find one that's three laps, and if the track is short you might see five, but then they're in car classes that lap a lot faster so the race time is similar to the shorter races you did in slower cars.</p>

<p>I decided to run some 50 lap races the other day to see what kind of difference there would be in terms of XP and Credits earned. &nbsp;I ran through all of the car classes from D to A and was earning approximately 50K XP (or 4 driver levels at level 85ish) and
 140K Credits per race. &nbsp;The races took about an hour for the lower class cars and about 45 minutes for some of the higher class cars. &nbsp;The XP and Credit totals earned doing those races were much better per hour than running the shorter career and multiplayer
 races.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Might want to give one a try and see if you enjoy the longer races as much as I did, they were a blast!</p>

<p>I did a 50 lapper with my class B vehicle and netted 75CR and 3 Affinity levels, along with 5 Driver levels. &nbsp;Much easier to earn money and XP this way, especially if you're starting with a new manufacturer. &nbsp;</p>

<p>To me these free play numbers don't seem that much different than career play.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Based on Adrian's and Knowitall's numbers they are reporting an average earning of 1.5-3k per lap in free play. Most career mode races are 2-3 laps and I'm easily earning 3k per lap (9k per race) in career mode.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I can certainly understand the fun in running endurance races - but from an earnings perspective I don't think it's any different than career mode.</p>

    <title>No Sleep Button in Start Menu After Windows 10 April 2019 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alisonhanna29  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Sleep Button in Start Menu After Windows 10 April 2019 Update</h2>
                    <p>So, I just installed the Windows 10 April 2019 update, and the first thing that I immediately noticed was that the Sleep button is no longer available on the Start menu. Here's a photo to give you an idea of what I see:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7afa923b-bed6-4d57-9559-7359ad332819?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7afa923b-bed6-4d57-9559-7359ad332819?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried searching for what happened, but there isn't even an option to enable the Sleep button.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d3f1a15-f0d4-44d8-b77c-146b20952430?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d3f1a15-f0d4-44d8-b77c-146b20952430?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>And when I tried the Advanced Power Settings, the only options I got for "When I close the lid" was "Do nothing", "Hibernate", or "Shut down". And Microsoft Support was not helpful at all. All I got was a bot who gave me a solution for "My Surface won't
 wake or turn on". I looked on the forum to see if anyone else has had this problem, but there have been no cases on this level nor cases that have come with this most recent update. Is there anyone who has dealt with this who can help me out?</p>

<p>Actually, I finally got through with Microsoft Support yesterday and they updated the drivers for me through a remote session. Sleep mode is back! By the way, shout out to Nikko over at Technical Support for being so patient through all my frustrations!

<h2>            WIndows 8.1&#58; Memory issues causing excessive hard drive use&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm having problems with excessive demands on the hard drive, which 'feels' like the system is paging to virtual memory. Looking at task manager, it is typically reporting 2.6/7.9 Gb (33%), but 100% Disk usage when, for instance, I swap between programmes
 or between tabs on Chrome. And yes, windows is managing the pagefile......</p>
<p>This is a problem I have seen on several forums, but I am yet to see an answer that diagnoses the problem or fixes it.</p>

            <p>If it helps, using procmon and looking at the file activity, System32\tzres.dll, System32\en-GB\tzres.dll.mui and System32\drivers\etc\services vastly exceed everything else when it comes to total number of events, although pagefile.sys accounts for 80%
 of write bytes &amp; 15% of read bytes.</p>

            <p>Hi Julian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could have occurred due to conflict between third party applications or due to memory issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
I would suggest you to run the Memory Diagnostic Tool and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Press <strong>Windows </strong><strong>key </strong>and type "<strong>memory</strong>".<br />
b) Click "<strong>Settings</strong>" and then click the result "<strong>Diagnose your computer's memory problems</strong>".<br />
c) Select the recommended option to run the tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If the issue persists, I would suggest you to set the computer in a clean boot state and then check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</p>

            <p>Hi Geethu,</p>
<p>Ok, after a large amount of churning due to pagefile.sys, the system seems to have settled down and the disk churning now appears to be resolved - or, at the very least, much improved. I suppose now I'll have to start working through the services and startups
 to identify what is causing the issue. Thanks for your help, I'll keep you updated as to what I find.</p>

            <p>The disk churning is back, even though I've left it in clean boot mode. pagefile.sys is constantly writing to disk, even though I'm only using 2.3Gb out of 7.9Gb. I can't remember when I had so much pain from an OS in my 30+ years of IT.....or maybe I've
 just forgotten ;)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any more suggestions would be appreciated, as I'm rapidly losing patience with the amount of time that trying to resolve this has taken so far and it is crippling the performance of what should be a decent machine.</p>

            <p>Doesn't look like anyone wants to acknowledge the issue in MS, so I took the drastic action of disabling the pagefiling system. Yes, I am aware of the consequences and I'm not happy with doing it, but at least I have a system that is usable again, unlike
 the disk-churning, stuttering system I had before. It seems that one of my old maxims for the teams I have run - "tell it as it is, not what you think I want to hear" - doesn't hold true for MS, evidenced by the tumbleweed rolling across this community message
 and many other forums like this........ ;)</p>

            You wanted it to be an MS pagefile issue, and you have subsequently turned the pagefile off, essentially hiding whatever problem was causing the pagefile usage. What do you want any of us to say?

<h2>            Can not adjust screen brightness on my Lenovo P500.</h2>
                    I went to the manual settings to attempt to change but no luck. Also at the top of the key board there is a brightness adjustment keys but they as well dont work. This all occurred when i updated to the new 8.1 update.

            No. I spent four hours talking to the sob's at Microsoft and all they said was wrong was the laptops (Lenovo in particular) are not compatible with 8.1.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows Vista wil not boot&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neegal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Vista wil not boot&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My Dell Dimension E521 will not boot up windows Vista . I purchased the NeoSmart Technologies Easy Recovery Essentials for Windows VISTA. Everything went smoothly. Until I booted up the recovery disk. It looked like everything loaded properly except it is
 just frozen on the "select a recovery option" screen that comes up first. Once I get to this point my mouse and keyboard don't work. The mouse pointer is frozen in the middle of the screen.</p>

<p>When not booting from the recovery disc the mouse will move on a black screen... also I can F12 to select to boot from the disc. But when the recovery disc starts the mouse and keyboard do not function.</p>

<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Hi Neegal,
<div>Thank you for posting the issue on Microsoft Community Forums.</div>
<div>As we understand from issue description, you are not able to boot to the computer.<br />
We will try to help you resolve the issue.</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>If you could answer a few questions it would help us to resolve this issue:</font></span></p>
<font color="#000000">1. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Did you make any changes in the computer prior to the issue?</span></font><br />
2. Do you get any error message?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here are a few steps which you can follow:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>First disconnect any external devices connected to the computer except mouse and keyboard.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div><strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong></div>
<div>Refer the link below:</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></div>
<div>If the issue does not persists in safe mode then, start the computer in clean boot to check if any third party program is causing the issue. To configure your computer to clean boot refer the following link.</div>
<div><strong>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></div>
<div>Note: Refer "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot"</div>
<div>under more information to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3: <br />
</strong>We would suggest that you try startup repair using the Windows vista installation disk.<br />
a. Insert the installation disc.<br />
b. Restart your computer. <br />
c. Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart.<br />
d. If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.<br />
Note: If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For more information, see BIOS: frequently asked questions.</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
 configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.
<br />
e. Choose your language settings, and then click Next.<br />
f. Click Repair your computer.<br />
g. Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click Next.<br />
h. On the System Recovery Options menu, click on Startup Repair.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer the below link for more information.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/How-do-I-fix-a-boot-startup-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/How-do-I-fix-a-boot-startup-problem</a><br />

    <title>Latest windows update corrupted my windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuartgreenberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Latest windows update corrupted my windows 10</h2>
                    I just downloaded the latest update to Windows 10. The installation was a problem as the screen never changed to the updated screen but installed it while the regular operating screen was visable. The update also included abode reader update and malicious
 software removal. When I restarted the computer it took a long time and I wound up with a black screen, the recycle bin icon and a few icons on the task bar. Nothing works. Any suggestions to save my installation?

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />Once you are able to boot into safe mode, check the integrity of the system
<br />
<br />To startwith, you should execute these 2 steps
<br />
<br />1. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+I &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Guided Walk though - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Run through Windows 10 Performance and Install Integrity Checklist by Greg Carmack, MVP to make sure that your Windows installation is rightly set up and optimized. Take all recommended steps outlined there to have best experience  - 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Last option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.

<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.

            I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10.

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Hi Jah
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />Check if its working...
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isnâ€:tm:t fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. Itâ€:tm:s possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you donâ€:tm:t have any. If you donâ€:tm:t have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=outlet+tester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=s...</a>). Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system wonâ€:tm:t be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. Slackâ€:tm:s Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.
<br />
<br />10. Replace Charger or Battery Module
<br />
<br />Ultimately, if you donâ€:tm:t see any improvements after trying all the above, then itâ€:tm:s maybe best that you replace either the charger or battery itself. This will require contacting your laptop manufacturer and placing an order. Batteries and the chargers are not necessarily cheap, especially if its an older system. But, if you have no choice, its something you will just have to do to get your system back in working order.

            Hi Jah123456 
<br />
<br />Your battery needs to be re-calibrated, so Windows can read its life correctly .. . 
<br />
<br />Some night, when you will not need your laptop, turn off (not sleep) your laptop and leave that charging all night 
<br />
<br />The following day, disconnect the laptop from the mains, then run that laptop continuously until it switches itself off, due to lack of battery power 
<br />
<br />Then with Windows 10 still on, charge the battery to 100% 
<br />
<br />That's It!       
        </p>

            When was the last time you calibrated the battery?

<br />
<br />I recommend creating a specific power plan for this rather than editing a current plan.

    <title>Hacked&#58; Change security info - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> callan m.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hacked&#58; Change security info</h2>
                    <p>I was hacked on the 4th, and before I could log in they had already removed my email, changed my password, and changed my email twice. Once to a "mailnesia" account, I assume its a onetime email sort of thing, and then to another so I didn't even know the
 account login email for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily, my security questions are the same. And because my Xbox attempts to autosign me in, I learned the name of the email associated with the account now for log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now changed the password and regained my account for now, however when I got to the info page in an attempt to remove the hackers email it tells me I cannot make changes until they're finished finalizing the hackers changes by early January. If I try
 to cancel the changes? It asks to send an email to the backup email THEY set up. I have no way of changing my email back to my own, and the virtual assistant has been no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have control of the account, but since the hacker has the email they can easily send password resets to boot me out. Do I *have* to wait until early January for the changes to finalize, only for me to attempt to change it back or is there any
 way around this? I've had no luck getting a hold of customer service, as it always boots me back to Virtual Assistant for "security reasons". I'm also worried they could change the security questions at some point. I already cancelled the debit card associated
 on my account, and they seem to have given up as there hasn't been any activity on the account the past couple of days. I'm still worried, and would rather not have to wait until January.</p>

http://support.hp.com/gb-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-laserjet-p1005-printer/3435674/model/3435675</a>&nbsp; The page checks your OS but you need to check it has correctly identified it before downloading anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The software should be the same as that on your CD.&nbsp; If it does not install&nbsp;[right-click, Run as Admin] then try setting it to install in a compatibility mode that matches the OS it was originally written for {XP, perhaps?} [right-click, Properties, Compatibility
 tab, Run in capability mode for XP SP3].</p>
<p>
</p><p>If even compatibility modes do not work then you'll find basic drivers on that same HP page.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Pro - Why Explorer.exe is creating many connections to the Internet. Am I running a virus&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Support Team</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am writing you this time because I cannot understand Why Explorer.exe is creating many connections to the Internet. This behavior in Windows 8 is normal? Am I running a virus?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will provide any details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was running Windows 8. Also, I was doing an exercise with Process Explorer - SysInternal.com and I discovered that my PC (Explorer.exe and other .exe files of my Anti-Virus Trendmicro) was creating many connections to the Internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the connections with the command "netstat -ano" --&gt; Many ESTABLISHED connections to the Internet appeared.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I checked the .EXE files with Process Explorer - SysInternal Tools, I discovered that Explorer.exe was responsible for that. Also, CoreAgent.exe from TrendMicro Titanium Internet Security. I researched in the internet for that and I did not find a good
 answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just for to be sure that I am running a health PC, I did a Clean Installation. Big surprise when I installed Windows 8 and I checked the ports listening. Many connections with status ESTABLISHED appeared. The .exe file responsible for that was Explorer.exe.
 I updated Windows Defender and I checked again, the same story. Explorer.exe is creating many connections to the Internet, I mean, IP address out of scope of my LAN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked some of the IP addresses, and some of them belongs to Microsoft Corporation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact is: I have my laptop just running Windows 8&nbsp;with Windows Defender Updated after a Clean Installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Why Explorer.exe is creating many connections to the Internet?</p>
<p>Why so many ports listening..?</p>
<p>Am I running a Virus?</p>
<p>How can I discriminate suspicious backdoors vs. legitimate traffic?</p>
<p>How can I discriminate legitimate Established Connections vs Bootnets?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            same thing happening to me plus I've been getting hacked ever since I started using windows 8 especially when on a wireless connection. all these connections are concerning and prevent my it dept from securing everything properly.

            Refer to your cameras settings to not add the time stamp to your files.<br />
Since wlpg is not able to add the time stamp it will also not be able to remove it in wlpg.

<p>I downloaded Escalation [EN] the day before the game was delivered (Tues, 31st May)</p>
<p>Now i am trying to download First Strike [EN], and it is not working, because its 'Not avalable to my location' or something, this happens when i try from Black Ops game/Multiplayer area, Xbox.com or normal marketplace.
</p>
<p>The map pack has attempted to download (without taking any MS points from me) but stopped at 99%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            The "code" you are looking for is officially known and the "Product Key". It is 25 characters, typically written in 5 groups of 5 characters.<br />
<br />
The sticker on the computer is almost certainly for Windows. If there is an Office sticker it would be the second on the computer.<br />
<br />
Presumably you have Office installed. As long as you have not re-installed Windows, you can use one of these tools to extract the key from the HD:<br />

            <p>YouTube is the downfall of parental control software, and Windows is no exception. Youtube can be accessed from so many directions, and Youtube provides virtually no effective controls for its own behavior. Even when you're watching a YouTube video with
 your kids that you know is safe, as soon as the video is over, YouTube automatically displays more choices, which could be terribly inappropriate. Even if you block the YouTube domain, websites that embed video from YouTube can still play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Blocking YouTube is no simple matter. You're going to need third-party software to do that, if it's even possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the schoolboys who run technology think that blocking filthy and violent content from our children is illegal censorship.</p>

    <title>cannot acces map pack - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kingging111  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot acces map pack</h2>
                    
<p>i got a new xbox slim today and seemed to be working fine. i used the ms transfer cable to get all info from the old hard drive once again all seemed OK but when trying to play the escalation map pack it wanted me to pay again. the map pack was originally
 downloaded by another account which will run the map pack fine but this isn't the cause of the problem as on the old console all accounts had access immediately after purchase.</p>
<p>please help</p>
<p>thank you</p>

<p>It's a licensing issue. When you purchase content it's tied to the gamertag that purchased it as well as tthe console it was purchased on. If the other account you purchased the map pack on is now on your new console, you'll need to do a license transfer
 in order for it to work properly. You can do a license transfer here - <a href="http://xbox.com/drm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            To continue, Xbox LIVE requires your parent or guardian to have a Xbox LIVE account.</h2>
                    
To continue, Xbox LIVE requires your parent or guardian to have a Xbox LIVE account. Your parent or guardian needs to sign in to an existing Xbox LIVE account or create a new Xbox LIVE account.

<p>I am 19 years old, and I am completely unaware of any parent or guardian account connected to my LIVE account. I am unable to try and get rid of this account, the only thing there is is a email i used when I made my XBOX account back in highschool. I want
 this apparent parent account to be removed to my account, because I was not even aware one existed and now I cannot accept the new terms and conditions</p>

<p>My gamertag is MasterlyAsp, or my email is <strong>[MOD REMOVED]</strong> if that is an easier way to find my account. I am slightly new to useing these forums, haven't had a reason to up until now.&nbsp;</p>
