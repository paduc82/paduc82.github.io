    <title>windows upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lynncalhoun1  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows upgrade</h2>
                    <p>We are a small business running "Quick Books" on an old Dell computer with Windows XP operating system. We have been using a HP OfficeJet pro 6830 printer for the last two years which HP tech support had to help us install then. The printer recently quit
 and we replaced it with an identical brand new printer but now HP tech support tells me it is not compatible with Windows XP and that we need to upgrade to at least Windows 7. My question is, can we upgrade Windows XP to Windows 7 and will it effect our "Quick
 Books" program if we do upgrade?</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; You may or may not be able to "upgrade" to Windows 7 (or a more recent version of Windows).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>First, you have to determine if your old Dell computer can support Windows 7, particularly if Windows 7 drivers are available for that computer's hardware.&nbsp; You can look this up for yourself at
<a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19?app=drivers&amp;c=us&amp;l=en&amp;~ck=mn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19?app=drivers&amp;c=us&amp;l=en&amp;~ck=mn</a> or you can provide your Dell Service Tag and I'll look it up for you.&nbsp; (Find your Dell Service Tag:

http://www.dell.com/support/contents/us/en/19/category/product-support/self-support-knowledgebase/locate-service-tag</a>)</li><li>If there are Windows 7 drivers for your Dell, you have to find a copy of Windows 7.&nbsp; Microsoft stopped retail sales of Windows 7 over 4 years ago, so it's increasingly difficult to find a legitimate copy, although they do exist.&nbsp; See

<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; On the other hand, HP tech support did not tell you the truth.&nbsp; Of course a printer identical to one that was happily running on Windows XP will also run on Windows XP.&nbsp; HP still has Windows XP drivers for the OfficeJet Pro 6830-e (I assume that's what
 you have even though you left off the "e" -- confirm by looking here: <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/HP-Officejet-Pro-6830-e-All-in-One-Printer-series/5390307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>If the new printer is in fact the same as the old printer, the driver should already be installed.&nbsp; What happened when you simply connected the new printer in place of the old printer?&nbsp; If you got an error message, please provide the complete text.</p>

</p><p>How is the printer connected (USB, wi-fi, something else (please describe)?</p>

            Yes the paper work does say HP Officejet Pro 6830-e All-in-One Series, and both printers are identical and another reason we bought this second 6830-e is because I thought it would work immediately since we already had the drivers downloaded for the old
 one but it's as if there is no communication between printer and computer. Computer says it is installed and ready to use but absolutely nothing happens on the printer. The printer works fine with another computer with Windows 10.

<p>You didn't answer the most important question:&nbsp; How is the printer connected (USB, wi-fi, something else (please describe)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several assumptions in the comments below.&nbsp; If any of them are incorrect, please let me know what the actual facts are.&nbsp; Also please don't forget to supply the information requested in Step 5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, my guess is that the printer is connected via wi-fi.&nbsp; If this is the case, the fix is exceedingly simple.&nbsp; The following
<strong>assumes </strong>that the printer is connected via wi-fi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My old Windows XP system has died, so this is from memory ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Open Printers and Faxes.&nbsp; Are there two icons that refer to an Officejet Pro 6830 or only one?&nbsp; The following
<strong>assumes </strong>that there is only one HP 6830 icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Right-click on the icon for the HP 6830 and select "Properties"</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Select the "Ports" tab.&nbsp; There should be one line that is checked and highlighted.&nbsp; What is shown in the "Port" column?&nbsp; You may have to click and drag on the faint vertical line between "Port" and "Description" in order to see the full width of the
 Port column (this image is from Windows 7, but your XP dialog should look very similar)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23a511c0-391f-40ce-b0e1-2520b9afdf16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23a511c0-391f-40ce-b0e1-2520b9afdf16" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Leave that window open and go to the printer.&nbsp; On the printer's touch panel display, touch the wireless icon.&nbsp; This is supposed to display the "Network Status Screen."&nbsp; I don't know what is included here, but if it shows the printer's IP Address, make
 a note of that.&nbsp; Otherwise, select "Print Details."&nbsp; This should print a network configuration page on which you should find the printer's IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; Please report in your Reply here both the printer's IP address from Step 4 and the Port IP address from Step 3.&nbsp; If these two IP addresses are not identical, the computer will not be able to send print jobs to the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; These two IP address will almost certainly look either like 192.168.1.xxx or 192.168.0.xxx (where xxx can be anything between 2 and 254).&nbsp; Even if the IP addresses are not identical, they should be the same except for the "xxx" parts.&nbsp; If they are not,
 you have a more serious problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7.&nbsp; <strong>Assuming </strong>that step 5 revealed that you had non-identical IP addresses in the two locations, the quick and semi-permanent fix is to make the Port IP address on the computer the same as the IP address assigned to the printer.&nbsp; Go back
 to the printer's properties dialog and click on the "Add Port" button.&nbsp; On the next screen, select "Standard TCP/IP Port" and click "New Port."</p>
<p>
</p><p>8.&nbsp; The "Add Standard TCP/IP Port Wizard" should start.&nbsp; Click Next.&nbsp; Enter the printer's IP address from Step 4 and complete the Wizard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9.&nbsp; Back at the "Ports" tab, you should now see another line with the new port that you just created.&nbsp; UNcheck the line that was for the old port and check the line for the new port so that the only line that is checked has the IP address that is the same
 as the printer's IP address from Step 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10.&nbsp; OK your way out.&nbsp; You probably don't have to restart the computer, but if you can't print (try opening Notepad and printing a test page), restart the computer and try again.</p>

            The connection is a USB Cable and the printer does not respond in any manner. There is another computer that is connected by wifi and it works flawlessly with it.

<p>There are two icons, one is HP Officejet Pro 6830 and The other is <em><strong>Fax</strong></em>-HP Officejet Pro 6830.</p>
<p>I have made the first the default printer and selected that line under ports in properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There also a third icon called HP Deskjet 450 Printer that was the default printer for the old HP 6830 that died and this is the one that HP tech support downloaded drivers for us to use with this printer 2 years ago. I have selected this icon and port as
 well with no success.</p>

<p>The Fax icon is there because your device has the capability to send faxes (if you connect it to an old-fashioned telephone line).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third icon seems as if HP support decided to have you use an older driver for some reason.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>As long as you mentioned the third icon (Deskjet 450), right-click on that one as well, select Properties and then the Ports tab and tell me what is shown on the line that is checked and highlighted for this icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give you an idea of what I'm asking you, if the "Ports" tab on the printer's Properties window looked like the image in my earlier post, the answers to my question would be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Port is 192.168.1.25</p>
<p>Description is Standard TCP/IP Port</p>

            I have finally fixed my problem. Apparently I just had it connected to the wrong port. I thought I had tried every configuration possible but finally with the old drivers already installed and getting to the right port, it is working properly now. Thank
 you for all your help and directing me to the port issue.

<p>Hello Cam-L,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the issue still exists? You can try the following methods to see if it works for your situation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Uninstall Skype for Business Meetings app, then join a meeting and reinstall this add-in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Adjust PC display settings, set Scale and layout to 100% (recommended) and resolution to recommended value, restart PC and only launch Skype Meetings app to test it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Update PC graph drivers as well as other drivers to see if it can make any difference.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Use a different network as sometime issue can be caused by specific network.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue still persists, you can share a screenshot of issue symptom with us here for checking. Please also confirm if other user in same organization encountered this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

</p><p>See updates below</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the issue still exists? You can try the following methods to see if it works for your situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Uninstall Skype for Business Meetings app, then join a meeting and reinstall this add-in.</p>
<p>This has been done and didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Adjust PC display settings, set Scale and layout to 100% (recommended) and resolution to recommended value, restart PC and only launch Skype Meetings app to test it.</p>
<p>Scale and Layout is set to 100% and resolution is correct.&nbsp; Tried this on several Laptops - different Makes&amp;Models.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Update PC graph drivers as well as other drivers to see if it can make any difference.
</p>
<p>We have updated the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Use a different network as sometime issue can be caused by specific network.
</p>
<p>We tried with a laptop connected on our Corporate Network and one connected directly to the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue still persists, you can share a screenshot of issue symptom with us here for checking. Please also confirm if other user in same organization encountered this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<h2>            Oops its appears you have found a glitch in the system. </h2>
                    So, I ran out of Xbox Live, trying to update via xbox and it sends me to the website. I accept and go the website but when I try to purchase gold or manage payment options it says "oops it appears you have found a glitch in the system!" Everytime.

<p>The account you are currently posting with is a Gold active account.</p>
<p>There was an update to the TOU within the past month or so, and everyone is required to sign it. If you haven't, that is likely why you are getting the error code and are having issues.</p>
<p>How to get the terms to appear so you can sign them, I do not know. Someone else may have the answer to that, but I'm fairly certain that has something to do with this.</p>

<p>It's impossible then for me to get my account fixed. </p>
<p>Until Microsoft fix it them selves. </p>
<p>I am NOT a gold account anymore because it has ran out. </p>
<p>Everytime I run out of gold I get this damned error and it takes me ages to figure something out, but this time It looks as though I can't play xbox.
</p>
<p>I think the only other way I can play is if I redeem an xbox live code... although that too will probably not work.

<p>It might show "GOLD" on here because it hasn't updated yet in the system. </p>
<p>Ive come across that message before and I can confirm its annoying as the Covenant sneaking behind you with a plasma grenade. But that aside... I have always tried back again later on and its been fine.</p>
<p>One issue you are having (other than paying 5 Quid per month) is only when your account expires and falls back into the silver domain. A slight work around I have used and suggested in the past is to:</p>
<p>-A) Don't let the account expire. (easier said than done, and i know there are circumstances) but that's the best way to avoid this issue.</p>
<p>-B) Second is to redeem a code (48hr, monthly, 3-month, or 12-month Card). If you are having this issue trying to enter payment options for a monthly subscription, I would suggest to enter a 48hr card... that way you ARE *Gold* then when you are gold you
 can then enter whatever payment option you wish to pay for your monthly subscription. If you don't have any 48hr cards, I'm sure you have mates that do... ask around. It might be the little thing that helps you avoid the "Glitch in the system" message.</p>
<p>Hope this helps and wasn't too hard to follow. </p>
<p>in short... &lt;use a 48hr card&gt; then &lt;update payment method&gt;</p>
<p>The "service" has worked flawlessly for me ever since I switched to a more permanent pay cycle (yearly) and at one time I had several years lined up.
</p>
<p>I hope I was able to help you or this message brings another user to answer a venue that I have failed to address.
</p>
<p>Good Luck</p>

            MirageAgent is setup as a task in my Task Scheduler as well, as part of my HP Pavilion dv7 laptop's Media software.&nbsp; it launches YCMMirage.exe, which is a background process that monitors if any APs are using the virtual driver.&nbsp; If it detects one, YCMMirage
 will launch YouCam, and YouCam will provide and share the webcam video to the client APs.<br />
<br />

            Because I'm unsure which router you have this will be pretty general.<br />
<br />
Click start, go to run, type "CMD" and in the prompt type "IPCONFIG" no quotations.
<br />
<br />
Locate the <span style="font-weight: bold">default gateway </span>address and enter that address into the address bar of your web browser. You will then be prompt to enter a user name and password. It's common for this to be admin/admin, admin/password, admin/1234.
 After you get this far and logged in, update us so we can better navigate you after knowing who manufactures your router. If you happen to get in there and feel comfortable moving forward, look for the wireless settings tab and it should have a sub category
 for security. Use WPA2-PSK, whatever you enter in for pass phrase will be your new password in order to access your wireless.

<h2>            why is windows ten so complicated and difficult to use</h2>
                    <p>I feel like I have to uninstall and reinstall different drivers and spend hours googling how to do stuff and talking to people in help chats almost every time I try to use my computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>I switched from macs because I was tired of everything being proprietary and expensive but this is just a constant headache&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's like I have to have a programming degree just to listen to music&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use it for Reason 9.5 primarily, but also watch youtube and sometimes play games on it (prefer console), and I use a focusrite audio interface</p>
<p>
</p><p>but it feels like something goes wrong almost every day and it takes hours of hair-pulling confusion and frustration just to get it to play sounds correctly</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had these problems on mac, this computer feels broken</p>

Then the, "technicians at Norton security" were high on something or figured you were and they could easily distract you with a

    <title>Xbox Originals Not Working - Is It The Hard Drive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> czhd-4607096a-20e1-4e0e-a175-59bc8d5723b6  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Originals Not Working - Is It The Hard Drive&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I bought the original Xbox versions of Splinter Cell, Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow and Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory for use on my 360 S. Whenever I try to play them I get the message "The game couldn't start. Try downloading the game again." I tried Battlefield
 3 to see if it worked and it booted up straight away as normal so the problem is with original Xbox games. According to
<a href="http://xbox.about.com/od/xbox360faqs/f/360hddbcfaq.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a>&nbsp;it says that it's common for users who get their hard drives off eBay after buying a 4GB version to get problems (which is exactly what I did). Apparently some of them aren't official and lack specific hardware that allows the backwards compatibility.
 So is this likely the cause? Is there a reliable place where I can get official Xbox 360 hard drives so I can play these games?&nbsp;After removing the hard drive I got a message saying "You need an official Xbox 360 hard drive to play Xbox Originals" or something
 along those lines. Wouldn't I have gotten this message before if the hard drive was fake? Or does it just assume the hard drive is legitimate because it fits and gives a generic 'game doesn't work' message?</p>

<p>Thanks for any help :D</p>

            <p>Battlefield 3 is not a good tester as it is a current gen game. &nbsp;You would need to test with another Xbox Original.</p>
<p>Now, although it may be possible that the hard drive is the culprit (yes, it is possible to purchase 3rd party drives online) the big issue here seems to be that none of those games are supported with backwards compatibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-CA/xbox-on-other-devices/original-console/backward-compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../backward-compatibility</a></p>
<p>However, if you would like to get a new hard drive then your best bet would be to purchase one from your local video game retailer.</p>

<h2>            Cannot connect to XBOX LIVE - UPNP is showing XBOX trying to use port 23250 UDP&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello need help. I have followed all the NAT open steps in the forum. I have 3 other XBOXs on the same network that can connect to LIVE no problem and log in. The one XBOX that cannot connect is showing up in the UPNP tab as 192.168.1.115:23250 UDP?? If
 can connect to the network, internet, but has limited access to live and will not connect.</p>
<p>I have also switch it over to wireless and have the same issue connecting to live. Is this XBOX toast?</p>
<p>FYI: I move my profile on an external mem card to play in diffferent areas of the house. The xbox that is not working is in my living room where I need NHL gamecenter to work. This started happening after the latest update approx 2 weeks ago.</p>

            <p>Greetings paulohotline!<br />Appreciate if you could post up the make and model of your modem and router. Also, look up your router's current version of firmware.<br /><br />[quote user="paulohotline"]The one XBOX that cannot connect is showing up in the UPNP tab as <span>192.168.1.115:23250</span> UDP??[/quote]This is one of two private endpoints from your part of the Peer-to-Peer communication. In this case the Xbox private address on your internal network (<span>192.168.1.115)&nbsp;</span>and it's internal port number (<span>23250). UDP is a TCP/IP protocol mostly used for VOIP, streaming or online-gaming.</span></p>

<p>Hello, The modem is a 2WIRE model 3801HGV which also has wireless. I have successfully connected to the 2 WIRE with wireless with this XBOX and still gets a "cannot connect to XBOX Live"</p>
<p>The router is a Linksys Expert Series E3000 Dual Band 802.11N Wireless N Router</p>
<p>The Firmware is DD-WRT v24-sp2 (04/13/11) std-usb-nas </p>
<p>This XBOX worked fine on this network the last 3 years, just started happening 2 weeks ago, with this XBOX only, the other 3 connect fine. I am thinking of getting rid of this XBOX.</p>

<p>Hmm, have you ever tried it on a wired connection? Honestly the issue may be as simple as that. &nbsp;Or if it does need to stay wireless you can give it a shot moving the console closer to the router to see if that clears it up a bit!</p>

<p>Hey now, was wired for 3 years no issues on this XBOX, other 3 are wired too. Like I said, I only tried wireless to connect to a different router (modem) in the house which is outside my local network with the open xbox required ports and had the same cannot
 connect to live issue. I knew this problem was going to be tough for this forum:) I think the XBOX is buggered and needs to be put to pasture. Unless there is a way to reset everything (not sure if initial setup will resolve this issue). OH well guess I am
 SOL.</p>

<p>I would instead suggest a house-wide, all Xbox sequenced power cycle. &nbsp;Some NAT problems are subtle and don't appear in the Test Xbox Live Connection test. Most likely there's a port blocked or misdirected away from your Xbox, in your router, modem, or at
 your ISP.</p>
<p>Since the Xbox 360 uses different ports than PCs &amp; Macs ordinarily use, you can't see the effect of a port blockage except on the Xbox, for the NAT problem is really the blockage or misdirection of ports. A sequential power cycle is the first step in clearing
 connection problems, and <em>the order and timing of the steps is important to success:</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>1) turn off all the Xboxen then</p>
<p>2) unplug power from the router</p>
<p>3) unplug power from the modem.</p>
<p>4) Wait at least 5 minutes then replug the modem power.</p>
<p>5) Wait 'til the light on the front of the modem which says BROADBAND, ONLINE, READY, CABLE or DSL is on solid (not flashing), then plug in the router.</p>
<p>6) Wait until the WiFi light on the router is on; you may not use WiFi, but it's still a good indicator your router is finished booting up.</p>
<p>7) Turn on the problematic&nbsp;Xbox &amp; run the Test Xbox LIVE Connection. &nbsp;</p>
<p>8) Power up the next Xbox and test it.</p>
<p>9) Repeat with remaining Xboxen.</p>
<p>10) Go back to the problematic Xbox and re-run the Test Xbox Live Connection test. Is it OK? Please let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&gt; &nbsp;I move my profile on an external mem card to play in diffferent areas of the house.</span></p>

            Hey GuyCruis,
<br />
<br />I'm an Independent Advisor here to help.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure if there was a security issue with Microsoft (none that I have heard of), but you can follow the link to reset your Microsoft password: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026838/microsoft-account-to-change-your-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402683...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn on two-factor authentication (download the Microsoft Authenticator app) for your Microsoft account, so any attempts can be authenticated through your phone.
<br />
<br />Hope this will help you.

created this thread</a> asking how I could remove some of the 15 icons there:</p>

            <p><span>Hi, <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">We regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand you want extra icons to be removed from the Taskbar of your computer. I suggest you to try restarting the Windows Explorer and check if it helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Restart the Windows Explorer process</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Refer the below steps to do so.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span> </span></span></span><span>Press <strong>Esc + Shift + Ctrl</strong> and open
<strong>Task Manager.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span> </span></span></span><span>Under
<strong>Processes</strong> look for <strong>Windows Explorer.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span> </span></span></span><span>Right click on it and select
<strong>Restart.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span> </span></span></span><span>Check if you are able to remove the icons from the taskbar.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you still face the issue, try running the System and Maintenance troubleshooter to check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Try booting the system in Safe Mode and check the status of the issue.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Safe mode</span></strong><span> starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start your PC in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible
 causes. Refer the link below for steps to boot in Safe Mode.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p><span>In case the issue doesnât occur in Safe Mode try performing a Clean boot to

<p>Thanks for this. It worked today as you said but when I followed that link on the 1st&nbsp; March it definitely took me to a blank screen with "failed" in&nbsp;the top address line. I've no idea if that was pre- or post-WU.</p>

<p>I too had the same issue(<span>DWM Notification Window icon appeared) this morning on the first start. I was going to close it but read someone closed it and created more problem..&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I then read what Pawan D's answer below and got rid off DWM icon.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I&nbsp; used Method 1. The only difference I did different was after Step 3 I did not try to remove the DWN icon(chicken out) instead I closed out everything then did a Restart, for some reason It took much longer to reboot
 this time than normal and I was worry, but after reboot is done it's FIXED, no more DWN icon.</span></p>

<h2>            Why do I have a BSoD&#33;</h2>
                    <p>This has been happening a long time ago, (approx. 4 weeks). Whenever I play high graphics games, e.g Battlefield 3, Far Cry 3, my computer always BSoDs and has the error SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION every time. I play about 30 seconds in the game and then it
 BSoDs. According to the Event Viewer, I have a few errors before the one that tells me when it shut down. I'll go down the list before it shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;The previous system shutdown at 2:49:56 PM on â5/â3/â2014 was unexpected.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;The DSM service was delayed by 17 seconds for a driver query/download/install on device 'ROOT\NET\0000'</p>
<p>and then the rest is confidential...</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Then I also have some of these</p>
<p>
</p><p>-The driver \Driver\WudfRd failed to load for the device SWD\WPDBUSENUM\_??_USBSTOR#Disk&amp;Ven_Generic&amp;Prod_STORAGE_DEVICE&amp;Rev_9451#6&amp;d9dd876&amp;0#{53f56307-b6bf-11d0-94f2-00a0c91efb8b}.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. When I try and compress the DMP file, it says its not readable and cannot be comprssed. It says I dont have access, but I checked the privileges and it said that I had full access to the file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I also cant just transfer it, beacuse of the same reason.</p>

<p>To try and answer your questions:</p>
<p>1. Run Doug Knox's .exe fix (which is <strong>not</strong> an .exe file). <a href="http://www.dougknox.com/xp/file_assoc.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.dougknox.com/xp/file_assoc.htm</a></p>
<p>2. Remove the malware. You will probably need to get the programs needed from a different, known-clean computer with an Internet connection. Put the programs on a USB key to take to the infected computer.
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#<span>Removing_Malware</span>
</a></p>
<p>3. If you need to do a clean install of Windows, yes all your data will be gone. Back it up
<strong>NOW</strong> to an external hard drive. Do this from either Safe Mode (to stop the popups) or by booting with a Linux Live CD such as Knoppix or Ubuntu. Let me know if you need instructions for this.
<a href="http://www.knoppix.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.knoppix.net</a></p>
<p>4. If you need to do a clean install of Windows, you will need an XP installation CD. If you have a branded computer (HP, Dell, etc.) get the recovery disc from that company. You will not need to enter a Product Key if you use the company's recovery media.
 If you have a generic-built computer you must use a generic OEM XP installation disc and will use the Product Key on the sticker on the computer case. I'm not sure why you think you wouldn't use this Product Key unless the company to which you took the computer
 installed an illegal copy of Windows. Please clarify what kind of computer you have and what type of XP the Product Key sticker on the case is for (Home/Pro/Media Center).
<strong>DO NOT POST THE PRODUCT KEY.</strong></p>

            Hey Matt.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />2) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />If you decide to use a driver finder then I would use only Driver Max for it's 2 free drivers a day, since my testing shows it to be the best and most reliable.  This is sometimes necessary on an older PC and due to Toshiba ending service.
<br />
<br />3) I would also compare the install you did with this gold standard  Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />The reason I suggest this is because no one of millions who have followed closely the steps in that particular install has ever come back to report another problem that I have seen.  So even if you don't do it over, I'd adapt the optimizations.
<br />
<br />4)  Test the RAM overnight to stress it with the best bootable test memtest86, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />5) Test the hard drive with diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models: 
<br /><a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>.
<br /><a href="https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatools-bootable/using-seatools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatoo...</a>
<br />
<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, from the Command Prompt if necessary:   <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As you have asked, slow performance may be result of your laptop hardware, since Windows 10 operating system requires more than 4 GB of Ram and latest processor. 
<br />
<br />Kindly try these: 
<br />- Delete programs you never use. 
<br />- Limit how many programs run at startup with msconfig. 
<br />1. Press Win + R . In the "Open:" field, type msconfig and press Enter. 
<br />2. Click the Startup tab. 
<br />3. Uncheck the items you do not want to launch on startup. 
<br />4. Restart windows. 
<br />
<br />You can adjust the visual effects in Windows 10 to get better performance: 
<br />- In the search box on the task-bar, type performance. 
<br />- Select Adjust the appearance and performance of Windows. 
<br />- On the Visual Effects tab, select Adjust for best performance &gt; Apply. 
<br />- Restart your PC and see if that speeds up your PC.

<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />
<br />Choose the Processes Tab
<br />
<br />Leave that window open to monitor your system
<br />
<br />When your laptop is running slow, is your Hard drive, CPU or RAM overly busy at that time?
<br />
<br />If so, click on the appropriate column header, so the arrow faces down
<br />
<br />What are the top 5 processes at that time?

<span>
<p><span>My laptop stopped working bc the hard drive was 2 full. &nbsp;I researched solutions 4 days &amp;
 days &amp; finally discovered Microsoft &amp; Google R space hogs, as well as other sites that had trackers &amp; cookies that filled my hard drive.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;After I downloaded &amp; ran CCleaner--it cleared over 50% of the stuff on the hard drive off
 of the hard drive. </span></p>
<p><span>Also, I read U can clean your android devices (phones), as well as tablets; so, U might
 want 2 give it a chance. &nbsp;</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>Here's the hyperlink:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>https://www.****/ccleaner</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>U simply will NOT believe ALL of the trackers &amp; unknown files microsoft &amp; google &amp; other
 websites download on your electronic devices!!! </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>WARNING: Whenever U run CCleaner, U will lose certain info--like if U have a grocery list
 on a grocerer's website; unless, it is saved 2 your account. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Most of the time, I run CCleaner 3x a day w/o closing google (bc U have 2 sign in google
 again after U do that); but, b4 I go 2 bed, I run total CCleaner &amp; click on the "ANALYZE" box; then, I click on the "google needs 2 B closed" box. Then, after I have clicked on the RUN cleaner, &amp; it's completed, I shutdown my computer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>CCleaner does have an annoying popup that warns U that U don't have the latest version;
 but, U can purchase it for $14.99, or something like that; but, it will continue 2 work w/o the update.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, CCleaner provides antivirus software (Avast); but, I don't use that bc I've been using
 microsoft security essentials; but, I'm LIVID, FURIOUS since microsoft is discontinuing support 4 their windows 7 software on 14 JAN 2020; so, I'll probably uninstall microsoft's defender software &amp; install Avast by CCLeaner. I have windows 10 on a desktop
 computer &amp; I HATE it--LOATHE it!!! I have NEVER gotten accustomed 2 it!!! I'm 99 years old &amp; I just want 2 live out my last days on this EARTH w/o having 2 endure ALL of these changes!!! These 1% rich RATS R so avaricious--it makes me physically ill--WHY can't
 ALLofUS feel like we're in the same boat together &amp; try 2 make the EARTH a better place &amp; help everyone have a better life???; instead, elitists funnel more &amp; more $$$ 4 themselves that the relatives they leave behind after they R worm food kill each other
 over their ill-gotten gains? (Sorry--I'll get off of my soapbox, now.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I didn't touch the "REGISTRY" suggestions bc a reviewer of CCleaner posted he had lots of trouble w/ it.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I didn't really comprehend the following; so, I didn't do any
 of this; but, I thought I would include it if anyone else wants 2 try it: </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>A reviewer of CCleaner posted:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I do use the Portable version. I replace CCleaner64.exe with
 a newer version and all settings are saved in the .INI file, no need to reconfigure anything.</span></span></p>
<p><span>ccleaner.ini</span></p>
<p><span>CCleaner64.exe</span></p>
<p><span>Portable.datâ</span></p>
<p><span>Use basic tools for protection of your computer, such as AVG (free) and Malwarebytes AntiMalware
 (free). The remaining task of CCleaner can be done by you, that is, registry cleaning.</span></p>
<p><span>Learn the format and the function of the registry. That way, you will be able to remove
 unnecessary registry entries manually. One thing I will mention is that if you do so, constantly create backups of the registry. I think the problem with these one-click-fixes is that they aren't smart enough to know what you need to keep and what you need
 to remove.</span></p>
<p><span>The really damaging advanced options are grayed out anyway except for the registry cleaner.</span></p>
<p>
</p><div><span>Good luck!!!</span></div>

    <title>Latest Surface Dock Updater Tool Breaks Sound on External Monitor - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Latest Surface Dock Updater Tool Breaks Sound on External Monitor</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this took me FOREVER to figure out, but here it goes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to have a Surface Pro 4 connected to an external monitor with integrated speakers via the Surface Dock. Everything worked great. Then, I downloaded the Surface Dock Updater Tool just to ensure I had the latest firmware on my Surface Dock. The update
 went off without a hitch. However, I later realized that I was no longer getting any sound from my external monitor, which was working perfectly fine prior to updating the Dock firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't ask me why, but it never even OCCURRED to me that the firmware update was the issue. So I did EVERYTHING to try and fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Used Windows Audio Troubleshooter to detect audio issues (non detected)</li><li>Installed the latest manufacturer (HP) drivers for my monitor</li><li>Wiped my Surface Pro 4 and installed a clean version of Windows 10</li><li>Changed out the cables connecting the dock to my monitor</li><li>Changed my monitor</li><li>Connected a dedicated audio jack from the dock to my monitor</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>NOTHING WORKED</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything else was working okay, minus no sound on my external monitor, so I let it go. Then, after a few months, I decided to buy the new Surface Pro. I figured it'd be nice to have the newest device and maybe it would magically fix my audio problems as
 well!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nope. Still the same. The only other variable in the equation was the dock itself. So I tried a brand new dock and voila! Suddenly, I had sound again on my external monitor! Huzzah! I figured the old dock had suffered some hardware failure which resulted
 in the audio problem (firmware update still never even crossed my mind).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, everything was working great. Then, earlier this evening, I decided to install the latest version of the Surface Dock Firmware Updater. Gotta have the latest and greatest, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation was a breeze, as usual, disconnected my Surface from the dock, as instructed, then when I reconnected after a successful update -- lo and behold, ZERO SOUND ON MY EXTERNAL MONITOR ONCE AGAIN!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now back to square one with nothing I can do (except get ANOTHER Surface Dock), which is a ridiculous position for a customer to be in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, please fix this issue ASAP! Or at least offer some way to roll back the firmware for the Surface Dock! It was working fine out of the box -- it's your software that broke it!</p>
<p />

            I updated my surface dock yesterday. It broke the display and made my audio full of static. I agree that they need to offer a way to roll back the firmware. My surface dock has essentially become a very expensive charger because of their update!

<p>
</p><p>That sounds like a good candidate for the&nbsp; Win+Ctrl+Shift+B&nbsp; "magic bullet".&nbsp;&nbsp; However, what that&nbsp;does to me is put everything back to PC Screen Only (which happens to be in Portrait orientation) and then I have to use Win+P, End, Enter&nbsp; Tab, Enter (to&nbsp;cancel
 the Keep this...? prompt with its ridiculously hasty timeout) and then fix some windows that get deformed in the transition from Landscape to Portrait and back to Landscape.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if that helps with your broken display (and makes it quieter)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,&nbsp;broken HDMI sound&nbsp;in W10 CU is well known, so maybe there is a combination of things.</p>

<p>Got the same issue since updating my Surface Dock to the latest firmware on 27 Oct 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before firmware update; the external display worked with perfect picture/display and sound was ok, albeit the sound had intermittent momentary dropouts when streaming or playing any video. Note that the intermittent sound dropout issue is not just on the
 external display's speakers, but also present on my USB stereo headphones which windows sees as a USB Sound card device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After firmware update; the external display continued to work fine with regard to picture/display but no sound whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither of the above two issues such as the intermittent sound before firmware update &amp; complete loss of sound after firmware update is present "if" plugging it straight into the Surface Pro 2017 tablets own built-in mini display port (same for plugging
 USB headphones into tablet), as the sound is then ok with no problems. It's just problematic on the Surface Dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for updating firmware on the Surface Dock, was in the hope it would cure the intermittent sound dropout problem. Unfortunately it just made it worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really wish Microsoft can get on this asap.</p>

            I used the multiple artists as an example, but that's not the only tag that has multiple entries.&nbsp; I also have multiple entries in the Genre tag, which are not written to mp3 files.&nbsp; So I must export these from the WMP library.

<p>Good question, I'm personally not aware of any other tools that export the WMP library and that are able to handle tags with multiple entries.</p>

Metadata Backup</a> , although it suffers from the same problem. However, I'm the current maintainer of the tool and I'm planning to fix this in the near future.</p>

<p>Thanks Tim for the suggestion. I tried out Metadata Backup and I just want to make it clear that the information I need is only stored in the WMP library database file.&nbsp; The MP3 files only have the first entry of the genre tag.&nbsp; Only WMA files seem to hold
 multiple entries in their genre tag.&nbsp;</p>

            Hmm, in case it wasn't clear already: Metadata Backup *does* export everything that's in the WMP library database (except that it currently only exports the first entry of tags with multiple entries).
