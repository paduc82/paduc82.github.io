    <title>Corrupted update&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Corrupted update&#63;</h2>
                    I probably should have mentioned this days ago, but my computer updated on November 2 and has since become unusable. It gets stuck in a restart loop and won't stay on for longer than three minutes before restarting.<br />
<br />
That only gives me enough time to log in and let the desktop load. I can't open Settings in time to do anything to fix this problem myself and nothing works when I run it in Safe Mode either. My network connectivity is also gone.<br />
<br />
I have a Windows 10 Version 1709 with an OS Build 16299.19. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you very much!

            I think this is a duplicate post, but just in case the first one did not get though:
<br />
<br />I think your best option is to try to roll back the update from the Windows Recovery Environment . . .
<br />
<br />Start PC, just as the manufacturers logo disappears and Windows attempts to load, press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced options - see if there is the option to roll back the update - might be labeled 'Revert to previous version of Windows' - that would be the best option . . .
<br />
<br />Failing that, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset

            I'm not surprised you are having trouble with Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />
<br />If you are unable to rollback:
<br />
<br />You can downgrade to Windows 10 1703 by downloading the ISO at <a href="http://windowsiso.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsiso.net</a>
<br />
<br />Create a bootable copy:

<h2>            XBOX ONE Redemption Issue&#58; &#38;quot&#59;Something went wrong - Give it another try...&#38;quot&#59; -- BF4 Premium Code</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>tl:dr - I have a legitimate code bought from Gamestop that is not being redeemed on my Xbox One or online for some unknown reason. The error code that is given to me does not match online to my knowledge. The prepaid code does
 work, but on the final confirmation of redeeming the code, I get the error.</span></p>


<p>I've been having an issue where my Xbox One will not let me successfully redeem a code - either through the X1 itself or online. The specific problem I'm having now is that I just bought a code at Gamestop for BF4 Premium. The code is printed on the receipt
 and is ready to use.</p>

<p>So, when I have been attempting to use the code, this is what happens:</p>
<p>I type in the code (correctly),</p>
<p>I get a screen (on the X1 and online - they're basically identical) showing what is being added to my account [it says: "Use Prepaid Code - $56.00 for your Microsoft account - When you redeem this code, we'll fund your Microsoft account. ... etc."],</p>
<p>I click Confirm,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I get this error message that says: "Something went wrong - Give it another try. If this happens again....", then it says to use the following code online to see if there's a solution to it.</p>
<p>(I WOULD provide screen shots, but I can't seem to upload them onto here :o)</p>

<p>I do get a long code, but it doesn't quite fit anything that is online. For example, this is what I received the latest time I attempted this:</p>
<p>XbosPurchase</p>
<p><span>ec3ca16c-1694-4d89-9d55-380eaf8033ff</span></p>
<p>2014/03/27 - 04:00:57 UTC</p>

<p>[I don't know why it says XbosPurchase, though... kinda odd]</p>

<p>As of now, I 'technically' don't have Gold at the moment (it ended about a month ago according to my account info online). However, I'm able to play online games and everything on the X1 as if I do have Gold. On my 360, I am not able to do such things.</p>
<p>Is it possible that I need Gold to even redeem this code? If that's the case, then that might potentially be an easy fix.</p>

<p>I also had someone chat with me through the BF4 help service. I'm pretty sure this problem is for Xbox and not EA, but the more help I can get, the better. They recommended that I be sure that this code works by asking Gamestop, then going online to Xbox
 for the help.</p>

<p>Has anyone else experienced this problem? This is turning out to be pretty aggravating, since I really don't want this code to not work at all and waste almost $60...</p>

<p>Thank you for any help in advanced! If there's any other info I should provide, let me know! I wouldn't be surprised if I forgot something :)</p>


<p>Oh, PS, I had a similar problem with the Titanfall Beta codes that I was given. Though, I'm pretty sure they didn't work just because the beta became open to the public by the time I tried the codes out.</p>

<p>Hello, I recently renamed my videos and the THM file associated with it and found out that now none of the videos play.</p>
<p>I made an even bigger mistake because I tried to fix it like a moron ,&nbsp;I right clicked on the THM file, I clicked on "properties", on the</p>
<p>general tab i clicked on "opens with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; change" and changed it to open with windows media player (big mistake).</p>
<p>Yes, I know this wasn't good (now) obviously, so can you help me fix this (before my wife kills me)? Thank you so much.</p>

<span>The problem is that I can't hear other players over the in game chat. my mic shows that i'm speaking, but I can't hear incoming chat. Now i messed with the router settings, trying a bunch of different things. I tried port forwarding, using a dmz, turning
 upnp off and on. I was able to get my NAT from moderate to open, but that didn't do much. Now, If I reset the router and turn off my xbox, when i boot it all back up, the game chat will work for a short time, but then pretty much shuts off. If the controller
 dies or i unplug the chat adapter or any connected wires, it won't work again when i plug it back in or turn the controller back on. that was all with my astro a40's. so after all that, i thought it might be the headset, so bought a new pair just to test,
 got the earforce X07's. same problem, chat works when i fire up the xbox, works for about 2-3 games, then shuts off again. I've talked to astro and ms, and I can't seem to get any answers. anyone having similar problems or have any advice??</span><br />

<span>sorry for the long post, but i have been trying to fix this for like 4 weekends, and i have just become extremely frustrated. if anyone has any input that would be really awesome.</span></p>

<p>Just started having the same issue today with the xbox chat adapter. Funny thing is it works just fine over skype, but when i play say Call of Duty, i can see mic icons light up, as well as my own, yet i hear nothing. Haven't been able to find any help either!

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;BadboyBH!<br /><br />Sorry to hear about the chat issues. &nbsp;Just to make sure that we are not missing any troubleshooting steps, I would like you to try a few steps to see if we can get this issue sorted.<br /><br /><strong>Please give the following steps a shot:<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Xbox One console for 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Once your console is powered off, unplug the power cord.</li>
<li>Leave the console unplugged for 5 minutes and plug in your console.</li>
<li>Power on your console.</li>
<li>Check that your privacy settings allow communications with everyone.</li>
<li>Unmute the person you are trying to chat with<strong>.<br /><br /></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are still unable to hear other players in chat, I recommend checking out our&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/troubleshoot-parties#45e08a1b38fb4e778594ffecfcf52389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot parties on Xbox One</a>&nbsp;page.</p>

<p>This is happening to me on every online game too.It is also happening to people on the gaming forum GameFAQS, &amp; my future brother-in-laws chat and he's in the same house.Unfortunately Mister Quimby, that is not a permanent fix.I updated my router, shut off
 both the modem, router, held the power button for 5 seconds &amp; unplugged my console for a little over 5 minutes, &amp; it just temporarily fixes the issue, and even when it's "fixed" I can only hear certain people, and I can see other people's chat icon light up,
 but I don't hear them, yet everyone else does.</p>
<p>Within a few matches or so, it starts doing the same thing.It either does one of the few things.....It will either show people talking &amp; I can't hear anyone, I unplug my mic, plug it back in, &amp; it doesn't show that I'm talking at all, I can only hear certain
 people, but can't hear my future Brother-in-law, none of it works yet Party chat does, or nothing at all does......We both even went out of our way thinking it was our headsets (the ones that come with every Xbox One) &amp; exchanged them for a new one at gamestop,
 only to still have the same issue....There has to be some xbox live issue with chat going on here......</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi jerrywinkle,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The error states that the hard disk is having errors or corrupt sectors, which is causing the issue.<br />
I would suggest you to use check disk command and check and repair for any errors on hard disk -</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Warning:</span></strong><span> Microsoft does not recommend
<strong>interrupting</strong> the CHKDSK process. Microsoft does not guarantee the integrity of the disk if the CHKDSK program is interrupted.
<strong>For safety you can back up your data before using the check disk command if you can.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Use the check disk commands as follows:<br />
&nbsp;1. Click Start. <br />
&nbsp;2. In search window type 'cmd' and ENTER. Right click and select 'Run as administrator'.<br />
&nbsp;3. </span><span>Type at the command prompt
<strong>CHKDSK C: /F /R</strong> and press ENTER to repair corrupt sectors, if there are any.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>NOTE: The root drive has to be C: and the command may schedule a task at the system startup, if it does, then&nbsp;press Y to schedule a task and restart
 the computer to perform chkdsk.<br />
Once chkdsk completes, boot to the desktop and then check.</span></span></p>

            Hello, I see that you are having some trouble with configuring the graphics card. First, can you make sure that the graphics card is plugged into the computer? Then, try checking the graphics card manufacturer. Once you have checked this, go to the manufacturers website and download the appropriate version of your driver. Don't forget to check the model for your hardware. Once you have finished installing, restart your computer and see if the graphics driver is listed in the device manager. 
<br />Hope this helps! :-)

<h2>            Revert start menu to pre anniversary update appearance</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just got the anniversary update and I really don't like the new appearance of the start menu since I hardly ever use the full list of applications. Is there any way I can revert the start menu appearance back to the way it was before the update or at least
 pin the left-most pane so it is expanded by default?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>You cannot remove the 'All Apps' from the Anniversary Update Start Menu, a lot of users are asking for this and hopefully Microsoft is listening.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe in a future Update there will be an option to remove this, but for now, we are all stuck with it</p>

            The most annoying part of this is there is no way to navigate to the power options from the keyboard. I have always hit the windows key navigated up and been able to select shut down or some sort of power option... now there is absolutely no way to do
 this... this is an example of fixing something that was not broken and creating a problem by doing so.

<h2>            mshtml.dll appears to be corrupt how do i replace it</h2>
                    I tried issuing the following commands using a command prompt on Windows 7:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>regsvr32 c:\windows\system32\mshtml.dll</div>
<div>
<div>regsvr32 c:\windows\system32\msjava.dll</div>

<div>regsvr32 c:\windows\system32\shdocvw.dll</div>
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and I get the following error for the first DLL: "The module c:\windows\system32\mshtml.dll" was loaded bu the entry-point DllRegisterServer was not found. Make sure that "c:\windows\system32\mshtml.dll" is a valid DLL or OCX file and then try again".
 And similar error messages for all of these.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So where can I get valid replacements for these DLLs?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Edit: I did a SFC /SCANNOW command at a command prompt and got zero error messages. Does the SFC /SCANNOW command check these specific .DLLs, I have listed?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />

            Some DLLs can't be registered. MSHTML.DLL is one of them, it doesn't have a&nbsp;DllRegisterServer&nbsp;entrypoint as the error message indicates. This is absolutely normal, and you don't need DLL replacements.

            Go to the start menu, find command prompt and right click "run as administrator". You are now in what's called an elevated command prompt. type in "chkdsk" as a command and hit enter. It will check for corrputed or damaged system files.

    <title>Surface Book 2 CPU frequency stuck on low even under heavy load - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Book 2 CPU frequency stuck on low even under heavy load</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I frequently run mathematical computations on my SB2 that take minutes or tens of seconds, both single and multicore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frequently my SB2 will get stuck with the CPU frequency on 0.8 GHz, even when running such a task. It will at most ramp up to 0.92. It's obvious this has happened, because the whole computer becomes very slow (without running the computation), even typing
 this in Edge at this moment is arduous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SB2 is connected to the mains, best performance is chosen. If I reboot, I immediately get back the normal 3.x GHz speeds for a single-core and 2.1 for multicore with nice 100% CPU utilisation, with no thermal issues. Surely this must be some firmware
 issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any solution? Is anyone at MS tracking this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>I am running a fully updated Windows 10 Pro (FCU, 16299.248).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has been happening since the beginning when I bought the machine in December (it was immediately updated to FCU at that time).
<br />
<br />
The problem is intermittent, but eventually always occurs when I have been using the machine to long enough with some sleep/wake cycles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know how to even start troubleshooting something like this. he importnant aspect is that the computer behave well after a cold boot for some days. After 2-3 days (with 5-6 sleep cycles during that time) this begins to happen.</p>

<p>I had the same problem: CPU throttling to 0.79GHz max no matter what power settings I changed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Happened several times and here was why:</p>
<p>&nbsp; Problem 1: Tablet was overheating.&nbsp; If the room is warm (80F+) these can overheat and throttle down.&nbsp; Solution: take to a cool room, wait 10 mins, and try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Problem 2: Unknown.&nbsp; Solution: Tablet needed to be fully shutdown (NOT just restarted!)</p>
<p>&nbsp; Problem 3: Docking station.&nbsp; I cant remember if dock was a problem here or it was a different issue.&nbsp; But try disconnecting all peripherals and shutting down/turning on again.</p>

 pushing the eject button.&nbsp; I have two copies of the movie on DVD and I checked them, they are clean and&nbsp;no scratches or marks.&nbsp; I put in Cinderella on Blu-ray and it works fine, I also tried it with Aladdin DVD and works fine it is only the Lion King DVD that

<p>I'm currently an Xbox Live Gold member, and have been so for a good 5 years. I haven't been playing online much lately so I've been considering dropping back to Silver for a while. If I do so, will I permanently lose the little badge on my gamercard that

<p>I would like to know if there is a way to expand the colors for the SOLITAIRE game? My dad finds the colors for the background and cards are too harsh and they appear blurry to him and me also. He wondered if we could add more colors so you can get a bigger
 variety to both the background and the cards. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><span><span><span>You will not be able to add colors to the cards or the background, but you can change the color of the background and cards and also
 enlarge the cards.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a. Click on start and then click on Games.<br />
b. Open Solitaire.<br />
c. Click on Game and then click on Change Appearance.<br />
d. Select your preferred background or deck color.<br />
e. Choose the option "Large Print Deck." This will enlarge the card identifier but not the card. So the cards will be the same size, but the name of the card will be bigger.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>Why do you want to screen mirror? Knowing your reason will help me come up with suggestions.&nbsp;What might work best depends on what you're trying to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I mirror my laptop's screen on my TV to use the laptop as a video player. The laptop stays by the TV, and is connected by an HDMI cable. I use a wireless keyboard to control the laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that setup might not work for whatever you have in mind. </p>

            <p>I have a desktop PC with a 6-tuner card with two 22" monitors&nbsp;and 60" TV in the same room. I have a wired Xbox 360 that I use as&nbsp;a WMC&nbsp;extender and a Roku 3 because I got it really cheap. I want to watch online programming on my TV instead of the computer
 monitor. There are a couple online video sources that I want to view on my TV instead of the PC but there is no App or Channel for them. The main site I'm interested in&nbsp;is cokeandpopcorn.com
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent hours on the phone with MS tech support previously even Level 2 and none of them knew about the W8.1/IE App/Xbox screen mirroring capability. As I said, the problem is that it only works with the IE App (not IE browser) and that doesn't work with
 C&amp;P and most of the other sources I've tried. It's like nobody wants to be bothered with the IE App.</p>

            <p>Actually it dose not work for Xbox, but does work for other computers. I tried with a HDMI cable and it didn't work. Will VGA work? Or is there some software or app. Also i have an Xbox 360 and Windows 10 ASUS laptop.</p>

            <p>Simple. In my living room I have my desktop pc on one side and a 50" plasma tv on the other. There are videos, TV shows (past episodes of USA Network&nbsp;and AMC, etc.&nbsp;only available from their website) and I'd rather watch on my TV from my sofa rather than
 my desk chair at my desk. Xbox&nbsp;has very limited apps and much of the content I want to view isn't available on YT and the few it has.
<br />
<br />
There are video on YT that show using a laptop with 8.1 streaming/mirroring to a TV via Xbox; it just doesn't work on my 8.1 desktop. It is supposed to work from Devices/Play/Xbox 360...and yes the Xbox is added as a media extender device; it just doesn't show
 after Play. When I click Play, it says it can only play through the IE app but even that doesn't work...nor does the IE browser. Even if the app did show, virtually nothing works with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even took my pc to the MS store recently and spent an hour with a tech who couldn't get it to work or figure out why it didn't. I have spent many hours on the phone with MS tech support and none of them even knew of the capability let alone how to get
 it to work...even after escalating it. They all acknowledged it's supposed to work. I've even reinstalled the OS but no go. It's been 3 years now and it still doesn't work!</p>

<h2>            Unable to connect to remote networked Win10 PC filesystem using file explorer</h2>
                    <p>At my location where I work, for troubleshooting and such, one way of accessing networked PCs is opening up file explorer and navigating to \\computer name\drive letter. Before the upgrade to Win10 this seemed to work without issue. Ever since the update
 to Win10 there will be intermittent issues with connecting to the PC's file system even when using the full path with domain. I can ping the PC fine just can't access file system. I've tried playing around with network sharing settings but haven't had any
 luck so far. Appreciate any suggestions!</p>

            1. Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them toAutomatic (Delayed Start).
<br />2. When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X &gt; computer management--&gt;shared folders--&gt; choose the shared folder, right click it then click Properties &gt; Share Permissions --&gt;protection that everyone can read and execute, see folder contents and read permissions.
<br />
<br />Add the machine to your Windows HOSTS file.

            Hi mattsshwaryn,
<br />
<br />If you have a problem seeing each PC in the Network Section in File Explorer:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Services and hit Enter
<br />
<br />When the Services app opens, scroll down to find the 'Function Discovery Resource Publication' service
<br />
<br />Double-click that and set its startup type to Automatic
<br />
<br />Then Start that service
<br />
<br />Save that and close the Services app
<br />
<br />That's It!       
        </p>

            &nbsp;Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
You may unplug the monitor, powered down, and then replug it and check.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
You may uninstall the display drivers and re-install the same and check if that fixes the issue.<br />
a. Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
b. Expand the Display Adapters section, right-click your device and then uninstall it<br />
c. Restart the computer, let vista detect the driver and install by itself. If that does not help, install the latest version of the driver from the manufacturer's website.<br />
Refer the link:<br />
Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly”<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a>
<div><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
You may also check whether the flash cards have been properly insatalled. Flash card drivers comes with Toshiba Value added Package.<br />
You may try to removing currently installed and reinstall it again and check if the Fn+ F5 key works.<br />

<p>Follow the steps to un-install Picassa 3.</p>
<p>a) Press Windows key + X to open a task list from the bottom left corner of the screen.<br />
b) Select Control Panel.<br />
c) Select Programs and Features.<br />
d) Double click on Picassa 3 to uninstall and follow the onscreen instructions.<br />

            Yes, there is a different tool. Delete or rename the current &nbsp;MediaCreationTool.exe &nbsp;in your downloads folder. Then re download the new one and run it.&nbsp;If you check the properties for the tool it will tell you what verision it is and what version you'll
 get with it.&nbsp;

            Right click the exe and select properties. The file version will have 10240 or 10586 in it. There is no problem running it on a Windows 10 PC. I've done it numerous times. Especially if all your doing is downloading the install media. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            Perhaps you didn't have single language originally. I found it best to go with what was recommended.

            <p><span>Hi Cliff,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Do you receive any error codes or messages when you try to open or delete the files?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Have you made any recent changes on the system?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Are you facing the issue only with the picture library?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>You may try booting in safe mode and try to open or delete the folder.</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer to the following article to boot in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>Start
 your computer in safe mode</span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:
</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists then you may try the below steps to fix the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open
<b>Windows Explorer</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>b.
<b>Right-click</b> on the corresponding library and choose <b>Delete</b>.
</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click
<b>Yes </b>when asked for confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Deleting a library does not delete the contents of the included folders. However, you may need to re-add or include your folders manually,
 if needed.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Then, in the
<b>navigation pane</b> of Windows Explorer, <b>right-click on Libraries</b> and click
<b>Restore default libraries.</b></span></p>
