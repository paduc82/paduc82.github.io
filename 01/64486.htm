    <title>Windows Movie Maker saving corrupted files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> turnbullroad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Movie Maker saving corrupted files</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to save a roughly 30 minute movie that I edited with no success. When I save the movie, everything works as it should, but when I go to the saved file there is no thumbnail and the movie cannot be opened with any media player. Oddly enough,
 the saved file is an MP4 file and the size seems about right (about 4GB for a 30 minuted 1080p movie), but no media player can open the file. In addition, when I open the file in Movie Maker, all I get is 7 seconds of a black screen with no audio. What is
 even crazier is that I just used Movie Maker to edit/save 3 movies a couple of days ago, the only difference being that these videos were much shorter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I have tried so far:</p>
<p>Opened the Movie Maker file and attempted to save the movie again</p>
<p>Created a new Movie Maker file and reedited everything and saved the movie</p>
<p>Converted the imported files from MP4 to AVI and saved the movie</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am sorry to know that you are facing issues with Windows Movie Maker.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I suggest you to open up your project file in Notepad and notice if Movie Maker has indeed corrupted your project. If there are several VideoClip items that have an outTime equal to zero. In particular, if the inTime is
 positive and the outTime is zero, that is essentially a clip with a negative length and that causes Movie Maker fits the next time it opens the project.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>You aren't the only one plagued by this problem but I've yet to see Microsoft acknowledge this issue. You are usually then forced to either start over or to try to manually fix the problem yourself.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>If you want to try fixing the problem yourself, make a *copy* of the project file. Right-click on the project file and choose "Open with..." and pick Notepad. (However, don't make that the default file association or all
 future projects will try to launch Notepad rather than Movie Maker).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Now manually find each instance of outTime and check the value. If it is 0 or earlier than the inTime, change it to be equal to the length of the original clip. You can find the length of each media item listed at the top
 of the file.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Hope this helps in resolving the issue. If the issue persists, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

            So I checked all of the inTimes and their respective outTimes, and everything seems to check out. However, I noticed that some of the inTimes had the same value (I had more than one 0) and that some of the clips seemed to overlap (like the inTime of one
 clip occurs BEFORE the outTime of another clip). Could this be causing issues?

            I found out what the issue was. The movie file was just too large. Apparently .mp4 files can only be 4 gB. Is there any way to save a Movie Maker project as a file type other than .mp4, like .avi?

<h2>            Not enough space for Windows 10 update</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron 11 with 32GB SSD that came with Windows 10 installed. The latest Windows 10 update requires 8GB apparently. There's no way to get that amount of free space but I do have a 16GB but Windows won't use it. How do I get the Windows 10
 update?

            You have a couple options you can try:
<br />
<br />Connect an external drive with enough space then choose it to facilitate the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are upgrading through Windows Update and the external drive is not detected, download the ISO file and use that. Learn more:

            Blimey! What a mess. Beats me why the Windows Update app can't just use the SD storage sitting in the laptop. I might not bother and just stick with the version already there.

            I had a same issue but my device was a LENOVO IDEAPAD it only comes with 27gb internal so what I did is I plugged in a 16gb SD card after an update has been initiated it ask me to choose an additional storage which is the SD card but suddenly an error
 message pop up INSERT EXTERNAL DRIVE so do I need to buy like 1tb external just for the update to be completed or is it okay just to leave it as it is and not proceed with it. I mean windows should make exceptions in regards to updating its just frustrating
 I bought a cheap notebook for simple works yet the updates of windows 10 is killin me. Could you please give me a cheaper options?

            I have had the same issue. I ended up stopping the Upgrade Assistant then moved the Windows10Upgrade folder to my external drive. In the folder I edited the configuration file to point to the new location for downloads. Ran the assistant from the new folder
 and it worked. Took me a very long time going through all the other suggestions online with no success. Hope this helps.&nbsp;

<h2>            All games stutter&#47;fps dip while connected to internet via lan&#47;wifi</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed recently all my games started to stutter/jitter whatever it is called. What is happenning is every few seconds there is a lag on the screen and as well as sound. this happened to all the games i currently play. I tried everything like updating
 to latest graphics driver/sound driver changed all possible 3d driver settings on the nvidia control pannel but the stutter didn't seem to disappear.&nbsp; I have latest windows 10 home 1709. The games fps seems to be normal but it dups to 0fps every 3 seconds
 for few ms. Then I tried to turn off the internet and the stutter seems to have disappeared. Initially i thought this is absurd but i tested this many times with wired/wifi so whenever i am connected to the internet all the games i play seems to start stuttering.
 When PC is idle connected to internet the cpu/gpu seems to be around 1% use and temp seems to be normal and also during games GPU seems to be around 100% and temp seems to be max 70degree c. So nothing unusual but the issue definitely only occurs when i am
 connected to the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So initially i thought this was a bitcoin miner virus but wondows defender doesnt seem to find any virus in my pc. Can u please help diagnose the issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>

</p><p>Thanks for the reply can u please elaborate on this I often see in Microsoft community forums if a customer raises an issue we get a blank reply on mostly what looks like a workaround honestly please explain the problem first. Now u recommending downgrading
 my OS version so have u already determined the issue from what I raised ? if so can u please elaborate on the problem first. and explain to me what is the issue with 1709 u want me to downgrade to 1703?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            You are likely experiencing a compatibility issue with your hardware and Windows 10 1709. 
<br />
<br />You mentioned updating essential driver software for graphics and audio and it doesn't help. So, since you have exhausted troubleshooting options, its either you are going to accept the problem as is or downgrade to a previous version where its likely to work better.

<h2>            Microsoft Office click to run &#40;SxS&#41; killing my disk space</h2>
                    <p>Hello All- </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of yesterday I started to experience this lag on my new laptop. I went to go check on task manager and found that a program called Microsoft Office click to run (SxS) was killing my disk space. I read that this program helps me connect to O365
 and if removed it will kill my connection. So far no one has a fix iin the forums I have ran into. Can some one assist? Also, my Anti Virus comes up as another with wsappx, Service host:local system (15), and system and compressed memory, but the ms takes
 the lead with sometimes going up to 30 MB/s.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Running in safe mode is a trouble shooting technique. If safe mode "fixes" the problem, it is an indication that you have to investigate programs and addons that are running in the background to find the specific program that is causing the problem.

<p>I think in this case they are Office 365 updates. It just make the PC unusable.</p>

<p>There are any number of reasons why the server might return this error. A common one is a mistake in one of the addresses the message is being sent to. To check this, disconnect from the Internet and then remove all unsent
 messages from the outbox (below the account folders in the folder pane). Then compose a new test message with a unique subject (like
<em>Test 1</em>) and send it to yourself. You will have to re-connect before being able to send.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If the message is sent and received without problem, you know that the fault was with the message(s) that failed to send earlier. Check the addresses carefully for illegal characters like spaces, commas or periods at the beginning or end.<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>If the message is not sent, something else is wrong. Please click on the error message to select it, then use right-click to copy it and paste it verbatim into your reply here.</li></ul>

<h2>            Autocad 2010 won&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>hi please help me.. after I installed the Windows 10 Anniversary Update my Autocad 2010 application didn't work. before the update i am using my cracked version Autocad 2010 in my Windows 10 almost 5 months ago and there is no problem in my apps but after
 the update my app wont work anymore. I try to fix it by the System Restore Option but it only had the restore point (September 16, 2016) that day after the anniversary update. The system wont restore the Windows 10 old version, after the restore is finished
 i try to open my Autocad 2010 but it still doesn't open the apps. I try to restart the PC then i turned off the windows defender and my other antivirus software and then I&nbsp;uninstall and install again the apps and I did this many times&nbsp;but still it doesn't
 work.. This problem is the same with my 3 classmate who Installed also the Anniversary Update, (We had the same PC model). I hope somebody help me to fix this problem because I need to pass my building project at the due date next month :(.</p>

</p><p>Regarding your concern about AutoCAD 2010, which is a good-old developed program, it should still work with Windows 10. You can run the
<strong>Program Compatibility Troubleshooter</strong>. Refer to this link: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15078/windows-make-older-programs-compatible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    <p><em>Original Title: .001 files </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi. I have a .001 that I think contains a ISO or BIN file. I have no idea what program to use. I've tried using 7-zip and WinRAR but they said its an invalid archive type...</p>
<p>So is there any other program? I know I'm asking this question again but..If you do find a program can you explain to me what to do I might not get what I should do with the program since I never opened a .001 file before &gt;.&gt;. Anyway, thanks for your feedback!]</p>
<p>(P.S I have used H-J Split too but I am confused on how it works. All it did was create more of those files. Were they part of it? Dunno~)<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/57ccab0e-b4b4-4da7-9e13-30f52f09b3ba" /></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
.001 implies it's a PART file, which requires the other parts and then software such as
<a href="http://www.hjsplit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HJSplit</a> to form it into one.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<h2>            Can you remove the disc while updating a game&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm updating Battlefield 4, but after getting to 96%, it started going really slow. It has been at&nbsp;97% for about an hour and a half (Assassin's Creed did the same thing, but finished after about an hour), so&nbsp;I would like to know if I could swap the disc
 out and play another game untill it finishes the update.</p>

Great question!<strong> You cannot remove the disc while the game is installing. You may be able to play it while it updates though. &nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
Hope that clears things up, but let us know if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I typed pnputil.exe -e and that enumerated the list of drivers on my system and so i found that audio driver and typed the pnputil.exe forced deletion of driver and it deleted it from what it said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;but when i placed the audio card in another slot windows automatically placed the driver (what was left of the software after trying to chop the software out manually because the uninstallers wouldnt start)</p>

<p>Notice if you can it originally said that deleting the driver package failed and then it says one or more devices are presently installed using the specified INF. and that device is not getting detected in device manager.</p>

            <p>I have now Put the audio card in another expansion slot (PCIe2.0x16_2) and it was detected there and went to device manager and right clicked on the audio device and clicked uninstall and then checked delete the driver software then ok and it proceeded to
 do so. </p>
<p>i put the audio card in the orginal intended slot (PCIe 2.0x1_1)&nbsp;and there still is no detection of the audio card. And so i am continuing to work on this.</p>
<p>I am thinking these things that i am trying will work for other devices also.</p>

    <title>Why is the headset adapter so expensive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> enendaveyboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is the headset adapter so expensive&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Its a very small part of a headset, but its £20? you can get a full headset for the 360 for that.</p>
<p>I don't buy £150+ headsets, so its a little disappointed at the price.</p>

<p>The adapter is for those of us who do buy expensive headsets and don't want to buy a One specific headset. 20 bucks for an adapter is a deal if I don't have to buy another headset for 150-200.</p>
<p>If you use cheap headsets you don't need the adapter.</p>

<p>Where is the magic. &nbsp;All this rubbish for STEREO WIRED. &nbsp;Who needs the volume controls on that adapter anyways as all the headsets have volume already. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The adapter is simply to allow us to use headsets that don't have MS's proprietary connection, doesn't bring anything else to the table.</p>
<p>I agree its a money grab but without it the alternative is a new headset with the MS connection.

<p>Update is to accommodate the silly adapter. &nbsp; the people who wanted the adapter were those with 2-3 hundred dollar headsets and most of those are Bluetooth wireless. &nbsp;I can't imagine anyone needing an adapter to use a 50 roller or less headset. &nbsp;A new headset
 would be better option for that</p>
<p>at least they added Dolby through optical so the sound is now amazing and the Kinect can work for chat</p>

<p>Come with an adapter that will convert the sound produced by the XB1 to a stereo pin most headsets used... &nbsp;you may think it is just a cheap adapter Radio Shack can sell to exchange a 3.5 to a 5mm &nbsp;but it is not...there is a lot of stuff going on inside

<p>It is so expensive because they know people will buy it. There are loads of people out there who spent a lot of money on gaming headsets for last gen. They don't want to go to waste. This will lead them to buying the adapter. I would say that the price to
 make it is no where near the selling price. </p>

    <title>Windows 10 update &#47; upgrade re-downloads over and over and over - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> antonfriedman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update &#47; upgrade re-downloads over and over and over again</h2>
                    <p>So I had to 'reset' my PC, using the version of Windows on my SSD's partition. I'm not sure what version of Windows 10 Pro I have, except that it is version 14393. It is trying to update / upgrade to version 15063.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What has been happening is: it will download all the way to 100%, hang for about 15 seconds, and then go back to 0% and start over. It does this over and over and over. There is no indication that these are different versions being downloaded, from what
 I can see (I've checked). It just seems to be the same cumulative updated being repetitively downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the download is estimated at around 4 gigs. I've already lost 16+ gigs of my Internet bandwidth to this repetitive download cycle (however, there hasn't been a significant decrease in disc space, it remains the same, making me think the data is 'lost'
 somehow).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's one thing I can think of that might be at the heart of this: when I initially started the update / upgrade process, it got to about 5% when there was a system crash (which may or may not have been related to the download). The crash resulted in a
 reboot, and when I restarted the download, it went fairly quickly to 5% again, making me think that that amount of data had already been downloaded onto my computer. (Not sure though).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I need to find a way to stop it doing this downloading loop, and to get it to accept the data it has downloaded so it can install it. Please help? I am in a third world country where Internet costs are expensive, and I can't afford to use much more bandwidth
 wasted on an endless downloading loop.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 pen is not longer working</h2>
                    <p>My Surface Pro 4 pen is no longer working.</p>
<p>I have replaced the batteries, paired it again, downloaded all Windows Updates and replaced the pen tip.</p>
<p>Is it possible that it just does not work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a problem just buying another one if that is what I really need to do. It is just disappointing that a pen I rarely used has completely stopped working.
</p>
<p>Any advice would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Catastrophic failure</strong> is a sudden, complete, and unexpected breakdown of a device from which recovery is impossible. This error can also be caused by malware or software conflicts.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Since Skype is now using the cloud infrastructure, it should reflect the same or equivalent status on both device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are&nbsp;you getting different status? What exact versions do you have installed on your devices?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Passwords are your first line of defense against hackers. If it is a simple password, your account may be easily accessed through hacking. That is why we recommend strong passwords. Kindly refer to this link:
