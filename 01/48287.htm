<h2>            Achievements</h2>
                    
<p>Has this happened to anybody else?</p>
<p><br />
Last service update june 4th 2014. Most my 100% completion list was reset&nbsp; 15 -18 game titles like Saints Row 3, Dishonored, Xcom which I had 1 k completed or purchased and completed the first DLC, like with AC3 and Saints Row 3. That first DLC had come with
 those games starting achievements were reset incorporating all the later DLC's presently. These games I had completed long before any later DLC's. I no longer have these games in my collection trading them for newer games before they devalued weekly to the
 point of 5 quid now a year later on when all there DLC's would have become available, off the original 40-50&nbsp; pre-order price. I hadn't played them after any completion which would have been within in the first few weeks of&nbsp; purchase or game play.&nbsp; I.E Dishonored
 was traded for XCOM, XCOM was traded for Halo 4.</p>
<p><br />
I have cancelled my subscription to LIVE until this issue has been resolved. If it doesn't get resolved, happening to other gamers, there is a very greedy corrupt marketing motive from LIVE. Where there new plan for giving games on GOLD is only a diabolical
 marketing ploy to get you buying the DLC's which don't devalue costing more then the game is worth. I&gt;E after waiting a year for BIO Shock new DLC that game would have been worth waht 5 quid from any retailer alot more from LIVE but the DLC is worth between
 10-20 this is on every game, a free Dark Souls with Gold the DLC costs 10-20.</p>
<p><br />
I would hate think there isn't a reasonable explanation into this and this achievement error happened when. I bought TWAU latest DLC In Sheep's Clothing on the MAY 27 2014 where when I completed all but the Master Librarian on that day. That DLC achievements
 weren't added to my social profile showing 21/28 complete. But when searching under that games achievements they were completed.&nbsp; I contacted LIVE support and they reset my profile but didn't fix this issue however on the 4th with the service update these
 achievements were reset allowing me to replay and achieve them. However in doing so it reset all my completed games as well.</p>

<p>I can only hope Microsoft aren't the evil organization ripping gamers off so blatantly through their marketing schemes.&nbsp; Making millions for companies who&nbsp; rip off gamers so blatantly to produce on average a 10 hour generic game title, when selling a 1/4
 of the game back to you every few months on a DLC which doesn't devalue like the original game has. Specifically controlled by LIVE who take that biggest rake for having full control of those DLC packs, because any retailer will only offer a code on the first
 as pre-ordered content.</p>

<p>I don't where to post but I feel incredibly cheated right now, I play for fun and completion but I don't have 5 -10k thousand to buy brand new games then wait a year until all DLC's are available. Then get 500 bucks back for my collection which I had already
 completed prior to DLC's not playing those titles I no longer even had.</p>

<p>In case you don't understand a word of this the above, in&nbsp;perspective. Will Wolfenstein New order completed at 1k in my social profile 100% revert back to non complete having points added when its DLC comes out. Wolfenstein New Order&nbsp; a generic game x4 cds
 of 10-15 hour play through 1ked completed basically in one UBER play through, although&nbsp; be it a fun game. It was gonna be traded in today for Murdered Soul Suspect or South Park Stick of Truth costing me next to nothing on those titles making them affordable.</p>

<p>I hope there is some resolve to this achievment issue, which looks to be quite sinister in intended motive</p>

    <title>BMR in WINRE won&#39;t restore the backup from network drive. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jbeangreen11  say:</h3>
<h2>            BMR in WINRE won&#39;t restore the backup from network drive.</h2>
                    Currently we are in the testing phase of rolling out DPM 2007 to backup Windows Server 2008.<br />
<br />
DPM backs up the Windows Storage Server 2008 correctly to the network drive attached to the DPM server.<br />
<br />
On the Windows Storage Server 2008 I pulled the current hard drive that was working correctly (500GB) out of the computer and replaced it with a 1TB.
<br />
<br />
I booted the machine with the WSS2008 disk, in CMD prompt I enter the following:<span>
<br />
<br />
<b>1)</b> x:\&gt; start /w wpeinit<br />
<b>2)</b> x:\&gt; wbadmin get versions -backuptarget:\\SANDSHREW\serverbackup$<br />
<b>3)</b> x:\&gt; wbadmin start sysrecovery -version</span><span><b><span>:</span></b><span>11/03/2012-18:04 -backuptarget:\\</span><span><span>SANDSHREW</span>\ServerBackup$ -recreatedisks</span><br />
</span><br />
I should mention that when I run 2 and 3 it asks me for the login for the sandshrew server.<br />
<br />
The error I keep getting on 3 is:<br />
<br />
The automated system recovery (ASR) pre restore operation failed.<br />
The parameter is incorrect.<br />
<br />
I have been playing with this for days now, any help would be greatly appreciated :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks a bunch,<br />
<br />

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with the Game's Maker's Support and their forums (if any) as there may be an updated<br />
version or patches to run on Windows 7. Maybe you need to run it in Compatibility mode.<br />

<h2>            How to install and activate Windows 10 using your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Basic
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />Microsoft recently announced the <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/11/12/first-major-update-for-windows-10-available-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
first major update</a> to&nbsp;Windows 10 which includes numerous improvements for end users and businesses. One of the welcome improvements is the compliance check when qualifying for the Windows 10 upgrade. Previously, Windows 7, Windows 8.0 and Windows 8.1 users
 needed to have either of those versions Windows installed and activated in order to qualify for the free upgrade offer. For persons who needed to perform a clean install of Windows 10 from the outset, it was a two step process of first validating the machine
 through the upgrade routine, ensure the Windows 10 Upgrade was activated, then proceed to perform a Reset. With the latest November Update (1511), users no longer have to go through this process. In this article, we take a look at how to install and activate
 Windows 10 using your Windows 7 or Windows&nbsp;8 product key.
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><p>For the purposes of this article, I am using a Windows 7 license to perform clean install using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please note: </strong>The copy of Windows 10 you download must correspond with the edition of Windows you are licensed for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core
<strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">must</span></strong> use a Windows&nbsp;<strong>10 Home ISO</strong></li><li>Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro <span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">
<strong>must </strong></span>use a Windows&nbsp;<strong>10 Pro ISO<br />
</strong></li><li>If you are using Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 8.0 Enterprise, Windows 8.1 Enterprise editions you won't be able to use the free upgrade offer.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Review complete instructions how to download the Windows 10 ISO in the following article:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have your Windows 7 or 8/8.1 product key ready. If you purchased a retail license, you can find the product key within the product box. The Windows 7 product key is normally found on an orange sticker attached to a pamphlet inside the box. The Windows 8/8.1
 product key is found on a small business size card. See examples below. Please note, you can also use your OEM product key too if Windows came preinstalled on your computer.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>If your computer came preinstalled with an OEM version of Windows 7, look for the Certificate of Authenticity sticker attached to the chassis of your computer. Normally this can be at&nbsp;the side or top of the system unit. For laptops, look at the bottom
 of the chassis or inside the battery or memory compartment. It looks like the following:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/image2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fimage_thumb2.png%3fw%3d438%26amp%3bh%3d156" height="156" width="438" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you are running an OEM preinstalled Windows 8/8.1 license, Windows 10 setup should automatically detect the product key and install it automatically.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With Windows 8, Microsoft had changed from stickers that have the product key that the user has to type in when installing the operating system to new BIOS embedded product keys. The idea is that by eliminating the sticker, you eliminate one of the easier
 ways for nefarious users to get a legitimate product key. Eliminating the product key sticker also removes any worry that the sticker might get damaged while at the same time eliminating the long and irritating process of typing in various letters and numbers
 when installing the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the user has to reinstall the operating system on a machine that came with Windows 8, the installation process automatically grabs the software product key from the motherboard BIOS with no input from the user. This means that those familiar Windows product
 key stickers will no longer appear on the Windows 8 computers.</p>

            <p>Have a problem with a win 8 machine which was used during the Insider program which&nbsp;I clean installed during the two weeks between&nbsp;&nbsp;Insider&nbsp;240 and RTM 240 which means that the machine&nbsp;will not activate.&nbsp;I&nbsp;do not&nbsp;have a win8 key as there is no sticker.&nbsp;
 Has this situation been sorted ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quote --- </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the user has to reinstall the operating system on a machine that came with Windows 8, the installation process automatically grabs the software product key from the motherboard BIOS with no input from the user. This means that those familiar Windows product
 key stickers will no longer appear on the Windows 8 computers.</p>

<h2>            Mic levels increasing as I speak. Auto is disabled.</h2>
                    Everything is the same as it's always been but all of a sudden my mic audio increases little by little as I talk. It never goes down unless I put it down but it will increase as soon as I speak. I want to lock it at 20. I have many pictures to show my
 settings and programs I have running. Please help this has ruined so many audio recordings.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a1ae1bc-4465-4f33-888f-9216dd84d704" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a1ae1bc-4465-4f33-888f-9216dd84d704" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04cc2e4e-c210-41ad-8fb8-10fca20303bd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04cc2e4e-c210-41ad-8fb8-10fca20303bd" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a41bce4e-7b06-4a1e-9789-a33bc29e097c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a41bce4e-7b06-4a1e-9789-a33bc29e097c" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba85a73f-ab39-4cfc-ae95-52f7bf0eb4a1" target="_blank" rel="noreferr

            None of this works. It seems fine when I launch my pc and test it but the moment i have any skype call (which is very often) it starts increasing even though all automatic options are disabled... I'm also constantly having the issue of my pc saying it
 needs to update and restart or update and shut down but when i do that the update fails and it says something about could not update undoing changes don't turn off your computer... so my pc has not updated once since i upgraded from windows 8.1 to 10.... seems
 like windows 10 is breaking a lot of stuff for me now and I'm fed up. I'm a content creator as my job and I need my pc to be consistant and spending 3000$ for it not to work is really messed up. anyway my point is either a new skype update broke it or my pc
 just not being able to update at all is messing with it.

            Just did some more testing. IT IS SKYPE! but only and i repeat ONLY when I'm in a skype call. I just did the annoying thing of searching for skype on my pc (bc it doesn't appear in the uninstall list) uninstalling it and trying to update it again which
 didn't work i got an error code stating it's already installed. So i went and installed/updated skype with the newest .msi and now my skype is fully up to date however when I start my skype call my mic instantly jumps to 50 then rapidly increases to 90 and
 then changes up and down as i speak..

<p>G'day Hollingsbee! Try the following steps to see if they improve your Blu-Ray playback:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlight the Blu-Ray app in My games &amp; apps (don't launch it). </li><li>Press the Menu button on your controller, and uninstall the app. </li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Power cycle your console</a>.
</li><li>After restarting, re-install the Blu-Ray app. </li></ul>
<p><br />
If that doesn't work, please make sure that the region on your Blu-Ray discs matches your console's region (were they both bought in the same country?) - While the console itself is physically region free, many Blu-Ray movies are still region-encoded to prevent
 exporting.</p>

<p>just found this which sorted it out :)</p>
<p>gamertag: yuji ben0ire</p>
<p>If u using a Capture Cards for ure YouTube or twitch or anything else PC recording, like Haupauge PVR HD (HDMI Version) or Elgato Games Capture, the Xbox One BluRay Player dosnt work.</p>
<p>U can Play Film DVDs at ure Xbox 360 and using the Elgato Games Capture but u cannot use Xbox One and BluRay Player at the same time.</p>
<p>If u do this, u see a black Screen with some Control Features but nothing happends. This is a HDCP Effect.</p>
<p>Plug out the HDMI from ure Games Capture and plug the HDMI directly at ure Monitor or TV Screen and the Xbox One BluRay Function works.</p>
<p>Sorry my english is not great but i hope ure understand</p>

<p>I too had a problem with HDCP and think I figured out what the problem is.</p>
<p>Hopefully these steps will help people having Blu-Ray "Black Screen" Playback Issues or DVD Playback Error code 0x91d70001 and DO NOT have a capture card plugged into the console (Also reported to cause these errors, due to HDCP protection)</p>
<p>After lots of troubleshooting, uninstalling the Blu-Ray App, Power Cycling the console etc. I basically switched the HDMI cable to another HDMI port on my TV and BOOM! I haz movies.</p>
<p>I then set about trying to get movies to work over HDMI Port 1 again. I factory reset my TV and plugged the Xbox back into HDMI Port 1 on my TV and it now works fine.</p>
<p>It seems like there's some sort of HDCP bug with the Console, and it blocked that HDMI port? I'm not sure, but either way, this fixed my problem.</p>

                    <p>Hello Everyone</p>
<p>I have updated my windows 10 final version from technical preview</p>
<p>on my old 10041 TP build (i think) i was able to cast X265 format videos to my samsung 32d6000 tv via my home WiFi network</p>
<p>but now when i try to do same thing i get "Not supported file format" error</p>
<p>i remember in old builds the option was "Play to" in context menu and now it is "cast to"</p>
<p>in windows 7 also i faced same issues&nbsp;</p>
<p>it was working only in tp build&nbsp;</p>
<p>other video formats are working perfectly</p>
<p>My samsung tv is older model and doesn't support wifi direct it only support DLNA &nbsp;</p>

            This is appalling support. How can all these Microsoft engineers be so bad at interpreting plain English? How can you attempt to defer support to the HEVC standard when the blame rests solely on Microsoft's [lack of] implementation in the "Cast to Device"
 function? It's already late March 2016, this issue exists for more than 6 months, and it still hasn't been fixed yet???<br />
You gentlemen are completely unworthy of employment at Microsoft if you can't get Windows 10 to "Cast to Device" HEVC/H.265 files like it does for so many other encoders.

            <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>you will not get the right info from this site I'm sad to say</p>
<p>
</p><p>okay</p>
<p>windows 10 does not support h.265 (I have tried)</p>
<p>the reason you can play h.265 in VLC is that its self contained and does not use or need any codecs from windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>so to cast to device (DLNA) you would need windows media player to play h.265, and for that you would need a working codec as all it will play is the sound and not the video</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you can get WMP to play h.265 then the cast to device&nbsp;will work as what ever WMP plays cast to should play</p>
<p>
</p><p>if VLC had a easy way to cast to device that would be good</p>
<p>divx player has a cast to option and it supports h.265 BUT watch out as it can be full of malware or downloads it later with updates (se the divx forums for more info)</p>
<p>
</p><p>on the subject of malware the codec packs that support h.265 may have malware in them or at least pup</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>edit: this works with both WMP and the cast to device https://x265.com</p>
<p>but you have to pay for it</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just paid for this decoder and encoder and it works</p>
<p>it only works with 64bit and on 64bit windows the cast to device is 64bit but the default WMP is not</p>
<p>so you can use the shortcut that appears upon install or you can look for the 64bit WMP in
</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Windows Media Player\wmplayer.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>so after tests I have found out that when you cast to DLNA it is the caster on the PC that does the conversion work not the DLNA device</p>
<p>I have a old WDTV Live DLNA box and it does not natively play h.265 from the HDD, but casting from the PC to it works when playing h.265</p>
<p>
</p><p>Warning the x.265 in the link works with no problems in windows 10, playing h.265 in WMP 64bit and the cast to device in the right click menu, But in windows 7 there may be a problem</p>
<p>it works in WMP 64bit but it sets WMP 64 as the default and it looks like this version of the player does not give out a play to device in the right click menu</p>
<p>the strange thing is even when you use WMP 32bit the caster is 64 bit so why it is not there is anybody's guess</p>
<p>
</p><p>if some one could help out making WMP 64 bit the default player in win 7 64bit and get the "play to" back in the right click menu it would be much&nbsp;appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will work on this and also ask the makers to give the option in the install not to set the 64bit WMP as default</p>
<p>to see if this gets the right click back</p>
<p>
</p><p>I continue to be appalled at the lack of knowledge of the experts on this site they should know this</p>

            <p>Vanessa and Jessen are clueless folk who copy-paste from scripts like bots do (or perhaps they
<em>are</em> bots).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However some users here seem to be a confused lot too. Win10 <em>does </em>support HEVC and MKV out of the box. Try casting with WMP or the Movies and TV app instead of VLC. If neither can do in Win10 1607 (or later) what they could in the 10041 TP build,
 file a bug with MS using the Feedback Hub app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plex as mentioned above is also a viable paid alternative.</p>

            Hi Jayne.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You should not need an app to connect to Wifi.  This tutorial confirms this for Eduroam:  <a href="http://kb.mit.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=156205815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://kb.mit.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.act...</a>
<br />
<br />However if this or any other challenge makes you want to move off of Windows 10 S Microsoft has accounced the Upgrade to Pro Version has been extended indefinitely.  Here's how:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4456067/windows-10-switch-out-of-s-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/445606...</a>

            Windows 10 S mode is still maturing and many apps still don't support it. Your best option is to take advantage of the free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro which lets you install full desktop apps. 
<br />
<br />You can continue working with that until developer releases a version that can be downloaded directly from the Microsoft Store.

<h2>            Keyboard, Mouse, Drivers, Laptop</h2>
                    
<p>I have a laptop with Windows Vista Ultimate. &nbsp;Something is causing both the touchpad and the keyboard to not function.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;It happens after running Windows Update - drivers for an infrared mouse/keyboard are pushed to the laptop and they over-ride the normal touchpad and keyboard drivers. &nbsp;I'm computer savvy, and I find them impossible to uninstall. &nbsp;They reinstall on reboot,
 consistently. &nbsp;Even if you disable Windows Update, they reappear 1-2 days later.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;A system restore to a previous point is the only way I've found to keep them off the computer for 1-2 days.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;A USB mouse can be plugged in, and works fine - seems to over-ride the infrared drivers (keyboard still doesn't work of course).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Copious reading online supports that this is a Microsoft created issue for laptop users, using Vista.</p>

    <title>my computer shuts down during game - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            my computer shuts down during game</h2>
                    <p>Hi, recently i have tried to play the game sea of thieves on two computers with windows 10, forming a crew. In one of them, the game makes the computer shuts down by itself after some time has passed inside the game. But according to the site canyourunit, my computer is fine in terms of minimal requirements, with the exception of the CPU, but my brother has almost the same computer and he doesn't have this bug on his notebook(instead of core i5, he has i7). I have tried to run the game on the lowest graphic configuration possible and even tried the energy economy mode on my computer but the bug still happens. What can I do to make my game run without presenting the bug?</p><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fimg-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net%3a443%2ftenant%2fxvi%2fentityid%2fRE1nDzG.img" /></figure>

            Hi EszterPummer
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera &gt; Make sure following 
<br />Allow access to this camera on this device is set to ON 
<br />Allow apps to access your camera is set to ON 
<br />Also down below Choose apps that can use your camera is ON for appropriate apps
<br />
<br />Let's execute following steps for this problem if above doesn't solve your problem. Please update me once done.
<br />
<br />1. Use the Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &amp; Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter &amp; follow on-screen directions &gt; Restart the computer after troubleshooting is completed
<br />
<br />2. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to invoke Task Manager &gt; Go to the “Processes” tab &gt; See which programs are currently running in the background of the system and     If you found an app that uses Camera, end that program
<br />
<br />3. Switch Off your Antivirus temporarily and check. Switch On antivirus when testing is over.
<br />
<br />4. Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices
<br />Locate your Webcam

            I have already tried all these steps in the past 24 hours, and now again, but they still did not help. I have tried everything in the troubleshooting link you sent me as well, but according to my laptop everything is fine, Skype has access to the camera,
 in the Task Manager I could not find anything that uses my camera, the driver is up to date. It does not work, the camera's light is lit on, so it shows if I try to use it, but the screen remains black. Please help, thank you.

<h2>            Killer Instinct 2 Classic not on Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Bought Killer Instinct Supreme Edition on March 30, 2016. Comes with tons of extras (KI gold, XP bonuses, blah blah). one of the items it comes with is Killer Instinct 2 Classic. I did not receive it on xbox one when i downloaded. (the sole reason
 i purchased the xbox one was to play this game) Talked to support, they linked me this forum. Not sure exactly how i'm supposed to get the game from you guys, but apparently this works?! Thanks in advance<br />

    <title>Standby memory and computer not having enough. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> isaacjamestaylor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Standby memory and computer not having enough.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm currently using a laptop which has 4GB of RAM. However my computer keeps around 2GB of my memory on "Standby".</p>
<p>I play on games a lot and use ventrillo or skype at the same time. However when doing that I end up using all available memory and I can't open anything else without my laptop sound failing. Even though&nbsp;I run out of available memory, my laptop still keeps
 2GB on standby. Is there some way I can change this?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I don't understand your problem. "Standby" (mainly = cached to speed up programs) memory and "free" (unused = mainly useless and wasted) memory together constitute the "<strong>available</strong>" memory, opposed to the memory "<strong>in use</strong>" (for
 OS, running programs, drivers). So, the constellation "though&nbsp;I run out of <em>available</em> memory, my laptop still keeps 2GB on
<em>standby</em>" is simply not possible.</p>
<p>There could be problems if one of your programs demands more than 2 GB exclusively (for itself) to run but Ventrilo or Skype don't look like that.</p>

<p>Ok then...regardless of the standby. The problem I'm having is that my laptop seems to just be able to run a game and ventrillo with 4GB of RAM. It's not even a year old. Where as my computer which is around 4 years old, could run a game, ventrillo and many
 more programs with only 2GB. I understand that the computer has a better processor, but still..surely it shouldn't affect it that much?</p>

            Hard to say. Some games and apps are demanding more CPU power, others need more RAM. But your observation that an older computer with less RAM and more on the CPU side is working better for you, leads to suspects about the laptop's CPU. 4 GB RAM should
 be well enough for every actual game, and some other apps like Ventrilo, too. On the other hand, I noticed some other users having problems (on Windows 7) with Ventrilo + games, perhaps the issue lies there. I'd be glad to give you a more specific advice,
 but I can't. Sorry...

<p>it is possable i have the same problem the standby memory will not release. period.i am running 3dsmax and when the memory reachs 2gigs it says out of memory, although i have 1 gig free in "standby" seems windows 7 can not reconize when it needs to release
 memory.its basicly stupid</p>
