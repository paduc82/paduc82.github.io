            In order to access your home PC, first you must check with your employer's compliance people to make sure what you want to do is allowed by the employer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, check with the terms of Adobe's license agreement.&nbsp; Often, using a personally-licensed product
 for paid work is outside of the license terms.&nbsp; Following that, check with your employer's networking staff.&nbsp; They may have a firewall in place that won't allow it.&nbsp; You may also have to change your home network's configuration to allow inbound connections
 through your home router.&nbsp; Finally, you'll need software that will allow Vista Home Basic to accept the connection.&nbsp; None of the WIndows Home editions support inbound connections.&nbsp; You'll need a third-party tool like VNC or LogMeIn ot GoToMyPC.

<h2>            Mail and Calendar app&#58; flag not syncing with Gmail</h2>
                    <p>Everything else is syncing perfectly but flags stay local. I have several Win10 devices and Android syncing on my Gmail accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The flags are not converted into a star in Gmail and vice and versa: starred emails in Gmail don't show as flagged in Mail and Calendar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other clients are doing this perfectly: eM client, mailbird, touch mail etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only workaround is to move the email into the Starred IMAP folder in Mail and , too slow..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a bug? I really like Mail and Calendar UI, which can adapt from a tablet format to a full desktop format. But without flag syncing with Gmail it can't be productively used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bug? Feature? Please help!</p>

    <title>Xbox One Elite Wireless Controller Grips Falling Off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cy63r cr4ck3r  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Elite Wireless Controller Grips Falling Off</h2>
                    <p>*15AUG2017*UPDATE: After receiving the promised "replacement controller" and asking if it was just the case for the controller or the case and the controller and being told that it was both. I found out the representative Len A. flat out lied to me about
 what I was getting, all to get a better survey, since all that I got, was the carrying case and nothing else. I talked to another agent after this, and they proceeded to try and go through everything again, and acted as if the prior agent was not in the wrong
 for lying to a customer. As it is, I still have my shoddy "Elite" controller that is extremely uncomfortable to hold since it is all bumpy from the expanded silicone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*04AUG2017*UPDATE: I have since reached out to Microsoft support through the link provided below, and was told I would get a replacement controller. However, I am on my second Elite Controller at this point and it had the same issues after about 6 months
 of use. This is the one that I am currently awaiting the replacement, and hopefully the grips are not the same material!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have had the Xbox One Elite Controller for only 6 months, and the grips have all but come off completely. There are no replacement parts for the grips on the controller, and according to your Support, my solution is to buy another controller... NO. I am
 also being told that my controller is out of warranty, since it is past 90 days, well isn't that just lovely, that you get to profit with a issue that is forcing others to buy another controller as the solution. I have been a supporter of Microsoft for quite
 some time, and I would understand the issue of the warranty, had it not been part of the controller that CANNOT be replaced. All I am asking for, is some new grips to adhere to the controller, or to send it in and get a replacement, of just the grips I don't
 care about getting a whole new controller to replace the grips... this is insanely shortsighted on Microsoft's part to have a grip that expands outside of the slot/groove for them. I have also included pictures to show off how the grips are extending past
 the grooves, and there is no way to "push" them back inside.</p>

            I am having exactly the same issue. It wouldn't be too bad if I could glue them back but the rubber has expanded too much. For the money spent the support and response from Microsoft is disgusting! I would expect ¬£130 controller to last longer than 1 year.

            I also noticed the same thing on my controller today. The grips on the bottom are starting to swell. Not sure what i am going to do yet, and the controller is way out of warranty, almost a year old now. Not really happy about this right now, seeing as
 how much it costs.

            I bought this controller roughly 6 months ago and the left side has peeled and bubbled up, now causes chafing/irritation to my palm during extended play. Considering I keep it in its case when not in use this is unacceptable for $150US. Contacted support
 and they flat told me I'd have to purchase a new controller.

            <p>Same problem I even bought insurance which apparently is useless. I called it in and was told it was just a cosmetic piece, therefore not covered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Why was the grip advertised for functionality when i bought it then? They don't even mention the grips in the store anymore. Wonder why...</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Since i have insurance and was told that the controller is still fine, doesn't that make microsoft responsible if i get injured on any sharp plastic that may be exposed?</p>

<h2>            Halo Wars 2 Spielst&#228;nde weg nach Windows 10 Store kauf.</h2>
                    <div>Hallo zusammen,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Ich habe ein kleines Technisches Problem, und zwar hatte ich seit dem Release auf der XBox One X Halo Wars 2, und k√ºrzlich habe ich es im Microsoft Store gekauft um es auch auf dem Pc Spielen zu k√∂nnen.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Auf dem Pc habe ich das Spiel gestartet, und konnte noch mit meinen Kampagnen Spielst√§nde spielen. Als ich dann aber auf der Konsole spielen wollte, hatte ich keine Spielst√§nde mehr. Es frierte auch oft der Startbildschirm ein beim Spiel starten.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also habe ich die Konsole neu gestartet, mich mit meinem Konto ein und wieder ausgeloggt, das Spiel Deinstalliert und wieder installiert. Leider habe ich immer noch nicht meine alten Spielst√§nde.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kann das den Fehler ausgel√∂st haben, als erstes das Spiel auf CD auf der Xbox One zu installieren, und dann einfach das Spiel auf dem Microsoft Store zu installieren ? Dachte da sollte es keine Probleme geben.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Bekomme ich die Spielst√§nde wieder ? Oder sind sie f√ºr immer verloren ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Habt ihr einen Rat ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
                </div>

<p>Hi! Kann's denn sein dass irgendwann mal eine Synchronisierung durchgef√ºhrt wurde, welche (m√∂glicherweise versehentlich) abgebrochen wurde? Dies k√∂nnte bspw. zu so einem Problem f√ºhren.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Das Installieren von Disc und anschlie√üend als Download auf PC sollte eigentlich kein Problem darstellen. Welcher Speicherstand wird denn geladen, wenn du nun die PC-Version startest? Noch mit der alten Kampagne oder ist hier nun auch der Fortschritt weg?
 Falls letzteres der Fall ist, besteht wohl tats√§chlich wenig Hoffnung den Speicherstand zur√ºckzubekommen.</p>

<p>Hallo,</p>
<p>Danke f√ºr deine Antwort.</p>
<p>Nein, ich kann mich nicht daran erinnern eine Synchronisierung abgebrochen zu haben. Ich musste lediglich beim Spiel Herunterladen √ºber den Store den Download mal anhalten und konnte nicht alles in einem Downloaden, aber das sollte nicht der Grund sein.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Auf dem PC sind nach wie vor die Spielst√§nde der Kampagne vorhanden wie vorher. Was meinst du genau mit dem Fortschritt ?</p>

<p>Mit Fortschritt meine ich lediglich den Spielfortschritt, den dein Speicherstand beinhaltet. Ich w√ºrde folgendes probieren: L√∂sche Halo Wars von deiner Xbox One. F√ºhre anschlie√üend erst
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
einen Hard Reset</a> und danach einen <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Soft Factory Reset</a> durch. Lade nun Halo Wars erneut auf deiner Xbox herunter und pr√ºfe, welcher Speicherstand geladen wird. Dies muss nicht, kann aber funktionieren. Im schlimmsten Fall ist es irgendein anderer Fehler (etwa durch Komplikationen seitens
 der Xbox Live Server) der den Fehler verursacht.</p>

<h2>            Usb device not recognized&#47;malfunctioned</h2>
                    My sister brought her ipod touch over to my house because she wanted me to restore it for her since she forgot her password. I tried to hook the ipod to my laptop and a message popped up saying, "USB Device Not Recognized. One of the USB Devices attached
 to this computer has malfunctioned and windows does not recognize it." I've been sitting for for the better part of the night trying to figure out what's wrong. I've been to about 50 websites and haven't found a solution yet. The Ipod won't charge when connected
 to my laptop but it will when its connected to my PS3. I have all of the drivers updated, itunes updated, etc. Its driving me crazy. Any solutions?

    <title>Function Keys and Fingerprint scanner not working on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Function Keys and Fingerprint scanner not working on Windows 10</h2>
                    Hi, &nbsp;I recently installed Windows 10. &nbsp;Since installing Windows 10 from Windows 7 I am unable to use the built in fingerprint scanner on my HP computer. &nbsp;Also I am unable to use the function keys on my computer/keyboard. &nbsp;Meaning, like if I wanted to lower
 the volume (from my keyboard) I would hit the fn button and the microphone button (f8). &nbsp;That would normally lower the volume, but since I upgraded to Windows 10 all my function or quick keys have not been working. &nbsp;What I want to know is how to fix both of
 these things.

<p>
</p><p>4) You said to search for an updated driver at&nbsp;FAQ: http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/FaqGeneric.aspx. There is no search available on that site and, again, it looks like it is focused on OS's older than Win10.</p>

            Like Gary I found nothing you said worked. Windows 10 has disabled my function keys which I used to use frequently. It's poor that it's happened. (Surely it would have happened in testing since it's happened to a lot of people?) It's diabolical that you
 can't provide a fix

            <p>Thanks for the windows key + X, and when i select the Mobility Center I do not have the option to change my Function Key to Multimedia Key. &nbsp; My function keys are stuck unlocked, which my kids press keys on the laptop and all of a sudden my mousepad isn't
 work. &nbsp;I would like to make it where the Function key needs to be pressed along with the secondary key to enable/disable a function. &nbsp;Thanks. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Far Cry 4 Xbox 360 Health Bar not accurate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> valefree  say:</h3>
<h2>            Far Cry 4 Xbox 360 Health Bar not accurate</h2>
                    
<p>So I was playing FC4 2 weeks back, and I'm on my second playthorugh, 83 hours, and I'm playing this time on Hard. I fell down a cliff near a safe house in the first city you go to in North Kyrat, and when I fell down, (small cliff) I lost 2 and some change
 bars of health. Normal, right? So I heal myself but it flashes the same amount of health I had before, and not letting me heal again. Confused, I threw a molotov and stood in it for a split second. My health suddenly jumped up to 6 went down the tiniest bit.
 Healing myself led to the same flash as if my health healed, but I can't see it. It should be noted that this happened after I finally got my 6th health bar skill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried committing suicide, hurting Ajay in every way, shape, and form, but the glitch remains the same. I've just recently simply turned off the health bar to prevent my small OCD side of me from flipping out. It's really annoying too, it makes parts
 unplayable and very annoying. I've never encountered this in all of my 80 hours of FC4, please help. I don't wanna be stuck with this forever. :/</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 - Mouse Jumps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justinwitz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 - Mouse Jumps</h2>
                    <p>I own a Surface Pro 4 and I have the Microsoft Arc mouse (gray - connects via bluetooth). My two external 27" monitors are made by Samsung and Windows 10 compatible and I use the Surface Dock by Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For about two weeks now when plugged in docking mode my mouse jumps all over the screen, closed applications, minimizes them, cuts the sizing in half, etc. I have read all the posts and articles on this in the Microsoft forms and talked with support countless
 times. I have replaced the Arc Mouse and the Surface Dock and tried a handful of other mouses lying around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? It's getting to a point that I now work with my Surface open and don't even look at my monitors which is counter-productive for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            This did not work, but what did and what I found in other posts was that disconnecting the keyboard (I have the black fingerprint one) makes the mouse work as expected without jumping around. Crazy, I think I'll take it back and replace the one I have.

            <p>I have the same issue. &nbsp;I took back my keyboad and exchanged it for the one without the fingerprint reader and the problem has returned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that the touchscreen stays active even when it is not being used as a monitor. &nbsp;I have it in the docking station with dual monitors and the surface screen is disabled. &nbsp;When the screen gets touched, without the keyboard attached to it, the mouse
 moves. &nbsp;I think when the keyboard is attached, it maybe making contact with the screen causing irregular mouse movements. &nbsp;Just a theory. &nbsp;The screen and touchpad should be disabled if in docking station mode with Surface Keyboard in closed state, in my opinion.</p>

            <p>It certainly is related to the new surface doc. &nbsp; The problem went from intermittent to constant, mouse jumping to top left, and worse, selecting items randomly. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>If I take the doc out of the loop, no mouse jumping, everything works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it is not the mouse or keyboard (multiple tried) and it clearly is the Dock. &nbsp;Fix??&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Nope. At least not on my end. I don't even own the dock and the mouse does EXACTLY as you described. It was just a bit a first. I would do what I thought was a solution than the problem would come back for a bit. I would try another solution and it would
 stop for a bit. Thought "that must be it" -but then it returns later. Jumping mouse, selecting things and pinning itself in the corner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Than today it happened. ..... It stated up again (maybe for the 4th time that day, again no dock) and it wouldn't stop! Nothing worked. Restart, nope. Attach external mouse, nope. Out of frustration I did a full reset and guess what? While windows is on
 the installing screen (big circle with progress in the middle) you could see the mouse flipping out in the top right corner! (no curser, just making 'taps' and miniature highlights).&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>So, I disconnected my type cover when attached to my dock, and the mouse jumping stopped immediately. &nbsp; It was constant.&nbsp; For how long?&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, I was only having the jumping when Dock-connected still, unlike Ryan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                    <p>Original title : DVD/CD-ROM and Drivers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Samsung DVD Writer is no longer working.&nbsp; The model (SH-222) is a plug and play using the Window's DVD/CD-ROM drivers.<br />
- cdrom.sys version 6.1.7600.16385 (win7-rtm.090713-1255) in Folder: Windows\system32\DRIVERS\ and.<br />
- GEARAspiWDM.sys version&nbsp; 2.02.03.00 in Folder: Windows\system32\drivers\ . <br />
<br />
I am getting the following error&nbsp; within the System configuration CD-Rom Drive Properties: "Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damage (Code 19).&nbsp; I have tried the windows hardware
 troubleshooting application to no avail.&nbsp; I even swapped the the DVD writer with a Brand new Samsung Model (SH-224)&nbsp; with same results.
<br />
<br />
I cleaned my registry using "CCleaner free download".&nbsp; I have a basic understanding of the registry requirement but not enough to run a registry editor on the registry file itself.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
What are my options?<br />
<br />

<p>Your registry might be corrupted. (Code 19) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did this issue occur after you cleaned your registry using "CCleaner"? If so, then when running CCLeaner you would have had the option of backing up the registry keys. If you did, perhaps restore the keys from the backups. If not, read the above article
 (don't rely upon the fixit).</p>

<p><strong>Redownload content to a new or refurbished console</strong><br />
<br />
To redownload your previously purchased content to your new or refurbished Xbox 360 console, you must set your new or refurbished console as your primary console. To do this, you must first download something new from Xbox LIVE to your new or refurbished console's
 queue, and then download your previously purchased content. Here's how:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the steps in the "Buy content from Xbox LIVE Marketplace" section of Buy or redownload content from Xbox LIVE to download some new content to your console queue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; After you've completed step 1, send an item to your download queue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Press the Guide button on your controller.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to Marketplace and then to Active Downloads.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the item that you want to download, select Download Now and then select Download All Items.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By completing step 5, you'll set your refurbished or new console as your new primary console.<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-AU/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/error-message-content-other-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />

<p>...so does that mean another console was receiving free content while the problem persisted? Or do the licenses just go into limbo until told otherwise? Just curious, as I seem to be having the same issue and will try what you've just explained when next

<h2>            how do I find out who is using my microsoft acount as an alias&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I created a Microsoft account with my @gmail.com email address years ago, but never used it, now I cannot get into it, as it says doesn't exist.&nbsp; but when I try to recreate it says it does exist.&nbsp; I got a reply from a forum moderator that made no sense.&nbsp;
 It said my Microsoft account is being used as an alias on an account, and that I cannot use an alias to log in to my account.&nbsp; HUH?&nbsp; What is an alias and why would someone be using my personal email as an alias?&nbsp; I was sent FAQ's of outlook.com.&nbsp; I don't use
 outlook.com didn't ask a&nbsp;question about outlook.com,&nbsp;so not sure why this was the reply from the forum.&nbsp; All I want is to be able to push the mail tile on this windows rt tablet and see my gmail.com email.&nbsp;Why is this so difficult, and why can I not get a
 straight answer?&nbsp; Needless to say I had to create another account just to be able to ask a question as no customer service phone # for Microsoft accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can someone please help, as the last person was no help at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slowly loosing my patience with Microsoft products and support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Email aliases let you add new addresses to your&nbsp;Hotmail account. You still sign on with your standard user name and get all mail in one place, but you can receive and send messages using the alias.<br />
<br />
To know more about alias you can refer to this article: <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windows_live/b/windowslive/archive/2011/02/03/hotmail-delivers-aliases-to-help-you-manage-and-secure-your-email-account.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Hotmail delivers aliases to help you manage and secure your email account</a><br />

Thanks

<p>ok PX Morpheus..letto<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-1.gif" /> mi dimentico sempre
</p>
<p>cmq il problema √® secondo me l MTU che non mi faceva entrare nel live e prima non so il perch√® sono entrato, solo che quando mettevo qualsiasi gioco per farmi una partita online non potevo(non si collegava ai sever) allora o spento e riacceso il modem e
 ora mi trovo di nuovo fuori dall live con il problema MTU</p>
<p>secondo me non riusciva ad entrare nei sever per colpa di sto benedetto maximum trasmision unit</p>
<p>io la vodafone lo chiamata e o chiesto se c era qualche problema con la linea ma niente, o chiesto all operatore il mio mtu della vodafone station che in default √® 1500 credo per√≤ lui non aveva tale info allora preso dal nervoso o scelto la cosulenza avanzata...ho
 lasciato il numero ma non mi an ancora chiamato...bo√≤</p>
<p>chiamato anche microsoft ,che un gentilissimo operatore mi ha fatto capire che √® colpa di vodafone</p>
<p>che dite sono spacciato?</p>

    <title>factory reset on windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryan.t.sa  say:</h3>
<h2>            factory reset on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an MSi GP 72 2QE Leopard Pro Laptop (not sure if thats relevant...) and use Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with my PC but over the past few months I have installed so many different Apps from the STORE and different Software programs from various Software download sites etc and I have no idea where I saved the files/which programs
 are still running etc. </p>
<p>I was wondering what my best option would be if I wanted to start off with a clean slate again and then only install the apps and software that really works well ((I used trial and error with SOOOO many different programs and now have a select few which
 I actually want/need)). So instead of manually going through all my files and uninstalling each app that I dont want, could I possibly do a "FACTORY RESET" and start over?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a "paid for" version of Office 365 ((the version where you can install office on 5 different PCs)) and I wanted to know if I could perhaps leave my installed Office on my Laptop while doing a factory reset? I remember it was quite a long winded process
 activating Office on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be GREAT!!!!!!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Ryan</p>

</p><p>Smart move.&nbsp; I am a big fan of clean installs to remove the adds/deletes&nbsp; I do one every 4 months whether I need it or not. There are two ways you can do this. First way is to use the ISO and clean install.&nbsp; That will give you the best performance boost.&nbsp;
 The second is to factory reset/refresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the second method you can do it two ways.</p>
<p>1-refresh and keep the files (office 365)</p>
<p>2-reset to factory (removing all the stuff you have installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get the ISO here</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick reply. Much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go for the 1st option that you mentioned, will it keep ALL my files/programs
<strong>(ie. all the software and apps that iv installed)?</strong> Or just Office 365? Because basically what I want is to wipe everything
<strong>((all downloaded software etc))</strong> but if possible -<strong> keep my Office365 intact.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to sound "dumb" !!!&nbsp; I am not a computer expert AT ALL :) </p>
<p>
</p><p>If its not possible to get my way, what would you suggest is my best option? Reset everything and just reinstall Office? Im just nervous because
<strong>Iv installed office on 5 pc's already</strong> ((the <strong>maximum number to install</strong>....on my home pc / laptop and work pcs)) so I would be so sad if I couldnt reinstall it on my Laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, basically - what do you think I should do? What would you do if you were in my shoes? Then I'll just follow your recommendation :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks again</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>There is no such thing as a dumb question.&nbsp; (I have on occasion given some dumb answers)&nbsp; We are here to help you and volunteer here specifically to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By first option I assume you mean refresh and keep files.&nbsp; That would of course keep them all but it would remove less of the things you have added and removed and would not trim the registry.&nbsp; Often the registry clutter is more significant than the actual
 programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were it me I would bite the bullet and clean install from ISO.&nbsp; Since the hardware is remaining the same Office activation SHOULD be automatic, and at worst you might have to call Microsoft to explain it.&nbsp; Just make sure you have the appropriate keys saved
 before you do.&nbsp; (we can sort of help you with the activation)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said the first wipe is the toughest but it is not rocket science.&nbsp; I have mine down to where it takes about 2 hours to get everything re-installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy to answer what ever questions you have before you do.</p>

            <p>I installed a program called MAGICAL JELLY BEAN KEYFINDER and have saved my different keys as a WORD.doc on my DROPBOX account incase I need my office or windows key.</p>
<p>So I think I am going to go for the option that cleans everything on the PC and reinstalls windows 10 ... Just to make sure that I do the correct thing -
</p>
<p>I would : 1) Reset this PC // </p>

<p>2) Remove everything //</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im a bit nervous because <strong>I love WINDOWS</strong> <strong>10</strong> so I
</span>that was installed when I got the PC ((XP Prof I think...)) or anything like that....I just want to start again from scratch :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when its done I'll have a CLEAN - GOOD AS NEW PC with WINDOWS 10, and I can go to my&nbsp; "OFFICE ACCOUNT" online and reinstall it from there....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sound ok?? </p>

            <p>The option you have highlighted does remove everything but it does not restore the OS back to the way it was when you got the computer.&nbsp; TBH&nbsp; It has been a year since I saw that version of win 10 and I always boot from the ISO delete all the partitions</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the way you can think about it.&nbsp; The top option does the least, the middle does more, the bottom does the most, to put the system back to the way it was when it left the factory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bottom option is a bit more effort because you would have to install updates (if any)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the middle option if it makes you feel safer and it will probably do a decent enough job.&nbsp; You should see a performance boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the install you should not have trouble with Office but if you do ask us.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 keeps crashing or freezing up</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>&nbsp; I have a Acer Aspire One net book and it keeps crashing (Freezing up) I don't really do much on here (Check E-mail, Facebook, Occasionally Google something). Thats when I have the problem. I have Windows 7 Starter I upgraded to Windows Home Premium and
 still had the same problems. I really don't know much about computers. I ran the security scans and found no issues, I went to the control panel and did the trouble shoot and the only thing that comes up is Multiple programs run on start up. I go to that and
 a list comes up, but I have no idea what I need to start up so I didn't mess with it. My buddy did a factory restore for me and He didn't know the computer didn't come with Windows 7 Home Premium, so I lost that and am Back with the Windows 7 Starter and I
 didn't see any improvement when I had it so I decided not to buy it again. I use Google Chrome as my browser Internet Explorer, Fire Fox, Safari were all horrible. Chrome seems to work the best. When I Google something, I will read and article it will be fine
 But if I click on a video or click on a picture it crashes and I have to turn my computer off and turn it back on. It happens several times daily I click start windows normally because I don't know what safe mode mean ect. I really don't know what to do.&nbsp;</div>

<p>In case you haven't read already, the Microsoft is giving away free Xboxes with purchase of a $699+ computer to students. I would like to get my free Xbox, so I'm buying a computer. Where should I buy it? I see myself with a nice i7 processor or something.

<p>Thank you for the information. Since issue persists after running your PC on Safe Mode, we suggest running the System File Checker tool and DISM to scan and restore corrupted system files that might have caused the issue. Refer on these articles on how to
 do so: </p>

<p>Thanks Anne - The system file checker returned that there were no issues (corruptions)</p>
<p>I wasn't able to run the DISM - that returned 'we don't recognise...etc'</p>
<p>I'll be glad of any more tips, everything is taking me about 10 times longer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mouse is infuriatingly 'sticking' a great deal too especially when my laptop is plugged into my dynadock - that might throw more light on the problem perhaps? I have to shake it and tap it on the mouse mat to make it work and press control to find where
 it is.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thank you for the update. Since DISM and SFC results returned zero, and Safe Mode did not work as well, we suggest contacting your device manufacturer to run hardware diagnostics as this might be caused by hardware issues.

    <title>Remote Desktop Problem on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silk purse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Desktop Problem on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Old title: Remote Desktop Problem </p>
<p>I have 3 computers on my network. Computer A is Win 10. B &amp; C are Win 7.&nbsp; Remote desktop is enabled on all 3.&nbsp; I can connect remotely from A to B and from B to C, but not from A to C.&nbsp; When I try to go from A to C, I get the following error: "The connection
 was denied because the user account is not authorized for remote login." I think it used to work, but not anymore, and I can't figure out how to authorize a user account.&nbsp;So what I've been doing is connecting from A to B then running remote desktop to go from
 B to C.&nbsp; That's just stupid.&nbsp; Can anyone point me to a fix?</p>
