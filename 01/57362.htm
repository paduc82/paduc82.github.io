<h2>            How to make OS see a .vhd as removable. So that I can then select the ReadyBoost tab under properties&#63;</h2>
                    From 1 DIYer to another, as ignorant as my questions may be.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration-line: underline"> I am aware this forum is win7 related, and as win7 and win server 2k8 R2 sp1 are practicly the same in most cases I decided to ask this here as well.
</span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hoping for a tech-er with insight.<br />
<br />
Question#1<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration-line: underline">I really just need to know how to make my OS see the .vhd I created (and am using without this issue for such, while booted into win7) as removable. So that I can then select the ReadyBoost
 tab under properties!</span><br />
If there is a policy I can make amendment to, or if there is a registry key modification you know of that can help me to accomplish this please reference such things in reply.
<br />
Thank you for your time.<br />
<br />
Question#2 <br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">What if anything I might be doing wrong when it comes to getting ReadyBoost to work on a .vhd that I have in windows server 2008 r2 sp1. I was able to set this .vhd up to auto mount
 and host ReadyBoost in my win7(x86) (preexisting)installation(prior to dual Boot to win2k8r2sp1), but I'm having issues accomplishing this in Win2k8r2sp1</span>. &lt;PS it still works and auto mounts on win7 side of things.&gt;<br />
<br />
I am using the "update-able" R2 Workstation Converter v3. application. &lt;(Found @win2008wokstation.com)&gt; I first used it to setup super-fetch and then I imported the boot-optimization.reg that I downloaded from the forum, and I am now seeing significant gains
 in terms of my boot-time.<br />
<br />
My physical memory is low (2Gb) and I was hoping to see more gains using a .vhd file that can be set to auto mount and work as ReadyBoost host. &lt;(It dose auto mount just fine, but cant get the ready boot option)&gt;<br />
<br />
I have good USB sticks but ports are a commodity, &amp; well; I was just hoping to overcome this challenge the way I do most others,"Head On"!<br />
<br />
A quick minute of your time would be most appreciated! <br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for all your time.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 update 1809 gone extremely wrong - all personal data wiped - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zeph7r  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update 1809 gone extremely wrong - all personal data wiped clean</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, </p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of days ago, I ran Windows Update and ended up installing what seemed to be the October 2018 update of Windows 10. During the installation procedure, I opted for using the aid of an external drive, as I didn't have enough storage space available
 in my HDD to cover for all the required disk space. After a series of automated boot-ups (which I considered normal, as similar steps also occurred in previous updates), my PC simply stopped booting-up - now, once it starts the boot-up sequence, it just engages
 in a booting loop, never going past that. I don't even have the chance to fire-up the system recovery menu - it just boots-up again, in an infinite loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is a dual-boot system - I also have OpenSUSE 15.0 installed on it, side by side with Windows 10. After selecting OpenSUSE in the boot manager (because I still have access to GRUB during boot-up) and manually mounting the Windows partition, I suddenly
 found out that over 90% of my Windows partition is now free space - when it was only about 7-8% before initializing the update process. Plus, after briefly browsing the contents on the Windows partition I concluded all my previous files were gone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, in the root of drive C, one can only find the following folders:</p>
<p>C:\$WINDOWS.~BT</p>
<p>C:\Users</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS</p>
<p>
</p><p>...and yes, \Users folder is pretty much empty. Only a few junk files left in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I panicked and called Microsoft tech support. Although forfeiting all responsibility for any loss of my data, the operator clarified that the external USB pen drive that I used for the purpose of extending the available free space (so that Windows would
 let me update my system) is included temporarily in the MBR as any other partition/disk, and that possibly my personal files were transferred there and are still there, depending on what stage was the process at when the "malfunction" took place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fired-up that same USB pen-drive in a different Windows 10 PC, and found that indeed there are a few files in there, but none I could actually recognize:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff945cd7-891d-4c08-805b-f1396064752f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff945cd7-891d-4c08-805b-f1396064752f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I gotta say I'm pretty devastated. Is it possible that everything in my Windows 10 partition has been wiped clean? I certainly didn't expect this to be the outcome of running Windows Update - and I don't remember Windows warning me about the possibility
 either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all.</p>

<p>Hi Smittychat,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your input. However, as you can see in my post, the windows.old folder is nowhere to be found. I checked everywhere - both on the Windows partition as well as the USB pen drive used as temporary storage - and there's nothing of the sorts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that it is somehow stored within that "windows.wim" file?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

 several hours, all my file data is gone. Please help. It wasn't just in my Downloads folder, it was in pretty much everything else as well. Can I get my data back?

<h2>            Non web-based email&#63;</h2>
                    I just switched to a new computer running Windows 8 after forever with XP. I understand that Outlook Express won't translate. I don't like using webmail systems. Is there a way to save/import years of business emails into some system on the new computer?<br />
<br />
Also, I tried setting up email via the "Mail" icon on Start. I filled in the necessary information and I can receive, but not send, which is kind of pointless. I can't find a way back to look at the settings.
<br />

Thanks,<br />

<h2>            Err 0x80090305 when running MS Update in Xp SP3</h2>
                    Have not been able to&nbsp;run&nbsp;MS update since July. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<div><br />
Each time I &nbsp;run MS update, it fails to run more than 15-20 sec before coming back with an&nbsp;0x80090305 error code.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>CCleaner was run, Malwarebytes, etc. &nbsp;No viruses present (Avast) &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Tried a &nbsp;MS support ticket, lots of emails, &nbsp;zero results. &nbsp;He had the&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;Update log to analyze - but none of his suggestions made a difference. &nbsp;Mr Fixit&nbsp;will&nbsp;not run due to the same error. &nbsp; Cannot use IE8 to converse with MS chat, same issue. &nbsp;Have
 to do that from a separate PC.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PC is not&nbsp;upgrade &nbsp;to Win 7 w/o a complete re-installation of the O/S. &nbsp; I may as well re-install Xp if&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;going to do that, and save $200. &nbsp;(Its an 2005 Hp Pavilion a1510n, so its not worth investing big $.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions? &nbsp;I'm going to attempt a system restore in&nbsp;the&nbsp;meantime, which MS support never even mentioned as a suggestion</div>
<div><br />

    <title>Xbox Game is unreadable, but has no serious scratches&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xxdollardxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Game is unreadable, but has no serious scratches&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to play MW3 and the disc is unreadable. There are no major or serious scratches on the disc, just little hairline scratches. It makes no sense because I can play it for 5 minutes, then it will say "unreadable." This is getting really annoying.
 I tried to install it to my hard drive, but it says "unreadable" after 45%. I tried putting toothpaste, peanut butter, car polish, deodorant, and even chap stick, and none of that works. This is one of the cleanest discs I have ever seen. It's not my disc
 drive because it plays every other game perfectly fine. Also, I swapped my MW3 disc with my friends, because he has mw3 installed so it doesn't matter, and the same thing happened again, but it worked better with his disc. I tried clearing system cache, and
 I removed any corrupted apps. Nothing is working. Please help, it would be appreciated 100%. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hey sorry to hear about this. After all your cleaning and it still wont work right? the only things I can think that you can try is taking it to a place that can repair discs and see if that machine will repair it but its mainly for scratches. Which brings
 me to that the disc actually is defected somewhere on info code where the error keeps coming up. The last thing to try is to return it back to the store and exchange it for a new copy.

<p>If all your other games work fine and you have even tried a different copy of mw3 with the same results there might possabily be another corrupted file that you have missed. This does sound like a very uique problem though. I would suggest sending your xbox
 to microsoft to get the lens fixed to cover a big possability. Maybe try your cleaned copy of mw3 in someone elses xbox to see if they suffer the same?

<p>Putting all those things on it probably didn't help. There's a solution I found that worked with a BF3 game of mine. Try borrowing a game from one of your friends. Put the disc in, on the dashboard go to game options. Install the game to your HDD. After
 that, put your scratched disc back in, and try playing it. This should work, since its only reading the data from the HDD, not the disc. The disc is then only used for authorization to play the game.

<p>The scratch could be whats causeing the game to error. Where the scratch is could be the location of important file information.</p>
<p>If you just bought the game then it could be a defective disk, everynow and again a disk doesnt fully complete the loading process and they dont do quality checks when they package them up. so just exchange it.</p>
<p>Worst case, just buy a new disk, Uploading it can be a problem, since there is a selected ammount of space for MW3 saved on your console to allow DLC content, some games dont use all that space but some do.</p>
<p>If you upload it to your console you may not have enough room for future DLC and/or your DLC wont work till the game is uninstalled.

<p>
</p><p>where did you originally get the key from and how have you tested on the Windows 8 iso?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where are you downloading the new 8.1 image from? try using this: &nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know there isn't a way of testing your key prior to download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Size for Windows 8.1 may vary, but will be over 3.5GB</p>

            I'm having problems with my Windows computer ever since Pokki notified me that the Start menu was updated. I ignored the pop up message but then i decided to give in and clicked ok. Afterwards, winservices popped up and said it needed my permission to
 make changes to the computer hard drive. After that my driver (Intel) updated and a microsoft program was newly installed and it jacked up my computer. When i look at my internet connection and wifi on the task bar it has a tv screen logo with a yellow caution
 sign over it saying it needs to connect to the internet. What do i do to reverse this unwanted change? I can't go into system restore and change anything. It wont let me. Windows also tells me that a program tries to shut down my other programs and that windows
 need to shut them down. What do i do?&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>it would be helpful to setup a new thread, and not post your separate issues in an existing one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does sound like you have allowed malware to install on your system (you should have said no to any requests like that!)</p>

<p>It sounds to me like your activation key is registered for Windows 8 respectively. If this is the case, then you will not be able to use this activation key to activation Windows 8.1 via ISO because it's not registered to Windows 8.1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These two versions of Windows are respectively unique to one another. You will have to install Windows 8, and then run updates until you can upgrade for free to Windows 8.1 (via Windows Store). After you've run Windows Update all the way through, Windows
 Store will display the ''Upgrade to Windows 8.1''&nbsp;notice on the front page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This upgrade process is the only way to retain your activated status with your Windows 8 activation key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option available for you, is that you can go Download the Windows 10 ISO and create an installation disc for Windows 10. From there, you can&nbsp;install and activate your copy of Windows 8—then use the Windows 10 installation disc to jump straight to
 Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to go about this, check out this discussion I made to help guide you through the basics of this&nbsp;process (avoiding the Media Creation Tool—which appears to be broken).</p>

            <p>You are using the old Windows 8.1 downloader which rejected Windows 8 product keys. Use the Windows 8.1 (with update 1) Media Creation Tool which will accept Windows 8 product keys. See here for details:</p>

</p>
<p>After that perform the Upgrade to Windows 10:</p>

            No, that is not the issue. This person is trying to upgrade to Window 10. They would need to use the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool. However, you can more quickly upgrade to Windows 10 manually by using the method I've provided in the link above.

<h2>            Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>Received an update to Window 10 last night, and this morning several websites that I frequently visit are showing the "Insecured" Icon at the beginning of the URL. Also, am noticing that Google Chrome appears to be a little slower. Any suggestions for remedying.
 Don't want to log on to insecure sites.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is definitely something wrong with this update and my system. Everything worked smoothly before the update. Now it looks like my screen resolution is worse, the internet speeds are slower and drag.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I've uninstalled and re-installed Google Chrome. This did not happen before the update, so I don't see how it would be a Google issue, especially after a re-install. I've noticed that the screen quality and overall video and sound quality are not as high
 resolution as before the updates from Microsoft. Very annoying!</p>

            Hi Ray,
<br />
<br />MSVCP140.dll is part d the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 
<br />
<br />So the solution will be to re-install that redistributable. 
<br />
<br />However, if you already have the 2017 version installed on your PC, due to a compatibility issue, you will need to uninstall that version, install the 2015 version and finally re-install the 2017 version
<br />

<p><span>Enabler works well but make sure you complete all steps.<br />
<br />
1. Create a user profile that you want to use as your master, I create a roaming profile for a default user that is assigned to each group of computers that I want to behave the same. Once all settings are exactly the way I want them I restart the machine.<br />
<br />
2. Logon as a user with administrative rights. Open start menu, right click on computer, click on properties, once properties are open, click on advanced settings, then click on settings related to logon (If you are reading this you know how to do this)<br />
<br />
3. Delete all users with existing profiles if you want them to use the new default profile, otherwise highlight the profile that you want to copy, use enabler and use press on copy to.<br />
<br />
4. When the box comes up, use the bottom of the box to activate it for everyone (just type in everyone) Once that is completed, in the copy to location type in C:\users\default&nbsp; -- this copies the profile over the default profile. Allow that to complete and
 close this program.<br />
<br />
5. Now run regedit.<br />
<br />
6. Highlight Hkey_Users<br />
<br />
7. Click on File, click on load hive, migrate to c:\users\default and in the file blank type in ntuser.dat and press enter<br />
<br />
8. In the blank box that comes up enter a name that you will remember, I use Default_User, but I have had kids use george, fred or whatever, it really doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
9. Go back to regedit and expand Hkey_Users and highlight the name you just created<br />
<br />
10. Go to edit and click on find and put in the name of your original default profile (the user profile you copied) Push enter<br />
<br />
11. Delete whatever comes up highlighted, use F3 and continue the process until you delete all instances of that name. Delete the whole key, windows will recreate it with the new users name, on some pages you will see the name multiple times, use shift or control
 to highlight all instances.<br />
<br />
12. Once you are done, re-highlight the name you used and click on file and unload hive.<br />
<br />
13. Restart the machine (don't just log off)<br />
<br />
14. Logon as a new user and they will have all the settings that you created for the default user.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am using this in an educational setting and it has worked perfectly fine so far. &nbsp;</span></p>

            When you tap and hold or right click the speaker icon on the tasktray bottom right of your screen, and select playback devices, does your Bassboomz speaker show and can you select it as playback device?

<p>Hi Barb, I clicked on the speaker icon and one option was 'playback devices'.&nbsp; I clicked on it but it didn't show the Bassboomz speaker.&nbsp; I then removed the Bassboomz icon from 'printers and devices'.&nbsp; I then tried to add a device and Bassboomz showed up.&nbsp;
 When I clicked on it I was taken to a page where it asked for a passcode.&nbsp; I don't know what the passcode is so I tried 1111, 1234 and 9999 but none of them worked.&nbsp; I don't know what to do next!&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Barb, thank you for your latest reply and information.&nbsp; I have tried moving the laptop completely away from the tablet I'm try to connect to.&nbsp; Unfortunately it still won't connect.&nbsp; It finds the Bassboomz and when I click on "next" it says it needs a
 code.&nbsp; If I ignore this step the next page says it didn't pair and I should try again.....which I have done, time and time again!</p>

<p>Hi again Barb,</p>
<p>Since my last reply to you I have persevered and finally it appears to have paired as it is showing in Printers and Devices.&nbsp; However, when I click on the icon it just takes me to the Properties page.&nbsp; There is nowhere saying "connect".&nbsp; I then went to the
 Bluetooth page and Bassboomz is showing as paired but when I click on it the only option which comes up is "Remove".&nbsp; When I click on my headphones, there are the options to "Connect"&nbsp; and&nbsp; "Remove".&nbsp; I'm afraid to remove the headphones to see if that helps,
 as I suspect it wouldn't, and I may not be able to connect them again.&nbsp; I tried the phone number on the Bassboomz website, but it says the number is invalid!&nbsp; How on earth do you contact them?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now at a complete loss as to what to do.&nbsp; Thanks for all
 your help and suggestions.</p>

            On the laptop, unpair/forget the Bassboomz speaker so that it is no longer paired. Restart the laptop. 
<br />
<br />If you right click the speaker icon in the taskbar, and select playback devices, do you see this speaker or not.

            Thank you for the new suggestion, but the laptop isn't working and I'm waiting for the technician to come next week.&nbsp; They are 75 miles away and there is nowhere nearer as I live on an island.&nbsp; Therefore I can't switch the laptop on at the moment.&nbsp; But
 maybe this is the problem, and I may have to wait until the laptop is working. I will wait until the laptop is fixed and will then try your suggestion.&nbsp;

<p>Ese codigo de 48 hrs... con que juego venia?</p>
<p>Te cuento, hace unos meses que me prestaron un Guitar Hero Wourld Tour al abrirlo me di cuenta que traia un Code de 48 Horas, wow y le dije a mi amigo si me lo regalaba, dijo que si. lo primero que hice llegando a mi casa fue "canjearlo", Pero oh sorpresa!
 Me marcaba error tras error y todo estaba bien. Lo intente meter en una cuenta de USA con el mismo resultado.</p>
<p>Conclusion: El code estaba CADUCADO. </p>

<h2>            Speech Recognition&#58; How can I get it to recognise &#34;full stop&#34; as a punctuation mark&#63;</h2>
                    I have just started using speech recognition with Windows 7. It says that it is working with UK (British) English, but it doesn't recognise the command 'full stop' for terminating a sentence; it appears only to recognise American commands. Can I get it
 to learn to use 'full stop' instead of 'period'? If so, how do I do that?

            <p>Thank you Srinivas KR, but this was an unhelpful answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>The Common Commands web page&nbsp;doesn’t tell me how to get ‘full stop’ recognised as a punctuation mark.
 It says to use ‘period’, ‘dot’, or ‘decimal point’. But it doesn’t recognise the normal British English term ‘full stop’. There ought to be a way of doing that – How do I set up the system to recognise&nbsp; the British ‘full stop’ to mean what Americans call a
 ‘period’?</span></b></p>

<h2>            Recent update broke text boxes&#63;</h2>
                    <p>An update in the past week has broken text boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to the update it was possible to enter as much text as you liked without limit. Now, there seems to be a limit of around eight lines before the text cuts off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This appears to be a bug as it’s only when you finish typing that the text after the limit disappears, with a few pixels of the first line after the limit visible. Since you cannot edit the text you end up losing work.</p>

<h2>            Skype-Can&#39;t Hear Person I called on my Headphones...</h2>
                    I spoke today, for the first time, to someone on Skype, through my headphones with microphone attached.&nbsp; The person I called, could hear me perfectly. However, I couldn't hear anything back on my headphones. So, I had to turn on the speakers on my PC,
 to hear the person I called on the other end. Obviously it was quite frustrating for the person on the other end of the call, because they could hear their voice twice, like an echo, because the sound was coming out of the speakers, rather than into my headphones.
 Can anybody please tell me, how I overcome this matter? Thanks.&nbsp;

            What skype do you use the Win32, or the UWP app on Windows 10? has you give the Skype client access to you microphone?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Settings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; microphone and check if skype have access to use you&nbsp;microphone.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What skype client version do you use? have you try the&nbsp;voice recording for check if the sound recording works?

            Many thanks for the response, much appreciated. The version of Skype I'm using is as follows: Skype 12.1809.217.0 for Windows 10. Once I plugged in the headphone/microphone device, I then went onto settings, to see if the device was linked to Skype, which
 it was. I did try a voice recording, it worked. Basically, I can't hear, through my headphones someone on the other end of my call (Yet the headphones work correctly!!). Baffled and confused, hopefully you can enlighten me further? Cheers.&nbsp;

            Did you also check so Skype has the promission to use the microhpone? If that is turn off in the settings the apps is not allowed to use you microhpone and they will not hear what you saying.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But if that is On under the follow settings, in that case you should check Skype Settings inside see if the microphone is as well selected.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If both the case is okey, i would try try unstall Skype and install it again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
By run PowerShell as Admin and run this script&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span>Get-AppxPackage *skypeapp* | Remove-AppxPackage</span><br />
<br />
and downloads the skype again frome store.&nbsp;<br />

            The person I called could hear me, but I couldn't hear them. I had to turn on my PC's speakers to hear the person I called. I had no sound coming out of the headphones. I know there's nothing wrong with the headphones, as I can hear sound coming from them,
 but unfortunately not when I made the call on Skype today.&nbsp;

            In that case the issues are not one you side, is one there sides the issues are ask them return with what device they use, and if they use as well the Windows 10 App ask them to do the same step as am provided.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you cold hear them with the PC speakers you problie have select wrong device you get the sound frome inside of the skype app.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Open Skype app, go to 3 dots and go to settings. and select Sound that device you want the sound to come to.&nbsp;<br />

            I've resolved the problem! In settings, I set my PC speakers on 'set device' rather than the actual speakers, and like magic, I performed the echo sound test and it all works just great. Marvellous, don't you think? Groovy!!&nbsp;

<p>Hello Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the exact same problem you had.&nbsp; I have my headphones connected to my pc, using Win 10 pro.&nbsp; When calling out, the person I'm calling can hear me just fine, but I cannot hear anything at all.&nbsp; I have to change my sound settings to use my computer
 speakers, and not my headset.&nbsp; Could you please explain step by step, how to access the setting that you were able to change to make your headset work too?&nbsp; I've looked in my sound settings, and see no "set device" anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Try checking your Skype audio settings and see what device is used for your audio output.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using the Microsoft Skype for Windows 10 (UWP) version, click the ellipsis button ( ... ) then select settings. Find Audio and see what device is selected for your speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using the classic Skype version, click tools, settings then audio settings.</p>
