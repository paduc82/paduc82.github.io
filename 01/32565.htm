            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>I had the same happened to me with a brand new Lenovo laptop.&nbsp; I had it connected to my 1 year old 49" LG smart TV through its HDMI port, and was working flawlessly...until the latest Windows update.&nbsp; After the update, no matter what I'd tried, I could not
 get my laptop to recognize that there's an external monitor connected to its HDMI port.&nbsp; It was sooooo frustrating!&nbsp; Through two days of searching the web and reading an inordinate number of posts on various forums, I was finally able to find a solution, at
 least for my particular situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, with the latest Windows 10 (Home, 64 bit) update it somehow, in some Microsoft's programmer infinite wisdom, decided that their generic display driver works better than, and should replace, Intel's display driver for its own chipset that was
 already installed and working properly before the Windows update.&nbsp; At the advice of a poster on another forum (forgot which one), I updated the Microsoft driver with one from Intel, which allows my laptop to recognize the HDMI port again.&nbsp; Now I'm back to
 enjoying streaming videos from Netflix and Amazon through my big screen once more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I did (your mileage may vary):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Right click "This PC" icon on the desktop</p>
<p>- On the drop down menu, click on the first "Properties" selection (not the "Properties" on the bottom of the list, which in and of itself is also confusing - again, another brilliant MS programmer move, but I digress)</p>
<p>- Click/select "Device Manager" on the left column of the screen</p>
<p>- Click "Display adapters".&nbsp; If nothing shows up, go to "View" on the menu tab above, and click "Show hidden devices"</p>
<p>- Right click the appropriate display adapter that's showing to bring up a pop-up menu.</p>
<p>- Click update driver and follow the ensuing directions - in the update driver wizard, choose the option to go to the web and find the latest manufacturer's display driver.&nbsp; Finish installing the driver update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should fix the problem with the HDMI port.&nbsp; At least it'd worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck to all who were afflicted by this Microsoft's programmer's oversight or over zealous promote of Microsoft products!</p>

    <title>Phantom Audio plays intermittently from an invisible video source - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fixmiester  say:</h3>
<h2>            Phantom Audio plays intermittently from an invisible video source</h2>
                    <p>Wierd stuff happening; I started getting audio from an unknown source, without any applications open, including Media Center yesterday. I can hear commercials, then random audio from a video source that is not appearing. It plays sometimes for several seconds,
 then goes away at random. Nothing I open or close seems to affect it, but since it is intermittent, it's difficult to correlate. It is definitely coming from my internet connection, and not my video tuner card.
</p>
<p>Thought I had it whipped yesterday, when I discovered a strange web site window that was playing videos (similar to uTube) on a different User account (my wife's). She swears she didn't even open it, but it was playing and the audio was coming through even&nbsp;when
 I switched to my user account (Admin). Went back to her account and closed the site; audio stopped. But now it comes and goes without any sites being opened, other than Explorer, even with her account closed.
</p>
<p>Is there any way I can use Task Manager or Event Viewer to trap where this is coming from? It did happen when I was looking at Processes in Task Manager, but I couldn't really see anything definitive since everything in the log was moving around. The CPU
 utilization definitely increases whenever this happens, and that is visible in the Explorer CPU usage.&nbsp;Any ideas?</p>

            <div>Hi Fixmiester,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Which browser do you use?</div>
<div>2. Were there any changes made to the computer prior the issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer the methods mentioned below and check:</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>I would recommend you to place the computer in clean boot by logging on to the user account that has the issue and then check if the issue persists.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</div>
<div><br />
If the issue doesn’t persists when the Computer is in clean boot or while in the Safe Mode with Networking, then the issue is confirmed to be caused by a certain non-Microsoft applications.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Viruses are also known to cause these kinds of issues. Please scan your computer from Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</div>
<div><br />
The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>You may use task manager to Identify the process associated with a program by performing the step mentioned in the following link and check if that program is installed.</div>

            Hello Mohamed, my name is Alexander. I'm an Independent Advisor and I'm happy to assist you! 
<br />
<br />I recommend that you try to change the power management for the Bluetooth drivers:
<br />
<br />Click on ‘Windows key + R’ to open Run box. 
<br />Type in ‘devmgmt.msc’ and click on Enter.
<br />Go to Bluetooth and expand it.
<br />Right click on the Bluetooth drivers and tap on Properties.
<br />When you are under the Power Management tab, remove the check next to the box ‘Allow the computer to turn off the device to save power’.
<br />Put the check next to the box ‘Allow this device to wake the computer’.
<br />Click on OK and close device manager.
<br />Restart your PC.
<br />
<br />Best regards, 
<br />Alexander B.

            Hi, <br />
you should have an option to bypass or ignore that warning. <br />
As long as you are sure you have the correct drivers, don't worry about it.<br />

<p>My guess is that is where the problem lies then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until that gets cleared up and shows completed then you will probably not have the license/ability to play the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your next step would be to contact Xbox support support.xbox.com/contact-us and they should be able to tell you what is going on with that.</p>

<p>That is very odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best thing to do would be to contact Xbox Support here support.xbox.com/contact-us choosing account in step 1 then Other in the next step for the chat option to appear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try a full reboot : hold power button for 10 secs until it shuts down, unplug for 30 secs and plug back in and turn on. See if that helps&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Community where you can find all the necessary information about Microsoft products!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After performing a re-installation of Vista, you are unable to use the wifi feature.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the
<b>make and model</b> of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows.old folder will be created when you perform a custom installation. With a custom installation, all the files, drivers and programs will
 be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to get the drivers for wifi and other devices using Windows updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the site:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also get the latest drivers from manufacturer’s site.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows.old folder would have files from previous installation. You could open the folder and copy the files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>You can find out by what games it plays. Look on the front of the case. &nbsp;If the games you have say NTSC or PAL, it will say under the XBOX 360 sign on the front &nbsp;(on the right side). It will be in a little box that says NTSC or PAL.</p>

<p>I had my xBox connected to my home wifi network and everything was working fine. For security reasons I changed my password on my Apple Extreme router and of course this has effected my xBox connection to my network.</p>
<p>So I went in and selected my router name and changed the password to my new password. then when I selected done it checks the network connection but this fails every time and at one point it said there were "two network connections with the same name" ?.
 Now everything else in the house has had it's password changed and all connections work except the xBox. Is there a way to reset the xBox to clear any residue network settings?</p>
<p>I play battlefield3 games online and at the moment I'm completely stuck.</p>
<p>Can you please help?</p>

<p>Hey there Spring! It sounds like your console is still stuck on recognizing the old network setup. Try resetting your network settings on your console and then set the connection up from scratch. Below are the steps to do the reset; try them out and let
 me know if that helps, thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After finally getting round to installing my mp3 collection, I have come across a real bind (well for me it is), all mp3's in folder view are shown as</p>
<p>blah.mp3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</p>
<p>toot.mp3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2</p>
<p>slack.mp3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyway on earth I can have them shown as:</p>
<p>blah.mp3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01</p>
<p>toot.mp3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 02</p>
<p>slack.mp3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 03</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes that is exactly right, they are track numbers but have the missing leading zero, I just wanted to know if there was an option within the registry to enable the leading zero.</p>
<p>as an example:</p>
<p>if you had a list of mp3's within a folder,</p>
<p>you would see:</p>
<p>Name &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ¦&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; size &nbsp; ¦&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ¦&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; date modified &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ¦&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Track Number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ¦&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bit Rate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ¦</p>
<p>blob.mp3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6,637kb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winamp Media File&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15/02/2009 10:06&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 320kbps</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot find anything within folder options, or anywhere else for that matter that would enable the leading zero.</p>
<p>It may seem petty but it's just one of those things that I cannot seem to do without.</p>
<p>many thanks for any replies</p>

<br />Well 1709 the Fall Creators Update is now the latest version.
<br />
<br />You can try to get the update to load or use the "Even better methods" or "Best methods" below (which is what I would do). 
<br />
<br />1. What I would first do is update the BIOS and chipset drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site. 
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall ALL 3rd party antivirus/security programs and then run its maker's removal tool to prevent trouble causing remnants. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 10 is a full antivirus.
<br />
<br />List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/mse-protect_start/list-of-anti-malware-product-removal-tools/2bcb53f7-7ab4-4ef9-ab3a-6aebfa322f75">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Uninstallers (removal tools) for common antivirus software 
<br /><a href="http://kb.eset.com/esetkb/index?page=content&amp;id=SOLN146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://kb.eset.com/esetkb/index?page=content&amp;am...</a> 
<br />
<br />3. Reduce the system down to as simple as possible by removing all the unnecessary devices possible such as USB drives.
<br />
<br />4. Uninstall any 3rd party programs Windows suggests.
<br />
<br />Now try updating again.
<br />
<br />----------
<br />
<br />Even better methods : (please do 1 - 4 above first) :
<br />
<br />Be sure to have updated the BIOS as indicated above.
<br />
<br />Or use the MCT to update to Windows 10 1709.
<br />
<br />MCT - Update now
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Or best method would be to do a Clean Install of 1709 to start with a Clean Slate. You should still first update the BIOS. 
<br />
<br />If you do a Clean Install then it would be activated with the Digital Entitlement.
<br />
<br />Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you. 
<br />
<br />What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have - like with buggy Windows Updates which are the last place I'd get the new version from.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />

            Next I'd try these steps which optimize your install first to smooth the way for the new version:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then you can do the vastly superior Clean Install and put issues with WIndows 10 behind you once and for all, following these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have the factory install which causes most of the hurdles, then you can also do the automated Refresh which reinstalls Windows while shedding the factory bloatware:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />This should allow WIndows Updates to do the version Upgrade or you can manually upgrade it without the bloat that's probably interfering.  
<br />
<br />Or you can ignore the Version Update until Windows Update finds a way to instal it, or if it bothers you hide it using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>.

<p>there are about 10 battlefield games before BF3.</p>
<p>[/quote]That's true, OP was probably, from what I've experienced, alluring to the CQC emphasis in the game. Even then, CoD has been shrunk to arena style maps even further, and ALL of the maps in Blops 2 are small. BF3 still has the sandbox style open landscape
 maps.</p>

<p>Battlefield 3 took away free roam and destructive elements that Battlefield 1 and 2 shared. So what is honestly different now between CoD and Battlefield today? Frostbite engine with improved graphics?

<p>All I'm saying is the first game started out great and took a turn for the worst in my opinion. I was highly disappointed with the 3rd installment. I'm not saying anything about the 4th one though just yet. &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>[/quote]I hate being <em>that</em>&nbsp;guy but you're talking about&nbsp;Battlefield <strong>
Bad Company</strong>&nbsp;1 and 2 which are kind of a side series. Before them were BF2: Modern Combat and for PC, Battlefield 1942 (the first one) and Battlefield 2.<br />
<br />
Agree on your point about what they took away from BC1 and 2. Especially 2, that was far more polished and a more cohesive MP experience than the first. They sacrificed gameplay (destruction) for graphics I reckon with BF3 and its close quarters maps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know there's a bunch of other battlefield games. I've played Battlefield 1942 but it's an arcade game and separate from this series.</p>
<p>The creators started out with Battlefield: Bad Company 1 and 2. Then went straight into Battlefield 3, which sacrificed everything it had going for it to be closer to CoD. That being said, I'm annoyed with the creators.</p>
<p>Battlefield 3 should technically be called Battlefield 1 :/</p>

<h2>            acer Aspire V5-572P Windows Secure Boot isn&#39;t configured correctly</h2>
                    I just updated to Win 8.1 with multiple problem not the least of which permanently implanted on my desktop is the warning about Secure Boot not configufed correctly.&nbsp; What is that all about?&nbsp; This computer is less than 2 months old and has all Windows
 8 prior updates.&nbsp; Why does MS mess dummies like me up further all the time?&nbsp; Is this dangerous, can it be fixed?&nbsp; I'm beginning to think that leaving Win 7 was a great big fat mistake.<br />

            Same here. &nbsp;Do we ask Microsoft signature support for help or should we ask Acer? &nbsp;I'm thinking it might be an Acer problem since the BIOS doesn't allow us to change and update the UEFI. &nbsp;By default when you upgrade to windows 8.1 the UEFI needs to be
 updated. &nbsp;The only boot option is to allow UEFI or legacy boot. &nbsp;I tried legacy boot and it doesn't even allow the hard drive to boot since there's no boot sector installed onto the hard drive. &nbsp;The boot sector is installed onto the UEFI.

            I found the solution online somewhere last week, but didn't keep the URL.
<div><br />
<div>In my case, the Secure Boot [Enabled] was grayed out in the BIOS. &nbsp;I had to set a Supervisor password. From there, it was no longer grayed out, I toggled the [Enabled] to disable and back to [Enabled] and I think the last step was I restored BIOS to the
 original defaults. &nbsp;Once I did that, the watermark on the desktop disappeared when I restarted the computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope that helps. &nbsp;If not, try doing a search for the issue with "supervisor" and you may actually find the thread.</div>

            <p>Thanks for the info I did as you explained and it all worked however the watermark was still on the screen, after going through lots of other fixes I had to do a factory reset back to Windows 8 to loose the watermark.</p>
<p>I then loaded an earlier drive image to get all my stuff back (lucky I did that always keep an updated drive image just in case)</p>
<p>Also in 8.1 none of my ports worked they were all blocked?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I am back at windows 8 and will stay that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But once again thanks.</p>

            Hi everyone,
<div><br />
<div>
<p>This could be due to incorrect POP settings, or Firewall issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Incorrect POP settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) – check with provider if it is required or not</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Firewall blocking ports (usually port 25) – could be 3rd party since Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to do so.</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            <p>This is not the problem.&nbsp; If you read my original post, I have 4 sbcglobal.net accounts I check through Windows Live Mial.&nbsp; The POP settings are the same for all of them.&nbsp; 3 of the accounts synch just fine.&nbsp; It is only the oldest, original, default, main
 acunt that all of a sudden no longer works.&nbsp; Why would the POP settings work for 3 accounts but not the 4th?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Please read this article at Yahoo tech support: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/kb/index?page=content&amp;id=SLN5242" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
POP Authentication Failures</a>. Note the date of the article; so far as I'm aware, the cause of these faults has yet to be identified. You may be able to find a similar article at your provider's website; I know
<a href="http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB412563" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AT&amp;T have one</a>.</p>
<p>One cause of such faults is having more than one device access the account. If you have a smart phone configured for push mail (where the server sends a message on to the phone as soon as it arrives, instead of waiting to be asked to send it via POP3), try
 disabling the push feature.</p>
<p>A remedy that works for some users some of the time is to log in to the same account via webmail. This seems to refresh the user's credentials at the server and makes access from the mail client possible.</p>
<p>This is a global problem affecting many mail client users whose mail service is powered by Yahoo.</p>

            <p>This is one of those frustrating intermittent problems that will take a long time to find. I'm a retired IT manager and I know the intermittent problems are the hardest to solve.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>From July 1-3, 2012 my default account worked fine through Windows Live Mail. Yesterday evening I started getting the password error again&nbsp;(NOTHING CHANGED FROM MY SIDE).&nbsp;Sounds like there's a bad server floating around somewhere.&nbsp; Problems pop up based
 on which server a customer hits during the login process.</p>
<p>I don't have more than one device accessing the accounts.&nbsp; I tried logging in to my webmail to refresh credentials.&nbsp; It seemed to work one time but after that it didn't help.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>AT&amp;T suggested that I delete the account and set it up again with new server names (Inbound and Outbound).&nbsp; This did not work at all.&nbsp; I changed my password through webmail and then updated it on Live Mail when prompted.&nbsp; Didn't work!!</p>
<p>Hope Yahoo keeps on working on this problem.&nbsp; </p>

<br />
<br />Yes, that is extremely hard to remove, even Uninstaler packages like Revo Uninstaller cannot see it . . .
<br />
<br />Please see RustiJ's answer on this thread for full instructions on how to remove that:

<p>
</p><p>I went to device manager and uninstalled the "microsoft acpi-compliant control method battery" and then after it was done, did a scan for hardware changes. &nbsp;It reinstalled the driver, and now my battery is showing the correct remaining charge time.</p>
