            <p>Hi Marsha, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Are you using AVG antivirus program? </p>
<p>2. Have you connected the computer to any domain network before? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your system is not in a network, you have no need for this service and you can disable it. If you are in a network, but do not habitually browse the network for file shares, you can also disable this service. Disabling it does not stop you from accessing
 file shares on other computers, it just prevents you from using my network places to browse to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This service maintains links to NTFS files that are moved between disks or computers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>It is not recommended to disable the service. However if you still want to disable, you may follow the steps.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Click on <strong>Start</strong> &gt; type "<strong>services.msc</strong>" in the search field and press
<strong>enter</strong>. <br />
b. In the "<strong>Services</strong>" window, look for the following entry: <br />
c. <strong>Distributed Link Tracking Client</strong> <br />
d. <strong>Double click</strong> and set the "<strong>Startup type</strong>" as "<strong>Disabled</strong>"<br />
e. Click on <strong>OK</strong> to validate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may refer this article for more information. </p>

            <p>Not sure what AVG virus protection&nbsp;is, my isp uses f-secure and it is on my computer. Domain network, not sure but probably no as I am a computer novice.</p>
<p>I was interested in this issue as I ran a pc health scan through my security suite and the only issue that came up was the client tracking feature. I thought maybe this was why I was "all of a sudden" having problems with my system being slow and hanging
 both in my email and in Internet Explorer. I have done several virus scans, deep scans including rootkit and it says no virus or malware is detected.</p>
<p>If there is a hardware issue like a bad hard drive or "brain/CPU" how do I as an amateur check for that? My installed PC health checker from Toshiba says there are no health issues.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply to my initial query.</p>

    <title>Found Bug in Spider Solitaire - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Found Bug in Spider Solitaire</h2>
                    
<p>I found a bug in Spider Solitaire, on xp64, don't know if it still exists in Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was playing a "Simple" game, and removed 7 suits of spades before trying to deal the last set of 10 cards.</p>
<p>With 7 suits removed, there were only 3 cards remaining in play.</p>
<p>When I attempted to deal, I got the error dialog "You are not allowed to deal a new row while there are any empty slots."</p>
<p>The problem is I don't have enough cards left to fill all the empty slots, so there is no way to complete the game.</p>
<p>I did some quick calculations, and decided the odds of this situation arising are roughly 1:100 for a simple game, but much less for medium or difficult games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Backups failing during the night. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> niallsweeney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backups failing during the night.</h2>
                    We are have problems with vss writers causing backup failures during the night. Approx 11pm on wards.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When we re run the backups during the day the backups complete. If we try to re run the backup just after the failure then the backup fails.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But when we re run them during the day after 8am they run and complete.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>the server os is Win 2008 R2 Standard with Backup Exec</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>What type of files are you backing up?&nbsp; If it is Exchange or SQL make sure that there isnt any maintanance running during the backups or that there isnt another program competing for the use of the VSS writers.&nbsp; Check the Windows Event Logs for errors that
 occur during the time that the backup that fails runs. </p>
<p>What version of Backup Exec are you using?&nbsp; Make sure that it is fully updated with Live Updates and that afterwards the updated agents are pushed out.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot do much to the server with regards to rebooting it as it is need nearly 24x7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have updated Backup exec 2012 to what Symantec tech ppl reccomend but and have changed a few setting they have suggested. They come back with its the OS and I agree with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have looked at the event logs and they are less than helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updating windows is someting I cannot do (see above).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This server backups another server B2 which never fails but is used in a similar way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What other programs use the VSS writers? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No Exchange data (i think) but there is SQL but backup exec only reccomends to change for this (but cannot reboot often see above.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing i think is out of the nortmal is there is a info listing the event logs for volsnap at 7am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this is related to the vss writers but how I do not know or what effect it would have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I have seen there are only info messages in the vent log around the time of the failure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot get even a weekly reboot setup to try changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think you are right in saying that some process/service or etc may be compeating for the VSS writers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My latop crashed today and I cannot log in to my normal profile so I cannot even log in tonight to do some investgating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this gives you some more to go on. Thx</p>

<h2>            Toshiba satellite overheating</h2>
                    My L55-A laptop is turning also 70+ C when cpu load up to 100%. But it is no dust, also i have cooling fan, but still happen when exposed the cpu to 100% also it turns 75 C and above when this load is so long(I'm using also third party CoreTemp and windows
 Task Manager). So i always on eco/power saver battery mode to prevent full of load. Also the only task that makes 100% load is System, Services hosts, windows update installer, other software updates. But it is normal? Or we need a service?

            Hi Rendell.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Have you programmed CoreTemp to put the PC to sleep if it reaches Core Max temp and alert you from the monitor in System Tray?  <a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/core-temp-monitor-cpu-temperature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/core-temp-monito...</a>
<br />
<br />Sometimes a cooling pad will help significantly.  
<br />
<br />But most important is to make sure you have a great install that isn't overtaxing the CPU.  Look over this gold standard install which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />If you've cleared all the dust from the fan exhaust and inside as far as you can reach, then the only other thing to clean is the CPU heat sink which is such a major project that it's expense is often prohibitive, so many owners try to wait until they are ready to junk the laptop then do it as a tech project - following an online video or tutorial to disassemble and repaste the heat sink, which can often involve endless removal of parts that are extremely fragile and easy to break or misplace.  So I saved that for last.

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade wiped my external Hard-drive. Replaced all files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade wiped my external Hard-drive. Replaced all files with Recovery.</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my Acer &nbsp;Veriton X2611G from Windows 7Pro to Windows 10Pro.</p>
<p>It appears that all files have been wiped from my external drive (personal files, pics videos and backups).</p>
<p>This is very disturbing as everything seemed to be going fine. I did backup of personal files on C: drive to F: and they were all wiped in the process but preserved on C: .</p>
<p>Now I have a 32768 MB out of a 1TB recovery drive only!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were to revert back to Windows 7 would it put my files back on the external drive F or are they gone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss as to what to do.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I understand how you feel about the situation. I apologize for not addressing in a timely manner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will either need to have recovery media or request recovery media from the manufacturer of your computer&nbsp;and there will be an option for 30 days to go back to previous version of windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, emails, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords,
 custom dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information helps. Please&nbsp;keep us posted on windows related queries and we will be happy to assist you further.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Nachappa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank-you for your reply but this really doesn't answer my question. You are quoting what Windows 10 says.
</p>
<p>It did preserve all the above on C drive only. but completely formatted &nbsp;my F drive which had all my videos, pictures and backups on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is regarding that drive "F". Will it come back or is it just a memory?</p>
<p>I'd rather not attempt to go back as I most likely will lose more personal data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would Windows take a whole 1 TB drive and make it a recovery? Now what do I do with that extra space as well, as it is named Recovery?</p>
<p>It never prompted me to create any backup. I did one after completion to a 32 G thumb drive and also DVD.</p>
<p>Are those videos and pics on that F (Recovery) drive? That I highly doubt as it is much smaller than the original.</p>
<p>Is there anything that would allow me to view what is in that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all this other than the F drive issue so far everything migrated so I think turning back would possibly be a waste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>I can help answer your question as I just ran into the same problem. &nbsp; Windows 10 will give you the option to use an external hard drive as extra space to put the old Win7 files for the rollback process. &nbsp;So, you select that option to use the drive and then
 the process continues and completes. &nbsp;What they completely forget to tell you is, "hey, you know that drive we are using for more space? &nbsp;Well, we are going to delete all your $h!t on it without even telling you to put the files on the drive". &nbsp;**** M$? &nbsp;You
 couldn't just copy the damn files needed to the drive and leave my very important data alone? &nbsp;I had a 2TB drive which contained all my backups which are now gone. &nbsp;I'm pretty f'kd now as far as all my system backups for like 12 machines and all my development
 work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you didn't try to restore your Win7 expecting your external drive data would return, because I am pretty sure they didn't take any care in that drive's data importance. &nbsp;I should have been more careful, but I really didn't think they would do something
 so amateurish.</p>

My friend had the same thing happen to him, he took to 2 data recovery specialists and said they couldnt find any raw data,surprisingly. So our last resort is kroll ontrack data recovery. He has 30 years of busines and data and is extremely upset &nbsp;with microsofts
 horrible upgrade process with external drives. He will sue them for sure as well as others to follow. Anyone want to follow or join a class action lawsuit?

<p>So wish I'd read these posts before updating Win10. Just lost the content of my backup external hdd containing personal documents, photos, music from the past 20 years. Disaster. Thanks Microsoft...what responsible company would think this is an acceptable
 policy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Microsoft have any advice on whether recovery is possible?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Has anybody had any luck in recovering info after this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im distraught. Irreplaceable photos lost in an upgrade.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear you are still having an issue. Unfortunately it looks like you will have to wait until the Xbox team fixes the Blu-ray app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of my consoles are enrolled in the Dashboard Preview so I know I can use the reporting tool in the Xbox Insider app to report issues I see on my consoles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to report the problem to them with some diagnostic information from your console, you could try installing the Xbox Insider app, then press and hold the Xbox button on controller until you see the Power Off, Restart and Report a problem screen.
 I don't know though if that will work without your console being enrolled in the Dashboard Preview program (I'm not suggesting you should enroll unless you want to) so let me know if just adding the app is useful for you to file a report in case it helps them
 identify your issue quicker by getting diagnostic info from your console.</p>

            I don't believe that your TV will pass a Dolby TrueHD signal.&nbsp; Atmos is in the TrueHD signal.&nbsp; It will only pass thru Basic Dolby Digital and DTS.&nbsp; Only a few high end TVs are capable of passing TrueHD and DTS MasterAudio signals thru because of the higher
 bandwidth required.&nbsp; With your setup I don't think you have any good options.&nbsp; For some sending the signal to the soundbar first works but your soundbar won't send a 4k signal thru to the TV.&nbsp; I bet sending the Xbox output to the sound bar first will give
 you Atmos (meaning the Xbox app is working)&nbsp; But then you would have to set the video to 1080p.&nbsp; Not a great option.

    <title>Portrait MP4 video not displaying correctly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Portrait MP4 video not displaying correctly</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Had several videos (MP4) taken with my Android phone. Some were taken in portrait orientation and some in landscape.</div>
<div>I use to synchronize videos/photos SugarSync. Synchronization has no problems so far. Once I open Windows Explorer to locate them in my PC (Windows 7 Ultimate) all thumbnails for landscape videos show up correctly and can be played with WMP but portrait
 thumbnails are not displayed and when opened no video came up, just sound. I've been trying to find a solution for this to no avail. May anyone help please?</div>
                </div>

I would suggest you to<span>&nbsp; rotate&nbsp;the&nbsp;video&nbsp;to landscape&nbsp;on the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;phone and then try to play the video and see if that helps. For rotating the video

Thanks Vijay for your reply, however I do not have a Windows Phone. Like I said in my question, I have an Android Phone (HTC ONE X+ running JellyBean).
<div>I'm not interested in rotating the video because it was recorded in portrait orientation. I have uploaded the video (which I can't see in my laptop) to FB and displays PERFECTLY! But I still want to see the correct thumbnail and see the video.</div>

<p>You will first need to go to the manufacturers website for your model computer and first find out if there are Windows 7 native drivers available. A lot of computers that come preloaded with Windows 8 do not have native driver support for Windows 7 by the
 manufacturer. If there are no native drivers, you will have to consider returning the machine and purchasing a machine preloaded with Windows 8 Pro with downgrade rights to Windows 7 Professional. Or look through the manufacturers catalogue for systems already
 preloaded with Windows 7, usually the business line will have these options. </p>

<font><span>
<p>Consumer versions of Windows 8 Pro that come preinstalled on PCs have downgrade rights to a previous version of Windows (example: Windows 7, Windows Vista).</p>
<p>If your copy came pre-installed on your system, you may downgrade your copy to Windows 7.</p>
<p>If not you need purchase a copy of Windows 7 and install the same on your computer.</p>
<p>• Downgrade rights are only available for licenses obtained through OEM or Volume Licensing (VL) and not apply to Full version (FPP).</p>
<p>• OEM downgrade rights apply to Windows 8 Pro and allows for downgrades up to two prior version</p>
<p>• Software Assurance through VL (Volume licensing) provides the greatest flexibility, allowing for downgrades to all prior versions and editions besides Windows 7 Ultimate and Vista Ultimate editions.Without Software Assurance coverage, VL has downgrade
 rights to prior versions of Windows with the exception of Enterprise.</p>
<p>• It is not possible for a Windows 8 copy with multi-language function to downgrade to Windows 7 Pro or Windows XP Pro as multi language function is exclusive to Windows 7 Enterprise edition and not available for Professional edition.</p>

<h2>            Pc freezes too much, can&#39;t do anything</h2>
                    My computer is not even a year old and just recently it has been freezing so much, just minutes after I start it up. I can't open more than one program at a time with out crashing. I can't open chrome or firefox at all because they crash as well, even
 after uninstalling and installing. I've ran memtest86+ with 7 passes but it found nothing wrong. I can't even start it in safe mode because it just stops loading at the black loading screen. I've been using IE, but even after loading a single website like
 facebook, my pc freezes. I think it might have to do with the desktop/explorer (explore.exe) or whatever because it's the first to freeze and then all the programs freeze. Any help, please?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Method 1</span>&nbsp;: Put the computer in&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Safe mode</span>&nbsp;and see if the error persists:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Method 2</span>:&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Clean boot</span></p>
<p>If the error does not repeat in Safe mode, there is likely a startup item or service is causing the error. Follow the steps found on the following link to pinpoint the item or service

<h2>            ctrl&#43;shift&#43;arrow keys not working</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Ctrl+Shift won't highlight</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few months ago, I got a whole new computer, and with it, I reinstalled Windows. Right when I had installed it, I noticed that the ctrl+shift+arrow keys wouldn't highlight. It bugged me at first, but I got used to it. Now, I've started writing code on this
 computer, and it is very annoying not having this shortcut. The ctrl+arrow keys and the shift+arrow keys work fine, but not them put together.<br />
I understand people have been having this problem in gMail, but this is for the whole computer, whether I'm typing in MS Word or a web-browser.<br />

            If by "Make of the computer", you mean the specs, here: <br />
System Manufacturer: MSI<br />
System Model: MS-7758<br />
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3470 CPU @ 3.20GHz (4 CPUs), ~3.2GHz<br />
Memory: 8192MB RAM<br />
Graphics Card: Nvidia Geforce 8800 GTX<br />
<br />
My keyboard is the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000<br />
<br />
When I ran the Troubleshooter, it gave me these 3 errors:<br />
SM Bus Controller doesn't have a driver.<br />
USB Controller doesn't have a driver.<br />
Hardware changes might not have been detected.<br />
<br />
None of these were fixed by the troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
I also tried Method 2, it did not work.<br />
<br />
I am currently attempting the clean boot.<br />

            Thank you! The Clean boot REALLY helped. I manually opened every program/service that happens on startup and found that Clownfish for Skype was the culprit. I had a hotkey set to ctrl+shift+arrow key. Thank you so much!!!!!<br />

    <title>Windows 7 keeps asking for activation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 keeps asking for activation</h2>
                    <p>For as long as I've had windows 7 it's been asking me to activate my product. I did activate it, I even tried activating it again and it still doesn't work. I've tried everything I could find to solve this problem and nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been a real nuance because it will randomly pull me away from whatever I'm doing to ask me to activate the code, I can't install any new microsoft programs cause I'm not updated and the updates keep failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates are probably the most annoying thing because sometimes when I start up my computer or restart it, it will automatically update, go all the way to 100%, and then the update will fail and will have wasted forty minutes of my time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, somebody give me an answer because I'm about to change operating systems at this point.</p>

            If you used your windows 7 on another computer, some how you have to get your same IP address in it to use the disk again. The disks are made as a one time use. You have to pay for another. If you know anyone that works on computers they will know what
 my uncle does. Its all in the same IP address. Good luck, I'm still trying myself!

            That is not a part of Windows 7.&nbsp; That is a feature that Gateway (and possibly other manufacturers) offer on some models and the software would be provided by them.&nbsp; You might want to check the support site of your manufacturer.&nbsp; Also, the following link

    <title>Display Settings missing Dual View Option - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dumplins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display Settings missing Dual View Option</h2>
                    Dell 8400 with 256 MB Nvidia GeForce 6800 Graphics Card. The Control Panel in XP showed Both Nvidia and monitor controls. I use a 17" Dell Monitor and a 46" Bravia TV. I like to have identical screens on both monitors. In XP, I used the Dual Viewoption
 &nbsp;to setup the differing resolutions of the 2 monitors. I haven't been able to find a similiar setting in 7. The Nvidia Icons no longer show up in the control panel. Whats the fix ?

            Nvidia's site says if your graphics card came with your computer as mine did, then go to your computer's site (Dell) for the latest drivers. I downloaded the drivers from the Dell site and tried to install them thru Device Manager but no luck. Device manager
 say that what came with MS 7 is the best and greatest and won't let you install anything else.
<div>I haven't tried the Nvidia site for downloads but I guess thats next.</div>
<div>Is there a way to disable the driver that MS 7 is so fond of, try downloading the one I downloaded from Dell to see if it has the missing Dual View feature ??</div>

            <p>There can be several reasons why the console is turning itself on. Since you don't have a Kinect, that's one less reason to mind.</p><p><br /></p><ul><li>Have you tried a proper <a href="http://xbx.lv/19Pxh2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">power cycle</a>?</li><li>Is your console connected directly to the wall, or behind a power strip/surge protector? The latter can cause electrical hiccups that could turn the console on. It is officially recommended to plug the console directly into a wall outlet (the Xbox&nbsp;has built-in surge protection anyway)</li><li>Assuming you have the original model Xbox One, the power button is capacitive. Various things can trigger it to turn on, especially hairs or stray&nbsp;wires. Wipe the power button area clean, and keep it clear of objects that could touch&nbsp;it.</li><li>Is your Xbox connected to anything that could trigger it to turn on with HDMI-CEC? Check your&nbsp;TV&nbsp;settings. This might happen with A/V&nbsp;receivers as well.</li><li>D

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure you can do anything yourself to resolve it, the only thing you can try is to see what happens if you perform a factory reset (with keeping games and apps installed) you will have to download your profiles after that so this will require your
 account credentials. See this link for the factory reset steps: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults</a></p>
<p>If that doesn't solve it then the only option would be a repair of the console, but since it's only the sound I would advise to contact Xbox Support via Phone or Microsoft Support Chat on what they advise. You can contact them via
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/contact-us</a></p>

<p>If the different chime sound comes from a hardware related issue, then no, you can't resolve that yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try your luck, and see if it's a system software issue, and do a factory reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if that doesn't do the trick, only a Microsoft Repair center can resolve that. If your console is still within warranty, you can set up a repair pickup at https://devicesupport.microsoft.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you say that the console works flawlessly otherwise, you can decide for yourself, if it's worth a repair, or if you can live with the changed sound.</p>

            I did factory reset and the sound is still same. My system is running very well there is nothing wrong but am afraid if that chime part creates some problem in future to motherboard. Is it possible to replace the console?&nbsp;

<h2>            Wireless service not running</h2>
                    <p>I've encountered a new issue with Windows 10 and my wireless connection. My wifi will work normally for a few minutes before failing. When I run the diagnostic tool, the error comes back as "One or more network protocols are missing on this computer", and
 the tool cannot fix the problem. If I manually disable and enable the wireless adapter and then run the diagnostic tool, the error comes back as, "Windows wireless service is not running on this computer." The tool is able to start the service, and my wifi
 will function normally for a few minutes again, before failing again. Wired connections work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried making sure that my WLAN autoconfig and windows connection manager&nbsp;settings are correct, that&nbsp;they're set to start automatically, I've updated drivers, uninstalled and reinstalled the adapter, rolled back to earlier drivers, all with no success.
 Any suggestions?</p>

<h2>            Is &#34;driver update&#34; by slimware utilities a Microsoft program that can be trusted&#63;</h2>
                    I read a forum on a program called driver update by slimware utilities and people having trouble uninstalling it, but it was from two years ago. I have Windows 10.1 and noticed the icon keeps showing up and got concerned since it doesn't say microsoft.
 I didn't remember asking for it and was worried I had accidentally clicked on one of the new style popups that I occaisionaly encounter. Is this program on my computer from microsoft, and if so, is it trustworthy?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check Compaq Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues.<br />
<br />
Compaq - Support, Drivers, and on-line documentation<br />
<a href="http://www.compaq.com/country/cpq_support.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.compaq.com/country/cpq_support.html</a><br />

<a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/psg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h30434.www3.hp.com/psg/</a>|<br />
<br />
======================================================================<br />
<br />
Check with System maker's support, on-line documentation,&nbsp;and/or forums as there probably are<br />
Hotkeys that enable and disable&nbsp;the touchpad functions. <br />
<br />
Settings for TouchPad are in Control Panel - Mouse (there might be several tabs with TouchPad entries)<br />
and some have a utility that loads in Notification Area near clock on lower right.<br />
<br />
==========================================================<br />
<br />
You may need to re-install or update the TouchPad driver.<br />
<br />
If needed : (make sure you have rebooted at least once if the above did not work)<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Mice and Pointing Devices - Double Click on Touch Pad - Driver's Tab -<br />
Click Update Driver (this is may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers), now RIGHT CLICK<br />
on TouchPad and UNINSTALL.<br />
<br />
Then go to USB Controllers and UNINSTALL EVERYTHING except the category itself (all in it). REBOOT<br />
<br />
This will refresh the TouchPad Driver and the USB Stack. This does not stop the touchpad from working.<br />
<br />
Here is the similar procedure in XP, Windows 7 and Vista's is the same except we need to clear the specific device if present.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575</span></a><br />
<br />

            On many brands the touchpad settings are accessed from a tab in the Mouse properties (Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Hardware and Sound &gt; Mouse)&nbsp; If it doesn't have a separate tab there, it might be accessed from the Hardware tab in the same area according to

    <title>Windows 10&#39;s Update Failure, Endless Reboot Loop, Missing Desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zahr p.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#39;s Update Failure, Endless Reboot Loop, Missing Desktop with Nonexistent Token in both Normal &#38; Safe Mode, and How to Fix them</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">The first Windows update tried to install, to update from v. 1703&nbsp;but failed due to the empty battery. This never happened before, the failed updates. I forgot to get to the bottom of it, especially to set it to manual update instead.
 It kept failing, thanks to the bad registries. At some point, it usually rolled back automatically to the previous version, but this time it was the final: Stuck in the endless reboot loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">To get out of it by either nonexistent F8,&nbsp;ESC+F12,&nbsp;or alt+F10 (Restore, Reset, nor Safe Mode) was tough, it kept restarting. And the last attempt, it somehow managed to survive into a normal mode, with Sign In screen. Everything
 seems normal except the network on the outside. I logged in, and there is the missing, blank Desktop with the popup message:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span><em>"C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\Desktop refers to a location that is unavailable. It could be on a hard drive on this computer, or on a network. Check to make sure that the disk
 is properly inserted, or that you are connected to the Internet or your network, then try again. If it still cannot be located, the information might have been moved to a different location."</em></span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Hell, I can't even use Start, taskbar, apps, basic setting, network (broken driver), or anything. It'd either give me nothing or another popup message:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Explorer.exe: <em>"An attempt was made to reference a token that does not exist."&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Other than them, these things I can access properly:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Sign In screen</strong>, with two Administrator accounts (with&nbsp;their usual backgrounds and profile photo), Power mode, glitchy Ease of Access, broken Network, and battery icon on it. By Shift+Restart from here, I can enter into the "<strong>Choose
 an option</strong>" blue screen to choose: <em>Continue</em>, <em>Troubleshoot</em>,
<em>Turn off your PC</em>. The Safe Mode, only to see Desktop apps with their popup message:
<em>"Problem with Shortcut: The Windows Installer Service could not be accessed. This can occur if the Windows Installer is not correctly installed. Contact your support personnel for assistance.",&nbsp;</em>or the same nonexistent Token popup message. Except&nbsp;for
 some certain Desktop apps like Adobe Reader, Iobit's Advanced SystemCare, ManyCam with missing Camera driver, these apps run pretty smoothly. I want to see my files but I can't, in both normal and safe mode.</li><li><strong>Win+R</strong>, cmd.exe especially.</li><li><strong>Task Manager</strong> (Ctrl+Shift+Esc), and I can see nothing but so many services including third party services, running in the background in Safe Mode.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">My question is: </p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">1. How to restore to the previous version? I have a backed up system image for my PC, but with the irrelevant files (Sept 2017) stored on the external hard drive,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">along with other backups from another different PCs.</span>&nbsp;File History on my PC is backed up weekly, I guess.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">2. Can I troubleshoot it&nbsp;with one of these options: </p>
<ul>
<li>Reset the PC but keep my files,</li><li>Or Advanced options:
<ul>
<li>System Restore, by a restore point.</li><li>System Image Recovery.</li><li>Go back to the previous version.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Which is the best option to fix it, but still keep my files? I accidentally chose System Image Recovery, and this brings me into the System Image Recovery blue screen with accounts to choose, and I don't know how to get back to
 Troubleshoot screen? I let it still open there without even dare to try anything, while it still charging.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Can anyone help me? I want to do this on my own but without reckless steps, and I need this Acer V5 for my uni projects.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>Update on June 20, 2018</strong></span>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took it to a reliable tech support I know about. He tried all options of reset, blue options but none of it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So he&nbsp;<span><strong>took the internal hard drive out to see it from another PC and all data I have is still there, safe and untouched</strong></span>. I managed to make copies of them on my external hard drive, just in&nbsp;case&nbsp;if something goes wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bring it home because we ran out of time and left it untouched for several months until recently I eventually got the bottom of it by&nbsp;<span>doing
<strong>clean install</strong></span>. Halfway through it, I had a little issue with the partitions to place installation with:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div><span><em>"Windows cannot be installed on this disk. The selected disk has an&nbsp;</em></span><span><em>MBR partition</em></span><span><em>table. On EFI systems, Windows can only installed on GPT disks</em>."</span></div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I've done a little research, I deleted all partitions I have (glad I made copies of those data though), and recreate the partition to let the system create some later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Survived through desktop, with a brand new system. Old desktop background still there but no apps nor drivers which is fine, I got them backed up in my flash drives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Case closed, and if you still have questions, just shoot, I'll try my best to reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Thank you for all replies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<div>Have a good day.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Thank you for the additional information, Zahr. If that is the case, we have two options for you to do. The first one is to
<strong>perform a rollback</strong> to the previous build/update. You may check this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-fall-creator-update-is-broken-garbage-how/19f09eb3-ac87-482c-b115-585946351583?auth=1">link</a></strong> and see
<strong>Andre Da Costa</strong>'s response for the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other option is to do a <strong>clean install in Windows 10</strong>. You may check this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-clean-install-windows-10-on-a-pc-step-by/854fd140-385f-452c-ad52-548f2acb0d0a">forum article
</a></strong>created by <strong>PaulSey...</strong> for the complete steps. There are some links that
<strong>Andre Da Costa</strong> also provided on the said link, that you may perform aside from the steps provided by PaulSey... A clean installation of Windows 10 is the best way to start fresh with your device when it's having performance issues. It can help
 to quickly get rid of errors, viruses and other type of malware, and fix system corruption.</p>
<p>

<p>Replies like yours are exactly why it sucks to be a Microsoft customer that needs support!
<strong>Either you did not read the OPs original post or worse, you do not understand it.</strong> You keep instructing him to use
<strong>Start</strong> when he very clearly stated he cannot access <strong>Start</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's tactic of forcing all customer support to go through public forums is flawed and is disservice to it's customers. Nearly all Microsoft products require some form of payment and should include support from true customer support channels. Microsoft
 is treating customers like users of open-source products which traditionally get support through public forums - that is the cost of "free" software. Paid software demands better customer service and quicker resolution from actual Microsoft employees.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/9004ff25-1280-42d1-b8ba-f74f68f02a21" title="Thomas R Adams">
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think settings to receive calls to contacts ONLY applies the same with Skype number. If your privacy settings isn't set to receive calls to ANYONE, this is the most common reason for receiving a busy signal when calling a Skype Number.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, i<span>f privacy settings are adjusted correctly, but incoming calls are still not coming through, you should check
<span>firewall/antivirus/router settings</span>, as they may block incoming calls from reaching client. Incoming and outgoing call streams are being controlled separately, calls to a Skype Number require an individual approach.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any additional questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
