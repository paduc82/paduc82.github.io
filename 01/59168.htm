<p>Either your hard drive or disc drive is probably going defective. The game discs are fine, but the problem lies in the Xbox 360 console itself.</p>
<p>I would first see if you have any warranty left for your Xbox for a repair. You can check it with your serial number here:
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.microsoft.com/devices</a></p>
<p>If the warranty is expired, I would then look into replacing the hard drive. Game freezes can occur if the hard drive has bad sectors of corrupted, unreadable data, which is a sign of the hard drive dying.</p>
<p>If your hard drive is not the problem, then your disc drive is at fault. The disc drive is closely linked with the Xbox motherboard, so your best bet is to just completely replace the Xbox 360.</p>

<h2>            JVC GRDA30U camcorder can&#39;t download to Windows 10 pc</h2>
                    How do I get my Windows 10 pc to recognize my JVC GRDA30U camcorder? so I can download the videos from it to the pc? I&nbsp; have both firewire and usb cords, but it does nothing when I turn it on. ONCE I got Windows popup warning saying something to the effect
 that Windows did not recognize the device. My device manager shows the camcorder under devices, and I install legacy drivers and the JVC drivers, but still nothing!

<p><strong>I found this article. I did not find any drivers as it looks like it was for XP anyways.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The JVC GR-DA30 is miniDV tape based. Connect the DV port of the camcorder to the firewire port of your computer with a firewire cable. USB streaming will likely not work - and the video
 imported is not "DV" format, but a more compressed (lower video quality) format.
<br />
<br />
Download the camcorder manual: <br />
<a href="http://books.jvcservice.com/booklist.asp?Model=GR-DA30US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://books.jvcservice.com/booklist.asp...</a>
<br />
Refer to page 30, "Connecting to a computer". <br />
<br />
Firewire, DV, IEEE1394 and i.LINK are all the same thing. USB won't work, and USB-to-firewire converter/adapter/bub/cable things won't work, either.
<br />
<br />
If your computer has no firewire port, hopefully it has an available expansion slot so you can add one.
<br />
<br />
When the camcorder is connected as indicated and in "Play" mode, your video editor can import the video. Windows XP SP2) or newer is bundled with MovieMaker - you will "capture" the video. Sometimes MovieMaker has issues - download and use WinDV for the importing
 process. iMovie is bundled with MacOSX - you will import the video. <br />
<br />
Since these are bundled, they are free - WinDV is free to download an use, too. </span>

            Well windows 8.1 compatibility install should work.<br />
<br />
But this codec pack is only to be able to use odd file types that are not common. It will not resolve the issue of the camcorder not being recognized. That is the driver. And looks like it is an old Camcorder.<br />
<br />
If you have the CD for the Camcorder then try installing the driver too using compatibility mode for the operating system version shown on the CD or in the manual.<br />
<br />
From what I seen it had XP drivers<br />
<br />
So insert the CD<br />
Go to THIS PC<br />
Right click on DVD/CD drive and select open folder<br />
find the installer file, usually SETUP.EXE or similar.<br />
<br />
Then right click on that and select troubleshoot compatibility.<br />
then follow the procedures on the link I gave you to install using compatibility mode.

            Nope no cd came with this camera. Really appreciate all your help! Do you think that a video capture device would help? I see them all over the place and watched a video on UTube showing using it to work around the firewire/usb issues, but not sure what
 edition of Windows that he was using.

<p>the main key is that it has to load a driver to recognize the camera. camera drivers are TWAIN drivers located in C:\Windows\Twain_32.
</p>
<p>If they are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be a driver somewhere for it. and then you may have an issue with a driver not for windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for example, if you do find a driver or driver/software to install that is for older windows version such a XP or 7, then you can install using compatibility mode and it should work just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how to do this</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-install-devices-software-from-older-windows/c19bee9c-431f-46e2-85f1-6ab90304d278?tm=1526498844033">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-install-devices-software-from-older-windows/c19bee9c-431f-46e2-85f1-6ab90304d278?tm=1526498844033</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But the articles I read from comments, there was a lot of people that stated they had problems and i think this was on earlier versions of windows. I would never buy a FireWire device to begin with. And they claim the adapter to USB don't always work either.
 Or Vise-Versa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you have video files that might have an un-popular file format, which I am not sure with yours, then you will need a codec pack to be able to watch them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will most likely help you in that area. I use shark007 and WMP anyways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install shark007 advanced codec pack and play everything even 4k videos in windows media player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install shark007, close out 64bit settings app.</p>
<p>in the 32 bit settings app select the box shark007 suggested settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now go to </p>
<p>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</p>
<p>
</p><p>scroll to bottom, right click on WMP and Pin to task bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now go to </p>
<p>settings&gt;apps&gt;&gt;default apps</p>
<p>select windows media player as default for audio and video</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you are all set. There is no malware AND YOU WILL NOT HAVE ANY ISSUES EVER. Been using shark007 for 15 years on numerous PC's on XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p>-------------</p>
<p>Even to just recognize and copy the video files to your PC, you once again need a driver to connect the camcorder to the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will look some more and see if I can find the driver(s) for it. I will also look in the manual for it and see what it says.
<strong>Have you read the manual ?????</strong></p>

</p><p><strong>Most video editing programs that support DV video can capture over Firewire from a MiniDV camcorder.&nbsp; Windows Movie Maker includes this capability I think.&nbsp; Many camcorders don't come with any MiniDV capture software, I know my old GR-DVL530U didn't.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You typically won't see a device detected by Windows itself when you plug in the camcorder, that's just how the Firewire camcorder interface works.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Once you've got capture/editing software (such as possibly WMM), you will need to start capturing with the software and then hit play on the camcorder.&nbsp; The capture software might be able to start playback automatically.&nbsp; You will need to rewind

            I can try this, thanks! I read an article that said the Windows Movie Maker is no longer available, so I downloaded Wondershare Filma, but it does not detect the camcorder by fire wire or ubs. I will try this links later today though. Thank you!

<p>WMM is available. I gave you the download link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also gave you the link on how to install it and it shows there WMM installed and I got it from the same download location and it is installed on my Win 10 v1803 and runs properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If WMM does work with your Cam, I suggest to download the PDF manual from the other link I gave you and read page 30 I believe that person mentioned in their comment or read the whole manual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all else fails, I can do more research and maybe find a driver or program that it will work in. Not a whole lot of info out there for it. But if you dig deep enough, you usually get lucky.</p>

<h2>            Why Microsoft is first to abandon their own software on older iOS devices&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes this makes me thinking that Microsoft is more interested in driving sales of Apple devices than in promoting their own software and retaining their users base.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an old iPad which is stuck at iOS 9 and cannot upgrade. Nevertheless it is in good condition, many useful 3rd party apps still work on it: Gmail, Evernote, Stack Overflow app, Kindle, etc. etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But not Skype anymore. Recently Skype refuses to start on this iPad and demands update. When I try to update, it says iOS 9 no longer supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier, the Outlook app stopped work. So I've dumped Outlook and moved to Gmail and Fastmail.fm.</p>
<p>Now I'm saying good-bye to Skype and Microsoft.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot TomR.3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype update available on my iPad yesterday is already the version for iPhone, but it's unwilling to install on this iPad.</p>
<p>I'll try to push it via iTunes, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/download-older-version-of-skype-in-ipad-ios-below/6e644e78-c138-46ef-af2c-40abd9fc36c5">

<h3> grant74  say:</h3>
<h2>            LAN network performance speed is slow with direct wired gigabit connection between Win7x64 and WinXPx32</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Win7 x64 installation with 8GB RAM. 2x GB Ports - 1 disabled - and other active - manually configured on IP4 - with IP 10.10.10.1/255.255.255.0 (no gateway or dns specified).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1x USB Wireless configured via DHCP from wireless router on 192.168......
 (gateway &amp; DNS specified as router address)</p>
<p>WinXP x32 2GB RAM. 1x GB Port - connected directly to above machine with wired cable - 10.10.10.2/255.255.255.0 (no geteway or DNS specified).&nbsp; Wirless adaptor configurd via DHCP from wirless router on typical 192.168..... (gateway &amp; DNS specified as router
 address)</p>
<p>When I pull files from the WinXP machine to Win7, it opertes at about 1.27% of network capacity (~1.5MB/sec). I have tried connecting via the network machine name as well as specifying an IP address to connect to directly.&nbsp;\\10.10.10.2\SomeSharedFolder.</p>
<p>Initially I thought it was favouring the Wirless adaptor - but now I see it is genuinely using the Wired adaptor (from the Task Manager Network Tab).&nbsp; It just doesn't want to transfer data using the networks full ability. It is faster from me to plug in
 the USB drive to copy data between the 2 machines.</p>
<p>I have set the wired NICs to use 1000 MB Full duplex instead of auto negotiation.&nbsp; I have unchecked the auto-metric option and specified a value of 1 on each machine for the wired connection.&nbsp; I have added the PC name and IP address of the 2 wired connections
 to the 'hosts' file on both machines.</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong?&nbsp; Any help appreciated.</p>
<p>Thx.</p>

<p>Hi<br />
Assuming that the cable is OK, and the Giga NICs are using the best drivers (usually the latest OEM drivers).</p>
<p>Entry Level Giga Network can yield anywhere from 35MB/sec. (B=Byte) transfer up to 75MB/sec.</p>
<p>Example, http://www.ezlan.net/vista/Giga-Optimized.jpg</p>
<p>Look at the TCP/IP properties of both Wireless adapters and uncheck them from File and Printer Sharing. This would force local sharing to go through the Giga NICs.</p>
<p>Also try to Optimized the TCP/IP stack on the XP computer, <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Internet_Speed.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>I have just spent the last few hours installing endpoints on each of the machines and running Qcheck which measures network performance over TCP/UDP/SPX/IPX (a very fancy ping basically).&nbsp; When I measure the IPs that use wireless I get about 6Mbps.&nbsp; When
 I test the wired IP's - I get 800 Mbps.&nbsp; It seems to me like the cable is not the problem - and the capacity for throughput is most certainly there.</p>
<p>As for drivers, interestingly neither were up-to-date - I used windows update and now the drivers have an even higher version that on the manufacturers download web site.&nbsp;Although updating them has not&nbsp;made any difference to the performance.&nbsp; Rather surprisngly
 when I use the IP access method the file lists take longer to arrive now than with the named method which is almost instantaneuos.</p>
<p>I also tried switching to the other NIC port on the Win7 host.&nbsp; Once again no difference in transfer speed.</p>
<p>I have the "Marvell Yukon 88E8056 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller" on Win7 host.&nbsp; There is a RealTek RTL8168X(P)/8111C(P) Gigabit Ethernet NIC on WinXP&nbsp; (ASRock P45XE Motherboard).&nbsp; Are those bad NICS?</p>
<p>I have tried both push and pull.&nbsp; In each case, it uses the wired network, but only at about 1-2% of capacity.</p>
<p>I tried your network sharing suggestion as a test, but it made no difference. I believe I also need sharing on the wireless to enable&nbsp;the media server to&nbsp;find the PS3 and stream or copy data to it.&nbsp; Anyway - the wrong NIC being chosen is not the problem.&nbsp;
 The problem is the right NIC with the wrong performance.&nbsp; In fact, I disabled the wireless adaptor alltogether and I still get the same 1.5MB/sec.</p>
<p>The 10.10.10 based network, shows up as unidentified Public Network in Win7.&nbsp; I dont have any options to be able to change this.&nbsp; Could this be effecting it?&nbsp; Is there a way for me to add this to me home network or class it as private?</p>
<p>I also have VMware installed which has created to virtual NIC's.&nbsp; Is there a chane this is getting in the way.&nbsp; I've disabled the IP6 &amp; VMWare Bridge protocol on that NIC.&nbsp; Also it has not made any difference.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>The screen shoot in previous post actually measured the "Speed" between two computers with the same onboard NICs.</p>
<p>The Yukon thought is a little "iffy" some of them are very good others can be troublesome.</p>
<p>If qchech yielded 800Mb/sec then the hardware should be good .</p>
<p>Try to measure (time) a real transfer of large file (like 500 MB) and see waht the sustained "Speed" is.</p>
<p>I do not know about VMware, I use the native XPmode and VPC, while they do not have giga capacity (they emulate Intel 100Mb/sec. card) it does not interfere with the regular Network.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Sustained transfer speed is 1.5MB/sec.&nbsp; Does not matter how I try it.&nbsp; Thats all I get on file copies.&nbsp; VMware adaptors also seem to emulate a 100Mbps adaptor, although I'm not sure which brand - and I really dont think it matters since they not even in
 use.&nbsp; Also, I'm sure this adaptor was getting closer to 25 MB/sec when I was running Vista instead of Win7.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is definately looking like a Win7 related software problem to me.</p>

            <p>Grant74,</p>
<p><br />
I am having a similar problem.&nbsp; I have a Gigabit network in my house, and my two machines (Dilbert and MediaPC) will transfer at 35MB/sec.&nbsp; All have Gigabit cards, gigabit switch, etc.&nbsp; But, then we plug my wife's laptop from work and she uses the network,
 then it degrades to 141kb/sec on file transfers or even slower.&nbsp; It's not when she is on the network; it is when she connects up to the MediaPc and establishes credentials there.&nbsp; And, she even has a gigabit card.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, when we drop her from the network, my computer Windows7 starts having slowdowns on looking out there on the network. When I click Network in FileExplorer, POOF -- it starts a green bar at the top to look for computers and just isn't the same.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
After that, things just slow down terribly.&nbsp; We even got 17 kb/sec.&nbsp; But, we drop her from the network, and I turn off and turn back on the switch between us.&nbsp; POOF -- everything runs perfectly again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just don't understand.&nbsp; I've monkeyed with it, and it pisses me off.&nbsp; A file transfer for 486MB from MediaPC to mine takes 5 secs (if that) but, with the issue above, it turns into 70 minutes.</p>
<p><br />
Crazy -- anyone got any ideas???</p>
<p><br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>I had this desktop built a few months ago, and it's been happening since then.</p>
<p>No, this only happens to me.</p>
<p>It just says unidentified network</p>
<p>I've done any I can find, the only ones I find are to disable DHCP settings and I don't want to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into command prompt and enter ipconfig</p>
<p>
</p><p>It shows everything normally until the IPv4 address, which instead of starting with the usual 192, starts with a 169, I've looked it up and it's because auto configuration is enabled, i just need help disabling that, that's all.</p>

<p>This was a recognised problem some months ago. An IP address that starts 169 means that windows cannot allocate a DHCP address that as you say should start 192.</p>
<p>The MS fix was to select Start and Restart and the problem should be fixed.</p>
<p>What edition and build level of Windows 10 do you have currently.</p>
<p>Your network device should be set to auto to enable windows to select an IP address automatically.</p>

<p>I have Win10 1703, build 15063.250</p>
<p>Restarting would do no good because this happens every time I boot up my desktop.</p>

            A restart will reload Windows. When you start Windows it actually starts with previous settings so if you restart it loads Windows fresh. It's always worth it if you have a problem.

<h3> virose79  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Bluetooth keyboard is not detected.  No Bluetooth in control panel, no bthserv either.</h2>
                    Actually this is a variation of a previous question LemP has answered, but my issue continues beyond the solution for that inquiry.&nbsp; My Netbook is an Inspiron 1501 by Dell and I don't know if it is even capable of bluetooth. There is no bthserv in the
 mmc services. Win XP Pro 32 bit SP3.&nbsp; What can I do?&nbsp; I have both a wireless and wired network adapter if that is relevant.&nbsp; The keyboard pairs with my Galaxy Nexus just fine, so the device is not the issue.

            <p>The Microsoft Optical Wireless Desktop for Bluetooth Keyboard does not need a usb transceiver to pair with my Nexus cell, and one was not supplied with it.&nbsp;( It does have a button that makes it discoverable on the bottom, labeled 'connect channel.')&nbsp; So
 is it hopeless to think it could pair with the Netbook without one?&nbsp; I would think a Netbook would have the capability to detect a Bluetooth device, but mine
<u>is</u> pretty old, 2006. So I repeat, do I need a hardware solution, or will a software do?&nbsp; I do have the radio and Bluetooth settings enabled in network settings. I even have Blutooth Devices in Control Panel and MMC; still, no detection.&nbsp; **sigh**</p>

            this sounds like a hardware issue. and sadly, there are no drivers for third party USB wifi adapters. Even if Microsoft has refurb replacements (unlikely) it won't be worth the $$ for an out of warranty exchange. sorry..

<h2>            Surface Book Keyboard Back-Quote doing accents instead of producing character</h2>
                    The back quote key on my Surface Book has stopped producing a back quote character and instead produces no output but instead waits for the next keystroke to decide whether to put an accent on it. I need the back quote character (I'm a programmer), not
 accented characters (I'm no good at foreign languages)! How can I get back to the old behaviour where I get what I type? My keyboard is set to UK Extended - the only other keyboard that appears to be available is simplified Chinese (well, I do&nbsp;<em>try</em>
 with foreign languages).

<p>Hi digitig, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is possible that the special character lock is enabled. You can try to press and hold the left&nbsp;
<strong>Shift </strong>+ <strong>CTRL </strong>keys at the same time then, tap the right
<strong>Shift </strong>key. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, press the <strong>Windows </strong>Key + <strong>Space </strong>
to switch to other active keyboard layouts. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try changing the keyboard language to English US and check. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance. </p>

<h2>            Print Status -paper out.  It won&#39;t print.</h2>
                    <p>I have hp psc 1200 series.</p>
<p>Just got this "paper out" challenge as of yesterday&nbsp;after trying to print a two page document from Document Library.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have never had to load paper before.&nbsp; I did as it requests and it still says "paper out".</p>
<p>I have already tried unplugging the printer from the computer and plugging it back in.</p>
<p>That got rid of the Check Paper error on the printer, however, I am getting "Paper Out" status on the computer when I try to Print.</p>
<p>Help!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><br />

<p><span>Hello DUCONLAJOIE, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Adding contacts in the updated&nbsp;Skype UWP does not follow the same steps in older versions.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>With new Skype you just need to <strong>click on the Contact icon</strong> ( at the right of the magnifying glass) &gt; search a friend by
<strong>name, Skype name or email address</strong>&nbsp;&gt; Select <strong>the contact </strong>
&gt; then <strong>send a message</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This message will <strong>serve as a contact request</strong> to your friend. A pop up screen will show on his end with the options to accept or block your message/request.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Take note that you only have a limited number&nbsp;of sending messages until your contact accepts.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know if you need anything else.</span></p>

                    <p>I have an issue where my computer is randomly blue screening however the blue screen call stack does not reveal a non-Microsoft driver. The only recent things that have changed is a new Bluetooth dongle which has been removed and the issue is reproducible
 and a new anti-virus which was installed by IT and that I cannot remove (at least software at the driver level). I have a mini/full-dump but the contents of windbg "!analyze -v" are pasted below. I have a mini-dmp file however I don't want to link it in the
 forums, if needed I will share it via PM with those that can help me. <br />

<p>3. From a certain page with the Windows screensavers legacy (Was approved by all antiviruses)</p>
<p>4. I DO tweak a lot my Windows 10 because I love modifying my computer (I even have a program planned for making Windows 10 better. The program I planned to make is similar to PLUS! and Ultimate Extras)</p>

<p><span>Apologize for the delay in reply.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We did reproduce this issue on our lab computer as you had provided the website from where the screensaver was downloaded.</span></p>
<p><span>If we set 3D Pipes as the screen saver, screen saver remains even after we reboot. If we choose a different screen saver and reboot the computer the
 3D pipes screen saver is gone.</span></p>
<p><span>Suggest you to contact screensaversplanet support team for further help.</span></p>

<h2>            Out of warranty repair&#47; exchange for a flickering&#47; juddering screen for Surface Pro 4</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently received some guidance on this forum about the technical issues with my Surface Pro 4 that have just become apparent. Although Microsoft declares the screen judder/ ghosting/ flickering symptoms of a known issue, it is stated on their website
 they will only exchange devices that are up to 3 years old. Mine is, unfortunately, 3 years and 3 months old. Do you think there is any chance Microsoft will exchange the product for free or a reduced price given&nbsp;that this is a relatively short time out of
 the window for repair? I am a loyal customer, a part-time masters student and I love my device, I really don't want to switch to another brand because of this known technical issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luke</p>

            Hi Sharon,
<br />
<br />Can you tell us which setting is User Account Control adjusted to?
<br />
<br />My own is set to the following and I don't get that prompt when I launch Snipping tool.
<br />
<br />Also, if you press Windows key + Shift + S you can use that as an alternative method to make a snip.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1b69327-19b4-4e52-ad8a-50cebcab0245?upload=true" />
