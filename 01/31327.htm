<h2>            found.000 &#38; found.001 folders - are they safe to delete&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here is a question that I am looking for a solution.</span></p>
<p><span>in September 2008 about 3 months after I originally installed VISTA 64
</span></p>
<p><span>I was doing large data transfers from one terabyte to another terabyte drive,</span></p>
<p><span>Keep in mind that I have a very fast box that is a quad 2.5 GHz Intel with 8 gigs of ram.</span></p>
<p><span>Vista and this machine were new to me.</span></p>
<p><span>During one of these transfers I cancelled them and probably rebooted while it was undeleting.</span></p>
<p><span>At the reboot I was not able to login no matter what type of safe or prompt mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I rebooted with the Vista 64 INSTALLATION&nbsp;disk that also has sp1 on it.</span></p>
<p><span>I chose to do a repair of the vista system and it kept all my settings.</span></p>
<p><span>Afterwards I was able to login normally and everything was fine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One thing that this repair I did was to generate two (2) folders under C: /</span></p>
<p><span>One called:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; found.000</span></p>
<p><span>A second one called:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; found.001</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before I did this UPGRADE explained above by Keith that succeeded in installing all important&nbsp;updates is that &nbsp;I was NOT able to delete these 2 folders.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But now I noticed that I could but I stopped short of doing it at the end.</span></p>
<p><span>The reason I would like to delete them is because</span></p>
<p><span>Found.000&nbsp;&nbsp; is 7.5 gigs&nbsp;and it would also be nice to recover this space.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Can I and should I delete these two folders?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>thanks as always</span></p>

<p>The found.00% folders contain recovered clusters by Scandisk or Chkdsk in the event of a corruption in the filesystem, you can view their contents if there is any data that is still recoverable, otherwise
 if access permits it, you&nbsp;may delete them.</p>
<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have Windows XP, package 3.&nbsp; On my Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop, the sreen comes up either too large (so, that I have to move it over to see what's on the right side) or too small.&nbsp; Is there anyway to set it to have it come up all the time to just fill the
 screen?</p>

            You need to set it to the correct resolution. Refer to your manual or Dell's website for what that is and then use the slider in Control Panel&gt;Display&gt;Settings to set it to that. If the setting doesn't "stick" after you reboot, then update the video drivers
 to the latest ones. Get them from Dell's website and enter your Service Tag to get the right ones. If all of the foregoing doesn't help then the video chip on the motherboard is probably failing. You would need to call Dell tech support to get this fixed.
 Whether it is worth it depends on your warranty and the age of the computer.

            This has nothing to do with watching videos. Your video adapter allows you to see what's on your computer. Follow the instructions I already gave you unless this ONLY happens when you are on the Internet. If the latter, you will have to provide the information
 as to what browser you are using and what search site you are accessing. Remember that I can't see your computer from here. ;-)

<h3> grey inquisitor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install anything</h2>
                    <p>I turned my Xbox One on yesterday and I could not install anything. No error codes, no messages, nothing. When I press the install button absolutely nothing happens. If I press the install button whilst in the marketplace it will just come off the button and I can't go back onto it unless I exit the page and return, still nothing happens. I tried to power cycle multiple times and it didn't resolve the issue and I also reset the Xbox One and that did nothing also. I can't install games that I've bought and when I go onto the marketplace to see if I can download things I haven't bought, it won't even go onto the game's page regardless of how many times I press the A button. No idea what to do, please help.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank You.</p>

<h2>            Nat issues since the guide update</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone else had any NAT&nbsp;issues since installing the recent update? Mine went from open to moderate then I&nbsp;rebooted my router and Xbox and is now strict. I&nbsp;had tried everything... currently it is sitting in the DMZ and STILL&nbsp;strict. My ISP&nbsp;says everything is fine. The only thing that has changed in my setup is this freaking update.&nbsp;<br />Any help if you've had the same issue but resolved it would be great&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

            <p>My NAT says its open, but since the update I have had MAJOR connection issues when playing online. I upgraded my router, and still have issues. LAG spikes every 20-30 seconds when playing any game online. Connection test are all good, download/upload speeds are good 25/10 mbps or so. I have only been having problems the last 2-3 weeks.</p>

</span>Now, make sure that the volume bar is set to the maximum for all the applications.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Additionally, you can try connecting a different set of external speakers and check.</font></font></font></span></p>

            I had already done method 1-3. &nbsp;I tried 4 now no controller shows up at all and I restarted Windows which didn't do anything. &nbsp;So that was a bust. &nbsp;Then I tried 5 and nowhere do I see a compatability tab. &nbsp;This really sucks. &nbsp;I spend days fixing my computer
 after Windows 8 installation and now I've spent hours trying to get sound after the 8.1 installation and I still don't have it.

            <p>Recently picked up this sound card at Best Buy and felt safe it would be Windows 10 compatible as it listed Windows 8 as a system requirement. Got home, installed it, and Windows 10 did not recognize it. Attempted to load the driver on the included CD and
 an error message indicated it was not compatible. Did some searching on the Diamond Support website and found this,</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Due to the age of this chipset, there will only be limited support for windows 10. The card will still function using a windows 8.1 driver, but will not provide full surround sound functionality. Digital Connections will no longer be supported. These cards
 will only provide 2 channel stereo."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why the helk would I want to settle for 2 channel sound when the product indicates a 5.1 capability? So, this product IS NOT compatible with Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Hi Crissy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Photos app automatically finds most of the photos and videos on your PC and . Sometimes though, you might need to tell it where to look.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the <strong>Start</strong> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fkbdevstorage1.blob.core.windows.net%2fasset-blobs%2f28805_en_1" />button, select
<strong>Photos</strong>, and then <strong>Settings </strong>.</p>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Sources</strong>, select <strong>Add a folder</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Browse to a folder on your PC, an external drive, or a network drive connected to your PC, and then select
<strong>Add this folder to Pictures</strong>. Subfolders of the folders you add are included too.</p>

            I tried all of your trouble shooting methods and I still have this problem of not being able to view my photos. I also have updated my system and still have the same issue. Is there an update to fix this issue? This is becoming very frustrating and is
 affecting the gallery for I need to create for my business. Or, are there any photo apps I we can use other than what is given?

            <p>I am having the same issue after a 12/09/2016 update for Windows 10. &nbsp;Frustrating. &nbsp;I attempted this fix: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fkbdevstorage1.blob.core.windows.net%2fasset-blobs%2f28805_en_1" />button, select&nbsp;<strong>Photos</strong>, and then&nbsp;<strong>Settings&nbsp;</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<p>Under&nbsp;<strong>Sources</strong>, select&nbsp;<strong>Add a folder</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Browse to a folder on your PC, an external drive, or a network drive connected to your PC, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Add this folder to Pictures</strong>. Subfolders of the folders you add are included too.</p>

<p>However, when I selected "<strong>Photos"</strong>, nothing was in the file, so I could not go further. &nbsp;</p>

<p>When I go to display photos (jpeg) <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">in my "Pictures" folder</span></strong> with the "Photos" app, the following happens:</p>
<p>1/ The picture I selected displays normally.</p>
<p>2/ however I <strong>cannot display the either the preceding or following photos by clicking on the arrows underneath.&nbsp;</strong> Also, the arrows are grayed out.</p>
<p>3/ When I click on "slideshow", the picture showing <strong>blinks but does NOT change</strong> to the next picture.</p>
<p>4/&nbsp; It prints out normally to my HP 8610 ( it allows me select photo size of 4x6 and allows me to select the proper photo paper and it finished picture is ok).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I display photos in folder on my desktop, the "Photos" app works normally - it displays sequentially in either direction and prints normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to display photos (jpeg)&nbsp;<strong><span>in my "Pictures" folder</span></strong>&nbsp;with the "Microsoft Picture Manager" app:</p>
<p>1/ The pictures display sequentially normally by clicking the arrows</p>
<p>2/&nbsp; The pictures won't print normally to the printer (only allows 4 sizes (none small) and doesn't allow selection of photo paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think, but am not certain, the problem started after a long Windows 10 update (1 hr or so).</p>
<p>Is there any way I can get the PHOTOS APP to sequentially display photos in my Pictures folder?</p>

<p>Hello Darkwarrior,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here on the Xbox forums. <span><span>S<span>tandard Xbox home sharing policies apply for both Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Live Gold. If you have an Ultimate subscription and have designated your home Xbox, you’ll
 automatically share your subscription with any profile signed in on that console.

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 16, 2, 1)">For Windows, that would be a different story. There doesn't seem to be a way to share games/subscriptions on windows the way that you share games/subscriptions on Xbox consoles.&nbsp;</span></p>

            The share works on the you home console and you online profile, you cant sign in with you profile in 2 pcs in same time, so share only work in you home console and PC. or in you home console + another console.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the discussion you have given.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can login to both your Xbox console and your PC at the same time. And you will be able to play Xbox one/360 compatibility on your console. But the thing is some games are only for Xbox consoles and some are just for PC. There is usually a little icon
 next to the games when you search on a pc for games which tells you which games are accessible through which device. But this is a new change so more (62) games are being added all through the year up to October 2019. You can check all games on your Microsoft
 account, it might be a good idea to try the new <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/console-companion-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
xbox console companion</a> on your windows PC.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Why is my screen black when I start Windows 7?<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/why-is-my-screen-black-when-i-start-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/why-is-my-screen-black-when-i-start-windows-7</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>Saving any needed data and re-installing Windows 7 might be the best option though here are a<br />
few others.</p>
<p>You can save your files by putting the drive in another computer or an external drive case and then<br />
backing them up. Do so using several methods in a redundant manner. Of course a real computer<br />
shop or your System maker can help recover the files.<br />
<br />
Or you could use an Ubuntu boot CD to back up the data.<br />
<br />
Use Ubuntu Live CD to Backup Files from Your Dead Windows Computer <br />
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer</a><br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel<br />
- Device Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver -<br />
then Right Click on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
A method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode) is to CTRL +<br />
ALT + DEL - Task Manager and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications&nbsp;Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe. Safe Mode is reached by<br />
repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up. CTRL + SHIFT + ESC also starts Task Manager.<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss<br />
basis. That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just<br />
adds to the difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect.<br />
<br />
You can try a google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these<br />
cover a wide field of efforts.</p>
<p>Here is a video of one fix.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=black+screen+of+death+vista&amp;btnG=Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=black+screen+of+death+vista&amp;btnG=Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g1</a>&nbsp;<br />

<br />
Do you have a&nbsp;Window 7&nbsp;Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the<br />
disks your system maker will sell them cheap. Or try from Safe Mode if you can get<br />
there.<br />
<br />

You can create a Recovery Disk or use someone else's same version (to do the System Restore<br />
it only has to be bootable).<br />

<h2>            Upgraded Windows 10 Pro Activation Error&#58; xc004f210.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I faced an issue upgrading my Windows 8.1 Pro x64 to Windows 10 Pro x64, and I received error
<strong>xc004f210</strong> while attempting to activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not find any result in my search to this error neither by using Google nor Bing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could it be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I used the latest ISO (November 2015 Arabic Version) for the upgrade, and my previous Windows 8.1 Pro was in English by default and then installed Arabic. Could this possibly be the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.: I upgraded a previous laptop seamlessly before when Windows 10 was launched back in August.</p>

    <title>downloading into SPSS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> psychome  say:</h3>
<h2>            downloading into SPSS</h2>
                    I purchased SPSS (a statistical software) and installed it. However, when I download data sets that are in a .sav format, they will not open and my laptop will not allow me to use spss as an option to open them. It reverts to word processor as the default
 to open and does not include spss as an option. when i try and save the data, it saves in some mode that will not allow me to open it either. Or it will not save it at all. Help!<br />
<br />
I have tried to update my software but have only had it 2 days; i have tried unsuccessfully to open the data by forcing spss as the file type and it will not open.
<br />
<br />
Many times when I save a download it defaults to something I cannot open, but this one i really need now.<br />
Thank you

<h2>            Halo 2 insane Lag...</h2>
                    I am facing 1-5 FPS in Halo 2. Its an old game &amp; my computer meets system requirement of this game but I don't know why its giving me so poor FPS. I have tried running it in Compatibility Mode (I thought it would work as game is meant to be released for
 older OS) but it doesn't work. Is this a problem with my OS or with the copy of the game.

<p>Yeah, you are right! I have also seen many forums and videos floating around &amp; most people are facing this issue in Windows 10. In this case I am facing this issue on Windows 7. Other tips that I found on those forums, any of them didn't worked for me.</p>

            Can you check and see by chance if there are any updates available to install for Halo 2 or for your PC? Sometimes this will fix these lag problems, if you are sure you are running the most recent version of the game.

    <title>Asus laptop with windows 10 doesnt go to sleep - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Asus laptop with windows 10 doesnt go to sleep</h2>
                    Hi Guys,<br />
I have this problem for a few weeks in my asus ux305u its really annoying..<br />
It seems like my laptop cannot go to sleep properly.<br />
When i press the power button or fn+f1, the laptop goes to black screen and the power light stays on unlike in sleep mode. then if i immediately press the power button again , nothing happens and if i press it after a minute or so, the laptop just shuts down.<br />
If i close the laptop lid, an action which suppose to put the laptop to sleep, it just stays on and even heats up a lot after a while.<br />
I checked the power plans its all defined properly to go to sleep mode.<br />
I checked with powercfg to see if anything is waking up the laptop and found nothing there.<br />
I re-flashed the BIOS as i read somewhere it could help, but it didn't...<br />
<br />
Ideas anyone...?<br />
Thanks a lot in advance,<br />
Shahar

            HELLO SHAHARKALDOR,
<br />
<br />Click the “Start” button and select “Settings”
<br />Click “System“.
<br />Select “Power &amp; sleep“.
<br />Ensure the “Sleep” setting is set to a desired value.
<br />Have a look under “Additional power settings“.
<br />Select “Change Plan Settings” next to the option that you have selected.
<br />Select “Change advanced power settings“.
<br />On the “Power Options” screen, you want to expand each setting and ensure that they allow the computer to go to sleep mode. In my case, the setting under “Multimedia settings” &gt; “When sharing media” was set to “Prevent idling to sleep“. I had to set this to “Allow the computer to sleep“. Hit the “Restore plan defaults” button and that should toggle all items to where sleeping is allowed in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Also try battery troubleshooter:
<br />1) Press Windows + X keys on the keyboard, select Control Panel.
<br />2) In the search bar on the Control Panel type Troubleshooting
<br />3) Click on View all on the left navigation pane. 
<br />4)Click on Power.
<br />5) Go to Advanced on and run the power troubleshooter as an administrator
<br />6) Click on Next
<br />
<br />Hope it helps, have a good day       
        </p>

I checked the power plans its all defined properly to go to sleep mode.<br />
I checked with powercfg to see if anything is waking up the laptop and found nothing there.<br />
I re-flashed the BIOS as i read somewhere it could help, but it didn't...<br />
<br />
Ideas anyone...?<br />
Thanks a lot in advance,<br />

<h2>            My Windows 10 PC has been sat on a black screen with the Windows logo for 2 days</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 PC has been sat on a black screen with the Windows logo for 2 days performing disk accesses. Started a couple of days ago and when I tried to stop it by powering off I got a message saying it was unable to complete an update and was uninstalling
 it. The PC then shut down, restarted itself and is back on the black screen with windows logo performing disk accessing and has been since yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help/ideas on what to do to rectify this appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>Hello Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A black screen can occur in a number of scenarios on Windows 10, it's possibly caused by the graphics driver, a connection problem between with your computer's display, during an update or installation, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better assist you, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Confirm which build is currently installed on your device. To check, follow the steps below:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Press <em><strong>Windows key + R</strong></em>, then type in <strong><em>winver</em></strong>.</li><li>Click <em><strong>OK.</strong></em></li></ol>
<ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your device?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we recommend performing the steps on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14106/windows-10-troubleshoot-black-screen-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>to troubleshoot black screen issues on Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, check if the issue occurs in a clean boot state. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you
 run a program in Windows 10. Check the steps on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Melchizedek</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying to help. My windows version is 1709 build 16299.125</p>
<p>
</p><p>My "device" is a PC based on ASUS Motherboard, AMD Athlon 5050e Dual Processor, 4Gb Ram, 64 bit OS, Windows 10 Home, ATI Radeon 3200 Graphics with the most uptodate driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has been recently added or changed. The latest Windows 10 Cumulative update causes the PC to hang at the black screen with windows logo. I have to reboot 3 times until it rolls the update back. When it undoes the update the PC starts normally but
 then I can't run the Update Troubleshooter as the update causing the issue is no longer installed. The PC immediately downloads the same cumulative update and the same thing happens again. If I start the PC in Safe Mode (again without the update as it has
 rolled back) then the update trouble shooter produces an error and will not complete (0x803C0103 ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your suggestion regarding the article for Win 10 Black Screen did not help as most of it related to upgrades to Win10 which is not my scenario. I did try to check if My Radeon 3200 was compatible with windows 10 (which it has been since Windows 10 came out
 - I was an early adopter) but was not sure how to interpret the information from the System Information screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was intending to try to run the update in Safe Mode so I could then use the Update Troubleshooter to find the problem but in Safe Mode when I try to enter the Windows Updates section within Settings . it just sits there doing nothing..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Clean Boot page you recommended told me that the suggestions were not for issues that prevented booting into Windows which is what my issue is doing post update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to any further recommendations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Joe</p>

            If you have any USB devices connected to your xbox like an ssd or a charging cable. Disconnect them and try to hard reset by holding the power button down until the xbox shuts down completely. Then turn it back on and try to connect. I have had this issue
 in the past and only found success this way.

    <title>Slow or failed attempts to install ActiveDirectory module - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff beisch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow or failed attempts to install ActiveDirectory module</h2>
                    <p>In a script running at logon of a user to a terminal server with two remote and one local domain controllers, we're finding that loading the ActiveDirectory module in the script sporadically takes a long time or records a failure message but does load.&nbsp;
 The failure message is:</p>
<p>WARNING: Error initializing default drive: 'Unable to contact the server. This may be because this server does not exist, it is currently down, or it does not have the Active Directory Web Services
<br />
running.'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ADWS is running on all three of the DCs; all the same domain.&nbsp; One DC is on the LAN and the other two a WAN VPN to another data center.&nbsp; I'm suspecting fro some reason during the slow load or ever the failure above, it's going to the remote DCs to get the
 module and not the local DC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to load a module off of disk or to force the Install-Module to look for a specific ADWS?</p>

<h2>            Screen Orientation does not show up in Windows Mobility Center</h2>
                    I can't seem to rotate my screen now. I have a laptop and an external monitor that I'd like to view as portrait, but the Orientation box does not show up in the Win Mob Cent. (Only 7 boxes)<br />
<br />
Not sure if this is the only way to rotate the screen (external monitor) because no other option shows up under Screen properties.<br />
<br />
Win7 Pro&nbsp;should do it nicely, like in Vista. <br />
<br />
Thanks

            Hey Deanomite_11,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers! <br />
<br />
If a setting doesn't appear, it might be because the required hardware, such as adapter, or driver is missing or turned off.<br />
<br />
So, if you do not see the option to change the screen orientation on your laptop, you may have to update the display and graphic drivers.
<br />
<br />
There are three ways to update a driver:<br />
<br />
• Use Windows Update. You might need to set Windows Update to automatically download and install recommended updates.<br />
<br />
• Install software from the device manufacturer. For example, if your device came with a disc, that disc might contain software that installs a driver for the device.<br />
<br />
• Download and update the driver yourself. Use this method to install a driver that you download from the manufacturer's website. Do this if Windows Update can't find a driver for your device and the device didn't come with software that installs a driver.
<br />
<br />

            Thanks, Gokul - <br />
<br />
For some reason the "orientation" drop down is not appearing on the screen resolution page. I've updated and reinstalled my drivers, but it doesn't seem to help. Is it an Aero setting?<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Here's the thing, I bought an expensive USB to DVI convertor, and now I have the option for "Orientation" under the Screen Resolution settings. But when I use the VGA cable (analog) it does not appear. What gives? The USB to DVI convertor is not that great,
 and gives me annoying screen lag (or maybe it's the W7 screen re-oreintation processing, though I didn't have this in XP with my trusty "Magic Rotation" software...)
<br />
<br />
Also, no matter what, screen orientation still does not appear in the Windows Mobility Center.

            It may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

            <p>The&nbsp; problem does appear to be solely with the netwlv64.sys.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However one of the dump files referenced the atikmdag.sys, a component of the AMD graphics driver:</p>
<p><br />
<em>BugCheck D1, {ffffd000263f26c0, 2, 0, fffff8000284a9d4}</em></p>

*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for <strong>atikmdag.sys</strong><br />
*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for <strong>atikmdag.sys</strong><br />
Probably caused by : netwlv64.sys ( netwlv64+419d4</em> )</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since the atikmdag.sys appears to be an older version (Jun 18, 2012) can you try updating the AMD graphics driver and see if it helps any:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/mobile?os=Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/mobile?os=Windows</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the error persists can you provide the following file via Windows Live SkyDrive which should contain&nbsp;more information on the crash:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>The memory.dmp file will be quite large so to upload it to Windows Live SkyDrive you will have to zip and&nbsp;compress the file with a third party application such as 7-Zip or WinRAR.</p>

            <p>Looking at the memory.dmp file I can safely say this is a issue with the Intel wireless driver.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are some things you could try to overcome the error.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One would be to disable the Intel wireless adapter via the Device Manager, or BIOS if possible, and use an alternate wireless adapter such as a USB wireless adapter known to be compatible with Windows 8.1</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Or you could try different drivers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The wireless driver presently installed appears to be version 13.3.0.137 so you could try a newer driver or an older driver, even a Windows 7 driver.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Apparently the Intel 4965AGN is not supported in Windows 8 according to information from the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://communities.intel.com/thread/31441" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://communities.intel.com/thread/31441</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>That does not mean a driver won't work.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If everything was working OK try rolling back the Intel wireless driver via the Device Manager.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You could also try the Windows 7 driver posted for the laptop:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.toshiba.com/support/driversResults?freeText=1998652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.toshiba.com/support/driversResults?freeText=1998652</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may have to install the driver in "Compatability Mode".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There does appear to be Windows 8 driver in the following link you could try:</p>
<p><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/SearchResult.aspx?lang=eng&amp;ProductFamily=Wireless+Networking&amp;ProductLine=Intel%c2%ae+Wi-Fi+Products&amp;ProductProduct=Intel%c2%ae+Wireless+WiFi+Link+4965AGN&amp;ProdId=2753&amp;LineId=1784&amp;FamilyId=1783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/SearchResult.aspx?lang=eng&amp;ProductFamily=Wireless+Networking&amp;ProductLine=Intel%c2%ae+Wi-Fi+Products&amp;ProductProduct=Intel%c2%ae+Wireless+WiFi+Link+4965AGN&amp;ProdId=2753&amp;LineId=1784&amp;FamilyId=1783</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You could also try adjusting the adapter settings as suggested by "stopthewire" in the following link, such as disabling 802.11n mode:</p>
<p><a href="https://communities.intel.com/thread/33377?start=45&amp;tstart=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://communities.intel.com/thread/33377?start=45&amp;tstart=0</a></p>

I will give this all a try, have tried some of your suggestions already.&nbsp; However prior to this I have been running Win 8 with out a problem, this has only happened since I did the 8.1 upgrade.&nbsp; So I guess 2 weeks after the upgrade an 2 updates the video driver
 stopped working.<br />

            Use NETw4v64.sys version 11.0.5.32. You’ll notice it assigns the wireless adapter a negative IRQ and the blue screens stop coming up. It is available here:<br />

<h2>            Black bars in media player 12 in Windows 7</h2>
                    I just bought a laptop with Windows 7 and everytime I play any video it shows up with these black bars to the left and right of it. I looked on the forums and it said to go under appearances in the control panel and look for side bar properties and to
 uncheck an option there. There is no such option. I play the same files in my windows media player 11 on my desktop and older laptop just fine and it uses the entire screen with no problems or loss of video quality. Could you please help me with this. Its
 kind of annoying since there is no such issues with my older media player. Also already been in the options menu already trying different things like "fit video to player on resize" or "fit player to video". Tried alot of different things nothing seems to
 work. Even went to tools-options-devices-display-properties and messed with stretching that. Nada. Here's a kicker for you, even on some of windows 7 videos from their own website, while playing the video you can see the same issue in th

<p>Hi R.L.V,</p>
<p>Since the videos are working fine without any issues this might be a problem with the settings for Windows Media Player and check.</p>
<p>I would suggest that you change the aspect ratio for Windows Media Player and check.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Open Windows Media Player.<br />
2.&nbsp;Click Tools.<br />
3.&nbsp;Click Options.<br />
4.&nbsp;Click Devices tab.<br />
5.&nbsp;Click Display.<br />
6.&nbsp;Click Properties button<br />
7.&nbsp;Drag the slider to a new position.<br />
8.&nbsp;Click Apply.<br />
9.&nbsp;Click Yes.<br />
10.&nbsp;Click OK. <br />
11.&nbsp;Click OK.</p>
<p>Give a try with the above steps and let us know if they were helpful.</p>

    <title>Help&#33; My Pointer Keeps Disappearing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Help&#33;  My Pointer Keeps Disappearing</h2>
                    <p>I am the owner of a brand new laptop computer, which came with Windows 10.&nbsp; I have had it less than a month.&nbsp; After about a week of owning the computer, my Pointer started both freezing up and disappearing.&nbsp; There does not seem to be any pattern to when
 it disappears.&nbsp; This issues happens almost every time I turn on the computer.&nbsp; Sometimes it is even present when I am at the Lockscreen when I turn the computer on.&nbsp; I have tried restarting the computer, which will help for a short time only.&nbsp; I solely use
 a Touchpad and have not installed any other devices on this computer.&nbsp; This is very frustrating and it appears that hundreds of other people are having the same problems.&nbsp; Here is the troubleshooting I have done so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Tried every single one of the Fn keys.&nbsp; No luck whatsoever.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Updated Windows 10.&nbsp; No luck fixing the problem.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Confirmed that the Driver software is up to date.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Have gone to the "Pointer Options" in Settings and have unchecked all of the boxes under the Visibility section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help, please, as I ready to throw my computer out the window.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Ajblair,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </span><span>I appreciate the efforts you put, I’ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to perform the <strong>System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Perform <strong>Clean Boot</strong> and check for the issue status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem. Proceed with the remaining steps to
 pin-point out the third party service. After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software you can consider uninstalling it.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the following Microsoft Article for performing Clean Boot:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer: Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section <span>
“How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting” </span>
to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></strong></p>

            <p>Hi. I performed both of these things. &nbsp;The SFC said their were not any issues detected. I also figured out the clean boot in windows 10. &nbsp;That did not help either.</p>
