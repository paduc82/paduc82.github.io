            <p>This is a common fault with Gmail accounts. The error code supposedly means <em>
maildrop busy, </em>but that could cover a number of ills. As often as not, the error goes away by itself sooner or later.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options. On the <em>General</em> tab, is <em>

n</em>? Try setting it to not less than 20. </p>

<h2>            Java&#40;TM&#41; Platform SE binary has stopped working.</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have just installed Windows 8 on a clean system and installed the latest version of java from the website. Everytime I open a .jar file (one which works perfectly on other systems) I get a "Java(TM) Platform SE binary has stopped working" error.<br />
<br />
I have installed Windows 7 on the same system and I get an error regarding BEX. When I disable DEP from BIOS and from Windows the .jar file simply closes itself instantly without any error. This while on Troubleshooting mode (All services disabled from startup).
 While on normal mode with DEP disabled I get a different error and the application crashes.<br />
<br />
The only way I can get anything to open properly is on safe mode, .jar applications run but with some problems on some sections of the program that make it crash.<br />
<br />
I cant seem to access the java control panel as it too seems to be a java application.<br />
<br />
The system is a tablet with Atom N2600 CPU and 2GB of ram.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your help.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to uninstall all Java related&nbsp; applications from your computer and restart the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After restarting the computer, run the following Fixit, restart the computer. Fixit will remove registry keys, this might help in fixing the issue.</p>
<p>Fix problems with programs that can't be installed or uninstalled.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reinstall the java application and check the issue status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Are you saying that your Skype account will be used simultaneously on a different location? If yes, this could trigger the system to restrict your account. Skype system is sensitive when an account&nbsp;has login attempts to a different&nbsp;location, this might need
 verification&nbsp;code to verify&nbsp;that you are the one using the account. If you are the one who will use the account abroad, then this is fine as long as you will be able to verify your account.

<p>
</p><p><span>We would like to inform you that if you use your <strong>Microsoft account</strong> as your log-in credentials, it will require an Internet connection and will take a while before your username will reflect to your lockscreen. It will opt to load first
 since it will verify your username and password before you can land into the desktop environment.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Unlike local accounts, your desired username will be reflected immediately, it is also easier to log in since it is a user profile that was saved on your computer and it will load and read it immediately.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In this situation, we suggest that you use your <strong>local account</strong> on your computer for faster login and to avoid being stuck in black screen and having a delay of reflecting your online username.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to create or add another user profile, you will need to use the local

            Hi MFTgamesYT ... 
<br />Let's try a couple of things.
<br />First try running the  Windows App troubleshooter 
<br />Got to search and troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom 
<br />Click Windows Store Apps 
<br />Click Run the Troubleshooter 
<br />
<br />If that does not work then try resetting the Windows Store 
<br />Go to search and type command prompt right click and select run as administrator.
<br />Type the following and hit enter
<br />
<br />WSreset.exe 
<br />
<br />Reboot       
        </p>

<p>Hello,</p>

            This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

<h2>            Can my PC run Win7&#92;What precautions do I need to take&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>As the title says, I would like to know if my PC can run windows 7. I will post my DxDiag file below. I would mainly like to know if it can run it, if there are any risks (such as turning my pc into a giant brick) or any precautions I need to take. I have
 run Win7 Upgrade advisor, but would still like to know of any risks.</p>

<p>MS has a free Win7 compatibility checker tool on their site. On the face of it your specs appear to be OK, but what of your other hardware, eg Printer / Scanner?</p>
<p>If you visit Gigabyte site are win7 drivers available for your motherboard? I had a gigabyte mobo, and the PC concerned passed the win7 compatibility checker, but I still could'nt install win7 untill I changed the mobo.</p>
<p>You have to clean install win7 on a winxp system so ensure data is backed up</p>

<p>There aren't any printers or similar attached to my pc. I do, however, use an external CD\DVD drive, as the in-built one is currently disabled due to it causing numerous issues. Would that be a problem at all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the mobo drivers, I am unsure as to what exactly I need to check for. I've looked on the site but could not find if my mobo was W7 compatible. Could you point me in the right direction?</p>

<p>You should be fine with an external cd/dvd, though I would suggest you enabled your onboard cd/dvd then attempted to boot using it and the win7 dvd to clean install - At least you should know then whether the drive is faulty or it was a winxp hickup</p>

<h2>            Dell Frustrations</h2>
                    
<p>I thought i'd vent alittle here. &nbsp;So there was a post on here a while back about dell opening up preorders. &nbsp;I have a dell preferred account and though ok cool I'll grab a second x1 for my son for a late xmas present because it says delivered by 12/31. &nbsp;Also
 they did 6months no financing awesome. &nbsp;So everythign is great order is "in produciton" &nbsp;Somehow I end up with a second system on my account showing est deliv 1/30. &nbsp;I call to cancel it and give them that order # I couldn't afford to have 2 on there. &nbsp;I repeated
 it several times asked them to make sure my other order was ok.....they said it's fine. &nbsp;I check my order the next day and they cancelled the 12/31 order and left the 1/30 delivery one. &nbsp;I was enraged..called them....get a manager.....they said there is nothing
 they could do and even admitted it was their fault but microsoft only gave them a certain amount. &nbsp;He informed me that also my order with the 1/30/14 est delivery is an error and would also auto cancel. &nbsp;Oh to top it off he informed me the one they cancelled
 would probably have come on launch........I WILL NEVER use Dell again.........SO frustrating.</p>

<p>I called them in a matter of a about 10 hours from when it happened. &nbsp;They said there was absolutely nothing they could do because it's not a dell product and MS only gave them a &nbsp;certain amount....so basically they gave mine to someone else. &nbsp;Oh well lesson
 learned never use Dell again.</p>
<p>And yeah 24hrs I remember you saying that...I shoulda lisntened to you heh. &nbsp;Yeah i'm getting one just bummed I got my son's hopes all up and now not so much. &nbsp;</p>

            I think that rather than "memory" you're referring to disk space.&nbsp; If you want the free offer of Windows 10, you need to do an in-place upgrade of the qualifying Windows version, which means you'll need to clear some space.&nbsp; You can't do a clean install
 the first time.&nbsp; You can start by using Disk Cleanup.&nbsp;&nbsp; Press the Windows key + x and select Command Prompt (Admin).&nbsp; At the prompt, type cleanmgr.exe and hit enter.&nbsp; Follow the prompts.<br />

<p>Hi Pravin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said that the network adapter has been reset multiple times, the issue may be with Wi-Fi itself. Let's have this issue isolated. You can try to connect your computer to a different Wi-Fi. Also, try using the in question Wi-Fi to different computers/devices
 and see if it does the same thing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what happens after doing the given suggestion/s.<br />

<h3> d604  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powershell Command Export-csv limitations</h2>
                    <p>I've notice that when piping results to Export-csv there is a 255 character limit on the output. &nbsp;How do I go around this? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm doing an sql query via powershell and exporting the results to CSV. &nbsp;I notice that when I do that the results on some cells are truncated at around the 255 character limit. &nbsp;I tried using Out-File and it overcomes this, but the output format is not easily
 usable format that I can import into Excel as compared to using the export-csv cmdlet.</p>
<p>Does anyone know a work around to this limitation of export-csv?</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm having a hard time getting used to the friendslist when viewing it. It keeps showing their names, and personal messages. Like on Windows Live messenger. Is there any way to set it so that it ONLY shows my friends name? If i press Y a few times, it does
 this, but then it resets whenever i close the friendslist and have to re-do it whenever i view it again.</p>
<p>It's a silly thing, but really grinding my gears, as Peter Griffin said it :)</p>

<p>Thank you for the update.</p>

</p><p>Try these steps to disable driver signature enforcement permanently:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X </strong>and select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Enter the administrator credentials once prompted.</li><li>In the Command Prompt window, type or copy paste this command: <strong><br />

<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> To enable it again, enter this command: <strong>bcdedit.exe /set nointegritychecks off</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please take note that disabling driver signature enforcement will make the driver vulnerable since this feature provides extra protection<strong>.</strong></p>
