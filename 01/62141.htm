<h2>            Windows 10 update has destroyed my laptop&#33;</h2>
                    <p>The update last Sunday took over an hour and another 30 minutes to try to restart.&nbsp; It kept repeating "This is taking longer than expected, but we'll get there."&nbsp; I left the room and when I came back the machine had shut off.&nbsp; Turned on again and, with a
 black screen and no mouse arrow, a small error message appeared:&nbsp; "C:WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\DESKTOP" &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Said to make sure it was connected to internet, insert a disc (No disc, came installed on computer), etc. "If the location cannot be found, it may have been moved or deleted."</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no mouse arrow, no way to get to anything.&nbsp; Question:&nbsp; What am I supposed to do now?&nbsp; I have work to do.&nbsp; I now have a Microsoft boat anchor!&nbsp; Sorry to be rude, but it is frustrating to buy a superb computer to have an operating system shut it down...with
 absolutely no way out!&nbsp; Cannot even get to a restore point!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a Lenovo 17" Z20 with high powered memory and 64 bit operating system.&nbsp; Barely used and now dead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.&nbsp; I am not happy.</p>

<p>Here's what I did.&nbsp; Contacted Best Buy and the Geek Squad guy told me to do a "hard boot," holding down the start button and letting it recycle.&nbsp; SUCCESS!!!&nbsp; My machine slowly restarted and everything works.&nbsp; Just haven't been able to get the tethering with
 my Samsung S6 edge+ to connect to each other.&nbsp; Will take it home and reconnect to the internet on Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>We just got a new desktop computer with OS Window 7. I tried to reply&nbsp;the seller from craigslits (I am using yahoo mail and&nbsp;also downloaded yahoo messenger)&nbsp;and when I click the reply link&nbsp;a small window popped out and says that
<strong>"</strong><em><strong>There is no email programs associated to perform the requested action. Please install an email programs or if one is already installed, create an association in the default programs control panel"<br />
<br />
</strong>Please help me how to make changes or add email default program. I can't also find the mail program&nbsp;under Internet Options. I want to use my yahoo email account.<br />
<br />
Looking forward for your help!<br />

            Ok, I've found a solution that is acceptable to me, hopefully it wll be for others as well.<br />
<br />
Simply download the Yahoo toolbar and be sure to select the "mail" applicatin, in my version there were 4 check boxes, the first three were selected and the fourth, the mail option, was not.&nbsp; I deselected the others, installed the toolbar and after it closed
 and reopend IE, the toolbar was active.&nbsp; I went to the start menu/default programs/set default programs and then selected yahoo mail as the default email program.&nbsp; I then went back to IE and clicked on the wrench which is settings for the toolbar and disabled
 it.<br />
<br />
Everything now works like before and I don't have the yahoo toolbar cluttering up my viewable area.<br />
<br />
Good luck!

<h2>            Netbook keeps lagging and freezing</h2>
                    After the latest automatic update from the system, my notebook keeps on lagging and freezing for several seconds. The audio of the video that I am watching continues on but the video itself is frozen. And I also often get "Not Responding". My notebook
 is already several years old. It's an HP Pavillion dm1 Notebook. I don't know why this is happening. I already did the Safety Scanner and there was no infected files found. Do I have to reformat? What do I need to do?&nbsp;

            Hi Chinbee_L, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting.
<br /> 
<br />I would do a complete Performance check for the entire system. These methods include how to perform a Repair Installation if required.
<br />
<br />If using an SSD or hybrid hard drive be sure it has the latest firmware.
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />This is not likely the cause of your issue however it is worth checking.
<br />
<br />Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a  process of elimination :
<br />
<br />Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin)   OR   Windows PowerShell (Admin) - at the prompt type in 
<br />
<br />MSCONFIG 
<br />
<br />and hit enter

<br />
<br />Other programs to help :
<br />
<br />Autoruns - Free - See what programs are configured to startup automatically when your system boots and you login. Autoruns also shows you the full list of Registry and file locations where applications can configure auto-start settings.

<br />
<br />Process Explorer - Free - Find out what files, registry keys and other objects processes have open, which DLLs they have loaded, and more. This uniquely powerful utility will even show you who owns each process.

<br />
<br />Process Monitor - Free - an advanced monitoring tool for Windows that shows real-time file system, Registry and process/thread activity. It combines the features of two legacy Sysinternals utilities, Filemon and Regmon, and adds an extensive list of enhancements including rich and non-destructive filtering, comprehensive event properties such session IDs and user names, reliable process information, full thread stacks with integrated symbol support for each operation, simultaneous logging to a file, and much more. Its uniquely powerful features will make Process Monitor a core utility in your system troubleshooting and malware hunting toolkit.

<br />
<br />=====
<br />
<br />Do all of these :
<br />
<br />If you had a 3rd party antivirus on the OS you upgraded OR if you have one now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype out there
<br />Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are true superstars.

<br />Tips to improve PC performance in Windows 10 &lt;-- read this link

<br />
<br />The below is additional help with some of the methods in the "Tips to improve...." link.
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />------
<br />
<br />Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS, chipset drivers, and all the major device drivers.
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click Start Button - Right Click Start Button - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -  REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<p>Hi - Strum-,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>This could be caused by corrupted system files. Running the System File Checker and DISM tool can help. The
<strong>Deployment Image Service and Management Tool (DISM)</strong> is a utility that scans for corrupted Windows system files. If it finds a problem, it will try to replace the problematic system files from a cached version that’s on your PC. If DISM can’t
 replace the files, the<strong> System File Checker (SFC)</strong> can check the corrupted files then download and replace the files through Windows Update. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Start menu</strong>, type <strong>Command Prompt</strong>. Right-click the result and then select
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Copy or type each command followed by hitting <strong>Enter</strong>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sfc /scannow</strong></em></li></ol>
<div>
<p>You can also consider downloading and installing the latest version of Java from the Java's developer website.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</div>

<p>Thank you, DaveM121!&nbsp; I'll give it a try.&nbsp; It's somewhat complicated because the drives (2) are from a USB addon to a NAS device.&nbsp; NAS is fine, but I'm trying to format the drives using connector cables and power unit outside the USB unit.&nbsp; I was able to
 format the drives via the NAS connection, but the only choices were EXT4 and FAT32.&nbsp; So, for the moment, I'm using FAT32.&nbsp; I have a another external USB addon that is formatted in NTFS and I feel more comfortable using that format.&nbsp; If need be, I'll remove
 the drives and format them in NTFS using the connecting cables and power unit (which I've done many times with many disks) and see if it will work with that formatting.&nbsp; It's working now, sort of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, again, and I will try it if there are any problems.&nbsp; In any case, I'll keep the procedure handy for when I need it, either very soon or later.</p>

<h2>            Screen saver not working when Microsoft Office applications open in background</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title: No screen saver</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen saver does not come up when an application from Microsoft Office 2013 is maximized on the screen running with Windows 8.1 as the operating system.&nbsp; The screen saver will come up if File Explorer or Internet Explorer or iTunes or other applications
 are on the screen.&nbsp; But with Outlook or Excel or Word maximized on the screen the screen saver will not come up.&nbsp; I even rebooted the system including formatting the C: drive and then reloading Windows 8.1 from scratch.&nbsp; I then reloaded Microsoft Office 2013
 before loading any other applications and the problem reoccurred and is still there after loading all my other applications.&nbsp; The monitor I have is a HP touch monitor and it is connected by HDMI cable.&nbsp; I tried switching the connection to a DVI cable and the
 problem persisted.&nbsp; My wife has an identical computer hardware wise with the monitor the only exception being an ACER monitor and Microsoft Office 2010 being loaded on the system.&nbsp; Screen saver works just fine on her computer.&nbsp; I called Microsoft technical
 support and was transferred from Windows support to office support and then back to Windows support and then told that they would charge me to fix the problem after a couple of hours talking with them.&nbsp;

    <title>Mail Problems and the Clutter feature - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mail Problems and the Clutter feature</h2>
                    <p>Hi, this is my first post so I hope it's in the right place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like millions of others I have just upgraded to Window 10 from Windows 7 (64 bit). All worked fine until a couple of days ago when I returned from holiday. I use Windows Live Mail on this home PC (NOT outlook or office 365 etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have started receiving emails from outlook telling me it&nbsp;' Clutter moved new and different messages' to a 'clutter' folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is there is no clutter folder and what's more no sign of my emails in ANY folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having followed various links it appears the clutter feature is a part of outlook 365 which as I'm sure you'll know is the business version. I do not and never have had it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a couple of hours I tried the Microsoft help 'chat' options. I went initially to the office chat who tell me they can only help with Office products and as I use Windows Live Mail I needed to go to the windows team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the windows team who told me they didn't have enough access to WLM and therefor I needed to follow the link they provided., That took me to the Outlook team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess what the Outlook team told me I wasn't using outlook so I needed to speak to the 365 team as it was a feature of that program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a near 25 minute call to the 365 technical support I got told as I don't have a 365 log on they cant help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustration is setting in so I go back to the Windows chat team where finally I get someone who attempts to help and offers remote assistance. Despite his best efforts and 1.5 hours of remote access we couldn't get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any one had similar problems or know a fix? I now have 151 emails I can't access - some of which I NEED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks and sorry it's so long.</p>

            <p>Thanks for this but unfortunately it's not worked. I did the complete uninstall and then re-installed as there was no repair option when I ran wlarp.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly it hasn't cured the issue - there is still no 'clutter' folder automatically created and I doubt manually making one will have the desired effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I'm starting to think the filtering is being done at server end as the emails have been grouped before I have the opportunity to see them and all I see is the email from outlook

    <title>UPDATE &#35;3&#58; Help&#33; My User ID Has Disappeared When XP Pro - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            UPDATE &#35;3&#58; Help&#33; My User ID Has Disappeared When XP Pro SP3 Loads</h2>
                    
<p>I am running XP Pro SP3 on a two-year old Dell Dimension e520 that serves as my personal home PC.&nbsp; I have the only User ID for the PC and have Administrator access.&nbsp; I disabled the Guest account over a year ago.&nbsp; (For privacy reasons, to describe my situation
 in the rest of this post, I will use "ABCDEFGH" as a substitute for typing my real User ID into the post.)</p>
<p>I use a Microsoft fingerprint reader to log on and "ABCDEFGH" along with personal icon and the number of unread email messages still appear as usual when I boot my PC.</p>
<p>However, starting yesterday for the first time and continuing today, my Personal Settings no longer load when I boot my PC.&nbsp; I started to go through the process of checking things in order to see if I could find anything unusual or that seemed different.&nbsp;
 Here's what I've attempted so far:</p>
I went to Control Panel - User Accounts, and my User ID is still listed, along with my personal icon, and the notation that I am the Administrator and the account is password protected.&nbsp; No surprises here.
<p>However, when I go to the C:/Documents and Settings folder, my User ID is no longer there.&nbsp; All that's in the folder is a set of folders labeled "All Users" and a folder that has always been there since I first set up my PC named, "ABCDE~1~FGH" .&nbsp; I don't
 know the exact purpose of this second folder but since it's always been there, I'm not too worried about it.</p>
<p>My C:/ drive still has a folder named, "ABCDEFGH's Documents" although the entire folder is empty.</p>
<p>When I click on Start - Programs, the files listed are the ones that are available to All Users.&nbsp; My personal settings for Start - Programs has disappeared.</p>
<p>The same is true for the Desktop Icons that display.&nbsp; The only ones showing are the same ones available for All Users.&nbsp; All the additional icons that I've added through my personal account are gone.</p>
<p>When I go to Control Panel - Computer Management - Local Users and Groups - Users, the only ones listed are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrator </li><li>ASPNET </li><li>Guest </li><li>HelpAssistant </li><li>"ABCEDFGH" </li><li>Support_388945a0 </li></ul>
<p>Although I am not 100% certain, it doesn't seem as though there have been any changes here.</p>
<p>For Control Panel - Computer Management - Local Users and Groups - Groups, the only ones that appear are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrators (which lists "Adminstrator" and "ABCDEFGH" as members) </li><li>Backup Operators (lists no members) </li><li>Guests (which lists "Guest" as a member) </li><li>Network Configuration Operators (lists no members) </li><li>Power Users (lists no members) </li><li>Remote Desktop Users (lists no members) </li><li>Replicator (lists no members) </li><li>Users (lists the following as members: ASPNET, NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users (S-1-5-11), and NT AUTHORITY\INTERACTIVE (S-1-5-4)</li><li>Debugger Users (which lists "ABCDEFGH" as members) </li><li>HelpServicesGroup (which lists SUPPORT_388945a0 as a member) </li></ul>
<p>Again, from what I recall, nothing seems out of the ordinary here.</p>
<p>I have not installed any third party software or drivers on my PC on the past few days. I did download an update to Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 and .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 Update (KB982524) on June 23 and took a WAG that this might be the problem so
 I I just uninstalled it using Control Panel.&nbsp; However, after re-booting my PC, the removal of the update did not help restore my Personal Settings.</p>
<p>Strangely, the Start - Programs folder does not include the basic Windows folder, I think it was called "Accessories" that includes things like Disk Defragmenter, Windows Explorer, and the like.&nbsp; I thought these programs would be available to All Users</p>
<p>Microsoft Outlook no longer appears in Start - Programs and there is no longer an icon for the program on my desktop.&nbsp; In order to start Outlook, I have to go to Control Panel - Administrative Tools - Computer Management - Storage - Disk Management and right-click
 Open my C:/ drive and search the C:/Program Files/Microsoft Office/Office 12 folder to manually start the OUTLOOK.exe file (quite a hassle to do this...)</p>
<p>Any insight to my problem or possible solutions would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I tried to figure out the problem with my PC and did a right-click - Properties on the C:/Documents and Settings folder and noticed that the number of files &amp; folders as well as the amount of memory used in the folder was much larger than what was visible
 in the two folders that were showing.&nbsp; I checked off the "Hidden" files box to see if I could view what else was in the folder and, after a few minutes of adjusting the properties of the folder, nothing changed.&nbsp; It was only the same two previous folders that
 were visible.</p>
<p>Question:&nbsp; Can someone explain why the "Hidden" files &amp; subfolders remain hidden after changing the Properties of the folder and why they disappeared in the first place?</p>
<p>A few months ago, I had a problem with my PC that required motivated me to purchase a copy of Disk Doctors' Windows Data Recovery program.&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to try to restore the my Personal Settings, I used the program and had it copy the output to another drive
 on my PC.&nbsp; It was pretty late at night when I started this process so I went to sleep and hoped that I would be able to copy the restored Personal Settings back to the C:/Documents and Settings folder.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, when I reboot my PC this morning, the settings in the Start - Programs folder have changed -- it's no longer the All Users settings that had been left after my Personal Settings disappeared on me a couple of days ago.&nbsp; In its place was an
 even more stripped down version of settings that showed an empty Programs folders.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the C:/Documents and Settings folder has completed disappeared.</p>
<p>At this point, I am thinking that my attempt to solve my initial problem is only causing additional problems so that I will have to reformat my hard drive and reinstall XP.&nbsp; However, I'd like to try to save as much "stuff" as I can from my current set up
 and was wondering if any readers had any suggestions for how to best accomplish this.</p>
<p>A full scan by my AVG security suite indicates no problems such as a virus or malware although I honestly don't know whether or not to believe the results of the scan.</p>
<p>I ran CHKDSK /f /r and didn't find any problems with my hard drive.</p>
<p>Any suggestions or insights from readers would be most appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            Those .NET updates buggered up my computer too! After the updates installed, and immediately after restart, I started getting "Microsoft Visual C++ Debug Library" errors. I have tried System Restore going back every day for a wek (7 times!) and NONE of
 the restores kept the error messages from popping up. God Luck!

I tried System Restore.&nbsp; I now have several folders in which no files are showing although when I right-click Properties I can see by the number of files and folders as well as memory used that the files are still there.&nbsp; Any suggestions as to how I can get
 the files visible again?<br />

<p>Hi blue227,</p>
<p>Obviously, there's a way to show hidden files and folders. But before we do that, I'm suspecting that your computer might be infected by a virus. Boot up your system in Safe Mode with Networking and run a Full Scan of the OneCare Safety Scanner.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggested Malware scan.&nbsp; I'll try running the Malware scan that you suggested after the re-run of the OneCare scan in Safe Mode is complete.&nbsp; It is now at the 26% completion level so it might be a while before I can run it.</p>
<p>I have not tried creating a new User Profile as a test but can do so after I d-load and run the malware scan.</p>
<p>The OneCare scan found the 3 problems during the Virus &amp; Spyware portion of the scan.&nbsp; My PC's hard-drive is partitioned into 3 sections -- 1 primary boot and 2 backup sections.&nbsp; It looks like the 3 problems were found during the scan of the one of the back-up
 partitions that contains the remnants of my PC's operating system and folders prior to my most recent go at reformatting my hard drive and reinstalling XP.&nbsp; The Personal Settings folder in the remnants of my PC's operating system and folders has been blocking
 me from viewing its contents since I used Disk Doctors' Windows Data Recovery program to salvage what I could of my data files prior to the most recent re-install of XP.</p>
<p>It's probably the case that the 3 problems identified by the OneCare scan are actually related to the blocked, old Personal Settings folder as it is probably corrupted or infected in some way.</p>

Hi Jaycee.</p>
<p>The OneCare scan found the 3 problems located in the partition that i use to store the remnants of my old operating directory before my PC crashed and I had to re-install XP to a different partition.&nbsp; It listed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exploit: Java/CVE-2008-5353.C</strong> </li></ul>
<p>d:/documents and settings/ABCDEFGH/application data/sun/java/deployment/cache/6.0/55/48345e37-1c7544d3</p>
<p>myf/y/appletx.class</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trojan: Java/Selace.K</strong> </li></ul>
<p>d:/documents and settings/ABCDEFGH/application data/sun/java/deployment/cache/6.0/55/48345e37-1c7544d3</p>
<p>myf/y/loaderx.class</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trojan: Java/Selace.L</strong> </li></ul>
<p>d:/documents and settings/ABCDEFGH/application data/sun/java/deployment/cache/6.0/55/48345e37-1c7544d3</p>
<p>myf/y/nbablaf.class</p>
<p>I've tried to reformat the partion a couple of times as the Administrator while in Safe Mode with Networking by Run - cmd - Format D:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drive resisted my attempts to reformat it with the message, "Format cannot run because the volume is in use by another process.&nbsp; Format may run if this volume is dismounted first.&nbsp; ALL OPENED HANDLES TO THIS VOLUME WOULD THEN BE INVALID.&nbsp; Would you like
 to force a dismount on this volume? (Y/N)," to which I answered "Y."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next message was, "Volume dismounted.&nbsp; All opened handles to this volume are now invalid.&nbsp; Cannot lock the drive.&nbsp; The volume is still in use."</p>
<p>After all that effort and&nbsp;a long wait in which it shows a slow status update one percentage point at a time, in the end&nbsp;the attempt to reformat the drive&nbsp;fails and I get the message, "System Partition is not allowed to be formatted."</p>
<p>The majority of my personal files that I had been saving to the other partition on the hard drive&nbsp;are still not visible although a Right-click - Properties still shows that the number of files/folders and the amount of memory they use.</p>
<p>I still haven't had a chance to run the Malware scan that the other poster sugggested.&nbsp; I thought I could simply reformat the partition to get rid of the infection and have spent the entire evening trying to do so but it is proving to be rather difficult.</p>
<p>(Unfortunately, I can't go into the Application Data subfolder in the Documents and Settings folder and simply delete the location of the 3 files that the OneCare scan provided as the Application Data folder is not visible, cannot be un-hidden, and does
 not even show up in the file/folder count or memory usage when i Right-click - Properties on the Documents and Settings folder.)</p>

<h3> span1shuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 RAID 5 Support</h2>
                    
<p>I am confused that everyone says Software RAID 5 is not supported on Windows 7 (Including Microsoft)In my system I got 3 Equal HDD,s READY for the RAID 5 and shows GREYED OUT THE OPTION.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in the other hand the TRAINNING MATERIAL from Microsoft itself MCTS Exam 70-680 Configuring Windows 7 by Ian McLean states that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>==================</p>
<p>Windows 7 offers software RAID-0, RAID-1, and RAID-5 volumes. You can also create<br />
simple and spanned volumes. You can shrink or expand a volume without needing to<br />
use third-party tools. PAGE: 249</p>
<p>==================</p>
<p>So can anyone clarify this? Is software RAID 5 supported or NOT?</p>

    <title>Multiple Profiles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roadhouse_007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Profiles</h2>
                    
<p>Good day. I am a father and have two sons. The XBox360 belongs to the one son, but the only profile is linked to my Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>I would like to have multiple profiles, not the current situation where my two sons are "sub-profiles" of my profile. I would like each of them to have a dedicated profile - they each have a Microsoft account but no purchase capability linked to their accounts.</p>
<p>I do not find any scope for setting up multiple profiles on Xbox 360 - can that really be true?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Every Xbox 360 profile, can be linked to Xbox Live. When doing this, however, you will need to link them to a Microsoft Account. This usually means an @outlook.com email address, which acts as the account sign in information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you able to boot to the desktop and work on it if you can cancel the error?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This issue occurs if the Userinit key in the Windows registry has been modified. For example, this issue may occur if the Userinit
 key has a value but no binary data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><strong><span>Boot the computer in safe mode:</span></strong></p>
<span>Start your computer in safe mode:</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><strong><span>Check the Userinit value and binary data in registry</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span>
</span>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft
 Knowledge Base: 
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/</a>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Start Registry Editor. To do this, click Start, type regedit in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Locate and then click the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon</span></p>
<p><span>d. In the right pane, right-click Userinit, and then click Modify.</span></p>
<p><span>e. In the Value data box, type hard disk:\Windows\System32\userinit.exe, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: The hard disk placeholder refers to the disk on which Windows Vista is installed.
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>f. Close Registry Editor.</span></p>
<p><span>g. Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If it happens at the startup, you may also eliminate it using clean boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b><span>Note:</span></b></span><span><span><span>
 After you have finished diagnosing, follow step 7 in the article to boot to normal startup</span></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<p>I don't have an iPhone but I did install iTunes.</p>
<p>does the certificate need the iPhone device drivers to work?</p>
<p>or is this a certificate loading error?</p>
<p>i'm tempted to uninstall the iPhone certificates but i'm not sure if I should.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How can I turn off windows 10 automatic updates. It is messing me up and I keep having to restore.</h2>
                    For the past week I have had to restore my computer several times because of some windows 10 automatic update which freezes my explorer bar. It's very frustrating.

<p>Disabling the Windows Update service, followed by a reboot, works very nicely. Check the service once more after the reboot. A pending update might have turned the service back on again.</p>

<p>I appreciate your reply to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was me that disabled the Windows Update service, then I would just assume it was something I did wrong. No, it was a Microsoft technician that did it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So last night I even turned off Wifi and closed my laptop lid. This morning the update had reinstalled yet again! - for about the fifth time. You would think that if you go to the trouble of uninstalling something about 5 times that the update manager would
 give up. But no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extremely frustrating. I worried about the day that the uninstall fails and really messes me up.</p>

<p>You probably had a pending update. After disabling Windows Update and rebooting, you MUST check that the service is still disabled.</p>

<p>I have not experienced the phenomenon you report. I would use the modified solution that SuperUser posted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Save the code you see below as c:\Windows\DisableUpdate.bat.</li><li>Create a task with a&nbsp;<strong>delayed</strong> start that invokes DisableUpdate.bat at boot time.</li><li>Check the log file C:\Windows\temp\Update.log after a few days.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>@echo off<br />
goto Start<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
Check if the Automatic Update service is running.<br />
Stop and disablle it if it is.<br />
Maintain a log in C:\Windows\Temp\Update.log<br />
This task must be run under the System account.<br />
13.2.2018 FNL<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
:Start<br />
for /F "delims=" %%a in ('sc query wuauserv ^| find /i "state"') do set State=%%a<br />
echo %date% %time% %State% &gt;&gt; Update.log<br />
echo [%State%] | find /i "stopped" &amp;&amp; goto :eof<br />

<p>What exactly are the steps to disable the Windows Update service? My last update was in January but for the past couple of weeks I constantly get held up by "Something Went Wrong" and have to wait for the window to disappear.

<p>
</p><p>Or better yet, how can I find the<span><span>incompatible app installed that is blocking the upgrade process from completing?</span></span></p>

    <title>Can not log onto laptop with windows 8 password after update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williereed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can not log onto laptop with windows 8 password after update</h2>
                    Have a new laptop (ASUS) with windows 8. The laptop uses my microsoft live account for the log in screen. After the first windows update, I could not log onto the laptop and had to have Best Buy reload windows 8 and start over. There is no way to unlock
 this cpu without the password. This once again happened. I can log onto my windowslive account using a different cpu, but can't unlock the login password using the same password, like I did before the update. Any ideas other than taking it back to Best Buy
 and getting the laptop with windows 7?

            Hi WillieReed,<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft community! <br />
Do you see any error messages/codes when you try to login? <br />
<br />
Here are some solutions:-<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. To make sure that the Microsoft account services are up and running, go to the Service status webpage.<br />
<div><a href="https://status.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://status.live.com/</a></div>
<br />
2. Reset your Microsoft account password<br />
To reset your password or get help with a forgotten password and other problems signing in with your Microsoft account, go to Reset your password.<br />
<div><a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/password/reset</a></div>
<br />
3. Check your password length<br />
Make sure that your Microsoft account password length is no more than 16 characters. This current maximum limit is clearly indicated during the initial Microsoft account sign up, but may not be clear during a password change. The password change process makes
 it possible to enter more than 16 characters, but your account won't accept anything over 16 characters. You can change your Microsoft account password by going to change your password.(You may have to sign in to your Microsoft account before you can access
 this webpage.)<br />
<div><a href="https://account.live.com/ChangePassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/ChangePassword.aspx</a></div>
<br />
4. Get back into your Microsoft account to check&nbsp; if&nbsp; its been blocked or hacked by following the link below<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/get-back-blocked-hacked-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/get-back-blocked-hacked-account</a>

</p><p>Neither the App store nor the Windows Update aren't working properly on my device. I tried to download Asphalt 8 Airborne, but it's been showing ''Starting download'' for a few days. The App store doesn't find any updates and doesn't show the recent updates
 either. The Windows Update. This ''checking for updates'' screen seems to be fitting my personal&nbsp;<span>taste for</span> background as I've been looking at it since 16.09.2018... Help me solve these please.</p>

<p>I suppose we'll have to wait to Asus launching a driver update for those.</p>

            Hello. I've upgraded and everything's alright! But now my webcam stopped working, was hidden on the device manager wich from what I've read means Windows isn't recognizing it anymore and after downloading every single webcam driver for the asus webcam
 I can't get it to work. Everytime I try to install a driver it gives me an error, just saying error and my camera's name. Can anyone please help me? ASUS N53SV i72630qm 8Gbs ram<br />

            <p>I'm in the process of upgrading now and if anyone else has question on it I'll be happy to help as I have an Asus n53sn. I just need to get through it first.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd imagine that a bios update my be needed and I doubt there haven't been any since windows 8.1 has come out. I'd &nbsp;also imagine issues with USB controllers and some of the oddball wifi cards these N series laptops have. We will see, &nbsp;I'll check back with
 any info I find.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit (additional info):</p>
<p>Windows 10 update was successful. I did have all of N53sn drivers from the Asus site installed, but, after the update to windows 10 I had to uninstall the ATK package software and Smart Gesture software and install the ATK package software (windows 10) and
 Smart Gesture&nbsp;(windows 10) for the Asus Q550lf. All seems fine and dandy, I don't use webcams so I haven't messed with that.</p>

            <p>What specific hardware are you running? Everything on the system I have is running pretty well aside from some old hardware drivers that I had to make it use. Here are some specs from my machine if it helps. My video card for both nvidia and intel are functioning
 well. I can try to link you the drivers that I used.</p>
