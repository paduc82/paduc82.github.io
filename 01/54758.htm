    <title>Update conflicted with Clip Studio Paint - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Update conflicted with Clip Studio Paint</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just set my Surface to update before opening Clip Studio Paint, a program I use for my art career.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the Windows update, whenever I drew a line using my Surface Pen (new version) the cursor would suddenly shift from the 'pen' tool to the 'move' tool, and I'd end up dragging my canvas hither and yond.</p>
<p>This was incredibly disruptive and irritating. After some troubleshooting, I discovered people recommending I uninstall the updates for this bug to stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did so - or I tried. I started with 'uninstalling' the "Security Update for Microsoft Windows (KB4074588)" - however both times I tried uninstalling this update, it didn't go away on my list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I went to try to uninstall it a third time, I noticed that my Surface was trying to update again, and I immediately halted that update. (I am guessing it is the complete "Update for Microsoft Windows (KB4099989)" )</p>
<p>Since doing so, the Surface pen bug I had been experiencing has stopped, and I can draw normally again - so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main point is - one of the latest updates is causing terrible issues with the Surface Pen in drawing programs. (and apparently, it's happened before in the past with previous updates)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This needs to be fixed, asap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi there!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been experiencing the same issue all night, but with Photoshop CC. I'm using a Wacom Cintiq 27QHD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue seems to be such - when I use the pen on a zoomed-out canvas, it works fine. But when I am zoomed in and have the ability to pan, the pen will automatically scroll and not activate the selected tool</p>
<p>
</p><p>The behavior is definitely *not* switching to the move tool in Photoshop, it seems more like an operating system action - like using a pen to pan/scroll on a webpage that is overriding Photoshop constantly. There is no cursor change within Photoshop like
 a normal in-software scroll, and it only scrolls smoothly in the cardinal directions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried the registry fix suggested and it's working again as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for the fix, and I hope this information helps! It's very frustrating, especially when the update came through at night without me knowing. Definitely would have sped up the troubleshooting process, I thought there was something wrong with
 my tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best</p>
<p>Pat</p>

<p>Hello I'm a Clip Studio Paint user too, and I'm using a Cintiq 13HD.<br />
I'm not sure i'm having the same issue as <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3a24567f-d537-4f70-9dd8-0ff3c53a84e3" title="Kudalyn">
Kudalyn</a>, so I guess illustrating it is for the best.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1edd3930-ee70-4cb4-add3-87ab5029b3c3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1edd3930-ee70-4cb4-add3-87ab5029b3c3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>At first I thought it was Studio Clip who did a bad update but then I've tried on another software, OpenToonz.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b63275b-339a-402a-8bb1-83b7cb8cc866?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b63275b-339a-402a-8bb1-83b7cb8cc866?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><br />
I've tried uninstalling and installing Clip Studio, installing a previous version of Clip Studio, to reinstall my tablet driver, to reinstall my graphic driver, I've tried to run the command (as administrator)"&nbsp;<span>reg add
 HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Pen /v LegacyPenInteractionModel /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f "&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;and tried to deactivate windows ink.<br />
</p>
<p>None of this worked.<br />
<br />
Last thing left for me is to do like&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3a24567f-d537-4f70-9dd8-0ff3c53a84e3" title="Kudalyn">Kudalyn</a>&nbsp;and find the update that has brought the problem (and I hope the code they've found works for a conventional
 PC), or reinstall windows and make a backup restore point at every small updates.<br />
<br />
I am at my wits ends here so if you have any other idea of a solution, I'm all ears.<br />
<br />
Thank you kindly in advance.<br />
<br />

I actually did have the message&nbsp;<span>"operation completed successfully" every time&nbsp;I tried the code but no changes happened, even after restarting. I've been trying this code since yesterday.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Excepted that I've never restarted immediately after doing the code. Which I just&nbsp;did after reading your message.<br />
Now it works.<br />

<p>I just checked, apparently I might have.</p>
<p>I can't tell which or exactly when since my update history doesn't give me all details.(For it, my most recent update in any thing is from the 11th of this month)<br />
<br />
I did retry the code and restarted my computer again after it started to re-botched up everything, just to see. But there was no changes, not even a 10 minute thing.<br />

            <p>So the way it works in Destiny 2 at least, is there is/was a season pass for "Year 1" which had the Curse of Osiris DLC 1, and Warmind which was DLC&nbsp;2, essentially. Coming up here in a few weeks is the "Year 2"&nbsp;expansion called Forsaken. Forsaken is it's own expansion, and is considered "different"&nbsp;from these other DLC's. Now with Forsaken, you have the option to buy the Season Pass or Annual Pass along with it, which covers the next three DLC's released, which is&nbsp;anticipated in Winter 2018, Spring 2019, and Summer 2019. The pass just means you sort of have preordered the DLC's well in advance of when they come out. You will not have to buy anything else to access them once they come out.</p>

For Forza, this can be Car Packs or Expansions. They can be bought separately&nbsp;as you wish, however, to purchase all of it would be costly.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>A Season Pass grants you all or almost all (up to the developers) of the DLC of a game to a certain date. This allows you to get all the DLC as it is released&nbsp;for a discount.

            <p>Season pass typically includes most/all additional DLC that's released, or that's released for a period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some games if you purchase the season pass it includes any DLC&nbsp;they ever release for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others it includes it for a period of time such as all DLC&nbsp;for the first year.&nbsp; Typical&nbsp;DLC is additional game content, map packs, characters, levels, etc. Usually the season passes do not include bonus skins or cosmetics unless it's specifically mentions that it includes them.</p>

            <p>The Season Pass DLC is not meant to be special or limited time. Usually it is a pass that grants you however many DLC content it provides at a cheaper price instead of buying each seperately. I don't have either game so I can't tell you what the Season passes get you specifically but if it follows tradition it is simply a way to get the rest of the content at a cheaper price.</p><p><br /></p><p>Edit: Many games offer the pass at launch (Like BO3, COD) to again, let you buy the content cheaper, and to guarantee you the upcoming DLC content they will release so you don't have to worry about missing out.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>DLC and Season Pass are thensame thing but with an important distinction.&nbsp; DLC gets sold a piece at a time, while Season Passed included all DLC for a given length of time.&nbsp; Usually Season Pass saves you a little money.</p>

<h2>            Skype and Microsoft account not fully merged</h2>
                    <p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">(the following usernames and email addresses are only examples)</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I started with two logins:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>a Skype account e.g. Phantom</span></li><li><span>a Microsoft account e.g. jasonbatgmail.com</span>
<ul>
<li><span>this account includes a Skype user e.g. live:jasonb_1</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What I'm trying to end up with is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>my Microsoft account: jasonbatgmail.com</span>
<ul>
<li><span>with my Skype name Phantom linked properly</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Months ago, I accepted the option to merge accounts. I never asked for the live:jasonb_1 account to be created.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">My primary Skype and Microsoft accounts are somewhat merged because if I log in as jasonbatgmail.com and go to&nbsp;account.microsoft.com/profile/ and select 'your info', I can select 'Go to your Skype profile' and it takes me to my
 Phantom Skype account. Also, any password reset I request takes me to my Microsoft account jasonbatgmail.com.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But the accounts are also separate, because if I log into the Skype desktop app with Phantom I can use my old password which differs from the jasonbatgmail.com password for the Microsoft account. Also, if I request a password recovery
 it will allow me to change the Skype Phantom password which leaves the Microsoft account jasonbatgmail.com untouched and with the same password it had before.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Earlier today when I went to the Skype account settings on&nbsp;secure.skype.com/portal/account/settings it showed that the accounts are not linked, even though the jasonbatgmail.com was linking to Phantom.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In desperation while trying to fix this I eventually logged into live.com with the Phantom name and Skype password only to be told that the jasonbatgmail.com was already used, so I selected the option to create an atoutlook.com
 email to see if I could then properly link the accounts. This action probably made my problem worse, because now the Phantom Skype account does show a linked Microsoft account, but unfortunately it is now Phantomatoutlook.com which is linked.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">At this point my jasonbatgmail.com Microsoft account still goes to the Phantom Skype account as mentioned above, but now I have another Microsoft account that I don't want and I still have the&nbsp;live:jasonb_1 Skype account that I
 don't want.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">How can I solve this? I see two options that could work for me:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Delete the Phantomatoutlook.com account</span>
<ul>
<li><span>along with the Phantom Skype account, and</span></li><li><span>make the jasonbatgmail.com point to&nbsp;live:jasonb_1.</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>or delete the live:jasonb_1 Skype account</span>
<ul>
<li><span>and make the jasonbatgmail.com point to the Phantom Skype account</span>
<ul>
<li><span>ensure that the Phantom Skype account password is no longer used, only the jasonbatgmail.com Microsoft account password from now on.</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>ensure that the Phantomatoutlook.com Microsoft account no longer points to or has ownership of the Phantom Skype account</span></li><li><span>delete the Phantomatoutlook.com account</span></li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would prefer option 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">How can I fix my Skype accounts? Finally, thank you and congratulations for reading this far ;)</span></p>

</p><p>A thorough&nbsp;investigation would require the account to be opened and an investigation conducted by one of our support representatives. Additionally, the merging/linking process works differently now. The main reason why you no longer
 see the article for moving a Skype account to a different Microsoft account is because we no longer offer this option. See this thread posted by

            <p>Hey there JoeDeck9999,</p><p><br /></p><p>The location for the app&nbsp;is based on the IP Address you're connecting from. The DNS or Domain Name System is only a way to translate an IP Address into a Web URL. So changing that is going to have no effect. You'll need to speak with your ISP in this case. It's possible they can issue you a new IP Address to see if that helps.</p><p><br /></p><p>_______________________________________________________</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 error 0xc0000020 when trying to start word, excel, any office 2016 program</h2>
                    <p>My Dell Inspiron 11 3000 series updated Windows 10 and would only boot to a black screen with cursor.&nbsp; After hours and hours of searching and trying and no success in fixing this, I deleted everything after backup and reloaded windows 10.&nbsp; I reloaded and
 restarted my Microsoft Office 2016 and it said all was a ok.&nbsp; When trying to start any app, I get "C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\dxgi,dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error." status 0xc0000020.&nbsp; I no longer get the black screen with cursor
 but can`t use my Office. I`ve reloaded three times.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            Hey Doug.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features. uninstall Microsoft Visual C++, restart PC.
<br />
<br />Download and install the latest Microsoft Visual C++ from here:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try repairing Office at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Microsoft Office &gt; Modify &gt; Repair. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.

            Doug, did you try the steps I gave?  Please reply to each so we can move on to new steps if needed.  All of the steps I gave are known to solve these problems in most cases. 
<br />
<br />Also compare the install you did with the gold standard install in this link which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<h2>            Windows 7 comes up with orange screen after sleep</h2>
                    <p>This has happened, I&nbsp; believe, twice.&nbsp; I am running Windows 7 with an HP desktop, just a couple of years old.&nbsp; I have two monitors. Twice I have tried to waken the computer up (the first time was months ago, I believe) and found one screen totally orange,
 the other one blank.&nbsp; Both times I cut the power and restarted--I didn't even restart in safe mode, which I suppose I should have--and everything was fine.&nbsp; But this is disturbing (I did a backup of recent files on my remote hard drive as soon as this happened)
 and I wonder if anyone has any ideas about it. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Dear KomalSoni,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I appreciate your trying to help, but there are two problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, the restart procedure you suggested does not work. Holding down F8 while restarting did NOT give me the option of restarting in safe mode.&nbsp; I shut the computer down and started it up again, and I got the option of hitting F12 for new
 boot options, but when I did, safe mode was not one of them. Neither was clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But more importantly, from the wording of the response you sent me, this was designed for an ongoing problem. As I have told you twice, this is NOT an ongoing problem, it's a very occasional one. In other words,&nbsp; even if I could start in safe mode
 (which you did not really tell me how to do), I would have to run it that way for months to see if the problem recurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a supervisor I suggest you show this exchange to him or her to see if they can find something that works and is more appropriate. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DK</p>

            As I explained, the instructions did not work properly and I was ot able to follow them completely, although I did start the machine once in safe mode. But in any case, as I made clear, the problem is a very occasional one, and it has not recurred since
 the time that I raised it. (This is in response to your email asking me for an update.) Thus, I am no better off than I was when I first emailed you.&nbsp;&nbsp; If some one else recognizes the problem and has something new to say, I'd welcome it.<br />

<h2>            Registry leftover entries</h2>
                    Windows must include a&nbsp;option that whenever we install a application it must mark down the registry entries made by that application and when we uninstall that app , windows with the help of those pointers remove all those registries entries automatically
 after a restart process as many apps left their registry entries which is of no use to the computer.

            <p>I have not yet found any evidence that Windows cleans up unnecessary registy entries. I have used the registry cleaner Registry First Aid for many years. Used it on Windows 10 after the recent features upgrade and was shocked. 6200 entries with incorrect
 or lost reference. Thousands were due to the updating of Silverlight and&nbsp;apps in the update, leaving registry entries looking for the previous versions. I have seen the Silverlight problem before but the first time for the W10 apps.</p>
<p>I question why Microsoft would leave this useless entries in the registry and why they are not cleaned up by the Auto Maintenance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can give some more insight into this issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have removed old version of Skype from my ubuntu 16.04 and downloaded the deb for the new version from skype.com "-rw-rw-r-- 1 ewan ewan 66964950 Nov &nbsp;7 16:40 skypeforlinux-64.deb"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the deb the software centre opens and shows me skypeforlinux 10.8.0.4 ready for install but after I install it shows that I have version &nbsp;5.2.0.1 installed, which if course shows "Sorry, this version of Skype is not supported anymore" when
 I run it<br />
<br />
I purged the old Skype installation and deleted my .Skype folder from my home directory before installing the deb and the skype icon disappeared from the dash (as it should) but I was left with&nbsp; a mysterious application "ewan.davis -(it's been there since I
 first installed Skype) - I don't seem to be able to do anything to remove this. I suspect it may be the cause of my problem? ewan.davis is my Skype ID.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>I tried install with from the command line with dpkg. This also reported it was installing 8.10.0.4 and appeared to succeed but I still getting ""Sorry, this version of Skype is not supported anymore" when I click on the newly installed Skype icon.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

    <title>Surface Book 2 ghost trail when dragging windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toni andreev  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 ghost trail when dragging windows</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar to the problem below and/or has information on how to resolve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I have encountered is to do with a 'ghost' trail, which follows the original window when being dragged - the trail isn't too slow, it feels like it's less than 0.5 seconds behind the original window. It's almost like the refresh rate is low and
 yet this is a Surface Book 2, which is supposed to be top quality machine. I have the 13'' model and is pretty new - more than a month old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have verified using Device Manager that the machine is running in 60hz refresh rate mode. What is interesting is that the Intel Driver &amp; Support Assistant is reporting 59hz. Even in best performance mode, I can still see this ghost effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any feedback.</p>

<p>Hi Vicky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No changes since I've taken the device out of the box - I've noticed this on day 1 but thought it might be a driver issue, so waited until now to raise my concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since<span> updates haven't resolved the issue, I've tried the following:</span><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing the scaling</li><li>Changing the resolution</li><li>Trying combinations of the above</li><li>Uninstalling and installing the Intel Graphics Driver (it is the latest version recommended by Microsoft)</li><li>Running in best performance mode with AC adapter plugged in</li><li>Enabling the Nvidia Graphics card as default for 3D applications</li><li>Running <strong>Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I actually suspect that it's the display itself due to the article below, which suggests that the 13.5'' model simply has low response time (if true, it would be very disappointing). Please navigate to '<span><strong>Display Response Times</strong></span>'.</p>

<p>Hi<br />
<br />
What is the file extension? It probably is binary code and needs another program to open it.<br />
<br />
Myfile.ext&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; .ext is the file extension part we need or the type of file.</p>
<p>What do you mean in DOS mode? Are you running notepod.exe from the command line?<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post! I understand you're experiencing an issue with picture on your Xbox One. Do you mind clarifying what exactly you see on the screen? If you haven't already, try out a

Power-Cycle</a> on your Xbox. Also, you may want to switch our your HDMI cable for another one.</p>

<h3> jitowix-  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Skype let fake accounts&#47;strangers not in my contact list call me&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Why can people not in my contact list call me on skype? Until now I was only receiving contact requests from bots but today I even received a freaking skype call on my phone. (from a fake account/bot)<br />
I can disable the option to be visible in search results but then nobody can add me right? (including people I give my skype id/email) I still want friends to be able to add me... So please don't tell me that turning off "Appear in search results" means nobody
 at all including people I give my id/email can add me? (as said in the <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34657/why-do-i-get-the-message-microsoft-account-already-exists-when-signing-into-microsoft-services-with-my-account-for-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
help section</a>) </p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally think it's quite stupid that by default, everyone can be called by strangers. From my skype I can find an infinite number of people using the public search and call any of them. That's smart! 👏👏 Should I try to ring every Bill Gates?
</p>
<p>Why add a feature like that, disregarding any care for privacy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And very happy my skype on ios is ringing when fake accounts are calling me but not when it's my dad (half the time it's not notifying me). I already complained 1 year ago about sometimes not receiving calls on skype (ios) but I guess it's not an important
 problem to fix.</p>

</p><p>That is how it is currently set up. We suggest for you to <strong>block </strong>
or <strong>decline requests </strong>from unknown people. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the call notification issue, kindly provide us the <strong>specific Skype version

<p>Well this is not helping, I'm not going to waste my time manually blocking requests (and ignoring calls) from unknown people forever.</p>
<p>My dad also got a call from unknown people so I bet many users have the same issue. Which is obvious since all the accounts can be publicly found/called by default!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my notification issue: Skype 8.28.0.41 (iOS) but as I said it was already happening 1 year ago. I'm not the only one:</p>

<p>The Mac OS (and probably Windows) links are outdated for the latest version of Skype (8.28) since there is no such Privacy option anymore. I tried changing the option using
<em><strong>Skype for Web</strong></em>, will see if it works, thanks. It shouldn't be that hard though.</p>
