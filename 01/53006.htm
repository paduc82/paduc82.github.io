<h2>            Hp printer not printing properly.  Using Windows 7</h2>
                    Just bought a Dell computer with Windows&nbsp;7 installed on it.&nbsp; Installed HP Deskjet 6988 and will not print properly.&nbsp; Takes over a minute for the test page to print and before it does it will flash a bunch of light and "move all of its parts" before it
 even starts printing - it also shuts itself down then back on.&nbsp; Thought the printer maybe died in the moving from one computer to the other - but I went and plugged this HP printer back into its old home (dell computer with XP) it works fine.&nbsp; Have unpluggled
 and plugged back in, changed the USB cable, ran the HP pinter Diagnostics (it comes back ok).

<h2>            no access to UAC, admin disabled, only active account type is standard</h2>
                    My situation is that I enabled admin, logged on and created a user. For some reason I created a standard user. I logged into new account and figured that I wont need admin so i disabled it. Now I have no access to UAC without admin approval, which is disabled.<br />
<br />
Edit: I wasnt able to create administrative type account while logged in as admin.

            Enable the built-in Administrator account again and make your changes. Consider setting up your computer per the recommendations at the end of this post. If you have no other administrative users on the system, the built-in Administrator may be enabled
 for you in Safe Mode so check there first. If you see an icon for Administrator on the Welcome Screen in Safe Mode, this is the case. If you don't see an icon for Administrator in Safe Mode, enable that account by:<br />
<br />
If you have a Windows 7 installation DVD (not a recovery DVD) you can boot the system with it. Select the default language, then choose "Repair your computer". Then select "Command Prompt". At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:yes [enter]<br />
<br />
If you only have a recovery DVD, you can download the file to make a Win7 repair DVD here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2009/windows-7-system-repair-discs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2009/windows-7-system-repair-discs/</a>
<br />
<br />
Note: All the Neosmart recovery disc downloads are torrent files. There is a good explanation of torrent files at the Neosmart website. You will need a torrent client such as
<a href="http://www.utorrent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">muTorrent</a> to get the files. The torrent client will download the .iso file with which to create the bootable DVD. Windows 7 can burn .isos natively (burn as an image, not as data).<br />
<br />
After you create the extra administrative account as described below, log into it and disable the built-in Administrator again for security purposes.<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: cmd<br />
When cmd appears in Results above, right-click it and choose "Run as administrator" [OK]. Now you will get the command prompt. At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:no [enter]<br />
<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP, Vista and all other modern operating systems, Windows 7 is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, All Users, and Guest. These accounts should
 be left alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Windows 7 because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it will require third-party tools and working outside the operating system.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).<br />

            There is no way to activate the built-in Administrator from a standard user account without an active administrator account because you need to do this from an elevated command prompt. If there is no active administrator account there is no one to elevate
 the command prompt!<br />
<br />
I already told you how to activate the built-in Administrator account. I gave you three ways of doing this. If this isn't your area of expertise - and there is no shame in admitting that of course - take the machine to a local professional who will be able
 to fix things in under 5 minutes. Don't use a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place.

<br />I understand how angry you are but being questioning who I am &amp; constatly claiming I may be a Microsoft employee or trying in some way to scam you will not be answering any further questions.
<br />Now if you want my help please answer the questions I asked.

<p>Sorry, can't help you with photos and music that are having a "wtf moment" - whatever that means - but here's how to transfer to or from a USB flash drive:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Insert the USB flash drive to a USB port on the computer. USB 2 port or USB 3 port - doesn't matter.</p>
<p>2- Click on the File Explorer icon on your Taskbar.</p>
<p>3- Double-click on the drive letter for your flash drive.</p>
<p>4- Right-click on the&nbsp;File Explorer icon on your Taskbar and click on File Explorer. This opens a
<em>second</em> copy of File Explorer.</p>
<p>5- In the second copy of File Explorer, open the folder that you want to transfer from or transfer to.</p>
<p>6- Select the files and folders you want to transfer.</p>
<p>7- Drag them to the new location.</p>
<p>8- Close both copies of File Explorer.</p>
<p>9- Remove the USB flash drive from the USB port.</p>

<br />
<br />Could you please tell me more with your thought? Does your SD card with a low free space and you want to free some space of it?
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Matt.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  
<br />
<br />First here are tips for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />As more space becomes needed, you can offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>.  I would not move program files or speed will be affected.
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest version since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

            Hi MattPoli,
<br />
<br />I'm an Independent Advisor here to help.
<br />
<br />You can't necessarily add space to an SD card, you can only "free up" space, meaning you can delete files to make room for it. They can be unnecessary files, files that you don't need, so do just that if it means getting more space.
<br />
<br />Of course there's the option of getting a larger SD card. If you have an 8 GB SD card for instance, upgrade to a 16, 32, or 64 GB SD card, but whatever capacity you should get largely depends on your needs.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps, let me know if you have any questions about such a prospect, I'd be happy to answer them.

</p><p>I have tried reaching out to MS support via live chat but they redirected me here to the community support area. I have tried searching online regarding the issue as well but still I am unable to fix it by myself.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well the good news is you should be able to transfer the license. (I can't see why the online chat suggested you come here)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go to Settings &gt; Update and security select Activation and then Change product key do you still get the same message if you input your key again.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do I would wait for further guidance from either ZigZag or Andre. But you may need to use phone activation.</p>

<h2>            prn file not readable in Notepad &#40;or anywhere&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have created a prn file using a generic text only printer in Windows 8.1. Whenever I try to open it in Notepad (or any other editor/viewer), the document looks to be formatted correctly, but all of the characters are wrong. The characters look to be in
 the correct place. I could even take the time to decode the document to "translate" it. There has to be an "easy" fix though.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
That is a binary file and as you found out it is not readable - it is a printer output file<br />
and not the product of that file which would be readable.<br />
<br />
PRN - file - see the 2nd example here<br />

Hope this helps.

            <p>My understanding (which is not always correct) is that a prn file produced from a generic text only printer (print to file) process is readable. One I just printed from WordPerfect is readable in Notepad. It may end up just being an Adobe problem.</p>
<p>

    <title>Please Insert Disk problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> icnvnu2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Please Insert Disk problem</h2>
                    <p>I had installed FSX few months ago (on Window 7) and enjoyed many hours of flying, but I got carried away and downloaded several aircrafts and kind of made a mess in my simObject folder, so decided to un-install FSX and start over. The uninstall went ok
 except that the FSX folder was not removed and neither did the the shortcut on my desktop, so I deleted those manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried to re-install, disk-1&nbsp;copied files ok, then it asks for disk-2, I put that in and it copys files, toward the end I get a popup saying " Please Insert the disk", tried putting disk-1 back in, that did not work, tried disk-2 again, but the popup
 wont go away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did some research and tried clean boot, but that also did not work. then I tried to copy the disks to my C drive to install from there, but since the program executes DVDcheck.exe is used to install that did not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I will try to install the trial version next from MS and see if it allows me to use my product keys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Any suggestions here will be appreciated. Thanks</p>

<p style="color: rgba(49, 49, 49, 1)">
A: You’ll need to log into Xbox Live (no need for gold) and insert the disc. You can either wait for the prompt once the game starts or go to the Xbox Store, where you’ll will find the new version of the game. If you’ve either played five hours in the last
 12 months, or have bought DLC at any time, the new game should show up as free to download. If not, you can fulfill either of the conditions above before January 30th 2018 and then come back to the store to download. Please be prepared for a short wait, though
 - as it may take us a few days to process all the redemption requests.</p>

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">When trying to open a spreadsheet off of Sharepoint, excel crashes. Found out that KB3055034 that was released in October was
 causing the issue, removed this and it started working. Now that windows updates has been released again for November, I am seeing the issue again. Confirmed that KB3055034 is not on the machine. Also attempted removing KB3097877 in hopes that would help but
 did not. Any suggestions?</span></p>

            Yes that worked. I had the same issue as you a month ago for several users and that last KB was the issue. For the record we have sharepoint and excel crashing on win serv 2008R2, win 7 and win 8.1. Removing those two updates resolved for all the machines.

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this
 tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions and run in normal
 mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.<br />

                    My c drive is running out of space.However there is enough space in the hard disk in the other drives.Is it possible to combine one or two partitions with c and increase the space available in c without formatting. I am using vista home premium

            <p>It is possible if you format one of the partition that you want to combine . If you have some data there, you could move them to another place or external drive. Then let say you want to combine drive D with C (you could do it with any other drive):</p>
<p>1)Go to start and then right click on computer and then click Manage</p>
<p>2)Then find&nbsp; Storage&nbsp;-&gt; Disk Management</p>
<p>3)right click on D drive there and then click delete</p>
<p>4)Then right click on C and click Extend</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that in this case, as I said information on drive D will lost. So make sure to backup them. It could be issue that if you install something on drive D you might need to reinstall it.</p>
<p>Drive D was just example, you could chose any other drive .</p>

            Using the Xbox &nbsp;app. You go to customize profile and then click on the pic icon. Then it will show an option to upload photos off your phone. You need to be over 18 to use the feature in most countries though as Arminator mentioned.&nbsp;

            Hey thanks for asking us for this. In order to do a custom gamer pic you will have to download the Xbox Live app to phone. Sign in on the app then click on the three lines on the top left corner, click on your profile, hit customize. Change gamer pic then
 choose custom picture. Then your done. Hope this was helpful.

    <title>Metro Apps won&#39;t open on accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> francis93  say:</h3>
<h2>            Metro Apps won&#39;t open on accounts</h2>
                    It first stopped working when the 8.1 update came on my main Windows live account. I've tried everything to fix it including the command prompts and the system reset/restore (it failed to fix it). My last resort which everyone suggested was to create a
 new account and copy/past the old files in to this new one. At first the new accounts apps all worked fine but when I finally pasted the correct old files in to it, it stopped working, just like my original account. What is going on? Thinking about returning
 my SP3 and starting fresh because of this.

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>No clean boot does not wipe out any data/files, it is just a diagnostic tool to find out if any third party application might be the cause of the issue.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When
 you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent
 you from following these steps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to the below article on how to perform a clean boot to know <strong>
“How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong></p>

<h2>            Sound Troubleshooting --</h2>
                    <p>Having successfully (to my knowledge) upgraded fromWin 8.1 to 10 last week, have been having otherwise trouble-free experience until today (8-13). Have been using Media Player 12 and Groove, aligning and updating music collection, with sound working fine
 until now. Have tested the hardware on another machine, so the external speakers and headphones do in fact work. Checked the sound card drivers, performing properly (according to "properties" dialog box).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried updating, uninstalling, and reinstalling&nbsp;the appropriate driver for the IDT High Definition Audio CODEC device, then restarting, but still no joy. I can see the output bar going up and down with input signal, but no output.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find the following when checking the properties box once again, under the events tab):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver Management concluded the process to install driver stwrt64.inf_amd64_e4ce23339ea824ad\stwrt64.inf for Device Instance ID HDAUDIO\FUNC_01&amp;VEN_111D&amp;DEV_76C7&amp;SUBSYS_103C2B17&amp;REV_1001\4&amp;127A7E58&amp;0&amp;0301 with the following status: 0x0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot decode this or infer what (IF any) particular / further action is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;In any case, neither speakers external nor headphone (front jack) produce any discernible audio output.
</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for the tools. Machine is HP ENVY 700-400z CTO. Mfctr has updated tools and driver support, which helpful in their own,&nbsp; included a step of checking cables -- very important, to COMPLETELY remove speakers from their power supply and then plug back
 in. Once that single step was done (power reset), speaker functioned properly with output. All other steps useful, but did not accomplish the proper&nbsp;functioning UNTIL the FULL power reboot.</p>
