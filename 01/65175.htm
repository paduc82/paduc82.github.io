    <title>Keep iTunes or other music playing when screen turns off Dell XPS 13 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Keep iTunes or other music playing when screen turns off Dell XPS 13</h2>
                    I have an issue. My laptop stops playing music from iTunes when the screen turns off. I have figured out this has something to do with the Modern Standby feature, but it's really frustrating to have this happen. I use my computer to play all my music around
 the house and having it shut off after 5 minutes of inactivity on the computer is something that shouldn't happen on a modern machine. I know I can set the power settings to be different but I think it's silly to have the screen stay on indefinitely, which
 would kill the battery. There has to be a way to get around this.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Have you confirmed that once the Display setting in System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep times out that you lose the music?  Or does it wait until the Sleep settings.  Check that first. 
<br />
<br />Next check at Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Lock Screen &gt; Screen Saver Settings that it's set to None because some themes are setting 1 minute timeouts.  .  You can also test if the sound quits when ScreenSaver kicks in and if not consider that an option instead of Display timeout.  
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>

            Is this a special Dell Power Plan?  If so I'd set it to Balanced Plan, at Change Plan defaults Reset to Defaults.
<br />
<br />I'd set the Display timeout to 20 minutes at least.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />
<br />This could be attributable in other ways to the Dell Factory Install, another reason tech enthusiasts will never run a Factory or Upgrade install because they'd expect endless issues like this one.  Better to Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

            The balanced plan switch did not help. Based on research and reading other places it seems as though the problem is that this is a desktop app that doesn't originate from the Microsoft store. I ran music on Groove and playback did not stop when the display
 turned off. It seems like this is the underlying issue dealing with modern standby and how the applications are integrated into Windows. Is it likely that this is truly the culprit? That I would be unable to use iTunes on my computer due to, essentially, a
 lack of compatibility with Windows 10?

            Are you updated to Fall Creators Update Version 1709?  There was a bug that kept music from playing when the display timed out or locked (not slept) but it was fixed in this version:  <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Windows/Windows-10-Spotify-stops-playing-when-Screen-turns-dark/td-p/1707402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Window...</a>
<br />
<br />There is also the option to turn off Sleep and set Display as desired, then when ready to turn of the music Lock the User account in Start screen by clicking the Account picture.  <a href="https://appuals.com/music-stops-playing-when-screen-turns-off-on-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://appuals.com/music-stops-playing-when-sc...</a>

<h2>            Upgade to Windows 10 created two problems for me.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 15, 3000 series laptop with a touchscreen and Windows 8.1 OS. I upgraded to Windows 10 and found that my Wifi distance was reduced to about 10 feet vs. 50 feet. Also there were issues with the touchpad not operating in a predictable
 manner. The good folks at Dell did a physical&nbsp;repair and several hours of diagnostics and online&nbsp;fixes to no avail.</p>
<p>After all this, I reinstalled Windows 8.1 and all the issues disappeared.</p>
<p>I installed Windows 10 sometime in January, 2016. I really prefer Windows 10 and am wondering if there were any fixes or newer versions created since then that will allow my Dell laptop to operate properly if I try to upgrade again.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any insights!</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>A wonderful Microsoft technician fixed the issue. She updated my Dell Network Adapter driver and uninstalled two HID- compliant mouse devices both within the Device Manager on the Control Panel and rebooted which re-installed the mouse devices.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Start Menu Failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom taylor fl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu Failure</h2>
                    <p>I have encountered a fault within Windows 10 multiple times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) After a sign in, the Start button fails. Windows pop up says there is a failure of the Start Menu and the only option is to sign out. Multiple Sign ins results in same failure. Reboot has cleared fault sometimes on one reboot, sometimes with 2-3 reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) After placing Windows 10 in sleep mode, when returning to the computer,&nbsp;the computer will have completely restarted and all work is gone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Windows Edge does not have a tools menu to eliminate popups and is hard to control without a tools menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyone have ideas on how to fix these issues?</p>
<p>

            The above method worked on the most recent occasion of loss of the start menu.&nbsp; It has failed several times before and previously I had to resort to creating a new user as this method failed. Is there anything to be done to prevent this issue from happening?

            I have had the start menu failure (along with Search Windows failure) on a number of occasions. Normally a reboot fixes the issue. Sometimes it take several reboots.

            <p>My PC works fine for a few months and the start menu gives another&nbsp;"critical error".&nbsp; Sign out and it will be fixed the message says.&nbsp; Well, if by fixed you mean wiping out but a couple of icons on the start menu that I have put together I suppose it is
 fixed until next time!&nbsp; This time I'm left with just Twitter and Edge.&nbsp; All the stuff I use regularly has once again vanished.&nbsp; I seem to be always able to recover a working PC but lose my organised start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the point of a personalised menu if Microsoft bugs keep trashing it and throwing your efforts away?&nbsp; The only way forward for me is to&nbsp;forget the crappy start menu and use the traditional windows... and maybe think about another platform!&nbsp; I have
 a laptop and another desktop specifically for other projects - I am so glad I did not upgrade these to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps someone at Microsoft can explain why there no proper recovery?&nbsp; Why the **** can't this stupid bug be fixed once and for all?</p>

<p>After all these months, still experiencing the same bugs again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The start menu ate my shortcuts and wasted my time. Nothing seems to fix this issue!</p>
<p>It's a horrible menu. A nightmare! I wonder why such a simple menu should cause all this trouble for all these users for such a long time!</p>

            <p>Well, In an effort to solve the start menu problem and the 512 total count limitation of the start menu, which I can't figure out until now why the *** would any sane person think like that since this limitation wasn't present in Windows 7, XP etc, I thought
 maybe I have an old build and it is from the early development days.</p>
<p>Then I learned that in later updates, Windows 10 start menu can hold up to 2048 items starting from build 10547.</p>
<p>It's weird, right?! but it is Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, at least the problem would go away temporarily and I can manage with that limitation for now. OK, no problem, I'll just update my windows to a later build. BUT For an unknow reason the update failed. Hours upon hours of downloading and when the download
 is done, it fails to install. Just like that. What a misery!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought maybe I'd go find some replacement from a 3rd party to display your malfunctioning start menu. Luckily there are some in the windows store. BUT I can't use my local account, I MUST use the Microsoft account to sign in. Why? I'm not a developer
 or a publisher. I'll just download an app to try it out.</p>
<p>There I go again with my negativity. I have to think outside the box. There are a lot of good features. Don't be ungrateful, think positively. No problem.
</p>
<p>Then a tiny little line appears beneath my account saying from now on, you'll use the Microsoft account to sign in. What the heck?! I am using a Microsoft account. What does this mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevermind, I don't have time for this, let's download the app and try to solve this issue. BUT the 3rd party was ugly and not practicle because of some security issues, it has to rely on another app that acts as a midiator between Windows store Apps and
 the normal apps. huh! that's nice. good security measures. That somehow rendered the store app useless. No, that does not work. Forget the 3rd party solution. I want this malfunctioning menu to work as it should. Ah, I know. I forgot to restart my PC. maybe
 that's why the update fails. Let's just restart the PC. Sure it'll work. And sure enough I found the start menu says update and restart. OK cool. I'm getting somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a few minutes, the update is done and Windows 10 has switched me to be using my Microsoft account rather than my local account. Why the *** would you do that????!!!!! I can't remember the password! I don't. It's not my login password, It's the email
 password which is more sofisticated and kept by 3rd party app. I don't remember this sh**t.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, calm down. there must be a way. A giant company can't be that stupid. There must be an alternative. Pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del to switch to the local account does not work, Safe mode does not work. Disconnecting from the internet and try to sign in an offline
 mode does not work. And finally, some black magic works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Boot from a bootable Windows 7, 8 or 10 DVD as if in the process of installing Windows</p>
<p>2. Press shift + F10 to bring up the command prompt</p>
<p>3. Type in regedit in the cmd console and hit enter</p>
<p>4. From regedit file menu, select Load Hive...</p>
<p>5. Browse to the correct partition that contains the Windows installation.</p>
<p>6. In the file name field type %windir%\system32\config\SAM and hit enter.</p>
<p>7. Name the Hive Test (or anything) and click ok.</p>
<p>8. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\test\SAM\Domains\Account\Users\000001F4</p>
<p>9. From the right side pane double-click the F entry</p>
<p>10. Edit the line that starts with 0038. The value next to 0038 is 11, replace it with 10.</p>
<p>11. Back in the Registry Editor, from the left side click on the name you gave to the hive you loaded earlier and from the file menu click unload Hive.</p>
<p>12. Restart the briked computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here I am. Wow. I've solved the problem which was to gain access to my computer after Microsoft switched the login to be using a Microsoft account. What! no. The update didn't install and I can't see the apps I installed in the start menu. Furthermore,
 searching from Cortona does not find them because they are not in the start menu. don't you know?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ah, I use firefox as well, in case it's interesting to you in expanding your privacy invasion plans. Firefox also updated itself and now it has disappeared from the start menu just like any self respecting app that gets installed on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What a bunch of donkies!!</p>

            <p>FYI the account screen that comes from Start Menu &gt; Settings (aka Metro window) is stuck for more than an hour loading the screen and the controls are not coming up.</p>
<p>The update screen is also stuck at 12%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe there is a problem with this version, shall I try another?</p>

<p>
</p><p>"From the user's standpoint, Windows 8 is a failure -- an awkward mishmash that pulls the user in two directions at once. Users attracted to the new touch-friendly Metro GUI will dislike the old touch-hostile desktop underneath. By the same token, users
 who rely on the traditional Windows desktop will dislike having to navigate Metro to find settings and apps they intuitively locate in Windows 7. Microsoft has moved the cheese."</p>

<h2>            How to measure the GPU usage &#37; for a process using the GPUView tool &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using GPUView tool to generate the GPU utilization graph . I am running log.cmd for few seconds and stopping it by again running the same log.cmd.</p>
<p>Once the .etl file generated i am loading it in the GPUView tool.</p>
<p>I need to measure the GPU usage % for a particular process.</p>
<p>I am able to see my process in the graph , but not sure which value i need to take.</p>
<p>I am able to see a string GPU=XXXXX&nbsp; at the right end of my process.Is this the value which i need to read ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Remesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>GPUView</strong> is a development tool designed to determine the performance of the graphics processing unit (GPU). It analyzes the performance with regard to direct memory access (DMA) processing and all other video processing on the hardware. For
 more information about using <strong>GPUView</strong>, you can refer to this <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/display/using-gpuview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Using GPUView">
<strong>documentation</strong></a>. If you have other questions about using the tool, I suggest posting it in
<strong>Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)</strong> forums for in-depth assistance. This forum is composed of developers who can cater to the complexity of your concern. Please post your concern in

<h2>            Forza Motorsport 7 - the game sometimes does not start</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>The game sometimes does not start (Sometimes the game starts normally, I do not understand that). One to two weekends back the game was allways normally started. Now, sometimes after I clicking on the game icon, the game logo will appear and after a few
 seconds the game will turn back to the windows desktop.&nbsp;The following two error messages appears in the Windows event viewer:</p>

</p><p>The first time I tried to reinstall the game-did not help. I also reinstalled the graphics card drivers, the visual C ++ packages - did not help. I also tried the clean boot windows - 1x started the game, the second time did not start.&nbsp;I also tried the tool
 to check and repair corrupted system files (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system</a>)
 - it did not help.&nbsp;The system windows 10 is up to date.</p>
<p>I'm probably not the only one to solve this problem, see <a href="https://forums.forzs.google.com/turn10_postst104377_-ANSWERED--Game-crashes-on-start-screen--PC.aspx?=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Skype for Business - Mac - Screen Sharing extremely slow lag</h2>
                    <p>I'm running the latest version of Skype for Mac for Business on a 15" tMBP on the latest Mac OS Version. &nbsp;When I start a screen sharing from a chat, it's extremely slow and takes about 10 seconds to "paint" a slide. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we do screen sharing during a lync conference call that was setup on the calendar, it works fine. &nbsp;I know it's not the network because we can recreate the issue if we connect directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember this was an issue in an earlier version of Skype but then was fixed. &nbsp;It looks like the issue is back again. &nbsp;Is this a known bug?</p>

<p>Hi Don, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue may occur due to the improper configuring of the wireless mouse on the computer. To ensure that this issue is properly addressed, we’d like to know if this the first time that you’ll use this device on your computer? If no, are there any changes
 made prior to this concern?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an initial recommendation, we suggest that you install Windows Update on your computer for us to further isolate the concern if this is caused by an outdated software. To do so, Select the
<strong>Start</strong> button, then select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> &gt;
<strong>Windows Update</strong>. If you want to check for updates manually, select
<strong>Check for updates</strong>. Once your software is already updated, restart the computer and check if the issue still persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We’re looking forward to your response. </p>

<p>Since you’ve verified that your Windows is up to date, we suggest rolling back the driver of your wireless mouse if this is available in its properties. To do so, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start</strong> menu and type in <strong>Device Manager</strong> and then select the first result.
</li><li>Right-click <strong>Mice and other pointing devices</strong> and select <strong>
Properties</strong>. </li><li>Go to the <strong>Driver</strong> tab and select <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong> and then click
<strong>YES</strong>.</li><li>Wait for the process to finish and once it’s done, restart your computer and check if the issue still persists.
</li></ol>
<p><br />
In the event that the Roll Back Driver is unavailable in mouse properties, we recommend that you update the drivers by going to the
<strong>Device Manager</strong> &gt; right-click <strong>Mice and other pointing devices</strong> &gt;
<strong>Update Driver Software</strong>. Select the option to get the latest drivers for your mouse and follow the instructions on the screen to complete the driver update. Once it’s done, restart your computer and check if the issue was resolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any other concerns, don’t hesitate to let us know. </p>

<h2>            System Service Exception Blue Screen error, BCCode&#58; 3b</h2>
                    Starting about 3 weeks ago, my Vista 64-bit machine started encountering a BSOD. I have encountered four crashes over the course of these 3 weeks. However, this does not happen very frequently as one point I went a week and a half without a crash. I ran
 MemTest86+ for 12 hours, with 10 passes completed with no reported errors.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Typically the crash happens when I have several programs open, which include a game such as DOTA 2, Spotify, Skype and Google Chrome.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have updated my network driver and I just updated my video card driver but it remains to be seen if that will help. Just looking for a straightforward list of things I can start going through, starting with the most common causes of this type of System

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BCCode: 3b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Cause</strong></p>
<p>This error has been linked to excessive paged pool usage and may occur due to user-mode graphics drivers crossing over and passing bad data to the kernel code.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have already updated the graphics card driver which did not help, you may uninstall it and reinstall the updated graphics card driver from manufacturer's website.</p>

            <p>Verizon has the driver support for SAMSUNG Galaxy S4.</p>
<p>I was able to get and install the driver. </p>
<p>(Note: these directions are for Windows 7. Windows 10 may have slightly different panel/clicks.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't installed the driver for your SAMSUNG&nbsp; on your development machine, you will not be able to do any Android debugging using your device. Instead you will need to install an emulator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instructions for installing an emulator OR&nbsp;the SAMSUNG device driver&nbsp;is covered in the Android Studio,&nbsp;in&nbsp; the &nbsp;developer tutorial.&nbsp;
<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you open up Computer Management, then expand Device Manager you will see your SAMSUNG device. I have the Galaxy S4 is model&nbsp; SCH-1545ZKDVZW...not to be confused with SCH - 1545PP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is no driver installed you will see this: <a href="https://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b106b218-fd00-49f7-929a-15d9cc14d76b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Contra to the instructions given in the Android Studio documentation, &nbsp;to find the correct driver from Microsoft and/or Samsung via auto-update...neither of those solutions worked for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to find the driver&nbsp;at Verizon's site. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The install actually took 2 runs through to install correctly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>First the Verizon installer ran some code the install the barebones:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a11be8bc-9af2-48f2-b426-0cf9cf0d8ed9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a11be8bc-9af2-48f2-b426-0cf9cf0d8ed9" /></a></p>
<p>But after that finished I still had the yellow alert on my device manager for the Samsung.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then&nbsp;I ran the&nbsp;Verizon Update Assistant.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a94f9430-5d2b-4091-8008-9b0324bcf069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a94f9430-5d2b-4091-8008-9b0324bcf069" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And the barebones install was updated by the upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07550161-76be-4809-b6c1-d8f1f2bff9cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07550161-76be-4809-b6c1-d8f1f2bff9cd" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The install is now complete. The alert is gone and the driver and ABD have been installed correctly.</p>

    <title>Odd problem with timeout error 1053 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopherpaquette  say:</h3>
<h2>            Odd problem with timeout error 1053</h2>
                    Hey everyone,<br />
<br />
So recently I've been trying to install iTunes but have been unable to do so thanks to the Apple Mobile Devices service "timing out" (error code 1053) during installation. What's weird about it is that there's no "time out" time when I try and start the service
 from the component services screen--I get the pop-up as immediately as I click 'start service'. I've tried clean booting and have the latest .net service pack.<br />

            <p>Hello Christopher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are facing issue while installing iTunes and getting error message/code "timeout error code 1053".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Windows Service Control Manager controls the state (i.e., started, stopped, paused, etc.) of all installed Windows services. By default, the Service Control Manager will wait 30,000 milliseconds (30 seconds) for a service to respond. However,
 certain configurations, technical restrictions, or performance issues may result in the service taking longer than 30 seconds to start and report ready to the Service Control Manager.
</p>
<div>By editing or creating the ServicesPipeTimeout DWORD value, the Service Control Manager timeout period can be overridden, thereby giving the service more time to start up and report ready to the Service.
<p>
</p><p><span>When a service starts, the service communicates to the Service Control Manager how long the service must have to start (the time-out period for the service). If the Service Control Manager does not receive a "service
 started" notice from the service within this time-out period, the Service Control Manager terminates the process that hosts the service. This time-out period is typically less than 30 seconds. If you do not adjust this time-out period, the Service Control
 Manager ends the process. To adjust this time-out period, follow these steps:</span><br />

            I followed the instructions but there was no effect. I don't think the service is&nbsp;<em>actually
</em>timing out, because the time out error pops up immediately when I try and start the service (in this case, Apple Mobile Devices); but I'm getting a time-out error for some reason, and it's preventing me from using and installing iTunes.

<h2>            Bluetooth headphone connected&#47;paired as keyboard</h2>
                    <p>I've got a 56S bluetooth headphone, and when i searching for the divice, it show up as a keyboard.</p>
<p>i was continuing paired, restart the computer, check the device, unpair, restart the pc, search again, but still the same.</p>
<p>I read about it, and the internet forums said it happens because the headset has buttons (volume up, volume down, answer calls etc.) , that's why the pc see it as a keyboard.</p>
<p>But nobody could solve this problem, i've spent hours to find the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On phone i can connect without problems and seen as a headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe any chance to change the Tool Category in the device manager? There i can see this device has input.keyboard category.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did many times, but the OS always installed the same driver. I've got some driver booster software as well, i was hoping it will find the good driver and fix it, but nothing changed. I really think that i must find where can i change the device category
 of the item deep inside the Windows.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. we suggest that you perform clean boot and try to reconnect the device. It is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. Also, it helps eliminate software conflicts or an update or when
 you run a program in Windows. Check this <em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Cause
<p>This error occurs when a user-mode subsystem, such as WinLogon or the Client Server Run-Time Subsystem (CSRSS), has been fatally compromised and security can no longer be guaranteed. In response, the operating system switches to kernel mode. Microsoft Windows
 cannot run without WinLogon or CSRSS. Therefore, this is one of the few cases where the failure of a user-mode service can shut down the system.</p>
<p>Mismatched system files can also cause this error. This can occur if you have restored your hard disk from a backup. Some backup programs might skip restoring system files that they determine are in use.</p>
Resolving the Problem
<p>Running the kernel debugger is not useful in this situation because the actual error occurred in a user-mode process.</p>
<p><em>Resolving an error in a user-mode device driver, system service, or third-party application:</em>
Because bug check 0xC000021A occurs in a user-mode process, the most common culprits are third-party applications. If the error occurred after the installation of a new or updated device driver, system service, or third-party application, the new software
 should be removed or disabled. Contact the manufacturer of the software about a possible update.</p>
<p>If the error occurs during system startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices. At the resulting Windows
<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, choose the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time. If this does not resolve the error, try manually removing the offending
 software. If the system partition is formatted with file allocation table (FAT), use an MS-DOS startup disk to gain access to the computer's hard disk. If the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename
 or delete the faulty software. If the faulty software is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you need to start the computer using the Recovery Console in order to access the file. If a newly installed piece if hardware is suspected, remove
 it to see if this resolves the issue.</p>
<p>Try running the Emergency Recovery Disk (ERD) and allow the system to repair any errors that it detects.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a mismatched system file problem:</em> If you have recently restored your hard disk from a backup, check if there is an updated version of the Backup/Restore program available from the manufacturer. Make sure the latest Windows Service Pack
 is installed.<br />

My generic bluescreen troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
You gave the error codes so the 1st part here is just in case they change while you are troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info that would
<br />
help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error information such as STOP
<br />
codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however there are other causes.<br />

You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or Recovery Options if your

system has that installed by the maker.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Use the utility above to check the minidump file and let us know what it says.<br />
<br />
Have you added new devices or updated drivers recently? Check in Windows Updates to see if any<br />
drivers have been updated just before this started to happen and since then. Changed antivirus,<br />
antispyware, or security programs lately?<br />
<br />
Update your drivers now to take that out of the equation and it may solve the issue.<br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your
<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site
<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software
<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

</p><p>On the bottom the sticker says: &nbsp;<strong>Windows 7 Pro OA</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the Windows 10 Pro x64 USB installer and tried to install a fresh copy of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the first step, the installer asks for a product key to activate Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I entered the key from the sticker and the installer said:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>This product key didn't work. &nbsp;Please check it and try again. &nbsp;</strong><strong>Error code 0xc004f050</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I checked it 3 times and I typed it in correctly but it still WILL NOT activate? &nbsp;This is very frustrating. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This product key is valid because I just re-installed a fresh copy of Windows 7 Pro x64 and activated it successfully.</p>
<p>

            I have this problem as well with using a Windows 8 disk. &nbsp;I have tried all day and each time it has come up with this error. &nbsp;I've been told by a friend he had this happen and then eventually it worked. &nbsp;For me, that isn't good enough. &nbsp;Microsoft needs
 to fix this ASAP.

</p><p>Seems you can't perform initial upgrade with the usb or disc option.&nbsp; Ran into it this morning so I instead used upgrade computer option iinstead of creating a bootable usb or disc</p>
