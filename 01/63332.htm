    <title>HDMI and 3.5mm audio at the same time&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mtpease  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI and 3.5mm audio at the same time&#63;</h2>
                    Right now, I have&nbsp;a 46"&nbsp;LCD&nbsp;TV hooked up with a VGA cable and a 3.5 mm audio cable. &nbsp;I have a second TV, a 40" CRT HDTV hooked up with an HDMI cable. I'm running them as dual monitors.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 will only allow me to select one audio device (right now the onboard audio.) I can easly change between the two, but I would really like to run both at the same time.<br />
<br />
Is this possible in windows?<br />
<br />
If not, is there any 3rd party software that can accomplish this?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I understand all of that. But what I'm unable to get is this</p>
<p>How come the " blocking " started to affect everyone in UAE all of a sudden?? &nbsp;ISP providers claim it has been blocked for years now so we shouldn't have been able to make calls at all. But i could. For the past 1.5 years. I'm sure thousands of users in
 UAE could as well.. the whole problem started right after the upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't get me wrong. I've always been a Microsoft lover. but I'm not liking the approach in which this one's been handled. And I've checked a lot of other forums as well.. there are many who are based out of UAE and are facing the same issue. The issue being
 started after the new upgrade.&nbsp;</p>

As already explained, they manage their networks, not Skype.&nbsp; They can modify their systems as they see fit at any time.&nbsp; These modifications can affect the quality of service in that area from no service to inhibited service in the manner already described
 in the links provided. Discord (another VoIP) worked in the UAE until recently as well.&nbsp; Since the issues are isolated in an area that has a known track record of blocking for years,&nbsp; pointing the blame square at Skype baffles my mind.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Not pointing. I just want to get a clear understanding of the picture here. But im definitely baffled as well about it. One of my friend here was able to call to India for an hour without any interruption. Same ISP provider. How can that happen?! If it's
 blocked, isn't it supposed to work the same way with everyone atleast in the same area like you have mentioned. But it isn't happening that way.&nbsp;</p>

            The best practical example I can give you is that of a bouncer or door person.&nbsp; The owner of several night clubs hires bouncers and provides then with parameters of who to let in, when to let them in and what type of customers have priority over others.&nbsp;
 Each bouncer at the same location or different locations will use their own judgement, not every person will get in every day and the people that got in one day/instance, may be rejected that next day/instance.

</p><p>Well the ISP providers are claiming they haven't done anything to unblock skype and it is still blocked whereas I am able to make calls since yesterday without any interruptions. Checked with a lot of colleagues and friends and they claim the same. So I
 am forced to be content enough since its working now and hope it continues to work without any issues.&nbsp;</p>

                    As it says in the title - I installed windows 8.1 and now none of my Apps work. I get a bar message across the screen saying I need to contact my system administrator about repairing or reinstalling the apps. My store app does not work and I can't get
 into settings.

            I ended up having to reinstall Windows 8 and then do the update - don't forget to make sure you have all of the updates for Windows 8 installed first though. I think this may have been my problem. Wish you all the best in trying to get 8.1 up and running.
 It looks really nice and seems to be running smoothly.

<p>
</p><p>I have gone from Windows 8 to 8.1 on an Asus mini laptop, I followed all the upgrades before the store would allow me to upgrade to 8.1. Now every icon on my start menu has no link, store, Microsoft explorer, xbox music live, the list goes on.

<p>
</p><p><span>If not, please try that step and check if it helps. If the issue persists, I would suggest you to re-register Windows Store app and check if it helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 - Winlogon error &#60;SessionEnv&#62;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I've disabled the Remote Desktop feature of Windows 7 Professional (64-bit, SP1) with the following settings:<br />
<br />
System Properties -&gt; Remote -&gt; Don't allow connections to this computer [Checked]<br />
Services -&gt; Remote Desktop Configuration [Manual]<br />
<br />
However, I'm now getting the following warning in the Event Viewer:<br />
<br />
Event 6000, Winlogon<br />
The winlogon notification subscriber &lt;SessionEnv&gt; was unavailable to handle a notification event.<br />
<br />
How can I eliminate this warning?<br />
<br />
The only other warnings in the Event Viewer are related to VMWare Player 5.0.2 (known lack of USB 3.0 support for Windows hosts).<br />
<br />
Not sure if it's related, but I'm also using Windows Classic theme with the Desktop Window Manager service disabled.<br />
<br />
I've tried the suggestions in this <b><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/windows-7-the-winlogon-notification-subscriber/f6959291-8a72-47f6-8625-9a6df876fd03">thread</a></b>, but they didn't solve my problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

Hello,<br />
<br />
I navigated to Windows Task Manager -&gt; Processes -&gt; Show processes from all users.<br />
<br />
On the Services tab, the status of "SessionEnv" is already identified as "stopped".<br />
<br />
The Windows Event Viewer is still reporting the following:<br />
<br />
Event 6000, Winlogon<br />
The winlogon notification subscriber &lt;SessionEnv&gt; was unavailable to handle a notification event.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?<br />

    <title>Microsoft Edge Connection Problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge Connection Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi, <br />
Two days ago I got the anniversary update and it worked really fine but yesterday I had an issue with MS Edge connecting to the internet saying "Your DNS might be unavailable" so I searched and found a&nbsp;solution that&nbsp;worked&nbsp;like the following:<br />
<strong>-Open run</strong><br />
<strong>-Type cmd.exe and click OK</strong><br />
<strong>-Type the following with "Enter" after each command</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; -ipconfig/flushdns</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;-ipconfig/release</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; -ipconfig/renew</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; -exit<br />
</strong>Today I had another issue that I can't reach this page to which I luckily&nbsp;found a solution too&nbsp;through changing my Internet Protocol Version 4 like the following:</p>
<p><strong>-Go to Network Connections</strong></p>
<p><strong>-The go to properties of the adapter.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-And double Click Internet Protocol Version 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>-And use Preferred DNS as 8.8.8.8 and Alternative DNS as 8.8.4.4</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>Now I'm concerned what might happen tomorrow and whether I'll find a solution to it. So is that related to the anniversary update? Because the previous build was working perfectly. Will there be any other problems concerning MS Edge? And if so, will
 there be new updates&nbsp;that deal with all the problems that might face anyone after upgrading&nbsp;to the anniversary update?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It's back again and this time it's so frustrating that I haven been trying to solve it for like seven hours but nothing works. It also seems to be affecting WiFi because I don't know how but my phone, that I'm using now, couldn't function properly until
 I shutdown the laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you answer quickly because I'm completely paralysed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For us to isolate the issue, please provide us below information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the exact Skype version installed on your brother's device? What is the device his using to Skype?</p>
<p>2. Are you referring to the video call button of your brother being greyed out?</p>
<p>3. Does this happen to one contact or multiple contacts in Skype?</p>
<p>4. What is the type of Internet connection you're using with Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check for the exact Skype version:</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to refer to the article to know about Mail app:</p>
<p><b>Mail app for Windows: Frequently asked questions</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/mail-app-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/mail-app-faq</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may not be able to put the Mail app on desktop. However, I would also suggest you to refer to the link for downloading Windows Live Essentials:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-home</a></p>

            <p>You can still install 3rd party programs such as Thunderbird, Windows Live Mail, and Outlook to run email clients other than the mail App.&nbsp; At least you can with the regular version of Windows 8.&nbsp; It does not appear to be possible with the Surface RT machines,
 but that is unclear to me, since I don't have access to one.</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you access Microsoft account ? Is it through app or on machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft doesn't access anyone's personal information. We cannot change any administrators ID or username since it is related to that particular person.</p>

<h2>            Printer Problem</h2>
                    <p>When I want to print anything, the box opens so I can select pages to print and select which printer to use. &nbsp;I no longer have the option to select a printer. All I can do is save the item. &nbsp;I can not print anything.</p>
<p>I've tried to print after I save, but same situation happens with no printer available to print. I have 2 printers available, one wired the other wifi. &nbsp;They are located in my Devices.</p>

            Hello, 
<br />Try reinstalling the Printer.
<br />Right-click Start and select Run.
<br />In the Run dialog box, type in control printers and press OK.
<br />Locate your printer in the Printers section, Right click it and select Remove device.
<br />Restart your PC.
<br />If you have a setup media of the Printer driver(This is usually a CD or Setup program supplied with the Printer), run the utility and let the Printer Install.
<br />If you do not have a setup media, try adding a printer manually using "add a printer" button in the menu bar. It should automatically detect and Install the Printer.
<br />After the Printer Installs, try printing a test page to see if it works as desired.
<br />Retry the task again.

    <title>Partition Recovery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cyril gabriel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Partition Recovery</h2>
                    <p>Okay so i was messing with Diskpart and Partition wizards to make one of my partition active/inactive and i even messed with virtual memory (pagefile),</p>
<p>then all of sudden i login and 3 of my partitions disappeared then i panicked and realised that all the partitions where unallocated (241GB) in the disk management and i so thought it could be recovered until i used many softwares and really messed and so
 what happen was i uses this live cd active @ undelete to try to recover my partition and after the process completed and i went back unfortunately and the scan results were save so i tried to recover again and it says there is no unallocated free space to
 restore your partition and then i went mad ,booted back to windows disk management and it say free space (241GB Green Label) and now i really don't know how to recover the partition so i need you help please ....<br />
but when i use 3rd party software it still says unallocated space 241GB , its only in windows that it has turned to free space and in the active @ undelete live cd it shows nothing i can't even scan unaclloacted free space to recover the partition</p>

<p>Hi Charlotte,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One step that we could try is to manually re-install the Audio Enhancement, and see if it helps. First, go to HP's website and download the latest Audio Enhancement installer (IDT) and save it to your Downloads folder. Once done, follow the remaining steps
 below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Search for <strong>Control Panel</strong> via Cortana search and hit the <strong>
Enter</strong> key.</li><li>Open the <strong>Device Manager</strong> and click <strong>Sound, Video and Game controllers</strong>.</li><li>Right click the IDT device and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>Restart your PC.</li><li>Once your PC restarts, it should automatically load all audio driver. Let it complete the process.</li><li>Go to the Downloads folder, right click on the IDT installer and select <strong>
Run as administrator</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Once complete, check if you have the enhancements back and let us know the outcome.</p>

            <p>When you buy the license from the Microsoft Store, you can skip getting installation disc, the product key will be emailed to you. Once you receive, just use the product key to activate your installation of Windows 7.</p>

<p>How to do it:</p>
<p>Click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows Activation</p>
<p>Click the link <strong>Change product key</strong></p>
<p>Enter the product key you bought from the Microsoft Store (should be emailed to you)</p>
<p>Then click Next to activate over the Internet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you encounter problems activating by Internet, try phone activation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;How to activate Windows 7 manually (activate by phone)<br />

            just a note:
<div><br />
<div>
<p><span>Product keys are never sold separately by Microsoft. If you see a listing on an auction site, online classified ad, or other online page advertising product keys for sale, it’s a good indication that the keys are likely stolen or counterfeit. If you
 were to purchase and use a stolen or counterfeit product key to activate Windows installed on your PC, the key may not work for activation, may already be in use on another PC, or it might be blocked from use later by Microsoft when the key is reported stolen.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Purchase from the Microsoft store is your only source if you do not want install media. My concern is did you get your windows from a legitimate source.</span></p>

<div>Yes , i am receiving non-genuine message.</div>

<div>I didnt buy this laptop personally, this was delivered via fed-ex from Saudi.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried contacting my laptop manufacturer but they said they dont install win7 pro in their satellite models. so i guess this win7 was pre-installed using a microsoft installation disc most likely from &nbsp;the store where it was bought.</div>

</blockquote>
<br />
<br />
You are using the default key - it can not be activated. It looks like someone installed Windows 7 Professional and never activated it, or gave you a key.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contact the seller and see if they will sort it out. If you don't have a key you will need to buy one.<br />

The SFC scan fixed this issue in your first report but you still have issues. You may have received this from a bogus seller.

<div>For what version and edition of windows is on your COA? do not state the product key.</div>

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Blue screen &#34;SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION&#34; win32.sys</h2>
                    <p>Having upgraded to windows 10, for 2 weeks all seemed fine, absolute rubbish photo editor, but otherwise fine. Then while in the middle of a project in photoshop. The computer switches off, without warning saying urgent updates required. &nbsp;When I got the
 computer back on &nbsp;there,s no Carolla or what ever her name is. To find programs I have to go through the control panel and I can't put photos into what looks like windows 3 photo editor, because the photos have too many bytes. Now I have the computer switching
 itself off because System.Service.Exception win32 base.sys &nbsp;Microsoft seems to have washed its hands of me, they should sort out the problem not ask me to ask other poor unfortunate people with the same problem to share our frustration and waste our time.
 I have read 10 different solutions to the Sytem Service ****, I've seen at least a dozen programs that will fix my computer all from £50 upwards. &nbsp;Microsoft I'm angry, sort out my problem and everyone that you've messed up. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are facing blue screen issue. Sorry for the inconvenience caused with Windows updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. "I can't put photos into what looks like windows 3 photo editor", are you referring to Windows 10 Photos app?</p>
<p>2. Are you not able to use taskbar search and start menu?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bug Check 0x3B: SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION:</p>
<p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff558949%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff558949%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Look in Device Manager to see if any devices are marked with the exclamation point (!).&nbsp;if you see any driver with exclamation point (!), try updating the related driver to check if it helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may refer to the below article on how to update the drivers in Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/how-to-update-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/how-to-update-drivers</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 2: As you are facing this issue after installing Windows updates, let us try to perform a system restore and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>System restore: This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Restore points are generated when you install a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you
<span>create a restore point manually</span>. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the section “Use installation media to restore or reset your PC” in the following article to perform a system restore:</span></p>
<p><span>Recovery options in Windows&nbsp;10</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while system
 restoring. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead
 to loss of important files as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing a system restore, you may refer to the below article to block the update.</p>

<h2>            How do I get past the EULA during install of Windows XP&#63;</h2>
                    <p><em>Unable to install Windows XP Home Edition</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am upgrading my PC. All new case, PSU, mobo and CPU, new SATA HDD, and transferred/installed previous optical drives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to install Win XP Home, using my original installation disk, on my new PC. The CD-Rom goes to "Windows Setup" and asks if I want to:</p>
<p>Install Windows XP Home Edition, press ENTER</p>
<p>Repair a Windows XP installation, using Recovery Console, press R</p>
<p>or, exit without installing Windows XP, press F3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I press ENTER. After a second or two, up pops the EULA screen. However, there is no way to proceed past the EULA info. You can page up or page down. Read the entire EULA agreement. However, there is no apparent way to proceed past that. If I hit ESC, the
 program (setup, EULA screen) is exitted, stating that the computer will reboot in 15 seconds and that Windows XP was not installed. It will reboot, and eventually, through the same actions, I get back to the EULA screen, where it just does the same thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why can I not install my original Windows XP Home Edition (SP2) on my newly built PC?</p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp; I updated to windows10 on 1/8/15 &amp; lost the use of 7 letter keys &amp; was left having to use the on-screen keyboard, living with this for 14 days and unable to get a solution to this problem i have now just returned my Laptop back to Windows 8.1 and the
 keyboard is now working OK -( goodbye windows 10 &amp; hello and welcome back windows 8.1 i say) i will miss windows 10 but its no good if you lose the use of your keyboard.</p>
<p>(UPDATE) I have just updated my windows 8.1 system &amp; windows update wants to install windows 10 ( i hope i can stop it)-I also have 5 family members who now will not be updating to windows 10.Lets hope Microsoft don't force it on us!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further Update</p>
<p>Now that i am back using windows 8.1 &amp; the keyboard is working fine-i have checked the keyboard driver in 8.1 &amp; its version 6.3.9600.17808-The driver that windows 10 brought with it is version 10.0.10240.16384 &amp; the keyboard didn't function properly.</p>
<p>I do want to update to windows 10 so i hope Microsoft can sort this problem out.</p>
<p>P.S both driver versions were from Microsoft</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another Update</p>
<p>Today the 30/09/2015 I thought i might try windows 10 again - this time all went well &amp; my previous&nbsp; problem with the keyboard (the loss of 7 letters) didn't happen.ive been using it for a few hours now &amp; all seems well.</p>

            <p>I have upgraded my windows 7 to 10 and now I can't use my keyboard.</p>
<p>all the advice I read hear still requires me to click a key or upgrade drivers, I can not do anything as the keyboard is completely locked out. &nbsp;I am using a microsoft wireless keyboard and mouse with a usb connection. &nbsp;how can I get my keyboard back? &nbsp;I
 was finally able to get the mouse to work after a number of shut downs. &nbsp;This is the strangest and most frustrating upgrade ever.</p>

<h3> a dirty lurker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dead Space 2</h2>
                    
<p>I completed Dead Space 2 on the 2nd hardest difficulty and it said that I had unlocked the + save game type.&nbsp; It never actually gave me the option to start a game that way so I started another run through on easy and have only just realised that the stacked
 achievemnts havent carried over ie the severing limbs cheevo and the decompressor cheevo.&nbsp; Gutted cos now Im gonna have to do another run.&nbsp; Is there any reason why I was never given the + game option??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Try loading up the save where you had beaten the game. If you have to, just beat it again and make sure to save over that file. As soon as you do that, the game should let you start a New Game+. If I remember correctly, if you beat the game and save but
 turn off your console before starting a New Game+ you have to load up that save file so it will give you the option.</p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I have a Brother HL-2140 connected to my Windows Vista-32 Business PC via USB.&nbsp; Prints great...it is shared.&nbsp; I have a second Windows Vista-32 Business PC and installed the shared printer and it prints fine.&nbsp; I have a laptop with Windows 7-64 Home
 Premium and I'm trying to install the shared printer.&nbsp; I have downloaded all current drivers via Brother's website and used both disks that came with the printer (All OS's on one disk and Windows 7 as a separate disk).&nbsp; I've tried installing all versions of
 drivers to be sure.&nbsp; I've plugged the printer directly into the laptop and the printer prints fine.<br />
<br />
When trying to install the shared printer, I physically point the laptop to the correct *.INF file, but it always says that "Windows could not find a suitable driver..."<br />
<br />
Just as a side note...Brother states on their site that the HL-2140 is Windows 7 compatible.<br />
<br />
I have seen many posts that contains 7 and XP issues...but I have not found any post for 7-64 to Vista-32 sharing.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!!!<br />

<p>Hi CSievers,</p>
<p>It's possible there is an issue with your User Account, can you try making another withe admin rights to see if you receive the same error:</p>

<p>Also, here is some additional information from Brother's website about your printer and Windows 7:</p>
