<h2>            Windows 8&#47;10 Webcam keeps blinking</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with my built-in webcam in my Asus N750JK notebook running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first bought the notebook the webcam used to work flawlessly. Then, all of a suddend, it started blinking when switching on and didn't worked any more. Sometimes it can stay on for a couple of a seconds and then shuts down. I have tried with both
 Skype and Microsoft Camera app. I looked around but didn't find any solution, so I waited for Windows 10 to come out hoping it would have fixed the problem, but it didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The system identifies it as USB2.0 HD UVC WebCam and reports it works correctly, drivers are Microsoft default ones (ksthunk.sts and usbvideo.sys). The Asus website doesn't report any driver for the camera. I've already tried to
 uninstall and reinstall it, with no success. The system says the drivers are up to date.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Windows Camera app reports the following error after a couple of flashes. Traduced it says:
<em>An error occurred. Ensure the camera is connected and no other application is using it.</em></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">What should I do?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, I have already tried those steps, did it again now, but I'm still having the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, on the Asus support page for my PC there's no webcam driver listed and default driver information don't help me identifying the webcam manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried to reinstall the device, but the problem still persists. The Windows Event Logger gives the following events/errors:

            <p>I also have the same problem but non of your advice has solved the problem, the only difference for me is that I have an ASUS N751JK (running on Windows 10)</p>
<p>On Skype calls it is possible to see myself when I tilt my screen down. But once I tilt the screen to my face the webcam turns on and off... Yeah, I already made the joke of saying that it cannot handle my ugly face xD. But this issue stays is getting bothering
 and I would like to fix it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the steps as below and check if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unplug the laptop if charging</p>
<p>Remove the battery (seek help from expert/manufacturer if you are unable to)</p>

            <p>So, since someone else has this problem too, I'll report here what I've found.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>It's a driver error</strong></span> for sure and since Asus doesn't give any driver for the webcam, I'll say it's Microsoft business to fix it, because it's their own driver which is faulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>I've formatted the whole PC performing a fresh install of Windows 10</strong></span> not long ago and I've tested the webcam in more stages during the reconfiguration (right after installation, after updates
 and after hardware/driver configuration) <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>and it never worked</strong></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>it works flawlessly with Linux in live</strong></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, it seems clear that it's a Microsoft problem. I'm willing to do tests if Microsoft engineers need help in fixing this bug (I've already posted a system log too).</p>

            <p>Thanks for taking time to do this. As I tried to fix this issue I ended up being failing. My webcam turns off when I tilt my screen apparently, it does not matter on what angle it is. Once I move it from its previous space it turns off and doesn't want to
 recognize the webcam. When I try to open it again it will start blinking on and off indicating that the webcam is there but keeps disconnecting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes this is a driver issue, next to having this issue another issue is my microphone that doesn't pick up sound too well, I have put all microphone levels in Realtek Audio Manager on the highest, but when I talk loud, it only reconizges my voice until 10%
 when previously on my old ASUS laptop runned on Windows 8.1 it would be around 70%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to download a driver other than RealTek and at first it seemed to work, my voice became louder but after the next day at some point my audio playback stopped working, no input or output.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a final, my display driver often stops working, it does notify that it recovered itself, but sometimes bothers me when I am simply using Microsoft Word.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;reseted everything back to default and came with the conclusion that the drivers in the "audio,&nbsp;video and game controller" are the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this brings more information to the problem and a closer step to a solution.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I would suggest you to look for any pending update to be installed. Install the updates and restart the computer. If the issue still persists, visit the computer manufacturer's support website and install all the latest drivers available for
 the same computer model as yours. Restart the computer and check.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. I'll wait for updates.</p>
<p>In the meantime, for those who have the same problem as me with the <strong>Microphone</strong>; I found
<strong>a temporary fix!</strong></p>
<p>1) Type "Device Manager" in your Search Windows and press enter.</p>
<p>2) Open "Sound, video and game controllers" and it should open a small list.</p>
<p>3) Right click on "RealTek High Definition Audio Device" and press on "Update Driver Software...".</p>
<p>4) Press on "Browse my computer for browser software".</p>
<p>5) Press on "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer".</p>
<p>6) Select "High Definition Audio Device" and press "Next".</p>
<p>7) It will ask you to restart your computer, press "No".</p>
<p>8) Type "Change device installation settings" in your Search Windows and press enter.</p>
<p>9) Select the Second Option, "No, let me choose what to do" and "Never install driver software from Windows Update" per below.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This SHOULD prevent the driver from updating to the Realtek driver on reboot.</p>
<p>If the microphone does not improve within 10minutes automatically, I suggest you restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the <strong>Webcam </strong>issue; my webcam only disconnects when I tilt it as I stated before. So as long as I won't move my laptop screen I will be fine until someone finds a solution or until a new Windows Update / Driver Update
 will arrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will let you know more when I found a better solution for both problems.</p>

            Hey Joe.    I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There's a registry change here to disable Cortana, updated to specify Windows Search, which you can try to see if it gives the results you want:  <a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/disable-turn-off-cortana-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/disable-turn-off...</a>
<br />
<br />It should be easy to reverse but just in case set a System Restore point first:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allow me to clarify further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - Cortana is disabled as you can see in the Group Policy Editor screenshot.&nbsp; *Cortana has been shut off.*</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 - However, 'Web Search' keeps appearing even though I have 'Enabled' selected as you also can see in the Group Policy Editor screenshot.&nbsp; When 'Enabled' is selected 'Web Search' is supposed to be shut off as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**These settings worked until the April 2018 update was installed.&nbsp; The link to the ghacks website has further clarification about this 'Web Search' problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you saying there is a problem with the Group Policy Editor?&nbsp; Is that the reason 'Web Search' won't shut off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Joe</p>

            Those policies are broken on the Pro version of Windows 10 April 2018 Update. While there are some who think this is just a bug that will be fixed, it's obviously an attempt by Microsoft to increase traffic to Bing. Maybe they will fix it if there is enough
 feedback but I wouldn't hold my breath. Each web search result is a hit for Bing and the more hits they get, the more they can charge for ads.<br />
<br />
I haven't allowed the April update to infest my laptop yet so I don't have hands-on knowledge, but this article has a set of registry modification that they claim will turn off web search results despite the broken group policies.<br />
<br />
https://news.softpedia.com/news/how-to-block-web-search-in-windows-10-april-2018-update-521646.shtml<br />
<br />
Personally, I disable all things related to the Cortana/Edge/Bing virus and use Classic Shell.

<p>Hi Byron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure glad you stopped by.&nbsp; Clearly, you understand what the problem is.&nbsp; As you know, I already had the Settings in the GP Editor set to the correct parameters.&nbsp; So, I went to the Softpedia web page your provided the link to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the Registry changes I made as that article described. (If the screenshot&nbsp;is too small to clearly see, let me know and I'll rework it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab2e06f4-177b-4405-927c-407e0fb3dde5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab2e06f4-177b-4405-927c-407e0fb3dde5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, still no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f8dbc9a1-ff95-4ed4-878a-1ac7eefdcc6c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f8dbc9a1-ff95-4ed4-878a-1ac7eefdcc6c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's quite frustrating.&nbsp; BTW, when Bing was first introduced I gave it a try.&nbsp; Occasionally, I still use it, but the verdict is the same:&nbsp;
<strong>But It's Not Google.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Joe</p>

            Hi Mitch.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Homegroup is removed in Version 1803.  
<br />
<br />What's working most for network detection issues caused by Version 1803 is here:  <a href="https://windowsunplugged.blog/2018/03/27/network-computers-no-longer-present-in-file-explorer-on-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsunplugged.blog/2018/03/27/networ...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over these steps to make sure File Sharing is set up correctly:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>
<br />
<br />There are Changes to file sharing over a network in Windows 10:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4092694/windows-10-changes-to-file-sharing-over-a-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/409269...</a>

<br />
<br />This is the latest fix that's working for Version 1803 breaking networks.  Please try it and report back:   
<br />
<br />- shut all computer and network gear down then start again. 
<br />- Try browsing to some of the computers manually, press Windows key + R, type: \\computername, hit Enter
<br />- Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />1. Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them to Automatic (Delayed Start).
<br />2. When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />If not then start over and set it up again:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>

<h2>            ACPI.sys have high CPU load on ntoskrnl.exe</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I noticed that my laptop's fan often kick in when idling or when doing light work, and that's when I found that System is having a relatively high CPU usage (~15%, not much I know, but it's enough to make my laptop's fans running like crazy and it takes
 up at least one whole CPU logical processor). Restart often fix the problem, but this high idle load would even return after starting up the laptop.</p>

</p><p>Upon checking with Process Explorer, I found that ACPI.sys is using a lot of CPU threads. That's as far as I can diagnose, and I don't know how to troubleshoot this problem further. I need your help!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am the only user of this account. I am not a child account, and I have no child accounts to add. However, for some reason I am being blocked by the family safety option and cannot access Google, YouTube, or any other major site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: How do I access these sites or turn off the family safety option? I understand that it may have something to do with the family safety option, but after trying everything I have no idea how to turn it off or change it so that I can access
 them.</p>

<p>I see you've had your disc cleaned, but have you tried a different copy of the game? If not, see if you can borrow a friend's copy, to see if that makes any difference.

<div>
<div>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have question. A telephone company installed a T3 connection to connect two of our offices. They stated they have tested the connection between their devices at each office and the connection is communicating successfully. They stated we can now connect one
 end of an ethernet cable into their device and connect the other end of the ethernet cable to our device. My question is, can we simply attach a computer to the ethernet cable at each office and ensure they are both on the same subnet ? Then can we ping from
 one computer to the other across the T3 connection to ensure communication is successful ? If yes, do I need to enter a Gateway and Primary DNS (although there is no DNS Server at this moment).&nbsp; One of the computers is Windows XP and the other computer is
 Windows 7.&nbsp; Or must we connect a router or firewall with a Public IP to the ethernet cable at each office ?<br />
<br />
Your help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

            I have had the same problem with Win 7 64. I spoke to Canon Tech Support and after an hour during which we tested various things I was told the the problem was with Windows and I should contact Microsoft. I tried creating a new profile which fixed the
 problem for about a week, then it came back again! The issue may be associated with Windows Update but I am not sure. On this last go around I created a new profile, then copied in the folders and files from the corrupted profile one at a time to see when
 the problem would start again. After carefully copying files, backing up, testing Mp Navigator, and if necessary restoring the last good setup I discoved that the following file was causing the problem:<br />
<br />
C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\App Data\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Network Shortcuts\My Web Sites on MSN<br />
<br />
Note: This file was not present in my new profile. Also, the icon has the shortcut marker on it, but explorer says it is a folder. There is no file extension.<br />
<br />
I eventually copied ALL of the other data from the bad profile to the new one and MP Navigator still worked! I then deleted the offending file from the bad profile and MP Navigator started working there too!<br />
<br />
I then reconfigured all of my software and started IE etc. for the first time while watching the Network Shortcuts folder. The offending file has not reappeared yet. I made a shortcut to this location so I can keep an eye on it to see when it appears again.<br />
<br />
Hopefully someone at CANON or Microsoft will fix this "corrupted" profile issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />

            Hey GregDaro,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!<br />
<br />
The issue could be related to a corrupt user profile, since you’ve stated in your post that the program works fine in the other profile you’ve created.
<br />
<br />
Refer the link below for more details on fixing a corrupt user profile:<br />

<h2>            Name and Shame a Hacker &#58;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Im not entirely sure about naming people on this forum so i wont. As many people know World at War is a bit of a hack fest, but i dont think people should be getting away with it. I would like to enjoy playing this game without every other lobby being filled
 with invincible flying soldiers who get dogs if they get a 0 killstreak, and those dogs last forever. As is customary i filed a complaint against the user for system tampering, i believe that is the appropriate action, but i am uncertain as to how many people
 do report hackers and whether a player with one complaint is put to the back of the queue, so i thought to record the hacker with my pvr and put it on youtube. I figured that other people who wish to remove this menace may want to take the time to view my
 evidence and file a report of their own based on that, so that these hackers' time invading and fun ruining actions, on a game we paid good money to play, is kept to a minimum. I also wondered if providing video evidence on the xbox forum may speed up the
 verification process for the banning team so they dont waste as much time trying to verify whether the guy is a hacker or someone who just annoyed a person.</p>
<p>I double checked the forum rules and i dont think i am breaking any doing this, but if i im i apologise, i wasnt aware, please delete this post if that's the case. Anyway here is the youtube video evidence:</p>

 someone based on evidence that can be altered. &nbsp;They need to be 100% sure. &nbsp;Which is why it takes longer to see these people banned than we like to see.<br />
<br />
Modders, cheaters, hacker, whatever you like to call them are a blight on online gaming (not just Call of Duty), but you need to allow the Policy Enforcement Team time to use their own back-end tools to gather their own evidence.<br />

<p>Thanks for the info, part of my reason for doing this was i was unsure as to the official method of checking the legitimacy of claims et.c., Although i dont entirely see how the video i made could potentially be mocked up, i understand completely. I guessed
 that naming and shaming might not be allowed which is why i havent put the persons GT in this post, it's up to you whether you click on an external link so i guess im okay?</p>
<p>Would i be right in thinking that complaints are anonymous? I file a lot of complaints just cuz i bump into a lot of hackers in CoD4 and WaW and make a habit of reporting them, but i didnt want my account to have a mark on it because it looked like i was
 just spamming complaints lol. </p>

<p>Complaints are anonymous, as far as I am aware. Ignore the 'hackers' who might claim they can track you down for complaining or whatever other trash they come up with, because it's not real. The complaints lodged against someone cannot be seen by them, you'll
 be pleased to know. It's possible to mock videos up, and while it is hard to do, it is amazing what some people are prepared to do in situations. I'm not sure if it's considered acceptable to have shared the video since it still leaves people able to find
 another player who has been named and shamed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The closest thing that you could do for a little 'crusade', is probably to act as eyes and ears for the XBLPET. If you get into a lobby with hackers, send a report to the Policy Enforcement Team via the File Complaint option on your console and you've done
 the best job you personally can. It's a satisfying feeling to be able to report someone and let them be handled by the rules they're gleefully ignoring in order to gain a temporary advantage.</p>

<p>Oh im not worried about threats lol, i havent got them. I usually do inform people that they have been reported tho just to see if they stop out of fear lol, it was more that it isnt uncommon that i file mebs 10 complaints in one sitting of CoD4 or WaW if
 i bump into that many people who have hacked and i was mildly concerned that having that many complaints from one person may raise an issue of its own lol.</p>
<p>On a side note, I had been filing complaints on CoD for those people who have no level emblem and do not rank up as usual within the game, i.e. a level 1 getting 12 kills and still being level
 1 at the end of the match. Clearly this is due to some abnormal activity on their GT, so i report them, but one of them told me he got "infected" or "hacked" or something and it wasnt his doing. Obv people who break the ToS are prone to lying and denying wrongdoing
 but is it possible that these people have been unwillingly "infected" or is it them being silly and joining lobbies willingly that they shouldnt? Should i still consider reporting them?</p>
<p>Thanks guys</p>

<p>Edit: On a side note, any job openings on the XBLPET Team? lol, i think i'd be a good enforcer :P</p>

<p>Oh, they're not necessarily lying. It isn't unheard of for someone to be reset in a modded lobby which gives them stupid amounts of XP requirements to go from Rank 1 to Rank 2 (think about ten times the XP needed to get from Rank 1, 0 Prestige to Rank 55,
 10th Prestige). It basically makes the game unplayable, but you should still consider making a report if there is something else happening (eg. they are invincible and impervious to any damage inflicted). If you're in a modded lobby you're recommended to Dashboard
 it or turn the console off and on to prevent mods like that impacting on your account. The 'no level' emblem is a bit harder to pinpoint though. It's known by the community as 11th Prestige as it's a blank prestige the game considers higher than 10th for whatever
 reason. I don't know if you can be pushed to it from one match or if you have to knowingly prestige. If it's like World at War you can be moved to it from any rank already.</p>

<p>Okay i'll bear that in mind, thanks. Obv its probably still worth reporting. If they were just unfortunate then any investigation wont end in their banning anyway, but i suppose its good to give the team the heads up so that they can look into these problems.
 Yeah i heard that you should always dashboard or power down your console if you end in a badly hacked lobby, I just remember that being good advice when there were all those 1 million xp per kill lobbies on MW2 that you had to dashboard so you didnt end up
 keeping the XP if you didnt want to be super levelled. Wow, never heard of this 11th Prestige thing :S Thanks for the info.</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I have windows 7 home premium 64bit and I have a problem with Maplestory</p>
<p>the RPG game. I have downloaded everything for the game and I have also gone</p>
<p>into properties and ticked the box that says run in XPService Pack 3. Ive also ticked</p>
<p>the box that says run as admin. Now, I try to run the program and its fine up until i get a message</p>
<p>that says the program has compatibility issues. Furthermore, it says that the program is not compatible</p>
<p>with my version of windows. Can anyone please let me know what I should do. Thank you.</p>

<p>I heard that if you go into the system menu Program Files-&gt;Nexon-&gt; you can run it by manually starting the exe. file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though I researched this on the MS forum, and supposedly the game is just not compatible with Windows 7, aka downgrade to XP or there might be no playing at all.</p>

                    <p>Using administrative command prompt I ran sfc /scannow and it displayed&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details are included in the CBS.log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log</p>
<p>
</p><p>When attempting to view the cbs.log I used scan everything. &nbsp;When I clicked on the results it opened notepad and access was denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An internet search indicated that many people struggle viewing the CBS.log files with the access denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many more searches a solution was found to view the CBS.log files. &nbsp;It requires a second administrative command prompt for notepad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) click start</p>
<p>2) click all programs</p>
<p>3) click accessories</p>
<p>4) right click notepad and click run as administrator</p>
<p>5) in notepad click file then open and enter %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log</p>
<p>It may take a while......and or become unresponsive........eventually it produced a large file</p>
<p>6) click edit</p>
<p>7) click find</p>
<p>8) type: &nbsp;cannot repair</p>
<p>9) use the F3 key to view each result within the cbs.log</p>

</p><p>On a prior post on Microsoftanswers I sought information on DISM commands and it seemed it did not work for windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I found this link and wonder whether anyone has had experience using the System Update Readiness tool:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/947821</p>
<p>
</p><p>The windows 7 professional is 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>These are some questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) what is the significance of each of the four errors found with dism scanhealth?</p>
<p>2) is the only way to fix the corruption to reinstall the windows 7 professional operating system?</p>
<p>3) does the system update readiness tool allow the repair of the corruption? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) are there any pitfalls in using the system update readiness tool?</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you for providing detailed information about this issue. I apologize for the inconvenience caused to you. I appreciate your efforts towards trying to resolve the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the significance of each of the four errors found with dism scanhealth?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The four errors mentioned in the checksur log file are all related to Internet Explorer spelling and hyphenation packages. The logs indicate that these four packages were not available for repair. These are not critical packages and if you are not facing
 any issues with Internet Explorer then you need not be worried about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is the only way to fix the corruption to reinstall the windows 7 professional operating system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd not recommend reinstalling Windows 7 for this issue. If you are facing any issues in Internet Explorer, please let us know what exactly the issue and we'd try to fix it without reinstalling the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Does the system update readiness tool allow the repair of the corruption? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, System update readiness tool does detect and fix corruption errors. But if few packages are not available for repair as mentioned in the logs, then they will have to be manually downloaded and installed. Refer to the section "How to fix errors that
 are found in the CheckSUR.log" in the system update readiness article you have mentioned in your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Are there any pitfalls in using the system update readiness tool?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, there is no pitfalls in using this tool. It is a very safe tool designed to work with Windows operating systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking the packages that have failed, we found that this error was displayed in many cases due to a file name mismatch in Windows 7 PCs. Please let us know if you are facing any issues with your PC or internet Explorer so that we might be able to provide
 more appropriate suggestion on what steps can be taken further.</p>

            You are correct.&nbsp; They did release a patch that fixed those problems with those two updates.&nbsp; But you should know that those particular updates are designed to feed information about you and your computer to Microsoft.&nbsp; Personally, I do not endorse that
 kind of privacy invasion and remove them permanently.

            <p>I suggest you see if there are updated drivers for your Video Card for Windows 7.
</p>
<p>Go to the video card manufacturer's website and see if they have current drivers.
<br />
It may be your video card is too old to be able to display graphics for Windows Media Center and for Windows Media Player.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

            Hello Ron,<br />
<br />
At this time, we are investigating the cause of the Limited Connectivity on the Surface. The currently suggested work around is to drop their router to 802.11 B/G mix until we are able to fix the 802.11N problem.

            <p>Hi JHzz,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried turning off your 5GHz band on your router?</p>
<p>This seems to fix some intermittent connection issues.</p>
<p>You can also try turning off Wireless N completely and just using Wireless G.</p>
<p>This also seems to have an effect on connection issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give that a try and let me know your results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Derrek.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to boot the system in safe mode and try deleting the ComboFix. Click on the link how to boot the system in safe mode.</span></p>

            <p>I have downloaded and run Microsoft Safety Scanner, but it didn't find anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose I will just have to live with the bodgy directory, since there is no way I will try removing it, since it will remove the entire C Drive, which is my only drive!</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: it is not found in Program and Features. Perhaps I removed it years ago.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I learnt upon searching the web, when last ComboFix scan was interrupted, it seems to create something like a reparse point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're not alone. Check out:</p>

<p>https://www.google.com/webhp?q=combofix+recursive+c:%5C+drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some users say to simply remove the folder, I don't want to blindly recommend that without testing it out myself... although nothing might happen if the ComboFix folder is removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you may ask this question in a security forum or directly write to the author.</p>

            <p>ComboFix was&nbsp;a legitimate spyware remover created by sUBs. However, it's old software that isn't recommended for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the normal uninstall procedure doesn't work (Settings &gt; System &gt; Apps and features &gt; select ComboFix from the list of apps &gt; click the Uninstall button) then try a third-party uninstaller.
<a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Revo Uninstall</a> is legitimate, widely used and safe. The free version is sufficient for your need.</p>

            <p>MRIS on&nbsp;http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/1248606 looks a likely fix, but I am not willing to try it, or anything else at this point, as I am not willing to lose my C: drive info, and in effect, my whole computer, including windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will just live with the bodgy listing until I get a new computer.</p>
