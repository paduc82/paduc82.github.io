<h2>            missing temporary internet file in IE 11 after windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I had a few issues when I downloaded windows 10.&nbsp; First and major was&nbsp;that shortly after the auto upgrade from windows 8.1. there was no longer any temporary internet file showing up in the IE 11 browser settings.&nbsp; Just showed no file in the IE 11 settings
 &nbsp;and of course zero Mb storage.&nbsp; Tried 3 times to tell it to look for the usual location (in the InetCache folder)&nbsp; and rebooted but each time came back as still no internet temp file.&nbsp; This meant that I could not see files in any email attachments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly&nbsp;went to &nbsp;download a game (adera) from Microsoft store but would either simply not download or came up with an error message....I should have known better with Adera and Microsoft store issues abounding apparently!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>thirdly,&nbsp;&nbsp;my beloved Microsoft money sunset would not work...found a fix to the registry for this and then it worked, &nbsp;but not sure if that caused issues 1 and 2 above as I did this first ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, but most importantly, &nbsp;internet browsing speed just got worse and worse over next 3 days after upgrade to the point that it was unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I rolled back to windows 8.1 and hey presto... no more problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyone seem something similar of come up with a fix?&nbsp; Until then its windows 8.1 for me</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

            <p>thanks for the reply.&nbsp; Whilst this may (??)&nbsp;have fixed the IE 11&nbsp;bug in windows 10, you did not offer any comments as to why IE basically stalled after the update to windows 10 nor any advice as to whether the change to the registry to get Microsoft money
 sunset might have caused any problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>also you have not commented on&nbsp;the Microsoft store issue??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that I rolled back to 8.1 and that this resolved all the issues (I did not need to use your suggested fix for IE 11) &nbsp;I would not update to windows 10 unless at the very least I can be confident that IE 11 would work normally, Microsoft store would
 work, &nbsp;and that money sunset would work ok</p>
<p>
</p><p>be interested in your reply</p>

            <p>I have also had this problem, with it getting so slow it took a minute to accept a keystroke, yet task manager showed little activity, interestingly Solitaire is also exhibiting the same slow response. I followed the uncheck and recheck instructions as my
 inetcache had also gone missing. After the 2nd reboot I checked IE options again and hit ok, Inetcache was back again with all the cookies, where had they gone? I was confused, but they are there and it seems to be running better but not ideal and I don't
 want to use Edge, that is designed for a pad and I want and need the full functionality, I even installed Opera because it was so bad.</p>
<p>I will now try a similar operation with Solitaire and see if that improves. This all seemed to get worse when I accepted the Windows 10 anniversary update, which I did as a result of other problems I was having and it was the solution given.
</p>
<p>I hope this doesn't occur every time we get updates as we can't control them any longer and that is very disappointing as they just happen and it is a lot of work finding out what has taken place invisibly and since this problem developed over time, not
 as soon as an update had taken place, backtracking the cause is made more, and unreasonably, complex.

<p>^^ &nbsp;I'm sure it is possible. &nbsp;Problem is, downloading maps (or using any 3rd party software on your Xbox) is against the Terms of Service and his Xbox could be banned from Xbox live for doing so.</p>

<h2>            gamerpic</h2>
                    <p>my gamerpic has been minecraft steve for nearly 2 days now. it all started when i wanted to change my custom gamerpic to a harmless mirror selfie of my friend looking special, and then it wouldn't change. i tried experimenting by changing it to one of the
 preset xbox images and randomly chose minecraft steve. little did i know that i wouldn't be able to change it back to my original picture (which xbox didn't have a problem with before hand). i tried uploading different pictures, however, every time it just
 shows it for a second and then reverts back to minecraft steve. i tried changing it on multiple devices but still no change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i hope this is fixed soon because people aren't taking me seriously in games now and i'm really scared.</p>
<p>help me.</p>

<h2>            One Guide mit HD-Austria &#40;AustriaSat&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Bin seit 24.12.2014 stolzer Besitzer einer Xbox One. Das Setup hat eigentlich recht gut funktioniert. Habe auch die Sprachsteuerung einrichten können.</p>
<p>Nur beim One Guide habe ich meine Schwierigkeiten. Ich verwende einen Satforce S2500HD+ mit einem HD-Austria Abo (<a href="http://www.hdaustria.at" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hdaustria.at</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;da sind z.B. die deutschen privaten Sender in der Austria-Version in HD, etwa
 RTL Austria HD und natürlich die ORF-Programme in HD). Welcher SAT-Provider wäre hier im Xbox One Guide Setup das Richtige?</p>
<p>Die Ansteuerung des SAT-Receivers durch die Xbox funktioniert grundsätzlich - die Sender werden gewechselt. Aber ich hab noch keine Einstellung gefunden, wo alle Sender von HD-Austria enthalten sind.</p>
<p>Was ist eure Erfahrung mit dem One Guide mit Satellitenempfang in Österreich? Wer kann mir mit der korrekten Einstellung helfen?</p>
<p>lg, Gregor</p>
<p>btw: an Alle ein schönes, neues Jahr.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu on 1 profile but not others</h2>
                    <p>As the title says, the start menu works on 1 profile every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other 2 profiles, 1 doesn't work at all and on the other it works about 5% of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The start menu worked on all profiles at first and as far as I'm aware no settings have been changed.</p>
<p>Any ideas as to whats causing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks Smiler768</p>

<p>I suggest you to first perform a SFC scan and reply back with the result.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Perform System File Check (SFC)</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Follow the steps:<br />
<br />
a. Press “Windows Key + Q” to open search Bar.<br />
<br />
b. Type&nbsp;<strong>“<em>cmd</em>”</strong>&nbsp;without quotes in the search box.<br />
<br />
c. On the left pane, right click on the “<strong><em>cmd</em></strong>” option and select “Run as Administrator”.<br />
<br />
d. Type&nbsp;<strong>‘<em>sfc /scannow’</em></strong>&nbsp;without quotes and hit enter.</span></p>

            <p>Hi, Thanks for answering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly the pressing "Windows + Q" to open the search bar didn't work. I'm guessing this is linked to the start menu problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead I right clicked the start menu and left clicked Command Prompt (admin). I'm guessing (again) that this brings me to the same place that you wanted me to get to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the scan and it came back with "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas where I go from here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, many thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Smiler768:</p>
<p>&nbsp; I have exactly the same problem.&nbsp; On my main profile the start menu fails - additionally the search box can only be intermittently typed into and other items are missing from the task bar like Edge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>sfc /scannow’&nbsp;</em></strong>found no errors and reinstalling Apps did not solve the problem. Did you finally fix it and if so, how?</p>
<p>

 RestoreHealth</strong>", troubleshooting and Antivirus software haven't been very helpful. Even when applied in the Windows 8.1 forum method. I'm&nbsp;currently exploring checking the integrity of my disk first with
<strong>chkdsk /f C:&nbsp;</strong>cmd to Repair what might not even be it. If you could forward this or give&nbsp;more targeted advice I would appreciate it Bill.

                    <p>I am trying to do a reset on my surface go however every time I try to do this it goes all the way to the end of the procedure and then says that&nbsp; "there was a problem resetting your computer. Nothing was changed".</p>
<p>the computer seems to have had a slight problem since new and I want to do a hard reset to clear any faults with the original set up. Any advise on how to rectify this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Thread Stuck In Device Driver Error</h2>
                    <p>Just got this BSOD message for the first time on my laptop. I've been reading through other posts about it and I've checked to make sure all of my drivers are up-to-date and that there aren't any new updates from Windows. Since it could be any number of
 things, I thought I would share the Minidump file (there was only one) to see if someone could help me diagnose the problem. That file can be found here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_Ap-lgiBo8aTGhoMHVMSTlKdnM.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm using the 64-bit version of Windows 10 Home (Ver 1703, Build 15063.540). I don't have a screen shot of the message, but it looked just like this one:&nbsp;http://innov8tiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fix-thread-stuck-in-device-driver-1-1.png
<br />
<br />
I was just scrolling through Facebook when it happened. I clicked on a link to a new article and about 30 seconds later I got the message. I don't believe the site I was on was the problem as several other people confirmed they viewed it with no issue.<br />
</p>
<p>No recent changes to the computer. No hardware or software installed or uninstalled. There were some automatic updates applied last week or the week before, but that's it.</p>

<p>We appreciate your response. Outdated driver and system file corruption are a few of the possible reasons why you are getting a thread stuck in device driver error. Since you’ve already checked your drivers, you can proceed with running the system file checker
 tool. It will help you scan for missing or corrupted files.

            Hi Maria. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Camera app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Camera &gt; Advanced Options.  
<br />
<br />Did you enable the Privacy setting to allow apps to use your webcam?  
<br /><a href="https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disable-camera-or-webcam-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disabl...</a>
<br /><a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-camera-and-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-...</a>
<br />
<br />Try also these steps from Microsoft for when webcam isn't working:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/s13753/windows-10-camera-does-not-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/s13753...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Hardware &amp; Devices troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the webcam driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  
<br />
<br />Also compare all other drivers including Chipset, display, sound, etc to make sure you have the latest on the PC maker's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Webcam device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br /> 
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            cannot install update KB2481109, error &#34;Some updates could not be installed&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows XP Pro update KB2481109.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My computer is constantly requiring an "important update" and it is always KB2481109, but it always comes back with: "Some updates could not be installed".&nbsp; I have just switched my protection ware to MS Security Essentials and have it set to scan everything
 and weekly do a Full Scan rather than just a <br />
Quick one.&nbsp; I have downloaded MS Fix-It and&nbsp;every time I ask it to check Windows Updates, it says that Windows Update must be repaired, goes through the process and says it is fixed but it still will not load.</p>
<p>The detailed Troubleshooting report shows as issues: Default Windows Update data locations have changed but then shows repaired; also shows: One or more Windows Update components are configured incorrectly then shows it as repaired.</p>
<p>Is there anyone who can help me out?&nbsp; It is probably an easy question for someone, but I have no idea and have been looking at various sites for help and nothing seems to work.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Mohd Iqbal,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for reaching out to the Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Based on the description, it appears that you are getting an<b> error 8024402C</b> while trying to install windows updates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>- Were there any recent changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I can understand the inconvenience you have experienced. I will certainly help you out with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s try these methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Run Windows update troubleshooter </span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a. </span></span><span>Open Search by swiping in from the right edge of the screen (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen and moving the mouse pointer down), and then tapping or clicking Search.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b. </span></span><span>Tap or click Settings and type troubleshooting in the text box.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c. </span></span><span>Tap or click Troubleshooting from the list of results.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>d. </span></span><span>Tap or click Fix problems with Windows Update, click Next and follow the instructions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Disable the proxy server and check</span></b><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Open<strong> Internet Explorer </strong><b><br />
</b>b. Click <strong>Tools</strong> and then click <strong>Internet Options.</strong><b><br />
</b>c. Then click the <strong>Connections</strong> tab.<br />
d. Then click the <strong>LAN Settings </strong>button.<br />
e. Uncheck the option which reads” <strong>Use a proxy server for your LAN”</strong><b><br />
</b>f. Click on <strong>apply</strong> and then <strong>ok.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Disable security software and check.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Warning:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 4: Perform clean boot and check.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error message, you can start Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<b>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/504ba81b-04f6-4832-aed9-7d6dc21eb20e" title="TristaEBurke">TristaEBurke</a><span> ,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community.</span></span> For us to further assist you, we would like to know more about this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. When did this issue occur?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Have you made any changes on your device (e.g. settings or updates) before this issue occur?</span></p>
<p><span>3. By any chance, have you performed any troubleshooting steps to isolate the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>4. What windows version and OS build number that is currently installed on your Surface?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile<span>, here are the few things we suggest you do.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>For the features like pinch to zoom/magnifying or touch with 2 or more fingers does not work:</em></span></p>
<p><span>1. Install and run <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a>. This toolkit resolves the most common Surface issues. Please follow the instructions posted on the page.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Run Windows Update. Updates have fixes to common problems, or issues. Kindly go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Updates &gt; Check for Updates.&nbsp;<strong>Tip!</strong><span> Restart the Surface after installing updates.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Force the device to shut down and restart. The device may be in a "hung" state.&nbsp;<span>Performing a Forced Shutdown is like removing the battery from a laptop or unplugging a desktop PC. It resets the hardware and clears all the cache and memory
 for your hardware. Kindly<strong> press and hold the power button for a full 10 seconds, until the screen turns off, then release the power button.
</strong><span><span><span>Video available at </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4036280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Force a shut down and restart your Surface</a>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>4. Boot to UEFI and see if the issue is present.&nbsp;<span>UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is an environment that exists completely outside of Windows and other installed applications.
<span>Once the device is shutdown, </span><strong>press and hold the volume up button,
</strong><span>and </span><strong>single press</strong><span> </span><strong>the power button</strong><span>.
<span>The device will boot to the Surface Logo, and you should see spinning dots. After the Surface logo, the device should boot to UEFI.
</span></span></span></span><span><span>If the issue does not exist in UEFI, then we know the symptom is being influenced by software such as Windows or other applications.
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><em>For the Pen that inking or using it to maneuver the screen does not work:</em></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>1. Verify that the pen's LED light is coming on. Please press and hold the pen for 3-7 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2<span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>. Install and run Surface Diagnostic Toolkit or run Windows Updates and test the pen on a known app.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>3. Restart your Surface Device and test the pen on a known app. Restarting your device will also restart touch functionality. Test your pen using the Sketchpad via Windows Ink Workspace.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>4. Reseat the pen tip, and test the pen on a known app.
<span>Reseating the pen tip may resolve the pen’s ability to ink. Kindly r<span>emove and reseat the pen tip (either by fingertip or extraction tool).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>5. Reseat the AAAA battery in the pen and test the pen on a known app<span> to ensure good connection.
</span></span></span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Important: </span>
</span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>Follow the instructions for

<p>Johning are you running the 32 or 64 bit OS?</p>
<p>The new versions of the Windows&nbsp; OS will check for a digital signature when installing new device drivers in order to verify the publisher of the software. Officially, Microsoft requires all drivers to be digitally signed with the idea that this will maintain
 secure and stable operations throughout the operating system. Admirable goal alright but sometimes Microsoft’s hand holding can get in the way. There could be a situation where you need that unsigned driver installed yet Windows makes quite a stink.</p>
<p>Microsoft has provided a means to developers to by-pass the signing requirement, if only to facilitate internal testing of the publishers driver. Using this method, us users are able to disable the digital signature check and freely install any driver of
 our choosing. Standard disclaimers apply and this disabling of a security layer in Windows should only be done by power users a like.</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch a <strong>Command Prompt</strong> under <strong>Administrative </strong>
privileges by clicking the Start Orb and searching for <em><strong>cmd.<br />
</strong></em></li><li>Right-click on the search result and choose <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. You’ll need to click through the UAC prompt.</li><li>

            I am having the exact same issue in VISTA.<br />
<br />
I have tried the steps suggested here.<br />
I have reboot the PC and I still have the same problem.<br />
<br />
I have also looked this up elsewhere and have found different commands that apparently do the same thing.<br />
<br />
<span><span><strong>Bcdedit.exe /set nointegritychecks OFF<br />
</strong></span></span><span><span><strong>Bcdedit.exe /set nointegritychecks ON<br />
<br />
<br />
</strong></span></span>Needless to say, these don't work either.&nbsp; This is a really frustrating problem.&nbsp; Why do all of these commands do absolutely nothing to help with this problem.<br />
<br />
The only command that does something is the "bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON" command.<br />
<br />
I am trying to install on a Window VISTA Ultimate, using the latest drivers from the manufacturer.<br />
<br />
An actual working solution would be greatly appreciated.<br />

            I have tried all of the above including ending the process and the process tree but as soon as you end the process or the process tree, it stops updating the drivers and you're back to square one. Very frustrating. If anyone has any other suggestions I'd
 be most grateful. Thanks

            I just kept clicking on "install this software anyway"... about 50 times. It takes so many tries because the driver is also updating, so you are telling windows to install something different each time. This worked for me, hope it does for you too!!

<p>Officially you can't. Your user account is really the Security ID assigned to the account not the name. The SID identifies the folder name holding the user&nbsp;profile for the which includes the user specific sections of the Registry. If you were able to just
 change the name it would no longer find those files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may find some guides instructing how to make the change but the process is unsupported. The safer option would be to create a new user as a
<p>
</p><p>Now you can convert the Local to a Microsoft Account and it will not pick up the MA nickname to apply to the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having found this I prefer to set up a new computer using a Local Account in the 1st instance and convert that to a Microsoft Account afterwards. That way<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> I</span> choose what the folder is called.</p>

<p>It is the "cleanest" solution overall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just bear in mind my last point, it is a bit hidden but use the option to install using a local account as the user folder takes its name from the account name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then once you have logged in for the 1st time you can change to the MA login and the folder name is kept.</p>
