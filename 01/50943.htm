            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build, if it was an upgrade to 1809 - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build
<br />
<br />E. If nothing works, I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

    <title>Multiple screens small gray box. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kground  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple screens small gray box.</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8&nbsp; 64 bit running on Lenovo Twist tablet 3347CTO&nbsp; running two additional screens in EXPAND mode through Lenovo USB3 expander box..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes for no apparent reason a small grey translucent box will appear on the right side of my main (built-in) screen and simultaneously on the left side of my first external screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequently this box will have a mouse pointer in it which cannot be
 moved out of that box.&nbsp; </p>
<p>as far as I have been able to determine this box has no functionality - i.e. clicking in it with right or left button does nothing, enter key with mouse in the box does nothing ...&nbsp; Once it is on the screen there is no getting rid of it short of a reboot.&nbsp;
 Changing to metro view and back to desktop does nothing - it is still there when the desktop reappears.&nbsp; This box appears without apparent relation to any program or app - i.e. there is no program or app that seems to cause this and sometimes it will appear
 even when no new program or app has been started recently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea what this is for and how to get rid of it without a reboot ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue MAY be related to the question I posted under mouse etc.&nbsp; where my mouse pointer disappears completely from the screen. The grey box does not appear every time the mouse pointer disappears, and the mouse pointer does not disappear from the desktop
 every time this box is present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 documentation and support from both Microsoft and Lenovo is the worst I have ever seen for any operating system or software product. If it were not for user forums like this the product would be totally unusable. I hope Microsoft is suitably rewarded
 commercially for jamming this fine product down our throats.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums where you can find answers to all your Windows related queries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have mentioned that there is a small grey translucent box on the right side of the built-in monitor and on the left side of the external monitor. You have also
 mentioned that the mouse pointer disappears frequently. We’ll help you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a few questions first, to get a clear picture of the issue;</p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you performed any troubleshooting to remove this grey box?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you checked in task manager if there is any background process running when the grey box appears?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This small grey box could be the result of some other program running in the back ground and the mouse issue could be due to an outdated driver. I would suggest
 you to try these steps and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Clean boot</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.
 This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. I would suggest you to perform a clean boot procedure to find out which service is causing this issue. Refer this link to perform a clean boot:

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Note</b>: After troubleshooting, reset the computer to start as usual. Refer step 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also post a screenshot of the grey box, so that we can check and help you. Refer this link:</p>

            <p>I did check Task Manager at the time and confirmed that the box remains even after all processes (programs) shown in task manager are shut down, task manager closed and the mouse&nbsp; moved around on the screen a bit.</p>
<p>The box remains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did a clean boot with everything&nbsp;&nbsp; non-Microsoft in the services and everything&nbsp;in the startup section of task manager disabled, and did not get the box, but then I have not gotten the box again in the past week or so, even when going back to normal boot
 .&nbsp; (Surprisingly, the only difference I noticed in computer operation with all of that stuff disabled was that my Bluetooth headset would install but not play audio. -- Don't most of these things start themselves if needed by whatever program uses them even
 if they are disabled&nbsp;for auto start ??)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be glad to post a picture here, but am not interested in setting up another subscription just to post a photo on this forum. Other forums accept image posts directly. Anybody wants the photo, let me know and I will be glad to email it to you...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I begin to think that the little box has something to do with the touchscreen gestures for changing screens, and that the reason I don't see it lately is that I stopped using the touchscreen in favor of a regular mouse , since my two external monitors don't
 have touch capability. &nbsp;</p>

            I have been using the Lenovo usb3 box as well for a while now with a Lenovo X230T and have been experiencing all kinds of issues with the drivers from Display Link that are used with it. &nbsp; &nbsp;Can't even get netflix to run correctly until the box is uninstalled.

            <p>I did get updated drivers for the USB box from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>After installation it now does something strange when I start the computer.</p>
<p>After the log-in all of the screens flash on and off&nbsp; a few times before settling down to proper operation.</p>
<p>Didn't do that before the driver update.</p>
<p>Other than that I haven't had any trouble, but haven't used netflix, only youtube and some videos stored locally on my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New drivers didn't seem to affect the little gray box.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
The most important thing you need to test it is some Modern UI Fullscreen apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. something which would show&nbsp;listed when you press Win-Ctrl-Tab.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then depending on your screen size when you drag a thumbnail you would see it going into split screen or
 just reducing size as it passes through a monitor and then out the other side into the next monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp;I do that with Touch and&nbsp;I press too hard&nbsp;my press will appear as a right-click box split between two monitors.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suspect that is the effect that you
 could have been observing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the fact that it didn't go away would be due to an artifact left over in the rendering that the GPU forgot about.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of rebooting I would expect something to refresh the monitor would make such a problem go away.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 E.g. use the Second Screen tool&nbsp; (Win-P)&nbsp; or do something with&nbsp; Catalyst Control Center, if you have that.&nbsp;&nbsp; That would be without even having to switch sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise you could certainly get a screen refresh effect by doing that, which could be less
 disruptive than rebooting, your current workaround.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW I must thank you for making me do these experiments because I have only just found out that I have been reaching too high--too much in the middle of the left side to try to pull an app out of it.&nbsp; Swiping lower down is much more reliable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knew?&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;&nbsp; )</p>

            <p>&nbsp;I think you are on to something here Robert.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forgive my obvious ignorance about some things you mentioned though...</p>
<p>1) What do you mean by pressing Win-Ctrl-Tab?</p>
<p>&nbsp; Do you mean the little windows button that switches between the metro interface and the desktop ?</p>
<p>&nbsp; If I start by pressing that button and try to add ctrl-tab, it switches out of the desktop before I get a chance to press ctrl-tab.&nbsp; And if I start with ctrl-tab and then try to press the windows button it starts switching programs (or something -(the
 screen changes very rapidly) before I can get to the windows button. If I am careful to click on an unused part of the desktop or metro screen first, and &nbsp;then&nbsp;ctrl-tab -win then nothing happens as far&nbsp; as I can tell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) And the Win-P ?&nbsp; Again, as soon as I press the windows button it jumps to the metro&nbsp;screen, and&nbsp;if I start with the P (after clicking on a unused part of the desktop), it either does nothing or, if I am on the metro screen it begins typing a string of
 Ps. Touching the windows button with P held down does nothing as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with these questions unanswered I feel that Robert's explanation is probably correct.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue isn't going to be much problem to me because I will most likely only use touch when the multiple monitors are disconnected and I am using the box in tablet mode with only the built in monitor.</p>

I suspect the key point you are missing is that the Win- key is a modifier key, just as the others are.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. you press and hold a modifier key and then you press the key it modifies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So when I write Win-P it means press and hold Win-, while still holding
 Win- press P.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same as Shift- (unless you use Sticky keys).&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to type a capital p you have to first press Shift-, hold it, and then press P.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now, let's look at&nbsp; Win-Ctrl-Tab.&nbsp; In fact, if you like look at it using the On-Screen Keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; osk.exe&nbsp;&nbsp; (You can Run... that e.g. press&nbsp; Win-R&nbsp; etc. &lt;eg&gt;)&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the modifier keys first, any order, they will just show as being selected until
 you click on a key which will be modified by them, in this case the Tab key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a look at some of the other Win- based keyboard shortcuts in W8.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are real time savers, and more reliable than swipes and taps.</p>

            <p>Ok, I notice that I was incorrect about the Win key&nbsp; - it doesn't cause a jump between the desktop and metro screens until it is released (at least that is the way it is working today).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I still get no action whatsoever when I press and hold the Win key and then press one of the other keys.&nbsp; (Whether I use the built in keyboard or the on screen keyboard. )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; OK -- I begin to get it now&nbsp; &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>All these shortcuts you mention APPLY ONLY IF THE METRO INTERFACE IS ON THE SCREEN</p>
<p>they do nothing from the "old" desktop. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see, all of my industrial control programs, CAD, WORD, EXCEL, etc.&nbsp;are desktop programs.</p>
<p>There is nothing on the Metro interface for me, as far as I can tell, and I seldom use it, except for the increased convenience of finding Microsoft system maintenance programs like Device Manager, MsConfig, etc. by just typing the name.&nbsp; That is a nice
 feature and a distinct advantage over having to search Control Panel to find these programs.&nbsp; Too bad it doesn't recognize desktop programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To me this whole business of having two interfaces that seemingly do not talk to each other is wacky. Two interfaces, OK, but when I can't put a shortcut to a metro app on the desktop or pin a desktop program to my metro screen it sure looks like I am carryiing
 around two computers inside the same box.&nbsp; If I wanted to do that I would buy an Apple and put windows emulator software on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the article -- I will examine it in detail and see if I can make those commands work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think we can put the original topic of this thread to rest with Robert's reply about the right click selection box.&nbsp; I haven't seen the problem lately, I think mostly because I only rarely use the touchscreen these days.

<p><br />
No.&nbsp; Many of them exist in W7 too.&nbsp; I mentioned with my example of Win-Ctrl-Tab that you would need to have at least one MUF app running, otherwise you won't see the side bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a Win-Ctrl-Tab in W7 too which duplicated the Flip 3D's key's Aero&nbsp;effect
 so they are analogous except that now you only see MUF apps.&nbsp; If you want to see all your tasks you need to press Alt-Tab (and hold on to the Alt- as long as you need to).&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that just representing all the Desktop tasks by one thumbnail is a good idea
 because as you can see from Alt-Tab it could be just a jumble otherwise.</p>

            I just purchased my first Win8-64bit touch laptop, Lenovo G400s and I am getting the very annoying &amp; disruptive "small grey box". The box always appears in the lower middle of the screen with a mouse pointer flickering inside. I am fairly certain it is
 a "right mouse click" command that has not completed because it will disappear (temporarily) after I finally get the "right mouse click" window in the spot where the grey box claims its space..
<div><br />
<div>The "grey box" mouse click is is addition to the "main" mouse pointer; the affect is I end up with 2 mouse pointers that "compete". It is very disruptive and makes it hard to use the "main mouse". This will happen when using the "touch pad" alone or with
 a wireless mouse with touch-pad disabled; it makes no difference. Eventually it will go way, but it it always comes back &amp; has happened over the last 3 days, my first 3 days with the machine &amp; Win8.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think it is the "touch screen" software getting a right-mouse-click command from some program or service that cannot complete all the way but as of yet I have no resolution. The Lenovo tech reinstalled many of my drivers to no avail &amp; they blame a Microsoft
 Update that they cannot identify (an easy scape goat). They want me to do a clean install &amp; start over; and then to not install the important Microsoft Updates (there was 49 MS Important Updates that 'needed' to be applied on the first boot as machine was
 built many months ago as per the norm).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also talked with a Costco Tech as I got the machine there, and they have no resolution but to unplug the machine, disconnect power cord; remove battery; press &amp; hold power button for 1 minute; and then reverse the process &amp; re-boot. This will resolve
 the issue for many hours but the issue eventually returns. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, is this grey box does not get resolved, I am returning machine. Any help would be appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

<h2>            FIles&#47;Folders Disappear When Copied - Windows 10 Anti-Malware Defense&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a vanilla Windows 10 installation and wanted to copy a couple of files over to test things before transitioning to this system. Since I have not figured out how many of the privacy settings need to be adjusted the Windows 10 system is NOT connected
 to any network.&nbsp;&nbsp;I popped the disk drive into a USB adapter and copied the large files in another computer.&nbsp; Ejected the disk drive on the other Windows system and then reinstalled in the PC.&nbsp; Upon boot the folders/files are missing.&nbsp; They disappear when the
 files are placed in the root OS folder (i.e. C:\).&nbsp; They disappear when I create a folder named Temp in the root of the directory.&nbsp; They disappear when I create a folder on the local admin's desktop that contains the files...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some security built into Windows 10 that is deleting any file created while the OS was offline?&nbsp; Remember, this is a VANILLA install just as Microsoft cooked up...no additional software is installed other drivers for hardware not supported by out
 of the box drivers...</p>

<p>
</p><p>I can, at the very least, assure you that there is no built-in code that would block you from creating folders or files like this. &nbsp;But rather, something is certainly broken, and we need to figure out what it is...&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            My laptop is freezing when using a wifi connection. &#40;WIN8&#41;</h2>
                    <p>If I'm using a wifi connection laptop will freeze and hard drive running 100% without any response. This will happen every time when there is little bit more network traffic.&nbsp;I don't have any problems with cable connection. So it&nbsp;feels like this is driver
 related issue.</p>
<p>Anyhow all the drivers are updated by manufacturers website/program without any help. What can I do next? This problem has been since I install WIN8 about week ago, and my laptop has been almost useless this time.&nbsp; First I installed update from WIN7, but
 after problems I made a clean install. Laptop model is&nbsp;Samsung NP305U1A.</p>

            <p><span>Hi JSt,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community!</span></p>
<p><span>First, temporarily disable security software and firewalls and check.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1: Disable Windows firewall.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a) Press ‘Windows + W’.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b) Type ‘Windows firewall’ and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>c) Select ‘Turn Windows firewall on or off’ and select ‘Turn off the Windows firewall’ for both ‘public network location settings’ and ‘private network location settings’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Disable Windows Defender.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>a) Press ‘Windows + W’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>b) Type ‘Defender’ and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>c) Click on ‘settings’ tab and uncheck ‘Turn on real-time protection’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Warning: Antivirus software, Windows Firewall and Windows Defender can help protect your computer against viruses
 and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while
 your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Clean Boot</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load
 startup items check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable
 all’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click
 on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that
 you originally selected in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes
 that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service
 causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may
 be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that
 you originally selected in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes
 that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup
 item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which
 Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer
 to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Step 7:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Also run System maintenance troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a) Press Windows key + W on the keyboard</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b) Type Troubleshooter then click on Settings under the Search field</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c) In Settings click on Find and Fix Problems</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>d) Click on System and security</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>e) Click System maintenance follow the prompts from there.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Also see Windows hangs or freezes.</span></p>

<p>You may also install the drivers in compatibility mode.</p>
<p><span>Troubleshoot Compatibility
</span></p>
<p><span>This can help with some (but not all) programs/drivers:
</span></p>
<p><span>a) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file
 right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"</span></p>
<p><span>b) Then click "Troubleshoot Program"</span></p>
<p><span>c) In the next window click an option that best describes the situation and click next to continue.</span></p>
<p><span>d) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs/drivers may not be able to run in Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><span>Please post back if you are still experiencing the issue. I will be glad to provide you with the additional options available that you
 can utilize to get the issue resolved.</span></p>

<p>vi contatto nuovamente per quanto riguarda il mio account XBOX360, tempo addietro (non molto comunque) mi avete sospeso l'account dicendo questo:&nbsp;<span>IL PUNTEGGIO GIOCATORE È STATO REIMPOSTATO A CAUSA DI UNA SCORRETTEZZA, quello che vi chiedo è come potrei
 mai fare una cosa del genere visto che, da che so io, non si può in alcun modo sbloccare gli obiettivi senza poter giocare. Ora non è tanto il fatto che mi avete azzerato i miei punti G, quanto avete immesso nella mia zona giocatore, INGANNATORE e questo non
 mi sta bene, non solo, mi son detto "vabbè avranno sbagliato, può succedere siamo esseri umani dopotutto" allora mi appresto a ricominciare tutti i giochi che avevo finito al 100% con gli obiettivi, avvio Assassin's Creed il primo e con mia sorpresa, quando
 vado a fare l'obiettivo&nbsp;<span>Genio della fuga (il più semplice tra tutti) non me lo sblocca. Ora non è cattiveria, ma oltre al danno pure la beffa, chiedo pertanto al supporto un paio di cosette che sono semplici semplici, ve le elenco:</span></span></p>
<p>1. L'eliminazione del messaggio&nbsp;<span>IL PUNTEGGIO GIOCATORE È STATO REIMPOSTATO A CAUSA DI UNA SCORRETTEZZA</span></p>
<p><span>2. La reimpostazione della mia zona giocatore da come avete detto voi a TEMPO LIBERO</span></p>
<p><span>3. La possibilità di sbloccare gli obiettivi e cancellare i giochi che non ho più in mio possesso in quanto li ho venduti</span></p>
<p><span>4. Restituire i Punti G ingiustificatamente azzerati</span></p>
<p>Dato che ho pagato un abbonamento XBOXLIVE 12 Mesi e ho acquistato tanti Microsoft Point, credo di aver diritto ad un leggerissimo risarcimento in questi termini, ribadisco che non avendo mai fatto una cosa del genere, gradirei riavere il mio profilo come
 era e cioè con tutti i miei obiettivi sbloccati. E cortesemente, non mi inviate il messaggio stupido fatto con copia e incolla del link del regolamento, ho chiesto una cosa specifica ed esigo una risposta specifica in quanto pago per il servizio che voi mi
 date. Mi dite che per poter giocare online devo essere membro gold, ok io pago, ma non mi piace poi essere preso in giro in questo modo e quindi ad una domanda si risponde come si deve e la mia è una richiesta formale che richiede una risposta adeguata e altrettanto
 formale.</p>

<p>Cordiali Saluti</p>

<p>Mi dispiace per il problema, ma la tua nel forum sbagliato. Per gamerscore reimposta dovete postare nei forum per l'applicazione del prodotto Team (PET)
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/41.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../41.aspx</a> Mi dispiace dirlo in genere poi non tornare indietro su gamerscore azzera, e sì, si sarà in grado di riacquistare i risultati che hai già guadagnato, anche se sono stati conseguiti legittimamente al momento. È possibile tornare
 indietro e giocare partita precedentemente svolto e ottenere obiettivi che non hai mai guadagnato comunque. Ci dovrebbe essere una e-mail che è stato inviato alla e-mail collegato al vostro gamertag con una spiegazione del motivo per cui è stato reimpostato,
 è generalmente piuttosto vago ma so che inviano uno. O dopo di postare nel forum corretto dal link qui sopra che ti invieremo una e-mail o inviare la risposta al tuo post nel forum.</p>
<p>Se siete alla ricerca di compensazione per il vostro abbonamento Xbox Live non succederà. E 'nel CDU, e non hanno intenzione di rimuovere la filigrana imbroglione sia. Hai violato le Condizioni di utilizzo. Forse non l'avete fatto, un amico ha fatto, in
 entrambi i casi una persona che non si sarebbe fatto e dato che avevano le credenziali di accesso non è ancora possibile ottenere che se ne vada. Ma ancora una volta un commento nel forum sbagliato, PET non rispondere qui.</p>
<p>TRANSLATED ITALIAN TO ENGLISH</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear about your issue but your in the wrong forum. For gamerscore resets you need to post in the forums for Product Enforcement Team (PET)
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/41.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../41.aspx</a> I'm sorry to say generally then don't go back on gamerscore resets, and yes you will be unable to reacquire the achievements you've already earned even if they were earned legitimately at the time. You can go back and play previously
 played game and earn achievements you've never earned however. There should be an email that was sent to the email attached to your gamertag with an explaination of why it was reset, it's generally pretty vague but I know they send one. Or after you post in
 the correct forum from the link above they'll send you an email or post the answer to your post in the forum.</p>
<p>If you are looking for compensation for your Xbox Live subscription it's not going to happen. It's in the ToU, and they are not going to remove the cheater watermark either. You've violated the Terms of Use. They don't have to answer you specifically or
 call you because you've been found to violate the ToU. Maybe you didn't, a friend did, either way someone who shouldn't have did and since they had your login credentials you still can't get that to go away. But again your posting in the wrong forum, PET will
 not answer you here.</p>

<h2>            Lastest Windows Dec 2018 Update - Mouse not working</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader2"><strong>UPDATES:&nbsp; KB4470788, KB4471332, KB2054637</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 64 bit - HP Elite Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Version: 1809&nbsp; &nbsp;Build: 17763.194</p>
<p>
</p><p>12/18/2018 AM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today,&nbsp; Windows updated the above KB updates today (12/18/2018 AM) and now unable to use Logitech Performance MX Bluetooth mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can no longer pair the device to Windows 10.&nbsp; The mouse used to work perfect until one of these updates screwed up my mouse and hopefully nothing else I don't know about yet. I ran the device troubleshooter, removed and reinstalled the software, also tried
 removing the mouse driver manually via device manager.&nbsp; Rebooted Windows and the system added back in the&nbsp; Logitech mouse driver.&nbsp; I ran Logitech unifying software as well to pair the mouse with no luck.&nbsp; All of the attempts above resulted in not pairing the
 device with the following message reported from Logitech Unifying software:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Unifying </em><em>software&nbsp; did not detect a device. Please restart pairing process and turn off and then on again within 60 seconds.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Spent over three hours on this and now back to old corded mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>.........................................................................................................................................................................................................................<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Update: 12/18/18 PM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mysteriously it seemed to resolved now on my HP Elite Desktop,&nbsp; but it's unconfirmed what worked.&nbsp; The last two things I tried were this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I turned off all other devices; another laptop &amp; Bluetooth mouse further away. And shut down the laptop as well. I tired this a few times during the day and didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; The Logitech unifying software screen - I selected&nbsp;<strong>advanced</strong>&nbsp;instead of choosing&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>&nbsp;which brings you to choose;&nbsp;<em>pair a new device.</em>&nbsp; This time it worked.&nbsp; Previous times I selected&nbsp;<strong>Next&nbsp;</strong>which
 performs the same pairing process and that didn't work after multiple times. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I followed these two steps in order and it worked, but not sure why it didn't work before.&nbsp; Either Advance or Next should pair the device.&nbsp; Also, perhaps my other computer (laptop) further away,&nbsp; which has a Logitech MX Anywhere Bluetooth mouse needed
 more time off or something (I shut down that laptop and turned off mouse) - it was off a longer time then previous attempts in the morning.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps anybody out there if they have same issues.<br />

            Hi Hank, start your laptop, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . .
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<br />
<br />If that does not work.

                    <p>After I upgraded to Windows 8.1 (and several weeks passed) I tried to add a friend's account (outlook.com) as a new user account on this computer. It created fine, but when he tried to log into the machine it stops on the "Please Wait..." screen, the spinning
 wheel stops spinning and the account is useless. I have to Ctrl-Alt-Del and log off user to get anywhere. I've waited 30 minutes for the login to occur without success.</p>

            I do have the same problem, my galaxy S7 can not stream music to my windows 10. I did all your suggestions and it didn't work. The same as the guy above. No error messages appear, just can't stream from my phone to my windows 10. I used to stream my music
 from my windows 7 laptop and now it can't in windows 10. Windows 10 is bad, I think. Bad product, bad decision for updating.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To stream music from your phone to Windows 10, make sure that your Bluetooth adapter has "<strong>A2DP</strong>" audio streaming feature; then, set up your Android driver on your computer. To do so, just connect your phone to your computer via USB port,
 and wait for your Windows 10 computer to finish the driver update.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>I saw that method on the internet and did it rightly. No, it didn't work. But thank you for the solution, i have been frustrated by this thing and I MUST use a third party app instead. Also it stream via Wifi not bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is SAMSUNG NP540U4E, it does have A2DP bluetooth. My android device is SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 also has A2DP bluetooth. I USED to stream music before i upgrade it to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see many other people come with the same problem over the internet, but no one has the solution. I think microsoft should take care of their customers by patching the bluetooth software.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm having the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and when I was using w7 on my HP laptop&nbsp;it worked fine (there's an option in
<strong>Devices and Printers</strong><strong> &gt; (connected phone name) &gt; Bluetooth Operation &gt; Audio and Video &gt; Connect</strong>) however after I upgraded it to&nbsp;w10 I can't find the said option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we please have a solution for this problem so we could play the audio through our laptop&nbsp;or PC just like an external speaker like the one with w7 before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have clean installed Windows 10 Pro, then you can not activate Windows 10. As I understand you want to go back to Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview right?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then you need to re-install it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you want the full version of Windows 10 Pro for free then you should have Windows 7/8.1 on the computer before upgrading to Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps in resolving the issue. If the issue persists, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows won&#39;t boot.</h2>
                    <p>I've always had problems with my system since I got it, especially with battery and power issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on a Windows 8.1, and it won't turn on. It's plugged into a wall, and when I press the power button, absolutely nothing happens. A white light shines from where the charger is plugged in to the computer, and when the power button is pressed, the light
 flashes. I've also tried changing the wall port from which it was plugged in, taking out the battery with it still plugged in (when the battery is out, no light comes from it). Nothing is visually wrong with the laptop, charger, or battery, and&nbsp; I have antivirus
 on it. Worked fine just a few hours ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help! Is it possible it's a virus?</p>

            It is not likely malware.
<br />
<br />My best guess is that it is the power supply INSIDE the laptop.  They can die suddenly.  But do work through the link greg provided.

            Hi J.LK2,
<br />
<br />Unplug your PC and if it is a laptop, remove the battery 
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Power button for 30 seconds 
<br />
<br />Plug your PC back in and if it is a laptop, replace the Battery 
<br />
<br />Start your PC and see if it boots into Windows 
<br />
<br />If not, let's see if we can get into the Windows Recovery Environment: 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<h2>            What is &#34;PfPre_b67f92d2.mkd&#34; file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have the above file in my Windows Prefetch folder that is 193KB. In my research, I gather&nbsp;".mkd" files are&nbsp;associated with a gaming programs. What application is it associated with? When I try to delete it, a window pop up and&nbsp;says that the file is open
 in "Windows Audio Endpoint Builder" (see attached). </p>
<p>

 I run a virus scan, no threat found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get nervous about files I can not find information about in a search. So I have the following questions, why is this located in the Windows Prefetch folder?&nbsp;Is it a&nbsp;vital and legitimate Windows file?&nbsp;Can I delete it? If so how?</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I tried was the "Windows Audio Endpoint Builder" Stop and Restart in the "Windows Services.msc". In-between the stop and restart&nbsp;I still was not able to delete the above file&nbsp;from the "Prefetch" folder. In stead what happened, I received
 a pop up box like that above stating "...the file&nbsp;is open in Offline Files". I then stopped that service and received a pop up box stating "...the file is open in Device Install Services". I gave up going done that road.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did down load the "Microsoft Safety Scanner". It gave me a green shield, OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then did the "Clean Boot". Did it twice, at first my Avast Antivirus wouldn't&nbsp;"Disable". I deleted it and ran the "Clean Boot" again. Both times I wasn't able to delete the file above from the "Prefetch" folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I welcome any other suggestions.</p>

<h2>            I&#39;ve bought Minecraft and can&#39;t play it.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've bought Minecraft for Xbox even though I already had Minecraft for PC and purchased Xbox Live Gold for a month, yet I still can't play the game. Here are the screenshots:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eef21945-290f-4baf-ac7c-61809914527b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eef21945-290f-4baf-ac7c-61809914527b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5aec7ed8-bb2a-43b1-b1f2-8e0ec1d02b99?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5aec7ed8-bb2a-43b1-b1f2-8e0ec1d02b99?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see I bought everything you could need, but when I went into game this happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1859900a-a460-4590-8e6d-e3d3e33d6586?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1859900a-a460-4590-8e6d-e3d3e33d6586?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It displayed a box with "Unlock Full Game", which I thought was stupid because I had just bought the game. When I clicked it this happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3af6d0e4-e50e-4af5-85d4-0f1a5252a688?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3af6d0e4-e50e-4af5-85d4-0f1a5252a688?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have absolutely no idea what this means, and I can't join a realm either.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/031de329-a15b-425e-8886-cbae5d833320?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/031de329-a15b-425e-8886-cbae5d833320?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try putting the link into Google Chrome or Edge, it just displays the home screen of Minecraft. I'd like to add for the record that I think that having to buy Minecraft again just to play with friends on Xbox is extremely dumb, and those who have previously
 purchased Minecraft on other platforms should be able to reduce the price of new Minecraft with it or get some other reward. This is common sense, and I am absolutely baffled how a multi-billion dollar corporation can **** something as simple as Minecraft
 up so badly. If anyone could explain to me how to get my game to work, that would be greatly appreciated, otherwise I want a refund, even thought the terms and conditions state games are non-refundable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>David</p>

 computer with windows 10. I had followed the on-screen steps to set up the Dolby atmos for my home theater but on the drop down menu in the spatial sound section, only the following two options were available "Windows Sonic for headphones" &amp; "Dolby atmos for
 headphones". Even though I've connected my computer to the home theater system via a HDMI cable, the computer doesn't seem to recognize the home theater in the spatial sound section even though it should. I've tried troubleshooting, but that didn't work and

<p>I have tried all the steps given but my computer doesn't seem to recognize that the home theater is connected. I tried switching the ports for the HDMI cable on the home theater but the problem is still the same. As I've said before, the same home theater,
 cable, same port with the only exception being the windows versions (the computer with the problem is Win 10 pro while the other is Win 10 home)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed this as well that the option is available but is greyed out and I cannot opt it (please refer to the second picture). The first picture is the one desired option in the spatial sound option.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7346737c-bcf7-4362-be5e-8335e7c1cfa6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7346737c-bcf7-4362-be5e-8335e7c1cfa6?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e524d859-ac31-4e10-8b48-b6b7a4d816c7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e524d859-ac31-4e10-8b48-b6b7a4d816c7?upload=true" /></a></p>

<h2>            Wakeup from sleep still uncontrollable &#40;Windows 10, 64-bit&#41;</h2>
                    <p>When I switched to Windows 10, 64-bit over a year ago, I've had several problems with internal DVD drive, USB connectivity, startup menu, Cortana, etc. Almost all these problems&nbsp; have been resolved with no intervention of any kind from my side--automatic
 updates did the whole job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the problem of self wake up from sleep doesn't seem to be on the update list by far. I've tried several times the control panel settings related to wake-up timers, but no luck. When in sleep mode, my PC wakes up daily at the exact same time. However,
 it doesn't wake up when shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clue?</p>

<p>Of course it won't wake up when you shut it down. Shutting a PC down means totally killing all processes. That's what sleep mode is for, and that's why the PC will only wake up when on sleep mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all you can't wake a dead person, can you? same goes for computers.</p>

</p><p>However, for technical reporting reasons, I had to mention the shut down info firstly to answer any question that might be asked in order to identify source of the problem that I have. Secondly, I can be sure that the devices is "dead" only when I have it
 unplugged&nbsp; or at least have a mechanical power switch like good old days. With a software-controllable electronic switches and power supplies, I can never be so sure the dead can't be wakened!<br />

<h2>            Certain games won&#39;t work after a factory reset</h2>
                    in November 2017, my computer went through a factory reset. After recovering some of my files, I decided to reinstall some games I used to play. One game, Five Nights at Freddy's 1, won't work; When I launch it, the game won't work and it'll be stuck on
 a black screen. Another game in the same series works just fine which confuses me. If anybody could help me fix this problem, that would be great

</p><p>Learn how to do it:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-switch-from-32-bit-versions-of-windows-to/40d90c4e-8845-4bcb-bb2f-aeab312caf74"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to: Switch from 32 bit versions of Windows to Windows 10
 64 bit</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'</p>

 Microsoft account without making a local one. They are active with no other license required. I also received a laptop as a gift and I want to do the same

            <p>Oh, my question is, because my old pc uses a 32bit version of the os and my new pc uses a 64bit one can they work on the same license?
</p>
<p>Another: If I'm wrong and the bit version of the os doesn't matter does that mean that I can log into any preinstalled machine link my account with that license and use it as my own?

            <p>You can't transfer a licence and continue to use it on the previous device.</p>
<p>The licence being link to your account allows you to activate after a hardware change (if the licence allows it) and not swap between devices that are not already activated.</p>
<p>If you have already tried this then you need to check in Settings &gt; Update and security and select activation, and see what it states there. (you could find devices lose activation after a certain time in using a new device)</p>
<p>The licence on the original device is allowed to be used on either 32 or 64bit on that device.</p>
