<h2>            Adobe Reader stopped working.</h2>
                    A few seconds after I open a PDF file I get a message, "Adobe Reader has stopped working and will close."&nbsp; Then I am advised to download the new version of Adobe Reader. I've done this twice now but keep getting the same message.I feel to be going round
 in circles.<br />

<h2>            Windows store games are not so stable&#40;Acer Aspire One AO531h&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I 'm running Windows 10 Pro the official release on an Acer AO531h and it's a pretty old laptop.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2763b21-5015-4426-b202-bcd99ab2fc37" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e4a6fc7-5833-4456-83be-e8377e6375eb" /></p>
<p>I've downloaded some games from the Windows store and most of them are crashing or&nbsp;they are not so stable. I've downloaded Dungeon Hunter 5, Captain America:The Winter Soldier, Blitz Brigade, Age of Sparta, World At Arms. All of the apps are launching properly
 but Dungeon Hunter 5 is crashing at the beginning&nbsp;and Captain America after entering stage. Blitz Brigade is slow on some points when playing but overall it is stable, World at arms lags a little bit on battles and Age of Sparta is normal everywhere.&nbsp;At store
 it shows that I can play them if my CPU supports x86 or x64 and I support x86.</p>
<p>This is Captain America at the beginning when entering to&nbsp;the game.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22c24aba-74f4-4448-adea-2d4fc993d7c8" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a little search on the internet&nbsp;on how to&nbsp;optimize windows 10 for gaming, I disabled as much&nbsp;things I could but I still have problems. I understand that my laptop is old but windows is running really well,&nbsp;games is the problem.</p>

<h2>            Wait Command, Wait, Batch file, cmd file, .bat, .cmd</h2>
                    Hello, I am new to DOS and scripting. I am trying to make a batch file or .cmd file that will execute multiple setup.exe files, one after another. The problem i am having is that i can only find ways to delay based on TIME, rather than delay until the
 first instance of setup.exe has completed to start the next one. Is there a command the will allow me to execute the first, and then, once it is installed, execute the second. The reason that i need this to work like this is that the second .exe will not work
 if the first one has not already been completed. Thank you all.

    <title>After installation of the Windows 10 Creators Update&#58; Start Menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> holgerianus  say:</h3>
<h2>            After installation of the Windows 10 Creators Update&#58; Start Menu lost all programs apart from Store Apps</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>yesterday I installed the Creators Update with the Windows Upgrade tool. The installation process did go through flawlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after the installation all my programs went missing from the start menu with the exceptions of the "stock" apps and those apps I installed from the MS store (such as Facebook, Twitter, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program shortcuts are still there. They are in the proper place in \ProgramData\...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The programs also show up in "Programs &amp; Features" --- so they weren't uninstalled during the upgrade</p>
<p>
</p><p>ClassicShell finds the programs just fine. The programs can be started just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's the Windows start menu that refuses to display them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to resolve the issue. The cause was a "<strong>god mode</strong>" folder placed in
<strong>%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</strong>. To be more precise, I had a folder as well as a link to the "god mode" folder there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the removal of those 2 items, all programs are showing up now in the start menu and pinned programs/apps remain in the taskbar after reboot.</p>

<p>I was wondering, since I sold my old xbox, if I buy a new one, and sign in to my account, will I still have all of my content? I realize I will not have like my offline gameplay saves, but will I still have my online levels on the games I have played? I
 had my friend check my stats by looking in his friends list, and the stats are the same, as expected. But, when I purchase my new Xbox 360 console, and I sign in, all I should have to do is download my downloadable content, such as map packs, and I should
 be set, correct?&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Windows Backup seems to be working but it simply skips all files that are in a folder that synchronizes with OneDrive.&nbsp; All other files are backed up normally.&nbsp; I have reproduced this problem in three different laptops (all Windows 10 and latest Windows
 version). This problem began after a relatively recent Windows update.</p>
<p>

            Windows Backup knows what it is doing. Your OneDrive is backed up to the cloud, backing up to a local drive be catastrophic if you perform a future recovery. This would replace currently synced files in OneDrive with new ones, deleting important data. 
<br />
<br />Backup in the traditional sense is not how Microsoft views how you backup files in Windows 10. Its using the cloud to do so.

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Synchronizing is not the same as a backup.&nbsp; Backup has version history and can be stored separately.&nbsp; It is not "live" data.&nbsp; For example, if you accidentally erase all your pictures that were in a folder that synced with OneDrive (and 30 days pass without
 you realizing it) then you lost all of your pictures forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, Backup does not know what it is doing.&nbsp; As a matter of fact it does backs up one folder in my OneDrive.&nbsp; It fails with virtually everything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>

<br />Check this link, first you have to be sure that OneDrive is synchronized.

<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that does not address my issue.&nbsp; It is an answer to another issue.</p>
<p>Your link showed how to back up something TO OneDrive.&nbsp; I have not problem with working with OneDrive.&nbsp; What I want synchronized or saved to OneDrive is already there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I need is to backup my Documents folder (which synchronizes correctly with OneDrive) to another site (a network drive).&nbsp; The Backup application in Windows 10 fails to do this.&nbsp; It skips folders that are synchronized with OneDrive.&nbsp; It backs up other
 folders well.&nbsp; I could use another application, like iDrive, but I want to use Windows 10.</p>
<p>

 which I was having problems with since purchase. I also purchased Battlefront II, which I am going to try downloading now.

 a thread with all of the support steps they have had me try and keep getting responses from ambassadors and moderators that are repeats of steps I have already done. It is like they can not read or something. I will stay on this for a while keep hounding.&nbsp;
 Its like my grandma always said the squeaky wheel gets the grease.....

<p><span>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, right click CMD<br />
Click “Run as Administrator”<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: </span><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong><span><br />
<br />
This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.<br />
<br />
Restart your system.</span></p>

<p>You have to do system restore on most troublesome update installs, but you should do them asap.&nbsp; Microsoft is illegally modifying computers looking for pirated software.&nbsp; Uninstalling the updates still leaves the modification active.</p>
<p>Even though I run legal stuff on my PCs, I still like to test for illegal activities.&nbsp; At $125 Win7 Upgrade Family Pak on sale and &nbsp;$99 Office2010 Family Pak, everyone should be able to afford the legal software.</p>
<p>If you are that broke, Linux is great and FREE and OpenOffice is great and FREE!! I use both with a dual boot just to keep up with the new updates.</p>

</p><p>I know I have two accounts, but I cannot sign into the one that has my skype credit and VERY IMPORTANT skype to go number. It says it is going to send a code to my wifes email but it never arrives. I sent screen shots of her email windows to level 2 escalation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Support Help" then told me there was nothing they could do, to close the account which means I lose everything. THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE!!&nbsp; THEN.... it all started mysteriously working for several days after I downloaded skype classic.&nbsp; Now Skype signed me

<p>I am doing nothing different, using the same computer and same network I have had for 4 years and the same one as skype worked for several days last week. When I try to sign in it says&nbsp; I need to verify my account. The partial email they want to send a code
 to, appears to be my wife's, but she never gets it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried multiple times to get in through the alternate method, I do not know the answers to the 157 questions. (I created the account 10 years ago how can I remember all that crap?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I was logged in last week, I made sure the account emails were one of my two and my cell phone. My wife never gets the codes and I do not understand why they are not sending the code to one of MY email accounts or my phone.&nbsp; I have wasted so much time
 and energy on this I am ready to chew off my leg! I HATE what Microsoft has done to Skype!</p>

<p>I think I now know the problem causing me to be locked out of my account. My wife was going to make international calls from her work computer. She tried to sign in to my xxxxxxxxx account.&nbsp; Unaware of THE RIDICULOUS CONSEQUENCE MICROSOFT HAS PUT IN PLACE,
 she tried entering her her email address when prompted to do so. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can provide a location and computer IP address if needed to resolve this MICROSOFT CREATED ISSUE!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, she made a typo in entering the email address so it is not even hers, but Microsoft created a new Microsoft 'skype account that is not linked to my xxxxxxxxx account and we have no access to it because it is blocked and because it is not a
 real email address we cannot get the security codes there. Please see previous emails in this thread that shows all of our emails.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS IS JUST RIDICULOUS!!! When I am prompted for the tenth time to use alternate log in to reclaim access, am I supposed to be entering information about when and where my original skype howard.horner was created or this new bogus messed up one forced on
 us BY MICROSOFT???????&nbsp; Dont you think it would be IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE THAT INFORMATION in the 157 questions for alternative sign in??????????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who thought up this BS dual account system and TOTALLY BOTCHED THE ROLL OUT????&nbsp;&nbsp; FIRING AND PERMANENT CAREER BLACKBALLING WOULD NOT BE SEVERE ENOUGH PUNISHMENT!!!!!!</p>

            Yes, there is a lot of demand for either moving to old Skype or upgrade new Skype to match old Skype. Skype is expected to roll out new features at a faster rate and sooner or later, it would become better than new Skype 
<br />
<br />This is a temporary pain period for all Skype users. This is for better future.
<br />
<br />I would also recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers by following below help -

            <p><span>Hi Larry,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the delayed response.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To fix the issue with Internet Explorer and downloads from outlook.com.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to
<strong>disable Antivirus program </strong>on your computer and test the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>When you disable Antivirus:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Important Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases,
 you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your
 computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For most Antivirus programs, there is an icon
<strong><span>next to the clock in the task bar</span></strong>, you should be able to
<strong><span>right click</span></strong> the icon and either be able to disable it from there or you can go into the options and disable it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If the issue still persists, you can turn on your Antivirus program.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also test the issue by
<strong>uninstalling and reinstalling the Antivirus program.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Before uninstalling the Antivirus program make sure you have saved the license key for it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow the above suggestion and let us know the status of the issue.</span></p>

<h2>            Skype for Business &#47; Outlook 2013 no missed call notifications</h2>
                    <p>A few of our users are having a problem where they're not receiving Missed Call notification on their s4b client (Lync 2013 15.0.4933.1000) and in Outlook 2013. We're also running Lync Server 2013.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record one of these users is on Office 365 Exchange Online and other users are still using Email On premise (Exchange 2010).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In terms of troubleshooting, we have done the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Removed the&nbsp;sip folder from&nbsp;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Lync</p>
<p>2. Reinstalled Office 2013</p>
<p>3. Checked that 'Send an email message to my Inbox when I miss a phone call' is checked in Outlook Voicemail/Notifications settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't appear to be a global issue as working correctly for most other users.</p>

                    <p>I have two Dell Latitudes, both running the latest version of Windows 10, and latest drivers for graphics and wireless from Intel. While connected to a wireless display (via the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter) explorer.exe repeatedly crashes, with the

</p><p>The issue only occurs while connected to the wireless display. Windows 10 is up to date on both, and the wireless (Intel 7265) and graphics (Intel HD 5500) drivers have been uninstalled, then reinstalled with the latest available. The Display Adapter is
 running the most recent firmware. With everything up to date the crashes still occur, and occur for all users on the laptops. Has anyone else seen this issue and resolved it? Thanks.</p>

            <p>Also, there are some suspicious modules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might suggest to try to obtain a user mode dump which has the potential to pinpoint the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.<br />
<br />
If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file (save with the .reg extension and give it any name such as dump.reg), then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file&nbsp;at the time explorer.exe crashes&nbsp;should
 be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\explorer.exe]<br />
"DumpFolder"=hex(2):43,00,3a,00,5c,00,43,00,72,00,61,00,73,00,68,00,44,00,75,\<br />
00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00<br />
</strong></em><br />
<br />
After Explorer (explorer.exe) crashes, can you then make the .dmp file&nbsp;available (provide link)&nbsp;via a public folder on&nbsp;OneDrive (SkyDrive) or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a couple of links on using OneDrive (SkyDrive):</p>

<p>
</p><p>To stop the creation of the user mode dump files run the following registry file:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\explorer.exe]</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can delete the C:\CrashDumps folder anytime.</p>

<p>I'm from Estonia and as I remember, added locale as Other or Russia, but I lived here of all times. If I did it, can I change a Locale without of leaving billing because I have some credit in my account and I want to pay for some games?</p>

<h2>            xbox360 controller voor PC</h2>
                    
<p>Aangezien dark souls voor een prikkie op steam te krijgen was en dat spel niet echt lekker speelt met een muis, heb ik mijn xbox360 controller afgestoft en aan mijn pc gehangen. En ik krijg hem niet aan de praat.</p>
<p>Het gaat hier om een draadloze witte controller zoals je die kreeg toen de xbox360 net uit was. Er kunnen batterijen in maar nu zit er zo'n oplaadbare accu in. Met google kwam ik al snel op support.xbox.com uit, waar ik zag dat je een zogenaamde receiver
 nodig hebt. Die heb ik niet, het enige wat ik heb is de usb oplader, en omdat dat toch een usb kabel is die dus signalen kan verzenden heb ik die er maar aan gehangen en het algemene stuurprogramma gedownload. Mijn windows7 64-bit computer herkent dit als
 een "Xbox 360 Wireless Controller via Play &amp; Charge Kit" onder apparaatbeheer maar voor de rest gebeurt er niet veel.</p>
<p>Eigenlijk weet ik zelf best waar dit op uitdraait maar voor alle zekerheid post ik dit hier maar. Enige creatieve oplossingen? Het moge duidelijk zijn dat ik niet zo'n idiote receiver ga kopen die meer kost dan het spel en ook nergens meer te krijgen is.
 Zou ik misschien een soort receiver uit mijn xbox360 kunnen slopen met een beetje knutselwerk?</p>

<p>Daar staat namelijk precies hetzelfde, alleen niet de woorden usb oplaad kabel.</p>
<p>Je hebt hier de instructies van de bedrade controller. Ik dacht inderdaad dat draadloos + usb oplader zou werken als een bedrade controller maar bij mij is dat dus niet het geval. Op de controller blijft het gehele rondje geel knipperen (langzaam) alsof
 hij draadloos verbinding probeert te maken, en joy.cpl herkent geen controllers.</p>
<p>Je zegt dat dit voor jou werkt maar *** weet je dat dan? Op je gamer profile zie ik voor pc alleen dark souls staan en er staat op dit moment dat je die niet gespeeld hebt.</p>

<p>Ik heb mijn controller gecontroleerd, het is niet de standaard oplaad kabel waarmee ik die van mij aansluit. Ik heb de doos van mijn controller erbij gehaald en daar staat specefiek op geschikt voor Windows. Ik denk dat daar het verschil in zit. Blijkbaar
 verstuurd deze usb oplaad kabel wel stroom en communicatie. Ik kan alleen niet achterhalen of wat er speciaal is aan de kabel om je daar over in te lichten. Succes

<p>Je hebt gelijk, het zijn mijn zaken niet waar je je controller voor gebruikt. Ik was wel even verbaasd want ik heb die support pagina van onder tot boven doorgespit zonder iets bruikbaars te vinden, en dan lees ik ineens dat er gewoon een stukje over een
 usb oplader staat. Maar dat was dus niet zo.</p>
<p>Jij hebt dus een speciale controller voor windows, die van mij komt rechtstreeks van de xbox, dus daar zal het verschil wel in zitten. Op internet zie ik veel mensen met dit probleem. Dat slaat natuurlijk nergens op, maar *** moet ome Bill anders aan z'n

            They first go into the Recycle Bin of the networked computer.&nbsp; You may be able to find them there.&nbsp; If they aren't there, check the Recycle Bin on the computer that issued the delete command (though I don't think they go there - it's still worth a look).<br />
<br />
If the Recycle bins have been emptied or you did a shift-delete then you'll need to use the data recovery programs provided by Mr. Murphy - but check the Recycle Bins first since that's much easier - well that's not necessarily entirely true.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;you have Vista Business, Vista Ultimate, or Vista Enterprise you may be in luck because they retain files called Shadow Copies
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Previous-versions-of-files-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Previous-versions-of-files-frequently-asked-questions</a>.&nbsp; These can be used to retrieve previous versions of files that have been accidentally modified or deleted.<br />
<br />
If you have Vista Basic or Vista Premium you do not have Shadow Copies, but there is a free program available for you that does essentially the same thing called Shadow Explorer:
<a href="http://www.shadowexplorer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.shadowexplorer.com/</a>.&nbsp; I suggest you download and implement it ASAP to protect you in case you accidentally delete or modify a file.&nbsp; It won't help you in this instance, but it may save you the next time.<br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope this helps!

So-called deleted files are really not deleted.
<p>The pointer to the file's blocks on the hard drive is added to the free-space list in the file directory, and this space, ''may'', eventually, be re-used for new files.&nbsp;<br />
They are eventually overwritten by new files.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Listed below are a couple of very good FREE Programs for Data/File Recovery.<br />
<br />
Read their reviews, and make your choice with which one you are happy working with.<br />
<br />
1. Stop using that computer; as you will overwrite the lost files, which are not&nbsp;lost, until they are overwritten..<br />
<br />
2. Preferably Slave your Hard Drive in another computer, install one of the Recovery Programs in that computer, and read your Drive from there.<br />
<br />
3. Or put your Hard Drive in a USB External Hard Drive Enclosure, attach it&nbsp; to another&nbsp; computer, and do the same as in 2.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can install the software and run it in your computer, but that risk of overwriting the “deleted” files
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>is still there.</span><br />

            Right Click the Speaker - click&nbsp;Recording Devices - <strong>Highlight your mic</strong> - then click Properties on lower right.<br />
<br />
Or instead of Highlight just Double Click the Mic there.<br />
<br />
You may also have an Audio Manager by some name in Control Panel.<br />
<br />
The problem could also be with the mic.<br />
