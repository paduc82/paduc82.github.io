<h2>            Destiny, No pause&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all.&nbsp; What Were devs thinking, not having a pause game option! This is way beyond my comprehension. I think this lack of implementation in modern games is unforgivable. Online games only? This is why I wont buy new elderscrolls, skyrim game. This sux,
 because I like to play with myself. If you know what I mean,lol.</p>
<p>I like to have a break from time to time, you know, refreshment break, ect....</p>
<p>Is this something that could possibly be patched later on?</p>

<p>Next question..&nbsp; How do you save your current&nbsp; progress to last checkpoint?&nbsp; Or do I have to finish each mission?</p>
<p>Last night the connection dropped out (again) near the end of a mission, which, on my return, bought me back to the launch screen to start again!</p>
<p>All comments appreciated.</p>

<p>There has never been a pause option in MMO style games, the whole idea is to give you a living, persistent world that continues on even when your making a sandwich.</p>
<p>Missions have checkpoints that auto save so you can resume them. Just go back to orbit, pick mission and you'll see options to "resume" or "restart"</p>

<h2>            Spammers&#47;Bots joining into group discussions, spam despite being blocked</h2>
                    Group chat I'm in where moderation is gone has spammers who have joined it because a feature changed where chats could just be joined without proper invites or whatever. Spammers, even when reported and blocked, continue just spamming unhindered and still
 cause alerts to pop up when they do spam, messages, files, images aren't blocked at all. Short of leaving the chat, is there much I can do about this or just leave the chat and cut off communication, defeating the purpose of skype?

            The spammers are blocked but their messages are still getting through completely unhampered and reporting them does absolutely nothing.<br />
This has been a persistant problem for upwards of two years. This answer and inability to do anything about it is unacceptable.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Skype 8 is host-less, I'm afraid we do not have a way to moderate the group chat like how you do it in Skype version 7 or the so-called classic Skype. This is the reason why I referred you to our feedback hub as our developers are checking feedback
 from our customers through that channel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the spamming issues with your group, we do not have a way to moderate it since everybody in the group can add any Skype user to it. In addition if your group's share link was provided to people, then anyone can join the group and leave a message
 to it. So the best suggestion I can provide is for you to migrate to a new group and delete the group full of spammers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for understanding the matter.</p>

<p>So is the skype team is now completely incapable of permanently banning someone spamming scam sites and child pornography in group chats, even when they haven't received a link and got in because of an earlier vulnerability?</p>
<p>Are you admitting reporting users does nothing?</p>

            Hello, Everything is fine except sometimes if you restart the computer using a program or a script, it will say Windows is restarting and continue forever until I have to hard boot. &nbsp;I bought the computer from HP. &nbsp;The system is fine, obviously this is
 a common problem as I am reading it more and more on the web, &nbsp;hopefully this can be fixed eventually with an update. &nbsp;Anyway Questions so far answered... &nbsp;1. No error message, just tries to restart and gets stuck restarting with spinnning dots on screen.&nbsp;
<div>2. &nbsp;There is nothing else connected to computer when this happens.</div>
<div>3. &nbsp;It is a fresh install and it still happens.</div>
<div>4. &nbsp;It is a HP DV6-7247 with an I7-3260 processor.</div>
<div>5. &nbsp;I have checked all logs, etc there are no errors, no problems are showing anywhere. &nbsp;My educated guess is pointing to something with the secure boot. &nbsp;When I disable secure boot it does not happen any more. &nbsp;</div>
<div>6. &nbsp;This has happened several times, but when booting fresh it is fine, only when I try to restart the system. &nbsp;I have already installed all updates, and I am waiting for a new one to fix this issue. &nbsp;My colleagues are also experiencing this issue on many
 new computers, Any more questions?&gt;</div>
<div>I am using &nbsp;windbg to try to find anything but there are really no errors showing up anywher, eventlogs clean, etc. C:/windows/logs - clean, appdata/local - nada, appdata/roaming nothing. &nbsp;</div>
<div>Computer came with windows 8 on it. &nbsp;I plan to upgrade to Pro but not if this problem still exists.</div>

<p>Thanks for sharing this. I myself almost cannot believe these are game graphics. I mean I know that since they only have one car when they show it off like that it's obvious they can devote more memory to graphics. They don't need other cars or space for
 A.I of physics. But this is still so damn impressive that my mind wants to think they tricked it and filmed a real car and we are just being taking on a tour. Yet I saw them demo it and when they open the door and get in you can tell it's not real. But still.
 This is so damn impressive. It is the best I have ever seen. Period. </p>
<p>I know the on track graphics probably wont be this high (They will have like 7 other cars and track and scenery and A.I and physics to worry about. So it will most likely be lower poly counts then this "Garage" view but still. Hot Damn.) &nbsp;They still looking
 impressive too. All around straight up mind blowing impressive. </p>

<p>One thing that I find interesting about that video is that if you look at the surface of the mountain road, in particular the specular reflection when the sun hits it, it's being rendered as glass-smooth...there's no breakup at all. &nbsp;I wonder if this means
 that the road surfaces will feel that way when driving as well, much like they did in Forza 3. &nbsp;At the risk of sounding like a fanboy, that's one thing they got right in GT5...the roads are not perfect, and you feel the little bumps and cracks and imperfections.</p>

<p>Looks really nice. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I might put some off when I say this, but for Microsoft to have such a gem in their gaming arsenal (Forza Franchise) they need to address their wheel options. &nbsp;I really want to pick this game up but after being spoiled with PS3 and their wide selection of
 wheels, I can't see myself playing with the MS wheel of current!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*I know about Fanatec, but I also know that MS can make a better wheel with features to accompany the games potential, shifter, clutch, 900 degrees etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry OP, I started getting off topic.</p>

<p>How is it going Snowowl?&nbsp; I havent seen you around in a LONG time!&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes the game is looking so dang good and most of the features I asked for are actually in F4.
</p>
<p>Here are some of the features confirmed that are in F4 that many of us asked for.
</p>
<p>-Vinyls and information from F3 carries over to F4.&nbsp; By far the best news after hours in the vinyl editor.</p>
<p>-16 players in multiplayer </p>
<p>-Backfire with flames</p>
<p>-We get to pick our prize cars</p>
<p>-Moving spoilers and body parts</p>
<p>-Day / dawn indicating possible change in time of day. Maybe night racing??</p>
<p>-Improved tire physics. Hopefully this fixes a lot of traction issues in F3.&nbsp; </p>
<p>-Autocross is back finally!!!!</p>
        </p>

<p>&lt;waving&gt; &nbsp;I've been around more than you might think. &nbsp;LOL! &nbsp;We don't have details on the importing yet, but I would imagine some of it is going to be limited. &nbsp;They've already indicated layer groups (Vinyls) and bonus stuff is based on a certain criteria
 (unannounced so people can't fudge it).</p>
<p>Maybe night racing, we don't know yet and Turn 10 is still saving some "reveal" stuff. &nbsp;What has been said is different times of day - "day" being between sunrise and sunset. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You are opening a file that is in binary with NotePad. Check your Shortcut - Right Click it - Properties<br />
- Shortcut tab&nbsp;- Target line and make sure nothing is after the notepad.exe .<br />
<br />
If you click on a file type and it opens in notepad then you need to un-associate that file type with<br />
notepad.<br />

====================================<br />

<h2>            How to bypass uac for specific programs for standard users</h2>
                    <p><span>My daughter recently bought Test Drive Unlimited 2 and was so looking forward to playing it unfortunately due to
 the User Account settings she is unable to play it unless I allow it as an administrator. As I work away from home during the week she is unable to play it unless I give her my password which I will not do. I tried using the task scheduler to dreate a shortcut
 and it works fine on my desktop but when I copied it to the public desktop folder or even her desktop folder it just flashes up a small window, I am at my wits end trying to get it to work and so is my son as she keeps wanting to play the game on his XBox</span></p>

This procedure does not work with every program that requires elevated privileges, but hopefully it will cover your needs. You will still receive a UAC warning, but you should be able to click through it.

            Thanks for the reply but the f@~$%(g shortcut sitll asks for the my password clicking though it just says the password is incorrect and won't stop unless i put my password in or close the UAC box which stops the game running.
 i had another look tonight and even tried the application compatibility toolkit the shorcuts work fine on my desktop but still refuse to work on my daughter, i've even tried setting the shortcuts up on her login but no joy. Bring back windows XP this makes
 the idea of dual booting more attractive every day if a simple game that was brought out after Windows Vista (which has worse UAC Controls than 7) cannot run bring back XP

<h2>            How to I get a DVD icon on my desktop&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Could someone please suggest how I could get a DVD icon on my Windows 7 desktop&nbsp;every time&nbsp;I insert a DVD in my optical drive? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I use Windows 7 Home Basic edition on my desktop computer. &nbsp;Until about a few months ago, inserting a DVD into the computer's optical drive use to make a DVD icon to appear on the desktop. &nbsp;For DVD movies, I would use this icon to play the movie, or to
 eject the DVD. &nbsp;But now-a-days no such icon appears. &nbsp;(Although the DVD can be accessed alright from Windows Explorer.) &nbsp;Is there a setting somewhere that I could use to get the icon back?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            That wasn’t what I was looking for, but your reply was still helpful because it reminded me of what I was missing: Roxio DVD burner! &nbsp;The icon in question was Roxio’s fancy desktop widget, which lights up every time a disk is inserted in the optical drive.

    <title>Problems Streaming Music to a SmartTV via Media Player WMP NetworkSvc - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems Streaming Music to a SmartTV via Media Player WMP NetworkSvc</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've hit a rather frustrating issue when setting up Window Media Player as a DLNA server for my Samsung Smart TV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst I have been able to successfully set up sharing for Videos/Recorded TV, and Pictures, I just cannot get the TV to pick up any music from the Windows Media Server I've configured on my main home PC, although my main PC will happily allow a Windows
 7 laptop I also have to play the music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't appear to be an issue with the TV, because that can connect quite happily to the Windows 7 laptop which I also configured as a Windows media server and it will consume music from that device without a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've managed to eliminate the following as issues on the main PC:</p>
<p>1) Firewall - I've disabled the firewall and I'm still having problems.</p>
<p>2) File formats - I installed an alternative DLNA server and that definitely allows the TV to consume my music files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm gravitating towards a file/directory permissions issue, but I've checked these across the directories containing the videos and pictures, and nothing looks "odd". The WMPNetworkSvc user appears to have access to the directory where my music is stored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts no what the issue may be?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul</p>

            <p>I would agree that it probably is a file permission issue. I have the exact same issue however I realized that SkyDrive was causing the file permission issue. I store all my burned music disks on SkyDrive to use as cloud storage. This was handy since I like
 to reinstall the operating system from time to time. After the fresh operating system install I then install the SkyDrive application and download my music to the main local hard drive from SkyDrive. I am able to then stream music to all my DLNA compatible
 TVs in the house. One day I deleted just SkyDrive and noticed that although the music was still on the PC hard drive the TVs would not recognize any music. So I took one of the physical music disks, burned it again to the hard drive and what do you know...The
 TV only recognized the music disk I burned and no other music downloaded from my SkyDrive. Needless to say I stopped using SkyDrive because of this. If you are using Windows 8 or 8.1 SkyDrive is integrated into the OS and cannot be removed. Again, not sure
 if this is your issue but I would suspect it to be a something with your file permissions. It seems that Microsoft puts special permissions on music files when they are uploaded to the SkyDrive cloud storage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;another note, all the pictures and video I downloaded from SkyDrive to my local hard drive were still able to be viewed on the TVs after removing the SkyDrive application, just not the music. Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hi - thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked all the permissions and nothing looks amiss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my case, I have my music stored on a separate internal drive (E:\music), which has been added to the Music library . This is a different configuration to the laptop (which works without a problem) where music gets stored in "My Music" folder on the local
 C: drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, if I copy music into one of the Video or Picture folders (which the TV can pick up without an issue), the music files still aren't seen&nbsp;by the TV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Permissions look identical across the laptop and the server PC, so I'm wondering if the music location the root cause?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said - if I disable the WMP "feature" via ControlPanel-&gt;Programs and Windows Features, reboot, and then restart it, then the&nbsp;TV can see the music files on my E: drive - however this doesn't&nbsp;last beyond a subsequent reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Definitely looks like it's an issue with the WMPNetworkSvc rather than the TV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks like I need to rethink what I'm going to use as my DLNA Server.</p>

<p>Gamers were told that the new update adds paypal to your choice of purchase as in you can use paypal to buy stuff off XBL instead of giving them your card information. And it also has something to do with memory for the firmware. And I was told that the
 update bans anyone with a modded xbox now instead of letting them play. If they modded their xbox, they will be banned and cannot get back online. same thing goes for future xbox games that has been burnt onto the disc to play like Call of duty Black Ops way
 before it was released</p>

<p>I did the update the 18th or 19th and it worked fine my console still works it's the new slim which I'm seeing lots of people say the update messed up this version of the console as well but I haven't had any issues.</p>
<p>My games seem to load faster and I am able to chat in a party while in a separate game which I was having issues with that in Feb but not now so I'm pleased.</p>

<p>Well mine won't finish updating. Something went wrong and the update just stopped. After I tried again it won't do it. I lost the connection to xbox live and when I test the connection, it says I need to update, and when I try to update it says it can't
 connect. Somehow I got in a loop of fml. </p>

<p>To Terd Ferguson 18, I would suggest contacting Microsoft and they will help you through the process. Hundreds of players have experienced this issue with the update but not all xbox are the same. they are all different. Anyways, some players that had the
 issues are because of a modded xbox which is banning players now. But other than that, Microsoft should help you out.</p>

</p><p>I<span>&nbsp;would suggest you to follow the steps provided and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: <strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Try disk cleanup and check if the issue gets fixed.</span></strong></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk Cleanup reduces number of unnecessary files on your device. It deletes temporary files and system files, empty recycle bin, and remove a variety of other items that you might no longer need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following Microsoft article and follow the suggestions from the article<span>.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>If your issue still persists, proceed to Method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Try deleting the file in safe mode and check</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Safe mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly.

<h2>            Recovering a hidden library from the &#34;Other Libraries&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been using Windows Media Player to stream my media to my computer at work. It had been working fine for a while, but recently, additional media I had added to my home library was not appearing when I accessed the library at work, even after selecting
 "refresh my connection." By mistake, while troubleshooting, I right clicked on the library and selected "remove from list." Since then, I have not been able to add my home library back to my work computer's "Other Libraries" section.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried unlinking my Sign in ID, I am also able to see my home computer when I run the internet streaming diagnostic tool, and I can still access several files I had streamed previously by going to the jump list of Windows Media Player. I have also
 read through&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Stream-your-media-over-the-Internet-using-Windows-Media-Player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Stream-your-media-over-the-Internet-using-Windows-Media-Player</a>&nbsp;and the links associated
 with it, and was unable to find a solution there.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for your help,</div>
<div>John</div>

            Thank you for the suggestion. I did not try that, though I believe that would have worked. I found out the solution to my problem while playing around in Windows Media Player today. In order to recover a computer that has been removed from "Other Libraries"
 in the Windows Media Player navigation pane, I need to right click in the navigation pane, select "Customize Navigation Pane" Within that window, there is a dropdown button at the top (which I missed previously) by default it is set to the local library. Instead,
 I selected the "Other Libraries" option, which had my hidden computer as a checkbox. I then re-checked it off and was able to access those files.
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your help and patience with my issue</div>

    <title>Cd&#39;s Sound is distorted when played back and ripped. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> origin of symmetry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cd&#39;s Sound is distorted when played back and ripped.</h2>
                    I have had my windows 7 laptop for about 6 months now, and since I have bought it, I have ripped many many Cd's to my laptop with no problem. But now, 6 months on, when I put Cd's in the drive and play them, the sound comes out all muffled and distorted.
 It's not actually the speakers, as I can play the music already on my windows media player perfectly fine. And I even checked if it was just windows media player by trying the Cd's in iTunes also and the same problem&nbsp;occured.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not damage the exterior or interior of the laptop in anyway. This just seemed to have happened. If anyone could help me out and give me a hand in fixing this problem, I would be very grateful.<br />
<br />
[Edit]: Could the problem be originating in the actual disc drive in my laptop? broken or misplaced part?<br />
<br />
[Re-Edit]: I have tried another CD and it has worked fine. Two of the other three CD's I have used we're Warner Bros. (Harry Potter IV &amp; V). This is unusual enough as it is, but the fact is, I have ripped Harry Potter VI soundtrack before. Any suggestions on
 how to fix this or at least why this is happening?<br />
thank you.

<p>This issue has affected a lot of people.</p>
<p>I am on a Toshiba Satellite, however, have had the above issue of cracking since first use. Bought brand new Dec 09.</p>
<p>I also have the same drive<strong> TSSTcorp CDDVDW TS-L633C.</strong></p>
<div>
<p>I have just updated the Firmware to TF03, got from Toshiba.&nbsp; May be worth checking out for other manufacturers.</p>
<p>http://aps2.toshiba-tro.de/kb0/TSB0502VV0000R01.htm</p>
<p>It appears to to have fixed the issue, as CDs which played distorted before are not now.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

Some enforcement actions including, but not&nbsp;limited to&nbsp;24 Hour communications suspensions and Console Suspensions are not reviewable.&nbsp;You can find more information in these cases through the communication sent by the teams to the email address associated with your Xbox Live Gamertag. Remember that all suspensions are only enforced when a breach of the <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Code of Conduct</a> or <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Services Agreement</a> has happened.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>That said, it's possible the suspension was extended.&nbsp;Have you seen any more information in regards to this suspension in your email inbox associated with your Microsoft Account? Please be sure to check your spam folders as sometimes the communication can be sent there instead. It's very possible the suspension on your account is not listed on the enforcement website, but was communicated to you via email instead. Our chat teams can also take a closer look and let you know if you have any current enforcement actions.</p><p><br /></p><p>_______________________________________________________</p>

            <p>Did not work for me either. Using Microsoft Money Plus Sunset Deluxe. Supposed to be compatible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Error message says --&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">Money requires Internet Explorer 6 to function properly. Please reinstall Internet Explorer 6 so these components

</p><p>A post in another forum says to make a registry change, but I'm reluctant. ----</p>
<p>
</p><p>
To resolve the error, try the following registry hack:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Registry Editor (RegEdit).</li><li>Navigate to the following registry key:
<p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer</strong></p>
</li><li>In the right pane, look for&nbsp;<strong>Version</strong>&nbsp;registry value.</li><li>Modify the value date to&nbsp;<strong>9.11.10240.0</strong>.</li></ol>

            <p>Search the web for:<span>&nbsp; </span>Microsoft Compatibility Center ms money</p>
<p>
</p><p>It shows WIN10 is compatible with several versions of MS Money, including mine, Microsoft Money Plus Sunset Deluxe</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, let’s hope MS feels compelled to fix WIN10 to work with MS Money.&nbsp; My version worked fine with WIN8.1&nbsp; Now it wants me to install IE6 !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to future upgrades, unforeseen issues, etc., I'm not keen on the idea of changing the registry unless MS announces that is the official fix.</p>

            <p>Spent all morning 10 AM - to about 2 PM with&nbsp;Microsoft &nbsp;support via chat. Issue same or similar to what is being discussed here. Had Windows 7 Home Premium computer came with and Microsoft Money Plus version 17 (also came with computer).&nbsp; No issues. Updated
 to Windows 10 yesterday. This morning Money didn't open "It requires IE6, Please, reinstall IE6" or something to the effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, technical support referred me to your (this)&nbsp;discussion for solutions. </p>
<p>Finally their solution was to remotely switch me back to Windows 7 Home Premium. (I guess the connection and chat was lost in the process as I never heard back from them.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now notice that my I Explorer&nbsp; remains version 11 though.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, with Windows 7 HP and IE11 Money opens and works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just sharing my experience.</p>

            <p>Hängt davon ab wo der Fehler her kommt.</p>
<p>Gestern gab es zum Beispiel zeitweise Probleme mit den Datenservern und da kam bei einigen der Fehler.</p>
<p>Wenn du das Problem häufiger hast - Dann würde ich gucken das du zum einen den NAT-Typen permanent auf Offen gestellt bekommst - Teredo-Filter deaktiviert ist. Gegebenenfalls mal einen Werksreset machen.</p>
<p>Bist du im Previewprogramm? - Dann dich dort austragen.</p>

            The camera is enabled in UEFI. Surface Diagnostic Toolkit did not, unfortunately, perform any tests on the cameras. Everything else performed correctly.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, as a student, I rely on this device and so sending it in to see if a technical fault can be found is probably a no go. So it's an issue I may just have to live with!

<p>Microsoft, if you are listening, there have been many requests for this same information that have gone completely UNANSWERED and without even a single reply from any Microsoft personnel. Come on, YOU can do BETTER than this!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea why your software keeps asking me for this passkey in order to run only some but not all of the "Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tools" but I really would like it to NEVER ask for this as it means that if I want or need to use your "Microsoft
 Support Diagnostic Tools" I CANNOT use them unless I contact Microsoft support to ask for a "Support Key" which is NOT an easy task to do AND I should not have to pay $100 for tech support from some third party you all outsource to in order to get this "passkey."
 It is time-consuming and I wish I could just run the automated "Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tools" on my own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>**************************************************************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p>MY RECOMMENDATION:</p>
<p>Microsoft you should have an automated site where an end-user can go and request AND receive a "Support Key" to run these&nbsp;"Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tools" WITHOUT needing to contact you all or spend hours of wasted time searching your websites.</p>
<p>**************************************************************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There you have it. Can you please issue me a&nbsp;"Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool Support Key" so I can run the Aero&nbsp;"Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool" since it stopped working?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Frustrated with Needless Hoops to Jump Through : &lt;</p>

            <div>Hello Traveler4God&nbsp;</div>
<div>You certainly make valid points in your post concerning the ability to run msdt.exe (Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool), but the tool's functionality has been provided mainly in view of allowing Microsoft Support Professionals to assist users, which is
 why it first requires one to contact Microsoft Support and obtain a valid passkey. Nevertheless, Microsoft
<i>has</i> provided tools that a self-reliant user such as you so obviously are can utilize to troubleshoot problems. Have you tried initiating a session at the Self-help section of the
<a href="https://home.diagnostics.support.microsoft.com/SelfHelp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Support Diagnostics</a> site? There are many helpful tool packages available there to any user with a free Microsoft Account (formerly known as a Windows Live ID, Passport, etc. - the account one must have to post in these forums, in other words).
 A user simply needs to follow the site's directions "To create a new diagnostic session, select a diagnostic package from the list below"; the "Learn More" links below each package will open the Knowledge Base article applicable to the particular troubleshooting
 package one selects, which typically provide useful insight as well as information (such as search terms) that can be used to further research a problem. There's some more information available in the KB2672837 article "<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2672837/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft
 Diagnostics Services—Self-Help diagnostic portal</a>". &nbsp;Hope this helps, and that you enjoy successful troubleshooting!</div>

<p><span>That got me into a process me download and create a MicroStupid Portable Troubleshooting Suite. They say it is filled with 26 individual troubleshooters and FixIt programs selectable from
 a generated list that is descriptive as to what they all are supposed to fix. I hope one of them can fix your problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I'm trying to fix a sound problem on one of my clients computers. You would not believe how many **** told me to fix the diagnostics tool all you have to do is run the DIAGNOSTICS. Genious!!!</span></p>

            There is no relationship between the executable for running the power troubleshooter and the executable for running msdt.&nbsp; For that dialog to have appeared in the manner described, there must be severe damage to the operating system for which a full reinstallation
 would be the only remedy.

<p>
</p><p>You can download it directly on the Windows Store app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if it works.</p>
