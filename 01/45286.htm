    <title>Flashing toolbar icons - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Flashing toolbar icons</h2>
                    I've just installed windows 10 today and for some reason the icons on my toolbar now keep flashing. The icons all go together so it's not just one icon that does it. Is there anything I can do to stop this from happening?

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the forum you could get help, advices etc. but for Microsoft software and products. For each 3rd party software the support should come from the company created that software. If you have a communication with that company and their support tell you about
 issue working with Windows (or Microsoft software), they should provide also logs from their software to prove what they mean. (Also this information goes to Microsoft support, then if needed to the developers).</p>

<h2>            error code 0x80070035 network path not found__unable to conect to internet&#47;network</h2>
                    I have been succsufully using a d-link router (DIR-655)&nbsp;and d-link wireless adapter (WDA-160) with windows 7 on a new PC. Two week of use and now wireless adpater cannot connect to internet and netowrk, however network and other computers are visible via
 wireless adapter. Other computer (laptop) conects to internet and PC is visible in network.<br />
Called D-link - tech says wait for updated drivers for windows 7. Okay.<br />
Installed old 2-wire adpater with updated drivers from 2-wire compatible with Windows 7 - same problem exists.<br />
<br />
No internet connection and error as noted above when trying to contect to other computers on network - thus writing this 'help request'&nbsp;from the laptop that is connected.<br />
<br />
Yes - reinstalled all devices, drivers, updates, rebooted router, called internet provider, called d-link.<br />
tried two different wireless adapters with same problem.<br />
<br />
Any advise or solutions would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<h2>            Wrong Engraving on controller  They refused to fix.</h2>
                    &nbsp;I was in need of a new controller.&nbsp; &nbsp;and I saw the Design Lab which I thought that's pretty neat.&nbsp; &nbsp;I made a custom controller and it cost more than a regular controller because it's custom.&nbsp; &nbsp;and I had an engraving put on it. they put quotation marks
 around my name. I did not put quotation marks around my name. and I find that highly offencive.&nbsp; I contacted them and they said I put them there&nbsp; and they refuse to do anything about it. I paid extra money for this and they messed up a simple Engraving.&nbsp; &nbsp;the
 quotation marks are insulting to the highest level.&nbsp; &nbsp;I suggest to not pay for the custom controller through design labs. I will be sure to spread this further on the internet. I have many followers on every social media accounts that are gamers.

            Sorry you had a bad experience but apparently the quotation marks were on the request.&nbsp; I ordered a design labs controller and it went perfectly so telling people not to order because you had a bad experience is probably not the best thing to do.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

            <span>I went through the order process again and looked at the preview the same way I typed it up before in on the screen there was no quotation marks just like it was before. They are claiming I put those
 quotation Mark's there which I'd entirely did not. Why would I do that? I'm not asking for anything for free I would be more than happy to send the controller back for them to fix it. To them the piece of plastic cost basically Pennies on the dollar did you
 just take the face off and replace it with a new one without the quotation marks. I would even be happy to pay for the shipping. I 100% did not put those quotation marks there and those quotation marks are highly insulting.</span>

<p>As far as I can tell both from previous experience &amp; checking there the default is an empty box for you to type in what you want engraved - there is no default to add quotation marks in.&nbsp; Is it possible that in trying to type a different special character
 your keyboard settings have not corresponded to the key you've pressed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the cost basis, afraid to say that what you see as "pennies" is actually a legit cost, from your perspective it seems meaningless, on the bigger picture if 10,000 people want that to happen then those pennies soon become dollars on a significant scale.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You sure that C6270A is the right model number?&nbsp;Is it a Scanjet or a combination<br />
printer/scanner.<br />
<br />
As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of the scanner&nbsp;or&nbsp;printer and <br />
their&nbsp;supplied drivers. Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation and <br />
drivers, and ask in their forums. <br />
<br />
Try the HP Print and Scan Doctor for Windows<br />

Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

    <title>Printer driver will not install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimhopkinson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer driver will not install</h2>
                    <p>My Epson Stylus photo R265 has run successfully on my Acer aspire OS windows 7 64bit for many years. After a recent windows update the printer suddenly stopped working and the driver has been replaced with a generic high speed printer driver. After a couple
 of hours tinkering, I found I could not update the driver through windows 7, could not download a new driver from epson and couldn't get the print spooler to start. I also could not use restore or recovery to reset the OS to an earlier (working perfectly)
 date. After several more hours of looking on forums and editing registry , I had managed to overcome the error 1068 and start the print spooler. This allowed me to download a new driver. However because this was assigned to a virtual USB I could not print
 anything and whatever I tried to change settings resulted in an error 0x00000709. Having twiddled a bit more to remove the driver and update a new one this resulted in a restart that put me back to square 1. No driver, no print spooler, no restore or recovery.</p>
<p>Sorry about the length of this post but my life is ebbing away and I would be grateful if someone could tell me is this part of the war Microsoft is waging to get us to upgrade to Windows 10 in which I am DEFINITELY NOT INTERESTED!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help someone.</p>

<p>At this point, you've done so much tinkering, registry editing, and twiddling, it's impossible to know where to start giving you instructions on how to get things going.&nbsp; At this point, I think you need to go right to the step of completely resetting the
 Windows printing subsystem to its initial default state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside before starting that, what happened when you attempted to use System Restore to an earlier (working perfectly) date?&nbsp; It's possible that there's something else going on in your system than just printer driver issues.&nbsp; And what do you mean by
 "recovery"?&nbsp; What did you try to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that your system is not otherwise compromised, Microsoft used to have a handy automated "Fixit" tool for resetting the printing subsystem.&nbsp; You can read about it here:&nbsp;
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2793718/you-experience-print-spooler-error-messages-after-installing-or-upgrad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2793718/you-experience-print-spooler-error-messages-after-installing-or-upgrad</a> and in more detail here:&nbsp;

https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askperf/2012/02/24/microsoft-fixit-for-printing/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, if you click on one of the Fixit download buttons at KB2793718, you'll see the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>If you are redirected to this article when you click the
<span>Download</span>&nbsp;button of a “Fix it” solution in a Microsoft Knowledge Base article, this means that the solution has been retired and is no longer supported.</em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, however, the "guts" of the Fixit have been preserved as a PowerShell script.&nbsp; You can see an allusion to this at the bottom of KB2793718 under "More information."&nbsp; The link there to codeplex.com is itself outdated because codeplex is shutting
 down.&nbsp; The data has now been moved to <a href="https://github.com/jdickson289/Print-Reset-Tool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p><span>A few comments on the instructions on that page.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>As I wrote above, I think you will need to run the "full" option.&nbsp; This will require a reboot of your computer and remove ALL of your current printers (you can try the
 "light" option first if you like).&nbsp; You'll have to reinstall any printers you want to use.&nbsp; Download the driver for your Epson Stylus R265 here, being sure to pick the one that's correct for your system (32-bit or 64-bit); there are 2 versions - I would try
 the newer one first: </span><a href="http://esupport.epson-europe.com/ProductHome.aspx?lng=en-GB&amp;data=wsMoc1iChVEvcFf9C95RCWYaBnNAZp0U002FnCaUQrvCDpQU003D&amp;tc=6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://esupport.epson-europe.com/ProductHome.aspx?lng=en-GB&amp;data=wsMoc1iChVEvcFf9C95RCWYaBnNAZp0U002FnCaUQrvCDpQU003D&amp;tc=6<br />
</a></li><li><span>PowerShell 2.0 is included with Windows 7; you already have it</span></li><li><span>The first instruction says "</span>Start PowerShell in Admin mode" -- to do that, click Start, type Powershell in the Search box, right-click on the shortcut to Windows
 Powershell that is found and select "Run as administrator".&nbsp;<span> Respond as necessary to the UAC prompt</span></li><li><span>If you saved print-reset.ps1 in C:\Windows\system32 you'll have to pre-pend dot backslash (.\) to the command to run it; otherwise, you'll need to provide the full path.&nbsp;

<p>At this point, you've done so much tinkering, registry editing, and twiddling, it's impossible to know where to start giving you instructions on how to get things going.&nbsp; At this point, I think you need to go right to the step of completely resetting the
 Windows printing subsystem to its initial default state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside before starting that, what happened when you attempted to use System Restore to an earlier (working perfectly) date?&nbsp; It's possible that there's something else going on in your system than just printer driver issues.&nbsp; And what do you mean by
 "recovery"?&nbsp; What did you try to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that your system is not otherwise compromised, Microsoft used to have a handy automated "Fixit" tool for resetting the printing subsystem.&nbsp; You can read about it here:&nbsp;

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2793718/you-experience-print-spooler-error-messages-after-installing-or-upgrad</a> and in more detail here:&nbsp;

https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askperf/2012/02/24/microsoft-fixit-for-printing/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, if you click on one of the Fixit download buttons at KB2793718, you'll see the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>If you are redirected to this article when you click the
<span>Download</span>&nbsp;button of a “Fix it” solution in a Microsoft Knowledge Base article, this means that the solution has been retired and is no longer supported.</em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, however, the "guts" of the Fixit have been preserved as a PowerShell script.&nbsp; You can see an allusion to this at the bottom of KB2793718 under "More information."&nbsp; The link there to codeplex.com is itself outdated because codeplex is shutting

<li><span>As I wrote above, I think you will need to run the "full" option.&nbsp; This will require a reboot of your computer and remove ALL of your current printers (you can try the "light" option first if you like).&nbsp; You'll have to reinstall any printers you want
 to use.&nbsp; Download the driver for your Epson Stylus R265 here, being sure to pick the one that's correct for your system (32-bit or 64-bit); there are 2 versions - I would try the newer one first:

</a></li><li><span>PowerShell 2.0 is included with Windows 7; you already have it</span></li><li><span>The first instruction says "</span>Start PowerShell in Admin mode" -- to do that, click Start, type Powershell in the Search box, right-click on the shortcut to Windows Powershell that is found and select "Run as administrator".&nbsp;<span> Respond as
 necessary to the UAC prompt</span></li><li><span>If you saved print-reset.ps1 in C:\Windows\system32 you'll have to pre-pend dot backslash (.\) to the command to run it; otherwise, you'll need to provide the full path.&nbsp; See the following and the screenshot below:</span></li></ul>

<p>Many thanks LemP</p>
<p>Now printing again after several frustrating days! The tinkering mainly involved deleting some unneccesary scripts in RPCC registry and others. The recovery method involved trying to undo some of the recent updates which I suspected of causing the problem
 and using System restore to reset to 15/5/17 system image restore point (the last time I backed up my system to an external storage device). I kept getting a 'System Restore' error 0x80071a91 saying the changes had not taken place on reboot.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have to confess someone had looked at my computer about a month ago because it became unstable after downloading a large piece of software. They said it was because the system was constantly trying to back itself up and filling my drive but they has 'fixed'
 the problem. Sorry to ramble on but I have had back up problems for some time because every time I try to back up or schedule one the link is broken and instead of starting the wizard it simply redirects me to the system 32 file. I have no idea if these problems
 are interlinked. anyway thanks again.</p>

                    <p>Comprei um jogo novo e ele não roda no console Xbox 360, pois acusa a mensagem do título. Troquei o jogo, mas o problema continuou, então pensei que fosse o leitor de CD que estivesse ruim, então pensei em instalá-lo em um HD externo, mas não consigo instalar pelo mesmo motivo. Agora não sei qual&nbsp;o problema dele e nem sei mais o que fazer, pois não conheço nenhum técnico que trabalhe com isso nem tenho dinheiro.&nbsp;O engraçado é que a cada vez que eu tento limpá-lo com um pano seco, ele muda de problema, por exemplo, sem passar o pano ele só aparece com a mesma mensagem, mas quando eu passo um pano de leve, ele nem tenta ler a mídia, acusa "Disco não reconhecido".</p>

<p><span>Hi nicholscha,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community Site.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let me know how are the computer connected. Meanwhile I would suggest you to try these options:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>1) To check if a third party application is a cause</strong>, follow this link (</span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</span></a><span>)
 for this Boot to the desktop in Safe Mode with Networking option and check if this issues still persists, if the issue is resolved, you need to perform a Clean Boot by following the steps mentioned in the following KB article to narrow down the exact source
 and isolate it: </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>2) No firewall or security software blocks sharing</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue may be caused also by your security program such an anti-virus or a Windows
</span><span>Firewall <span>
/Defender which might have conflicting settings as to not to perform certain tasks. I suggest that you temporary disable the anti-virus and firewall and check the result again. You would need to turn on the security programs again which you had disabled.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>3) Password Protected: OFF</strong> (unless you want to set up identical usernames and passwords on ALL computers in your Network)
 or you can try creating the same username and password on both the computers.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Try pinging IP address of the computer from the other but not by machine name (PING each computer by IP address, and if successful, PING by name. You can obtain
 the IP address of a computer by opening a command prompt (DOS window) and typing IPCONFIG)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>4) Ensure NetBIOS over TCP/IP is enabled on both computers</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to “Control Panel - Network Connections”.</span></p>
<p><span>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-Click on the connection and click Properties.
</span></p>
<p><span>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Version 4 in the list.</span></p>
<p><span>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Properties, and then click Advanced.
</span></p>
<p><span>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Advanced TCP/IP settings windows, go to “WINS” tab.</span></p>
<p><span>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under NetBIOS setting, click Enable NetBIOS over TCP/IP, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>5) Disable IPv6</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists due to IPv6 deployed you might need to follow the steps mentioned in the KB article: How to disable certain Internet Protocol version
 6 (IPv6) components in Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008</span></p>

    <title>Does the Xbox One really support gigabit&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Does the Xbox One really support gigabit&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>This is the question that I have started to ask myself day after day. When you search up “Xbox One Specs” and look under what networking capabilities the Xbox One has, you would see that it has a Gigabit Ethernet port and
 supports the speeds. <br />
<br />
I’m really starting to doubt this after all the phone calls with Xbox/Microsoft and after reading up on forums. It has been 5 days now since my internet was upgraded to fiber/gigabit (1000/1000.) Every device
<strong>BUT</strong> the Xbox One has been able to show me the speeds I pay for. <br />
<br />
If I was to take my Cat6 Ethernet cord and plug it directly into my wall where the gigabit Ethernet port is (bypassing the router), then plug the other end into my computer......my speeds show 900+/900+ for upload and download. I have tried many sites and other
 devises to test the speed and they have always came back with the appropriate speed results.<br />
<br />
<span>For some reason when I plug my Ethernet into the Xbox One and run a diagnostic test, the speeds are reduced over 90%. After speaking with reps for hours and going through all troubleshooting steps, I am still having the issue.&nbsp;</span><br />

<span>Does anyone have the same issue, or an explanation/solution for my problem?</span><br />

<p>the ethernet interface does connect at 1Gbps, but that only is to the router, the problem you're having is that you're trying run a connection test from the Xbox to a MS server, when i run the test the server i'm connecting to is like 4 states away, the
 further away the server is, the less accurate the results will be, that is why most ISP's have their own speed test server and other speed test sites will automatically choose the server closest to you.</p>
<p>and then there is the question of, do the MS servers even have the ability to test for connections over 100mbps? i mean, why waste the resources just so people can brag?</p>
<p>so unless there is an actual problem with your connection, don't put any stock into connection test results as they will be inaccurate.</p>

<p>Well it tests right on the Xbox one X speed test but will not go over 100 mbps on the Xbox one. So that statement makes no sense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Xbox one X is testing at 200+ / 200+ but my Xbox one (same wired connection and router) only tests at 98/98</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has to be a reason for that and not the MS servers</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro4 - Significant decrease in Battery Life</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 4 256 MB, with latest updates installed.&nbsp; This July my battery life seemed to drop by 50% from between 4-6h life to 2h30min.&nbsp; See table below from the Battery report.&nbsp; The Surface runs very hot when using battery as opposed to charging.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice on trouble shooting this? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Paul</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>From the description it appears that you wish to close all programs for uninstall purpose</p>
<p>First of all note that you need not close all programs because many of them are system programs and closing them will result in system failure</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click your task bar and click 'Task Manager' or use the Ctrl+ Alt+ Del combination to open up the task manager.</li><li>In the window processes, choose which programs you want to close and click 'End Task' at the bottom</li></ol>
<p>If you want further assistance, reply to this post</p>
<p>Ashwin0</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>The HDMI cable is more than capable of running all the features of the new Xbox One S including outputting at 4K HDR to a TV.</p>

    <title>Why are there not more games available in the built in tournament - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why are there not more games available in the built in tournament feature on xbox&#63;</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
<p>
Would be great to be able to join and create tournaments with the tourn<span>ament feature on xbox but currently only 4 games are available (Halo Wars 2, Injustice 2, Killer
 Instinct, World of Tanks: Mercenaries). I would really like a lot of more games to be available. For me personally, I would like Fortnite, COD and FIFA and maybe some other games.</span></p>
<p>
Now you kinda have to find and register for a tournament online which of course has it's advantages but also disadvantages. More people would register and play in tournaments if it was abailable through the xbox and you don't have to do everything on a website.
 Some things would be easier, some harder I guess. Most likely you can't do money tournaments on the xbox but still fun to play in tournaments once in a while and not just spam regular games. I haven't played in a tournament on the xbox cause I don't play any
 of the games available so I don't really know how it works. Being able to join random tournaments as well as being able to create one for just your friends would be really cool. Even the tournament on webistes for real money could run their tournaments through
 the xbox tournament feature I guess.</p>
<p>
But how does it work, do game developers need to work with xbox to implement their game to this feature? And why haven't more developers done that?</p>
<p>
Don't really know if this thing tracks if you win or lose but anyways, If the game developer haven't added their game to this feature, why can't you at least just create your own tournament there for just your friends and report the score or whatever yourself?
 Doesn't even have to be specific to that game, just a general tournament feature where both players (or only one since it may only be for tourney with your friends) need to enter the score. Or that only the host can report score and you report the score to
 the host. A lot of youtubers and streamers run free tournaments for their viewers and this feature could be great for that kind of stuff cause everyone could report the score on their xbox and the likelihood of a dispute is basically the same as otherwise,
 everything is just more smooth overall imo. If there's a dispute, the host and creater of the tournament (or people he maybe could be able to promote as admins, whether they play in the tourney or not) would have to decide a winner based of proof etc. Then
 the host or admins could just press on their names from the tournament and look at their saved photos or videos that the players need to save for proof. Or the players that have a disputed game could just go in to the tournament and choose from their recently
 saved photos and videos and link the proof there as well as being able to write what happened etc.</p>
<p>
I don't know why this doesn't exist, especially when there's already a tournament feature added and available. The feature as it is now looks great based from what I know but I would really like seeing more games available and this general tournament idead
 being added, whether I would use it a lot or just a couple of times (probably a lot, both for money tournaments by 3rd party sites, random free tourneys just for fun, content creator made tourneys and private tourneys just for friends)</p>

            According to this&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xbox-live/multiplayer/arena/xbox-arena" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xbox-live/multiplayer/arena/xbox-arena</a>&nbsp;it seems like it’s up to developers to implement the
 Arena capability. Hopefully with the next system Microsoft will somehow make it even easier for developers to implement into their workflow so that most every game supports it.
