            <p>I have the same problem with the same Dell Inspiron 5547 Microsoft Signature Edition using the Intel Dual Band-AC 3160. It's brand new and very frequently drops WiFi (as often as 5+ times per hour), and doesn't see all available networks all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did what you described in the Device Manager and used the Dell Power Management software. I contacted Dell Technical Support over the phone and was transferred to a Wireless Technician who took control of my PC remotely using GoToAssist.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 2 hours of the tech updating every driver, flashing the BIOS, configuring settings (including what you just mentioned above), and even uninstalling certain programs that may conflict (Bonjour by Apple, part of iTunes), no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've even tried restoring the PC to factory settings and then immediately updating all of the drivers and updating Windows before installing any applications and the problem still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased TWO of these laptops on the Thanksgiving/Black Friday sale from Microsoft Store online and they BOTH have the same problems. Every other device in the house works fine, including an HP Laptop running Windows 8.1, another HP laptop running Windows
 7, a different Dell laptop running Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 Technical Preview, two smartphones, and gaming consoles all work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two new Dell laptops have the same problem at other locations, such as at public WiFi hotspots and WiFi at friends' houses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been back and forth in contact with Dell with no success. Their Wireless Technicians have no clue and have never heard of such a problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Their recommendations: either (1) send both laptops to Dell to have the device diagnosed and any faulty parts repaired which may take 2-4 weeks and there may be a service charge or (2) return the device to the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any *real* help would be much appreciated. I'm very glad to know that I'm not the only one affected by this!</p>

            <p>I have&nbsp;a similar problem with Inspiron 5547 which I bought direct from Dell this month. I have been through the same experience (Dell Technical support - GotoAssist, driver updates, bios update, factory reset). The wireless works when next to BT Home Hub
 3 but does not if I just move to the next room whilst all other devices are happily connected.</p>

other devices ---&gt; push their signal ---&gt; your card is reduced,<br />
because, do not want to collide with the old technology wifi cards.<br />
Your card is intelligent and gives way to the road, another wifi. :-)

    <title>Samsung R519 Password not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Samsung R519 Password not working</h2>
                    
<p>original title: <span>User Password no longer works!</span></p>
<p>Greetings all. Here's a weird one for you.</p>
<p>My Windows 7 (pro) Admin password stopped working (it hadn't been changed). Thankfully mine wasn't the only Admin account on the laptop so I logged into another Admin account and reset the password on my account, then logged off and tried logging into my
 account again using the password just created. No joy, still says it's incorrect.</p>
<p>I've tried this several times, using different passwords and it still won't work, so basically I've got an Admin account that I can only get into when it isn't password protected, not ideal really! It works when I remove the password, but doesn't recognise
 any password I create!</p>
<p>Anyone got any idea what's going on, as I'm completely stumped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also tried the steps in a similar thread about editing the registry (setting some count to zero), no joy. I've even created a new account with a password and I can't log into that one either! So basically my machine will no longer allow passwords on
 any user!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark.</p>

<p>Your post is a rare exception! The vast majority of password-related posts deal with machine on which there is just one single admin account. When it goes bad then it really hurts.</p>
<p>Since I do not know what's going on with your machine I suggest you try some diagnostics, e.g. like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reboot into Safe Mode. </li><li>Log on under your alternative admin account. </li><li>Click Start. </li><li>Type the three letters cmd into the Search box. </li><li>Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter </li><li>Click "Run as Administrator". </li><li>Type the following commands and press Enter after each of them:<br />
net user "xxx"<br />
(replace xxx with the name of the problem account)<br />
(make a note of the date/time when the password was last set)<br />
net user "xxx"&nbsp; 123456<br />
(This will set the password to 123456. Use this value because it is insensitive to keyboard layouts)<br />
net user "xxx"<br />
(is the password date/time correct?) </li><li>Reboot into Safe Mode. </li><li>Log on under the xxx account with a password of 123456. Does it work? </li><li>Reboot into Normal Mode. </li><li>Log on under the xxx account with a password of 123456. Does it work? </li></ol>

<p>Solved this problem as have been having the same problem.&nbsp; When Mark said it was the characters that numbers are enabled by the Fn function key for laptops I checked the Bios.</p>
<p>On this Samsung R519 Laptop I am working on I booted into the Bios (F2) and in the boot section it had the Enable Keypad as By NumLock so I changed it to Only By Fn Key and this solved the problem.</p>
<p>It would also help if this customer would stop spilling her drink and cigarette ash all over the keyboard!</p>
<p>Hope this helps you with your problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Had also tried a restore to Factory Settings but this didn't solve it so if thinking of trying that, don't bother!&nbsp;I thought it was a faulty keyboard, but it appears not.</p>

            Most likely a WMI problem. Rebuilding the WMI Repository should cause the Windows Security Center to report AntiVirus &amp; Firewall status correctly.<br />

            I am experiencing the same issue- Windows is informing me my AVG protection is out of date, yet AVG reports all functions up to date and normal.&nbsp; I followed the detailed advice in the link above (repairing and re-registering the WMI), however I'm stuck.<br />
<br />
The directions instruct me to "<span style="font-weight: bold">rename the folder %windir%\System32\Wbem\Repository</span>. (For example,
<br />
Does this mean find the folder called "Repository" in Windows\System32\Wbem\ and rename it "<span style="font-weight: bold">Repository_bad</span>"?&nbsp; Sorry if it seems like a thick question, but don't want to mess something up that I can't fix later!<br />
<br />
Your help is appreciated, and thanks in advance!<br />

Yes, that's exactly what it means.<br />

            When the program says that it is out of date it means that it is not updated for new threats.
<div>The program says that your system is protected because it will protect your computer from the older viruses but not from new virus.Many viruses are generating everyday and antivirus programs should know about it so that it can recognize it and protect
 you from it.To know about the latest viruses it needs to update its database for which it shows OUT OF DATE.</div>
<div>You are protected from a virus even if it is not updated but you will not be protected from all viruses if you don't update it regularly.</div>
<div>You can understand it better with this example-</div>
<div>Think of a condition in which you installed an antivirus in 2010 and never updated it till now.</div>
<div>So it will protect you from viruses which were known till 2010 but not from viruses which were generated after 2010.If you update this antivirus till 2012, then it will protect you from viruses identified till 2012 but not from antivirus which are yet
 to come after 2012.</div>
<div>SO YOU NEED TO UPDATE YOUR ANTIVIRUS PROGRAM REGULARLY!!!!!</div>

    <title>Windows 10 Element Not Found Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tehdarknight  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Element Not Found Error</h2>
                    I upgraded to windows 10 two months ago and have loved it even though there were a few quirky problems up front especially for my Alienware X51 R2. &nbsp;But I found easy workarounds and have had no further problems until now. &nbsp;Today I was using my computer
 as usual gaming and whatnot. &nbsp;But then decided to change my background as I do that often. &nbsp;When going through my photos I finally found one that I wanted and tried to click on it. &nbsp;I receive an error message stating "Element Not Found". &nbsp;So I try another
 photo. &nbsp;Same thing. &nbsp;After many try's to no avail my frustration gets the best of me. &nbsp;I cannot access any of the photos on my computer. &nbsp;This is no good. &nbsp;I can access music an videos but no photos. &nbsp;What gives microsoft? &nbsp;I know windows 10 is new and all
 but this bug affects many people in many different ways. &nbsp;Please help.

 interfering here.&nbsp; If anyone else has been able to fix this issue please let me know.

<p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please sign in Outlook Web App with your Office 365 account and check the profile picture. It’s recommend that you upload your new image again and check if the image is synchronized to the Skype for Business client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Also, please try clearing the Skype for Business cache to troubleshoot this problem. Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log out of Skype for Business client.</li><li>Delete any sign-in info and exit.</li><li>Navigate to&nbsp;<strong>Users</strong>&nbsp;&gt; username &gt;&nbsp;<strong>AppData</strong>&nbsp;&gt;<strong>&nbsp;Local</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Office</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>16.0</strong>&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Lync</strong></li><li>Delete&nbsp;<strong>sip_profileName</strong>&nbsp;folder.&nbsp;</li><li>Delete all files in&nbsp;<strong>Tracing</strong>&nbsp;folder. Do not delete the folder itself.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please give us the following information:</p>
<p>1. A screenshot of the profile picture in Skype for Business and Outlook client.</p>
<p>2. The version of the Skype for Business client.</p>
<p>3. Does the profile picture show correctly in the Skype for Business client?</p>

<p><span>Unfortunately, there is not option to merge Skype and Microsoft accounts. Please refer to this link:

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What you can do is to use both accounts. Log in to each account using the same credentials you have used in creating them.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you need to transfer contacts from one Skype account to another, please refer to this FAQ for the steps:

<h2>            Windows cannot access &#40;insert computer name&#41;__Please check spelling or there may be a problem with your network.</h2>
                    I am networking some new windows 7 machines to a pre-existing network with both Vista and XP computers already on it. I have set it up as a work network and opened the ports in our McAfee firewall that windows recommends. However while the older OS machines
 can access the windows 7 computers and&nbsp; the win 7 computers can access the older OS, the windows 7 machines cannot access each other.
<br />

The computers show up on the network but when they try to gain&nbsp;access an error message pops up. I've even tried to uninstall McAfee but the problem persists. What is the problem?

 time and realized the rest of my computers are not using TCP/IPv6, everything else is using v4.</p>
<p>SOLUTION:</p>
<p>So go to your network card settings, scroll down the items and UNCHECK "Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6). Then click on Version 4 -&gt; properties -&gt; advanced -&gt; WINS -&gt; Make sure that the following is enabled, "Enable NetBIOS over TCP/IP.</p>
<p>your computers show up now??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*also, sorry for proposing the previous post as an answer, i clicked it in error, and there is no way to undue it.</p>

    <title>Some &#39;right click&#39; options not working on Windows 10 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Some &#39;right click&#39; options not working on Windows 10 Pro Anniversary updated pc</h2>
                    <p>I have just finished updating four similar computers to Windows 10 Anniversary edition.</p>
<p>Three of them are running Windows 10 home, and the problematic computer is running Windows 10 Pro. I don't know if the fact that it's Pro is relevant, but thought I'd mention it just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On all four computers I have the 'This PC' icon showing on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right clicking on 'This PC' brings a menu with options like OPEN, MANAGE etc. and the three Windows 10 Home computers, all of the options work perfectly, however with the Windows 10 PRO computer when you click on MANAGE nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another right click option that doesn't work on the Windows 10 PRO computer is when you Right click on the Windows logo button (start button) and then click 'Control panel' nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted the computer twice, checked for any further updates that might be there, and still the above symptoms continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know what is wrong and have a fix?</p>

            <p>I had the exact same problem and found a solution.</p>
<p>If you speak french have a look <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/forum/windows_10-start/problemes-de-clic-droit-apres-installation-de/6dcb0791-0550-4326-9676-27de62e08bb2?page=2">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise here is a short version of the solution. Seems like the fact that several shortcuts reachable from right click do not work after anniversary update are related to dll called in context menu.</p>
<p>Solution is to use ccleaner and go to tools-&gt;startup. Here select the context menu</p>
<p>Select all entries (shift click) ans click disable and verify if this fix your problem.</p>
<p>If it does re-enable the dll (one by one or by group) until you find the dll that causes the problem.</p>

<h2>            how to&#58;connect my UPS to Windows 7 computer</h2>
                    Original Title: Device not detected<br />
<br />
I have an HP R/T3000 UPS connected via USB to a Windows7 HP 6200 Pro.&nbsp; This UPS is a replacement for the same model that had the same problem.&nbsp; I use PowerManager 4.3.2 to manage the UPS.&nbsp; Both the original and the replacement were communicating with PowerManager
 and then stopped.&nbsp; The error was "one of the usb devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned and windows does not recognize it".&nbsp; The UPS seems to be working fine but I can't check logs or configure.&nbsp; HP decided it was the UPS and sent the replacement.&nbsp;
 It worked great for 5 days and then stopped with the same error.&nbsp; Has anyone had the same problem?

            Thanks for the response.&nbsp; I have tried these suggestions but still not having any luck.&nbsp; I'm going to try taking all devices attached to the UPS down and then down the UPS and bring it back up to see what happens.

<p>That is different. &nbsp;Have not run into that issue before. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My first guess would be to look at your router. Many routers have "time calendars" in them, which allow the owner to set certain times that the Internet can be accessed by certain machines. &nbsp; Make sure there are none of those things setup in &nbsp;your router.
 &nbsp; </p>
<p>Also, "Family Settings" in the Xbox can be setup to limit the times and Xbox can be used online. &nbsp; So you might check to see if there are any settings in your Xbox for that.</p>
<p>Still, another possibility is that some software on a PC or Laptop, in your home, &nbsp;is interfering with the Xbox and that software is typically running at a certain time of day.</p>

    <title>How do I hook up my new laptop to the tv&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicky west  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I hook up my new laptop to the tv&#63;</h2>
                    <p>OK, so I hooked a HDMI cable up to my flat screen 42" Sanyo TV (which incidentally I had used a few years before as a comp screen to my Dell desktop). It has 3 HDMI plugs on it. I plugged it into the top one. I plugged the other end into my new Dell laptop
 and went to control panel/ view devices and printers... clicked it, and there was the TV... I had 4 options in comp settings: PC screen only -- Duplicate -- Extend (which is the setting it was on my default, I think) -- and second screen only...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, extend didn't work, so I clicked on Duplicate... that didn't work... I clicked the first one just to see if it was noticing a thing I did. NOT, it seemed, so I clicked on number 4, display second screen only. And the world went black. It did not display
 on the TV... and it did not display on the comp... and the only way to see the screen is to unplug the HDMI.... BTW, when I first went in to settings with an HDMI plugged in, the display settings said 112 and showed the option for multiple monitors. Now it
 says 1... only one, with no option, and every time I hit 'project' to project the display to another screen, the first box comes up with the 4 setting options and it is ALWAYS on PC Screen only... I can't click on extend or duplicate and save that choice,
 and I can't do anything with an HDMI plugged in, because the moment I plug it in, the screen goes black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, I saw the other posting. I shut the comp down, plugged in the HDMI and rebooted, to a black screen. When I put the HDMI on the TV side into plug number 3 instead of 1, the comp screen came back on, but a search of settings did NOT show the TV...
 the comp couldn't see it anymore....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wow, how do I get myself into these things? How do I get back to step one which showed a setting of 112 or 1 / 2 whatever that was, short of Dell Roll-Back, and how do I get the comp to see a TV screen through HDMI without killing itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, this is so frustrating, and I have a lot of time invested in this already!</p>

            <p>THIS may sound silly, but what channel is the tv SUPPOSED to be on? I don't have TV, I have DVD (player)... never watch TV, have none, so the TV is set where it is set and the DVDs play on screen just fine, I am assuming that it IS on the right channel...
 as for the rest... trying it now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>well, it's a trick, pressing those keys all at once... I need 3 hands! But yes, black screen of death, and it did switch it back to 'extend' so hopefully no more black screen...</p>
<p>
</p><p>OMG THERE IT IS... I FORGOT.... I haven't had a standard remote for this TV in years, I use a Universal.... I needed to hit INPUT and scroll through the options : Video 1, 2, HDMI 1, 2, 3, TV, etc.... it was there... now I only hope 'extend' stays where
 it should...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You helped me, reminding me of the input... thank you...</p>

                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Acer Aspire 7750G-6645 Laptop, I am using with an HDMI connected monitor (no speakers, HDMI sound disabled).</p>
<p>Due to the manufacturer design, I was forced to install Insyde H2O Bios (v1.17) and Uniflsys v14.4 (latest) drivers which moved my</p>
<p>BSOD culprit from igdpmd64.sys to igdkmd64.sys, no variation in using original drivers has helped and I cannot install original AMD drivers.</p>
<p>This somewhat constant BSOD happens only on boot, which makes me think it has to do with switching graphics mode, because the laptop is plugged in 90% of the time. I am also getting random screen blanks anytime. Just had the AMD Catalyst Control Center say
 no drivers are installed out of the blue. All this started when updating Unifl from version 12.8. Without Unifl, I cannot use my AMD processor as MAIN for gaming and when laptop is plugged in. Here is the WhoCrashed report (Win7 SP1):</p>

<h2>            Dead Rising 3 gets stuck on load screens</h2>
                    
<p>I have been having this issue for over a month. &nbsp;I contacted MS support via chat about a week ago, case
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>
<p>This is a digital download version that seems to download and install fine every time but I get stuck at various loading screens. &nbsp;I have tried uninstalling, clearing cache and/or doing the hard reset, about 20 times now. &nbsp;I even deleted all my user data
 in the hopes that my save file had been corrupted and was causing the issue but still no luck. &nbsp;Sometimes it freezes before getting to the main menu. &nbsp;Sometimes it freezes as I try to start a new career mode game. &nbsp;I don't know what else I could try and worry
 that it could be an issue with the hard drive having corrupt sectors or something. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In case it could have to do with network speeds, I am hardwired to the network and have a very fast (Verizon FIOS) internet service. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I need to send my Xbox One in for service?</p>

<p>Thankfully an uninstall, hard reset, reinstall fixed the Plants vs. Zombies but still no go with DR3 even after doing it 5 more times since I originally posted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Well actually, I got it to work for a short time with one of the installs. &nbsp;I was able to play up until the part where you make your first vehicle combo. &nbsp;I then started having the issue of falling through the world, unable to go more than a couple blocks
 in any direction before that would happen. &nbsp;Then it stopped loading at all again.</p>

<h3> terryjw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell Laptop with Samsung second monitor won&#39;t display.</h2>
                    Originally used second monitor in extend mode - worked fine. Then I used my TV as a projector off of my laptop. Now the second monitor comes up infrequently only. Usually the laptop thinks it is there ( I can move a window to the second display and it
 disappears from the first) but nothing displays on the second monitor. I have read that Windows checks for a second display - how often? How do I force it to check? How do I get it to work all of the time? Thanks for any help.

            Good basic information - I went through this when I first set it up, and I have been able to change the config as I need to. And if I am away travelling with my laptop it always recognizes that the second one is not there and puts everything on the main
 screen.
<div><br />
<div>However, as I said above&nbsp;the&nbsp;second monitor now comes up infrequently only. Usually the laptop thinks it is there ( I can move a window to the second display and it disappears from the first) but nothing displays on the second monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the try but it doesn't solve the problem.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which device was connected to the laptop in extended mode?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to&nbsp;u<span>pdate the display drivers.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a) Open <b>Device Manager </b>by clicking the <b>Start button </b>, clicking <b>Control Panel</b>, clicking
<b>System and Security</b>, and then, under <b>System</b>, clicking <b>Device Manager</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />

            When I try this the only driver that I can update is the driver for my native device - i.e. the laptop screen. The option to update a driver for the Samsung monitor (the other one that I attach as a second monitor) does not appear.

            It happened again that I was doing something else on my laptop and my second screen spontaneously started to work again. This was 1+ hours into my session with my laptop. I had tried to trigger a "discovery" of the screen by plugging and unplugging the
 screen signal cable. I got normal beeps from the laptop indicating that I had plugged and unplugged something, however the second screen did not come alive. It came alive sometime later.

<h2>            Need help updating Surface Pro 1 from 8.0 Pro to 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to update my Surface Pro 1 from Windows OS 8.0 Pro to Windows 8.1 OS. I have tried running the free download from the Store but it only gives me an error saying that it can not be done. I did check the minimum requirement settings on this tablet
 already and they are well within range to perform a software update so I know this is not the problem. After some further investigation I found that it may&nbsp;be because the Surface currently has Windows 8.0 Pro version on it thus making it not able to download
 to Windows 8.1 as this is what it says on the Microsoft Support page for updating the software from 8.0 to 8.1. My question is, I just purchased this Surface tablet used and it was already&nbsp;hard reset back to OEM specs with Windows 8.0 Pro OS, so what do I
 need to do to update to Windows 8.1? There are many apps that can not be downloaded from the Store with Windows 8.0 such as Facebook for example and this is really starting to become rather frustrating so someone please help. Even if I have to pay for a new
 Product Key for the&nbsp;Windows 8.1 OS,&nbsp;that's no problem. Just please post&nbsp;an official Windows link to purchase it and I will. Any and all information will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Matthew,<br />
<br />
<br />
To install Windows 8.1, download the Windows 8.1 ISO from this <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and use it to create an installation media. Click
<strong>Download Tool Now</strong> and follow the on-screen instruction to create an installation media. Make sure that Windows 8 is activated before installing Windows 8.1. Ensure that you have your product key for your Windows 8 operating system as it would
 be needed for the installation process.<br />
<br />
As of now, Microsoft no longer sells product key for Windows 8.1 and lower version of operating system. You may consider getting Windows 10 instead. Windows 10 has a lot of features that you would enjoy. You may visit this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/windows/features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to learn more.
<br />
<br />
You may purchase Windows 10 product key from <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Store</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or things you'd like to clarify, feel free to ask.

What is file fragmentation?
<p>Sometimes when you install a program or create a data file, the file ends up chopped up into chunks and stored in multiple locations on the disk. This is called
<em>fragmentation</em>.</p>
<p>What makes this happen?</p>
<p>When you first install your operating system and programs on your hard disk, they are written to the disk, for the most part, in one contiguous block without any gaps. The exceptions are certain system files that must be stored in specific locations. Over
 time, as you create and then delete documents or uninstall programs, once-filled locations are left empty and you end up with files dotted all over the disk.</p>
<p>Now, when Windows is writing a file to the disk, it looks for a suitable piece of free space in which to store it. What happens, then, when you copy a 40M database or audio file to the disk and the biggest slice of free space is only 30M? Or say you modify
 an existing file, appending a whole bunch of data so the file now takes up more space on the disk. To accommodate the files, Windows writes the first part of the file in one section of the disk and then scouts around for other places to store the rest of the
 file. The end result is that a single file may be stored in several chunks scattered about the disk.</p>
