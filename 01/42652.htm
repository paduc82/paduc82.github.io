            Hi Curt, Greg is here (an Independent advisor).
<br />
<br />If you specifically refer to Windows 10 OS, my answer is ‚Äúno‚Äù because this driver is not part of the OS. But TXE driver is installed by the system manufacturer in Intel NUC devices because it is required for secure boot and platform security features. 
<br />If you want to check if TXE installed on your machine, follow the steps:
<br />&gt; Right click on Windows logo
<br />&gt; Tap on Device Manager
<br />&gt; Try to find the Intel(R) Trusted Execution Engine under System devices, if it is there, the driver is installed on your PC.
<br />If you need further information, refer to the article: Intel:registered: Trusted Execution Engine (Intel:registered: TXE) Driver for Intel:registered: NUC  devices &gt; <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005666/mini-pcs/intel-nuc-boards.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support...</a>

<p>Hi MiteshRathod,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a few reasons that might have caused your <strong>Input Method Editor (IME)</strong> like a possible update on the computer that renders your changes incompatible or a 3rd party program that might be preventing your
<strong>IME</strong> to work on your <strong>Windows 10</strong>. In order for me to determine what troubleshooting steps to perform or for me to refer you to the correct channel, I would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tested if the issue is happening on other user profiles?</li><li>Is your IME installed on a company computer or a personal computer?</li><li>Have you tried reinstalling your language pack and your <strong>IME</strong>?</li><li>Is your computer connected on a domain?</li><li>What is the current build installed on your <strong>Windows 10</strong>?
<ul>
<li>You'd be able to check this by pressing the <strong>Windows button + R</strong> to open the
<strong>Run</strong> box and type <em><strong>winver</strong></em> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

<h2>            Windows Hello fingerprint disappeared and not working anymore</h2>
                    <p>Hello anyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was relying on the fingerprint reader as the primary log-in method, as it is convenient and fast for me.</p>
<p>My laptop has windows 10 installed since 2 months ago, when I bought it, and the fingerprint reader was working correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today (01-10-2015) the fingerprint log-in option was gone, and also in the settings there is no windows hello and fingerprint enrollment option.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b56337cf-ac69-47f5-8634-9df118c473a1" /></p>
<p>I did tried to reinstall the fingerprint driver driver, uninstall then reinstall, remove the hardware from the device manager, install the universal synaptic drivers (lenovo), remove everything again and nothing...</p>
<p>I did also tried to force the biometrics framework enables (as in screenshot)</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e17c917-ce30-45d1-a744-5139fec4ed12" /></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73ce31f1-5ee2-4569-b1d4-7b4060b69cb3" /></p>
<p>and run the&nbsp;<br />
‚ÄúSfc /scannow‚Äù<br />
"dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth"<br />
commands with no results (Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the EFI settings (BIOS, as some still calls it) the biometric device is enabled and found as TPM 2.0 (if i'm not mistaken)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this? I do not like to log in with the PIN as default</p>
<p>My laptop is a custom assembled XMG P505, which derives from Clevo (yes, I did also tried the Clevo drivers)</p>
<p>And the update showing in the history of 01-10-2015 was found and installed later the same day.</p>

            Hi,
<div>
<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.&nbsp;We're sorry for the trouble.We will help you resolve the issue as soon as possible.</p>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1: Hardware Troubleshoot</strong></div>
<div><br />
Windows has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with Hardware and Devices. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with your Devices.<br />
Refer these steps:<br />
1.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows key +X,</strong> select<strong> Control panel.</strong><br />
2.&nbsp;Click on <strong>t</strong><strong>roubleshooting</strong> and click on the view all option on the left panel.<br />
3.&nbsp;Run the <strong>Hardware and Devices.</strong></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also run the <strong>system restore</strong>. System Restore is a feature that allows users to restore their system to a previous state. It offers a way to undo all the changes in the system files, registry keys, installed programs, etc, to a previous
 state, without affecting personal files such as documents, photos or e-mails. <br />
<strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Windows key + R</strong> to open Run window.<br />
<strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;On run command type <strong>‚Äúrstrui.exe‚Äù</strong> and press<strong> OK.</strong><br />
<strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>Select the <strong>restore point </strong>and follow the onscreen instruction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</div>

            <p>I exactly have the same issue on my Lenovo S440&nbsp; : I cannot use Hello (fingerprint) !</p>
<p>For your information I tried to "upgrade" to 'the insider build' (Windows 10 buil 10565) and I still have the problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only one functional solution is :</p>
<p>- install windows 8.1, </p>
<p>- configure the fingerprint </p>
<p>- dirty upgrade to Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me it is not a good solution because I prefer a fresh and clean "from scratch" installation of Windows 10. So if you find a good solution to solve this "missing hello feature", or a workaround to use fingerprint : please share your tips and tricks :-)</p>

            <p>In my case the fingerprint reader was reported faulty and changed under warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in your case I read something interesting: Windows 8.1 drivers do run in windows 10, although they may not satisfy the W10 requirements (I have not tested, i suggest you to research this)<br />
<br />
Have you searched for drivers? because lenovo's drivers are used also to fix the fingerprint on other laptops, have you tried all the steps I did?</p>

<p>Yes I tested all your steps... and I also tested old drivers... Tomorrow, I'll do a new from scratch install of Windows 10 with no drivers and I'll do a windows Update... maybe Microsoft drivers provided by Windows Update will be the trick ;-)</p>

all i did was went to the search and wrote:Hello&nbsp;<br />
the best match will be :set up Fingerprint And after i clicked on it Windows Hello appeared again in the settings.

here</a>. I know Xbox was resolving some issues these past few days, so some things might be down. If that didn't help, I would hard restart your Xbox. After doing so, give your router a hard restart as well as it may be a connectivity issue. Once you are connected
 to the internet try logging into your account and also connect to the Microsoft Store.</p>

            <p>Hello Liv,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most anti virus applications will locate key logging software and quarantine it for you. So I would begin by giving your system a complete virus scan. You might also like to download the free version of Malwarebytes Anti malware
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free/</a>&nbsp;and run that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Removing key logger software manually is not an easy thing to do. You need to know what you are doing. These two links may be of use:</p>
<p><a href="http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-20050505-285/how-to-remove-keyloggers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-20050505-285/how-to-remove-keyloggers/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.2-spyware.com/keyloggers-removal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.2-spyware.com/keyloggers-removal</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if you do not find anything on your PC a good safe guard is the freeware application called Keyscrambler.
<a href="http://www.qfxsoftware.com/download.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.qfxsoftware.com/download.htm</a>&nbsp;Make sure you download the Free version. This does exactly as the name suggests - it scrambles your keystrokes making it impossible for key logging software to tell
 exactly what you are typing. As an example you may type, say, Liv. The keyscrambler would interpret this as, say H3m. While the word Liv would look normal to you, to a key logging application it would be meaningless.</p>

<h2>            USB Device Not Recognized - Unknown Device - Code 22 &#38; Code 45 </h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am at a loss. I am repeatedly receiving a pop-up saying "USB Device Not Recognized"&nbsp;When I&nbsp;open it, it says,&nbsp;"One of the USB Devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned and Windows does not recognize it." and&nbsp;shows as "Unknown Device". When I click
 this on sometimes is says Code 22, sometimes Code 45, always the Device&nbsp;says it is&nbsp;Not Working, Disabled but&nbsp;sometimes&nbsp;the window will not open at all.</p>
<p>I have gone to Device Manager where the Unknown Device sometimes shows, sometimes not, clicked it on, checked Properties and it states that it is not working, Disabled. While I am in Device Manager it will sometimes refresh itself, very quickly and frequently,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the
 Unknown Device will appear and disappear. Feels like a poltergeist!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have made no hardware changes, really have done no changes at all to my computer. As it appears, I sometimes click it off, sometimes do the above but what ever I do the longer I stay on the computer the more often this appears until it is flashing on and
 off by itself. When this happens everything on my computer freezes, I hear a loud beep, and my computer has crashed!</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;checked different forums and have not seen anything under USB Devices which are causing the kind of problem I am having. I have done the unplugging and plugging back in, done chkdsk, Enabled the Device intending to go back and Disable it but when
 I do, I&nbsp;find it has Disabled itself, and anything else&nbsp;remotely I can think of. As you can guess, I'm not very tech savvy. I would sincerely appreciate any help or ideas anyone may have. BTW, I have Windows XP and will check back anyway I can (between crashes
 and re-booting that is. :) I'm so afraid my computer will die completely :(.</p>
<p>Thank you! Helen</p>

            just turn off your computer and bluck out the source of power from power supply and wait for few minutes and then restore the bower and turn your computer on, because all problem that accured with USB is come from power source distrbution for usb wich

<p>Hello narjeen,</p>
<p>Thank you for offering help but I'm so sorry&nbsp;I do not understand what it is I should do. When you say to "block out the source of power from power supply" I do not know what this is or how to do it. Particularly as the&nbsp; message,&nbsp;when I&nbsp;open the USB not recognized
 window, says "Unknown Device".&nbsp;How would I track where this device is located to remove it from the power source?&nbsp;As I wrote, I have made No Changes to my computer, did not add any hardware to my system. This problem just appeared of it's own accord. If you
 could explain further I will give it a try.</p>
<p>Thank you, Helen</p>

<p>Hi helenrose,</p>
<p>You can check in the Device Manager to see what the failing hardware may be, though it's likely to show up as "Unknown Device" which won't help:</p>

<p>Is this a laptop?</p>
<p>If so, do you have an internal webcam?</p>
<p>If so, is it working?</p>

<p>Chris, I have a similar problem because my laptop doesn't regognize flash drives either. One of them comes up in the device manager/disks as IBM_SERVICE but it doesn't let me do anything with it but ask for Help. That has all lead to nothingness including
 downloading the 'net fixit thing'. This laptop doesn't have an internal webcam either.</p>

<p>esse layout √© com base no X-One, ou seja s√£o de l√° as imagens, pra entender melhor, podemos dizer q as gamerpic do 360 n√£o s√£o "full hd" por exemplo, no X-One olhando seu perfil, sua gamerpic n√£o aparece por inteiro aparece em tamanho pequeno (metade da
 tela) n√£o importa se sua gamerpic √© uma imagem ou foto do avatar, ela aparece assim no One</p>
<p>j√° no One, alem de poder fazer a foto com o avatar, ele tbm tem algumas gamerpic disponiveis, essas seriam as imagens que vc se refere, elas s√£o (digamos que) em "full HD"</p>
<p>em outras palavras, √© preciso q vc edite sua gamerpic no One, pode ser criando com o avatar ou escolhendo uma das imagens disponiveis no One.</p>

<p>Mohr, tinha uma gamerpic que escolhi sim a do The Beatles, sabe qual √©, n√©? Era ela que estava no perfil.</p>
<p>Verifiquei o perfil da minha esposa e o dela tamb√©m est√° com essas imagens nova e ela tamb√©m s√≥ joga X360. Ser√° aleat√≥rio? Ou ser√° que se inspiram em usu√°rios "novos" com cadastros recentes?</p>
<p>Lembro que meu outro perfil e o dela foram feitos h√° menos de 1 ano. Pode ser isso, sei l√°...</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Automatic Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rintintino&#39;casey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Automatic Updates</h2>
                    <p>I have often received notice of updates for drivers, features, and software updates for items that my computer is</p>
<p>not capable of doing. For instance, not too long ago there were about 10 updates for Windows 8.10 RT. I do not have</p>
<p>RT and am not interested in it for my home. Since now I have the choice whether to download and install updates that my computer</p>
<p>doesn't have, I chose not to download and install those RT updates. Will Windows 10 be downloading things like this without my being able</p>
<p>to control that? If they do, more space will be taken, I will run out of space, and have no more computer. I can't just go out and replace my computer that easily. They cost too much.
</p>
<p>I won't be upgrading to Windows 10 until I have an answer to this.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>What does Windows as a Service entail?</strong></p>
<p>Since the introduction of Windows Update as part of Windows, Microsoft has delivered updates as way to keep Windows updated and secure. This has always been the way the company keeps commercial versions of Windows on the market current.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10, Microsoft is making significant changes to this model by delivering new methods of servicing Windows. Taking into account we now live in a mobile, constantly connected world, where threats happen all the time. Part of the solution to this
 is to keep users current by providing the latest updates&nbsp;as soon&nbsp;as they are&nbsp;available in addition to delivering features as soon as they ready too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft will do this using three types of service branches for Windows 10:</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td>
</td>
<td>
</td>

<tr>
<td>

<li>Windows 10 Home</li></ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>CBB includes the requirements of the Current Branch, but also provides the option of customizing when and which Security Updates, Features and Fixes are applied, similar to how Windows Update works today in current versions of Windows.&nbsp;</li><li>Updates cannot be deferred indefinitely.</li><li>Windows Updates can be managed using enterprise management tools such as Windows Update for Business and/ WSUS.</li></ul>

    <title>How can I turn on my video card. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mujer loca  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I turn on my video card.</h2>
                    When I install windows 8pro, it turned off my video card and install a generic monitor that only gave me two modes/pixels for my screen resolutions. Now I can't play games cause I can't change the resolution on my monitor. It's only goes to 1024x564. Is
 there anyone who can help? And when I download any drivers I get a code 31, software won't let me upgrade the system driver or graphic driver.,and no video cards can be found. I have a mini HP 1000 notebook, with an Intel(R) Atom(TM) 1.60 GHz. I tried asking
 HP but they have no solutions for windows 8pro. When I had windows xp I didn't have a problem.

            <p><span>Hi Mujer Loca,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Microsoft Community. As per the problem description you can't play games because you can't change the resolution
 on the monitor. Provide the following information:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which games are you referring to?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is it an online game or installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This behavior can occur because of the display/graphics drivers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to update the latest display/graphics drivers from the manufacturer‚Äôs website. If Windows 8 drivers are
 not available, you can install Windows 7 drivers in compatibility mode. Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press the ‚Äò<b>Windows + W</b>‚Äô key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type
<b>compatibility</b> in the search box and then press
<b>enter</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click ‚Äú<b>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</b>‚Äù option from the list appeared in the left side.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the drivers and install.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know if you need further assistance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

<h2>            WMM project missing images</h2>
                    <p>Sorry if I'm posting in the wrong location!&nbsp; This is my first time doing this and this is</p>
<p>the only place I found stuff relating to Windows Movie Maker!&nbsp;&nbsp; Although none of</p>
<p>me files are on the Skydrive!&nbsp;&nbsp; However my project is local to my PC.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Earlier this year I built this movie project from still photos and burned it on DVD.</p>
<p>Today I loaded the project to make some changes to it but I'm seeing throughout</p>
<p>the project, images missing and a warning icon that looks like a yellow triangle</p>
<p>with a ! in the middle.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please help me figure out what is wrong and how to fix this?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm assuming that the image files are not found in the location they were when the</p>
<p>project was created; which is very likely.&nbsp;&nbsp; But one thing does not make sense, is that</p>
<p>as far as I remember all the images for this project were stored in one folder!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Am I on the right track?&nbsp; or am I off the track?&nbsp;&nbsp; Please advise.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />

            <p>A project file (.wlmp) is not a movie.&nbsp; It just saves the state of your project so you can come back to it later.&nbsp; It has a list of all the source files (photos, videos, music) but doesn't store a copy of these within the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the project just remembers the folder and the file names, if you have done any sort of clean-up since last using the project (such as renaming folders, renaming files, moving photos, deleting photos, etc.) then Movie Maker won't be able to find them
 anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, you can hover over a missing item (one showing the yellow triangle and exclamation point) and it will show you the location and file name it is looking for.&nbsp; You can also double-click on one of these problem files and navigate to wherever it may
 now be (assuming you haven't completely deleted the file).&nbsp; Once you point it to the file again, Movie Maker will again load the items into the storyboard and let you preview them in the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, should keep all your source files in their original locations if you want to make further edits to your project.&nbsp; Or if you are done, you can save it as a movie (File &gt; Save movie) and it will create a complete video file (.wmv or .mp4) that you
 can then share and view elsewhere.</p>

<p>Do you have the same symptoms where you are seeing yellow triangles and exclamation points?&nbsp; Are you using photos or video?&nbsp; If video, what file type?&nbsp; When you run

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
Did you make any changes?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I would suggest you to update the drivers
 for your sound card and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Device Manager by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>
System and Security</strong>, and then, under <strong>System</strong>, clicking <strong>
Device Manager</strong>.&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.‚Äå
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the list of hardware categories, find the device that you want to update, and then double-click the device name.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the
<strong>Driver</strong> tab, click <strong>Update Driver</strong>, and then follow the instructions.&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;Try running System File Checker and see if it helps, here are the steps:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and select Run as Administrator.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Continue or supply Administrator credentials if prompted.<br />

<p>My personal recommendation would be to backup your important files onto a USB stick, then install the new drive and download Windows 10 directly fresh onto it, then copy your files back from the USB stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get the Windows 10 install files here: &nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/windows-create-installation-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Create installation media for Windows</strong></a></p>

<p>Thanks Shawn</p>
<p>This gives me a better understanding of both the process and the risk.</p>
<p>I will backup all files and go shopping for a new hard drive.</p>

<p>You might also make a list of programs you'll need to reinstall later and if they have any serial key codes you'll need to print or note down. Things like Adobe or Office, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really not such a long process though.&nbsp; I did the same thing when I wanted to put a larger hard drive in my Lenovo laptop. Although I wish I had bought a faster one, I got the cheapest/slowest drive.&nbsp; Tons of space on that large drive, but definitely
 on the slow side.</p>

    <title>Abbonamento Xbox LIVE Gold Sospeso - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guybrush65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Abbonamento Xbox LIVE Gold Sospeso</h2>
                    
<p>Causa furto di carta di pagamento usata e registrata per pagamento Xbox Live ora scaduto, giustamente il servizio mi appare "L'abbonamento √® stato sospeso a causa di un problema relativo alla tua opzione di pagamento. Per continuare con l'abbonamento, modifica
 l'opzione di pagamento oppure utilizzane una diversa."</p>
<p>Volevo sapere data l'impossibilit√† al momento di rinnovo se posso ripristinare il servizio non prima di fine Agosto pagando da quel momento i 3 mesi successivi senza perdere il mio account ed i contenuti</p>
<p>Ovviamente non vorrei pagare il periodo non sfruttato per causa di forza maggiore ripartendo da nuova data</p>
<p>Come funziona ? Qualcuno mi sa dare supporto ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Grazie!</p>

    <title>WINDOWS UPDATE CONFLICT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> londondeb  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS UPDATE CONFLICT</h2>
                    My printer has stopped working and I think it's a conflict with a latest windows update.&nbsp; The printer is a lexmark and I've tried reinstalling but no difference.<br />
<br />
I've even rebooted windows and started from scratch (reinstalling all software and devices) and everything seems to work OK until windows update starts automatically installing it's many updates.&nbsp; Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

            Many thanks for your reply.&nbsp; The printer is not on a shared network.<br />
<br />
I've checked the print spooler and it has started.&nbsp; I can print one document and then when I try to print another one it says document pending and will only print that document if I restart my printer and log on again.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have deleted the files in windows explorer as you suggest and no change.<br />

Any more ideas?&nbsp; Many thanks<br />
