<h2>            Windows Media Player fails to syncronize files with portable media players</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Hi everyone!</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I have the following problem with WMP: when I syncronize songs from my computer to my mp3 player (does this with *any* MTP device, tested on 2 different computers and 3 different mp3 players: Creative Zen X-Fi, Creative
 Zen Touch and Sandisk Fuze) the syncronization works perfectly if the files in question are on my hard drive, but fails completely if they are on a cd/dvd. In that case, I can add the files correctly to the sync list, I can correctly play them, but as soon
 as I hit the sync to device button WMP fails on evey file. There isn't any particular error message, but under "sync status" all the files are reported as "failed to syncronize".</span></strong></p>
<p>Any ideas? It's really a WMP bug, because I tested and reproduced this on different machines and with different portable devices, it always fails.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can give me.</p>
<p>Master_T</p>

<p><span>Hi Master_T,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For your information, you cannot sync the files present on your CD/DVD directly to your portable media player. You need to rip the music files
 so that the tracks are created as files on your computer before you sync them to a portable music player.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, Windows Media player does not automatically add a file that you play from removable storage media, a removable storage device, or on a shared
 network folder. You’ve to store the songs from a removable storage device (CD/DVD/USB) on to the hard drive so that you can sync the files to a portable music player.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I don’t think what you’ve discovered is a bug. All I can say is that syncing files from a removable storage device to a portable media player directly
 is not supported. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>First of all, sorry if I was a bit unclear, I'm not talking about automatic syncing, I'm talking about just drag &amp; dropping a bunch of mp3 files in my device's "SYnc List" in WMP and hitting the "sync" button.</p>
<p>I don't think I have to "rip it first", I'm &nbsp;not talking about a music cd, I'm talking about plain and simple mp3 files stored on a dvd, they don't need ripping or conversion, just to be copied to the portable device.</p>
<p>Also: WMP doesn't have any problem syncing files even if they're not in the media library, as long as they're on hard disk. In fact, if I just copy those same files I have on the dvd to my desktop and then drag and drop them on the portable device's "Sync
 List" in WMP, it works perfectly!</p>
<p>So, if it's really not a bug (I don't see why tho, what's the differnce between copying a file from HD or copying it from a folder on a dvd?) then it might be a good idea to tell the user that tries to do that, with a message box or something, that "Transfering
 from CD/DVD is not supported", because as it stands now you can add the files to the sync list and start syncing as normal, only to be faced with a series of "failed to syncronize" on all files, without any explanation given... a bit confusing.</p>
<p>Thanks anyway for you answer, guess I'll have to use a 3rd party program...</p>

<h2>            How to undo inadvertently enabled sync settings</h2>
                    On my office pc with Windows 10, I was using the Photos app with my personal account, and now all settings are synced with my home computer. I have now disabled all sync settings, but I wonder if there is a "single click" way to return to the "last not
 synced version" on my office pc, &nbsp;to get rid of "my account picture" etc.

            I suppose a system restore would be convenient in this case, if you have a restore point preceding the sync...

<p>Programs can't be transferred. You have to reinstall them on the new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fastest way to transfer your personal data (documents, pictures, etc.) is to backup the files to an external hard drive and restore them to the new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have backup software -&nbsp;<em>tsk tsk</em> - just copy them to an external hard drive and move them from the external hard drive to the new computer. That works just as well.</p>

            Hi Frogman228,
<br />
<br />The quickest and handiest way is to use a large USB Flash Drive
<br />
<br />You can transfer your files and folders. you cannot transfer software (programs)
<br />
<br />Your software will need to be re-installed on the new laptop. 
<br />
<br />When software installs, it installs files into many folders and makes registry keys - it would be very hard to replicate that on a now PC, that is why you will need to re-install your software

            <p>Yes I did check</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily downloading Windows 10 directly worked</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was from the Microsoft Windows site.....media creation tool page or something like that.</p>
<p>Downloaded and installed easily with no problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of all Windows handles all drivers &amp; settings. Samsung utilities not required now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 is Amazing!</p>

<p>I'm planning to upgrade mine also, but I'm not sure if the drivers, especially the digitizer screen, have been updated to work with Windows 10.</p>

 Samsung has a patch for this problem but after the installation, windows 10 try to update and stop the patch. I was upgrade to latest windows 10 versions a few days ago. But illumination problem continued.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>@ferhanarman, I think what you're describing is the ambient light sensor issue that's prevalent when the ATIV 700T's was upgraded. I'm having it on my machine running Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Adrian1296, do also experience the problem described by @ferhahnrman with regards to the screen illumination?</p>

            Just an update: I upgraded to Windows 10 last week, and I immediately installed the Brightness patch from Samsung SWUpdate and the Wacom Feel Driver from Wacom's website. I also set Windows Updates to stop installing driver updates automatically. Everything
 seems fine but tests are still being done. Will see if all is right in another week.<br />

<p>I have the Samsung 700T laptop/tablet.</p>
<p>I tried to use the free upgrade, it installed with no errors. The problem I had was that the keyboard and touch pad no longer worked.</p>
<p>I tried this twice.</p>
<p>I uninstalled the Windows 10 upgrade for the 3rd time.</p>
<p>I hope Microsoft finds a cure for this.</p>

    <title>After a roll back from the Creators Upgrade, what happens next&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arcadian222  say:</h3>
<h2>            After a roll back from the Creators Upgrade, what happens next&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have had to roll back after trying the Creators Upgrade (v. 1703) because I could not set my screen resolution to my chosen resolution. I nee a 16:10 aspect ratio and I normally use 1680 x 1050 on my Dell U2412M - however I was not able to select this
 after the upgrade. Strangely enough, the <em>recommended </em>setting after upgrading was 1024 x 768 (ratio 4:3)!! This displayed squashed text and distorted images - so I rolled back to the previous Windows version,. which was quick and painless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I am now wondering what happens next. Will Microsoft try to persuade me to upgrade again? Will I have to wait until Dell issues a new monitor driver? As I have noted that there are
<em>many</em> issues with the Windows upgrade so perhaps the ball is firmly in Microsoft's court.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would welcome expert comments</p>

<p>Yes I'd like to know the answer to this question.&nbsp; I've posted my situation on another posting.&nbsp; I will post it here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On June 15, 2017 my Dell Desktop ran this stupid Windows 10 Creator 1703 from the perfectly working Windows 10 1607 that I had on my system.&nbsp; HATE, HATE, HATE 1703!!!! I ended up rolling it back to 1607, but then it automatically Updated me AGAIN to 1703!!!!
 AGAIN I rolled it back to 1607 but the 2nd time I went to the Control Panel and changed Category to Large Icons (because I found something on the internet that told me how to do this), I chose Administrative Tools and Scrolled down to Services and dble clicked
 on it, and scrolled down to Windows Update and dble clicked that, and under the Service Status I clicked Stop. This permanently stopped updates.&nbsp; But then I changed it to Startup but I changed the Startup Type to Manual from disabled and clicked ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I go into setting from my desktop and click check for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And today being June 24, 2017 It still says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your device is up to date. Last checked: Today, ‏‎11:25 AM</p>
<p>
</p><p>but it also says below that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good news! The Windows 10 Creators Update is on its way. Want to be one of the first to get it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I not ever get 1703 Creators Update to install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't use it because It doesn't Install Internet Explorer 11.&nbsp; I need to use Internet explorer for printing issues and Bill Paying issues.&nbsp; I cannot us Microsoft Edge cuz it doesn't Print the things I need it print and us my Bill Paying on my Banking online.&nbsp;
 I even tried to uninstall the Internet Explorer App and reinstall it.&nbsp; Didn't work!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to make sure though, now that I have updates set to Manual, Will Microsoft be updating 1607 any further, or are you going to force me into the non-usable 1703 Creators update.&nbsp; Which means I will have to go to buy a computer that will allow me
 to use Internet Explorer 11 or maybe check into an Apple Computer that will work for my needs!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know, because I don't want a computer that is obsolete and I've only had it a few years!!!</p>

<p>Like you, ShariPrince, my system is up to date but I am no longer getting a "Great News, Creative Update is coming soon!" Perhaps MS rolled it out as a beta test just to find out what problems were reported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, have you tried Firefox or Chrome for bill paying or banking?</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply Arcadian222!&nbsp; I do have Firefox and Chrome but have not been able to get them to work with the printing and banking online for my bill pay to work like I need them to work like IE 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did receive some advice from Tim the Tech on facebook and he led me a link to Block Forced Windows Update and I was able to set it up to Metered connection to&nbsp; on for my WIFI so windows update won't force its updates on me in the future until I turn off
 metering.&nbsp; If you'd like to check out the link here it is:&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">My concern is if it was just a test, great, fine.&nbsp; I wish they would have let us common folks know BEFORE they sent it so I would have a choice.&nbsp; It's like the government forcing Trumpcare on us without our input
 other then calling our stupid deaf Senators to vote NO!&nbsp; But, hopefully the nasty note that I sent Microsoft on how much I HATE 1703 and WHY that they will listen and do something about it. HAHAHAHAHA!&nbsp; {sarcasm}</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">But thanks for your help!&nbsp; If you hear any info on what Microsoft has up their sleeve on this matter, please feel free to let me know.&nbsp; Thanks Again!</span></p>

    <title>No internet connection after Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> msa49  say:</h3>
<h2>            No internet connection after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP dv7 notebook with a Broadcom 4313 Wi-Fi Adapter and a Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller ethernet card.&nbsp; I have not used a VPN.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 as soon as it became available and had no problems.&nbsp; However, after an update to Windows 10 at the end of November, I lost my internet connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the time of the update, I was using a Wi-Fi connection, so I tried plugging directly into the router using an ethernet cable.&nbsp; The light went on indicating that there is a connection, but according to my computer the Broadband Connection is "Blocked"
 so I am unable to get access.&nbsp; I tried to establish a second Broadband connection and was able to do so, but that connection also is reported as being "Blocked."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have uninstalled the Wi-Fi Adapter driver and restarted, and that did not solve the problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the suggestions listed at http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-network-connection-issues, at the command prompt I ran the following command as administrator:&nbsp; "netsh winsock reset" and restarted the computer.&nbsp; That didn't solve the
 problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then ran the command:&nbsp; "netsh int ip reset"&nbsp; In response, I received the following messages:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resetting Interface, OK!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resetting Unicast Address, OK!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Resetting Neighbor, OK!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resetting Path, OK!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resetting , failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access is denied</p>
<p>
</p><p>After restarting, I then attempted to run the command: "ipconfig /release" and received a message stating that "No operation can be performed on Local Area Connection 2 while it has its media disconnected."&nbsp; I received the same message after running the
 command: "ipconfig /renew" but after running the command: "ipconfig /flushdns" I received the message "Successfully flushed the DNS Resolver Cache."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I turned off all firewalls and also disabled Kaspersky Total Security.&nbsp; Still no connection.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Network Connections, for my Broadband Connection it states "Unavailable - device missing" and for my Local Area Connection it states "Network cable unplugged TAP-Windows Adapter V9 #2" even though the ethernet cable is plugged in.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I am contemplating reinstalling Windows 7 using the original product key.&nbsp; However, I would prefer to get my internet connection working using Windows 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

            <p>I was able to get to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Nsi\{eb004a00-9b1a-11dr-9123-0050047795bc and then find three instances where 26 was an option, but each time I right click on 26 the options I get do not include "Properties."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, the only options I get are the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; New</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Find ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Delete</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Rename</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Export</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Permissions ...</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy Key Name</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the option "Permissions," one of the categories is "Permissions for Everyone," and there are three listings under that, two of of which has boxes for "Allow" and "Deny:"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Full Control&nbsp; -- neither box is checked</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Read -- the "Allow" box is checked</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Permissions&nbsp; -- Both boxes are greyed out</p>
<p>
</p><p>I presume that even though "Properties" was not an option, the intent of your instruction was for me to check the "Full Control" box under the heading "Permissions for Everyone."&nbsp; However, because I am somewhat cautious and don't want to do something that
 renders my computer even less useful than it now is, I would like your confirmation that this is, indeed, what I should do.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />

            <p>When I got to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Nsi, there were six subdirectories (at least, they appear to be subdirectories) with the same label:&nbsp; {eb004a00-9b1a-11dr-9123-0050047795bc}</p>
<p>
</p><p>I expanded each of them searching for "26," and the first, second and fourth one have what appears to be a file or something labeled "26."&nbsp; That's the reason I asked which one of them I should modify.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One additional piece of information that I didn't notice&nbsp; before.&nbsp; When I click on "Permissions" for the items labeled "26" in the first two subdirectories, under "Group or user names" the only listing is "Everyone."&nbsp; When I click on "Permissions" for the
 item labeled "26" under the fourth subdirectory, in addition to "Everyone" it also lists "SYSTEM," "LOCAL SERVICE," "NETWORK SERVICE," "Administrators [followed by my Admin ID]," "Account Unknown [followed by what I presume is an identifier for that account],"
 and ""BFE."&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the fourth instance includes so many entries under the heading "Group or user names," I presume that is the one where I should click the "Allow" box following "Full Control."&nbsp; However, before doing so I would like to be sure that it is the correct
 one to click.&nbsp; </p>

<p>My Device Manager shows me I don't have a driver installed for the SM Bus Controller.&nbsp; Windows update won't update it.&nbsp; The Gateway OS Disc that came with the computer doesn't have it and Microsoft FIx it wouldn't work.&nbsp; I'm wondering whether its been made
 obselete by another program or update for the Intel chipset or something.&nbsp; I put this under Hardware and Drivers because my main problem is having random Blue Screens and lockups;&nbsp; It has refered to Memory Management once.. Direct x once but most of the time
 there either isn't code or it flashes too&nbsp; fast to be able to tell.&nbsp; I have avast antivirus and spybot search and destroy which tell me im free there.&nbsp; I have ran a check disk utility scan and it found various(5 or 6) files that were missing(not sure why that
 is?) and restored them , but i still am having problems.&nbsp; I have done other scans from pcpitstop(which didnt say anything about an SM Bus Controller missing) and others.. I'm not sure why I am having Blue Screens which seems random.&nbsp; Sometimes it will go all
 night without one and sometimes It wont even get past the bios part of loading.. ANy help would be appreciated</p>

<h2>            Why isn&#39;t Skype for desktop updating conversations&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a problem lately with Skype and I was wondering if there's any fix.<br />
<br />
While I'm offline, I can the messages that others and sending in private or group conversations on the phone app, but when I log in to the default windows app or the windows 10 one, I can't see them at all.<br />
I can see the messages and history from before I logged out from the windows appx and none of those that were sent while I was offline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried logging in and out several times from everywhere, updating, re-installing and nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Issues with downloading games such as Minecraft and Flappy bird for the child account due to need of older age.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Parental Control</p>
<p>I set up a child's account. &nbsp;Son is 9 years old. &nbsp;He cannot download games like Minecraft and Flappy bird. &nbsp;It says the age needs to be older. &nbsp;So I went into administrator &nbsp;settings and changed it to being allowed to access for 12 year olds. &nbsp;However, it
 still will not allow in the app store. &nbsp;I even rebooted. &nbsp;Please help. &nbsp;I'm not looking forward to deleting the profile and setting up a new one. &nbsp;I'm hoping it is just an easy fix.</p>

<h2>            Halo 2 Saved Games On Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Well here goes.</p>
<p>I changed my motherboard and CPU. After I did it, I had to reinstall Windows 7 and all my software, including Halo 2. I would like to get my saved games&nbsp;out of the Windows.old folder that the reinstall created and put them where they need to go so I have
 my saved games.</p>
<p>I found the folder I think, "My Documents/My Games/Halo2", but when I&nbsp;copy it back where it was originally they don't show up. Anyone know what I can do?&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Cyclone-Charlie,</span></p>
<p><span><span>• Are you trying to copy the installed copy or installation files for Halo?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• Are you getting any error message when you try to copy the game?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When you perform a custom installation the applications that were installed on the previous operating system won't open in windows 7. You won't be
 able to move or copy/cut paste older programs into Windows 7, they must be reinstalled. In addition, if you just try to copy the files of an application from windows.old folder to windows 7, the application will not work because its registry information does
 not exist in windows 7.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer the following KB article for more information:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>How to restore your personal files after you perform a custom installation of Windows Vista or of Windows 7</span></span></p>

<p>I found&nbsp;Halo 2 files&nbsp;in "windows.old/users/charlie/my documents/my games/halo 2", but there are no saved games there.</p>
<p>I've&nbsp;also found Halo 2 saved games in "windows.old/users/charlie/saved games/halo 2", but when I copy that to my current folder, they don't show up in Halo 2 when you start the game.</p>
<p>These are locations that every post I have read about this&nbsp;claims this is where they should be. Well, for me, it's not working. I had three games in there that were in various stages, and one of them was completed that I'd like to get back.</p>
<p>When I had to do the reinstall because of the hardware change, believe it or not, the new installation&nbsp;already had all my personal files where they were supposed to be, even the saved games for Halo 2. They just don't work!</p>
<p>That's why I'm asking the question, could there be information someplace else that needs to be moved to my current profile? I'm at a loss here, I've managed to reinstall all my other games and have there game saves work, just not Halo 2.</p>

<h2>            RECOPILACION DE HILOS OFICIALES</h2>
                    
<p>Bueno, recupero una idea que surgió en el antiguo foro y que termino desapareciendo, la recopilacion de todos los hilos oficiales en un mismo post. Ahora con la posibilidad de editar el primer mensaje siempre que se quiera, esto sera mucho mas util y mas
 facil de utilizar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intentare llevarlo al dia, y, si creais algun hilo oficial, enviadme el link por privado (por si yo no lo veo) o posteadlo en este mismo hilo.</p>

            <p>Unless you have Windows 10 Professional or higher versions that have the option to defer upgrades I don't think you will be able to stop the update other than keep resetting the driver. What you could do if you have a recover drive with Windows 7 (or the
 original operation system) and do a Reset of your PC which would remove Windows 10 from your PC. Then you can go to your recovery options via a function key when it keep booting and restarting, then follow the steps to reinstall Windows 7. But do note that
 you should make a back up of your Windows 10 system image and all your personal data before doing anything like this.
<p>
</p><p>1. Back up everything you can</p>
<p>2. see in file explorer if you have a drive called System Image or recovery drive (Make sure it's not a Microsoft office back up protected drive or else it won't work.)</p>
<p>Make sure you make a system image recovery drive <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=windows+10+recovery+drive+creation&amp;FORM=EDGNNC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Link-- Warning do not delete partition on the last step if there is one--</a>&nbsp; if you have book marks in firefox or chrome you can sync your stuff with an account or in firefox&nbsp;go to troubleshooting information and hit refresh firefox (it will make an&nbsp;"old
 firefox data" folder which you can backup and retrieve bookmarks later)</p>
<p>3. after backing up, go to power and hold down SHIFT while hitting Restart.&nbsp; then hit reset this PC and then hit clean reset (full reset don't keep anything) (Warning if you have Bit locker encryption implemented you will need your recovery key.
</p>
<p>4. follow the steps and&nbsp;delete Windows 10 (warning only delete info on C: do not delete any other drive .... especially the recovery drive) It will say continue to windows 10 but it wont.
</p>
<p>If you&nbsp;have a&nbsp;install disc then insert it now.&nbsp;and follow the steps. if not keep below.</p>
<p>5. hit all function keys one by one (trial and error) to see if you get to a recovery page. (if it is a Tablet hit power and volume button.) You will know if it is the correct screen when it shows a windows 7 looking box.
</p>
<p>6. do not hit repair PC&nbsp;at any time. System restore is not the one you want. if you can find the Image recovery option then you will be able to reinstall windows 7
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(please note this was done on a HP Desktop computer so if you have another PC then these steps might not&nbsp;apply.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you get stuck with out an OS and have a recovery disc or drive look here:

    <title>win 7 restore from image does not see usb drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jwizardc  say:</h3>
<h2>            win 7 restore from image does not see usb drive</h2>
                    I have faithfully made backups of my Windows 7 machine using the Image option. It is a laptop, so I have used external usb drives.<br />
<br />
Now, when I need to restore, my genuine, honest-to-Sam Goody Windows 7 Ultimate install disk does not see the drive. Any drive.
<br />
<br />
I really need to restore this machine.<br />
<br />
HELP! PLEASE!!<br />

            <p>Hey, Orwell!</p><p><br /></p><p>What a weird issue!&nbsp;This could be dependent on a few things. The first one being your router that you're connected to. Can you post back with the manufacturer and model number of that, please? Same with your modem. A gut feeling I have is that you have a modem and router, but the modem is actually a gateway which is a 2-in-1 device. What might be happening is that your wireless connection is actually through the gateway, while the wired connection is through the router.</p><p><br /></p><p>However, these are all assumptions until I have that information.</p><p><br /></p><p>We'll be able to start from there to determine our next steps. I look forward to working with you!&nbsp;:)</p><p><br /></p><p>--------------------------------------</p>

<h3> housecat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana Invoke xbox one skill doesn&#39;t stay paired</h2>
                    <p>Anybody else experiencing the Cortana xbox skill not staying paired with the xbox?&nbsp; A majority of the time it just doesn't even work, but when I do get the two paired it doesn't last that long.&nbsp; For example, if I come back the next day and say "Hey Cortana,
 tell xbox to turn on".&nbsp; I get the response, "Sorry I can't help with that right now".&nbsp; The only way to remedy the matter is to say "Cortana, tell xbox to pair".&nbsp; Rinse and repeat the process every time.&nbsp; Is this normal behavior to have to pair the two devices
 all the time or is there something wrong?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried a hard reboot for both devices.&nbsp; I've enabled digital assistant on the xbox one.&nbsp; And lastly, even the Cortana app indicates that I'm already connected to my xbox even though I am not or have to first pair again before the two work together.</p>

<p>Yes, and I've tried all of the above items that you have listed.&nbsp; What is strange is that I can get the two devices connected with each other, but then the two devices will disconnect and I have to pair them again in order for them to work together.&nbsp; The
 two devices never stay connected for an extended period of time.&nbsp; I haven't measured how long it takes for the two to lose their connection.&nbsp; I do know that if I connect them let's say tonight, then tomorrow they will no longer be connected.&nbsp; Cortana Invoke
 will say, "Sorry, I can't help with that right now".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a known glitch that others are dealing with, then I can postpone using the integration until it gets resolve in a later system update.&nbsp; I just want to know if this is an isolated situation or if this is happening to a lot of other people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have yet to find a similar post on the community forum or web.</p>

            I had this issue, disconnect the Xbox skill in Cortana, factory reset your Invoke and then add the Xbox Skill back. Been working like a champ every since. Good luck.&nbsp;

            Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I'll give it a shot and let you know if that works.&nbsp; I know I've done a factory reset before, but I didn't remove the skill before doing so.

<p>Hey Xbox Gamers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this thread hasn't seen activity from the OP in a while I will be locking it down. If you have any questions or issues with the Cortana feature on your Xbox One, we encourage you to create a new post. Someone from our great Xbox Community will be more
 than happy to assist! :)<br />

                    I purchased genuine Win7 Ultimate in the Philippines and I brought that in India and installed on my PC here. On the first activation it was perfectly okay however, after a week I reformat my hard disk and trying to re-activate my product but this time
 it is showing error 0x004c017, geographical restriction.&nbsp;
<div>How to can I re-activated it again?&nbsp;</div>
