<div>This crashing started a few weeks ago, only difference was that I was able to right click my hard drives. I ignored it after awhile as I was getting frustrated. Now I can't right click them without crashing. &nbsp; I couldn't remember what I was doing before
 this to have caused this crashing, but I did a system restore to 3 points in the past, with none of them fixing the problem. I just did a clean boot, except I did not want to disable any of the Microsoft Services (I'm not really tech-savvy, so I didn't want
 to mess with anything that could potentially make the problem worse). I ran ShellExView and disabled all non-Microsoft shell extensions. I ran the check disk, and I attempted to run the sfc /scannow twice today, but that process stopped at 18% both times (It
 says "Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation"). I ran sfc /scannow when the problem first arose though, and I was able to complete it with nothing wrong. I ran CCleaner and Malwarebytes, cleaning out everything that needed to
 be cleaned out. The same problem persists if I make a new user account, and even when I start in safe mode. I've been trying to fix this problem for hours now and I can't figure out what I need to do to make explorer stop crashing! Please help. I could create
 a dump file if someone is willing to look at it.</div>

then Right Click TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - <br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are <br />
the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab -
<br />
write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything <br />
as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT <br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback)<br />
and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get <br />
their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System <br />
Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot -
<br />
check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR <br />
SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p><br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using <br />
the methods above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker <br />
and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations<br />
in Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install <br />
drivers which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new <br />
driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if
<br />
you wish.<br />

            <div>I forgot to mention that when I type anything into the search bar, or when I open up any of the hard drives, a popup will come up, saying that Windows Explorer has stopped working and it asks if I want to either restart Explorer or to search for a solution
 and restart Explorer.</div>
<div><br />
Since I've done a clean boot, I don't think any&nbsp;start-up&nbsp;programs or non-Microsoft services are the problem. I believe all my drivers are updated. I downloaded Process Explorer, but I don't really understand how to use that program to show what is wrong. I
 created a dump file, if you or anyone can look at it. I just right clicked explorer.exe &gt; Create dump &gt; Create full dump, then I made Explorer crash again. I don't know if that last part is even necessary, but like I said, I'm not really tech-savvy, so I'm
 new to dump files..

            Too big to download. Explorer can crash if you've installed something thats either buggy or its not compatible. And its added something to the context menu / when you right mouse on a file.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">I would install something like ccleaner.</a><br />
<br />
Click on advanced when you install it. In case Chrome installs<br />
<br />
Once its installed go to tools / startup. Go to the context menu tab. Disable everything here. And see if it works<br />
<br />
If it does, something here is causing the crash<br />

            I don't know if I created that last dump file right.. But I went to the task manager and created a dump from there instead. Now when Explorer crashes, it tells me the location of this dump file, so this one should be .. better?&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Start at the top of that troubleshooter and work down. The Clean Boot, if done properly,<br />
does eliminate most all StartUp programs, however there are a myriad of other possibilities.<br />

            Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.

<p>That's a pretty old laptop so I can't promise that the camera will work with Windows 10. But you can try installing the drivers from here:</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 - No Battery Detected - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 - No Battery Detected</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 3 with an LGC battery that reports No Battery Present and has done for about a year (which is when we had to stop using it). However it did operate on AC and on occasion, if we disconnected the AC while it was on, it would remain on
 and it would even restart, but if it was powered down it would not power up unless it was on AC.</p>
<p>It has an LGC battery.</p>
<p>We installed all of the updates as instructed and tried all of the methods to reboot / reset the battery to no avail. And then last month while on AC the battery icon suddenly showed a battery present. This was not after an update, it was just random. We
 charged and depleted the battery a couple of times and all seemed good, but it lasted only 5 days before the battery was not present again. It will run on battery power and still charges (it seems) but always shows No Battery Present and will not power-up
 unless connected to AC. This week the battery came back so I ran a battery report to determine the battery type and then it promptly disappeared again. Updated with the latest today (15/3/17) but still no battery present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BIOS 3.11.2050 11/11/2016</p>
<p>OS BUILD 14393.693.amd64fre.rs1_release.161220-1747</p>
<p>Battery Name: X883815<br />
Manufacturer LGC-LGC<br />
s/n: 1156520196<br />
Full Charge Capacity 40,090mWh<br />
Cycle Count 136</p>
<p>
</p><p>The battery is obviously fine and it is present (I would have removed it and replaced it if I could) but it doesn't seem to matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would love to have a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Within our business, the Surface Pro3 was replaced with another brand immediately as it was used for business travel. By the time the replacement offer came out I couldn't see any justification paying almost full price for a replacement device that had then
 become just a toy. This device has such extensive issues that Microsoft needed to show its true colours in recognition of its customer base.</p>
<p>They have finally offered solutions over the last few months, but as my post indicates, these do not deal with all of the battery issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unfortunate because the Surface Pro3 was the ideal device for what we used them for, but we will be staying well clear of this family of devices while these problems remain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
I tried to use the "Stereo Mix" to get my capture card to be able to "listen" to the desktop audio, because for some reason it doesn't just do that by itself. But the Stereo Mix said it was "Currently Unavailable."&nbsp;After doing some google searches, I uninstalled
 my audio driver and restarted my computer to force it to download the most updated version of the driver. (VIA HD Audio) That seemed to work and Stereo Mix was working fine, but my microphone now said "Currently Unavailable." I've looked all over and nowhere
 else does this seem to be a problem! Everyone else seems to just have the Stereo Mix "disabled" and needs to enable it or something simple. What do I do?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi LightningDragon,</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth headset does not auto-connect, gets disconnected</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My hardware: Lenovo X61 Tablet + Bluetooth headset Motorola S9 HD.</p>
<p>I successfully established connection and could use S9 as headset.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong>&nbsp;But after I turned it off,&nbsp;and later&nbsp;on - Windows 7 would not autoconnect.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 2:</strong> OK, it would not autoconnect, so I go to devices, open S9, click Connect. It works (not always, but most of the time), but then if I close this Explorer window "Motorola S9-HD", Windows will disconnect the device! Why do I have
 to keep this Explorer window open to use the headset?! Makes no sense at all.</p>

            Sorry Sammie, I attached a wrong link. Lest try the following suggestions, please:
<br />
<br />
In Windows, search for and open Device Manager. <br />
<br />
In Device Manager, double-click Imaging devices. <br />
<br />
Verify that your webcam or video device is listed under Imaging devices. If the webcam is listed, skip to Updating the webcam driver. If not, continue with the next step.
<br />
<br />
If there is no webcam or video device listed, select Imaging devices and select Scan for hardware changes to scan for the webcam or video device.
<br />
NOTE: If no hardware is found after running the scan, there might be an issue with the webcam hardware.
<br />
If a webcam or video device is found, right-click on the device and select Enable.
<br />
Open YouCam to see if the application opens with the selected webcam. If this did not resolve the issue, continue to the next step.
<br />
Update webcam drivers: <br />
<br />
Make sure you are connected to the Internet. <br />
<br />
In Device Manager, double-click Imaging devices. <br />
<br />
Right-click your webcam or video device, then select Update Driver Software. <br />
<br />
In the Update Driver Software window, select Search automatically for updated driver software.
<br />
<br />
After the message, Windows has successfully updated your driver software, or The best driver software for your device is already installed, click Close.
<br />
<br />
Open YouCam to see if the application opens and the driver update resolves the error message.
<br />
<br />
If Device Manager does not recognize the webcam after the scan, use Microsoft System Restore to go back to a time when the webcam was working properly.
<br />
<br />
Make sure the webcam drivers and software are compatible with your version of Windows. Go to the webcam manufacturer's website to download and install any driver updates.

            There is no need to "reserve" anything.&nbsp; It is merely marketing on the part of MS to "encourage" users to upgrade.&nbsp; They will be happy to upgrade any qualifying OS during the first year for free and it will remain free for the life of the device when it
 is released on July 29<br />
<br />
There will be ISO'S available when win 10 is released on July 29<br />
In almost all cases you data should migrate seamlessly<br />
If your data is important to you back it up

    <title>Workgroup stopped after install of new wireless router - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael27370  say:</h3>
<h2>            Workgroup stopped after install of new wireless router</h2>
                    <p>My Workgroup stopped working after install of new wireless router.&nbsp; Router was switched due to upgrade from DSL to Fiber-Optics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a very simple home Workgroup with two laptops, both are connected with a wireless router.&nbsp; One PC is running XP with current updates and service packs; the other PC is running Windows 7 home premium.&nbsp; This Workgroup was running without a problem for
 a couple of years.&nbsp; The Workgroup was used to share files between the two laptops.&nbsp; Internet access was through the DSL wireless router and printing was with a wireless printer, not through the Workgroup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had my DSL switched out to a fiber-optic connection last week which meant a new wireless router was installed by my local telco.&nbsp; Internet is working fine; wireless printer is working.&nbsp; The Workgroup no longer works.&nbsp; When I try to connect from the XP
 to the Win7 and I click on View Workgroup Computers, I get this message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>WorkGroupName is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions.
</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>The network path was not found.</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried creating a new Workgroup, new identical Workgroup name on both machines, but this hasn't helped.&nbsp; Workgroups are supposed to be simple; this seems like an issue at the new router - telco tech support says nothing is blocked at the router; I
 don't believe them.</p>

            Which version of XP are you using (Home or Pro)?<br />
<br />
Can you access the XP computer from the Win 7 one?<br />
<br />
Do you have identical <b>accounts</b>, with passwords, on both computers?<br />
<br />
If all that was done was to change routers without making any changes on the computers, the most likely cause of the problem is a third-party (non-Windows) firewall on at least one of the computers.&nbsp; Be default, a home router automatically assigns IP addresses
 to the computers on your local network.&nbsp; Different brands of routers, however, may use different ranges of addresses.&nbsp; For example, Cisco/Linksys routers typically use addresses of the form 192.168.<b>1.</b>1 through 192.168.<b>1</b>.254, while D-Link routers
 typically use 192.168<b>.0</b>.1 to 192.168<b>.0</b>.254.&nbsp; A firewall configured to permit only the first range of IP addresses will block communication to the latter range.<br />
<br />
So ... what is the name and version of your antivirus program?<br />
What other security software is installed?<br />
<br />
On each laptop, open a Command Prompt window <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for XP:&nbsp; Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd &gt; OK<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for Win 7:&nbsp; type cmd.exe in the Search box and press Enter<br />
In the black Command Prompt window, type the following and press Enter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ipconfig <br />
<br />
Please provide the values for the following items for each computer's wireless adapter<br />
IP address (XP)<br />
IPv4 address (Win 7)<br />
Default Gateway <br />
<br />

    <title>Surface Book gets slow WiFi&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Book gets slow WiFi&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a surface book and have been getting slow wifi speeds and wanted to see if anyone managed to solve the issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all latest updates installed and istalled comparing to a macbook that I have next to each other, I get almost 50% half the speed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed Verizon's instant internet which gives up to 750Mbps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Macbook I get up to 600 Mbps through the wifi connection and the Surface book barely gets more than 150Mbps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might think that is still a lot of speed, but we do live streaming here so the more download/upload speed we can get the better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made the change on the regedit file I read online but that didn't change anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has a solution? For such an expensive machine this should have been fixed already , no? :/&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Logitech H390 headset broken since creators update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jbw999  say:</h3>
<h2>            Logitech H390 headset broken since creators update</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have a Logitech H390 headset which has stopped working since the Windows Creators update 1709. Prior to that it worked fine. Previously it was recognised as Logitech H390; now it is 'Lync Audio Device'. If I turn the volume up to 100% I can hear a slight
 crackle when I test the audio device.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>My PC is a MS Surface Pro 4. I have also tested this on a Dell Latitude, with exactly the same result - it also worked on this machine prior to the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried updating drivers, using generic drivers, using different USB ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this would be greatly appreciated - Creators update has killed my headset :(</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4 - errors out making amd64 dll for my KLC</h2>
                    <p>I have a layout I made some years ago.. recently I wanted to update it to include the currency symbols for more currencies. I am having trouble building the layout now (the old version of the layout is currently installed, Im using it right now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>copied the whole directory for MKLC1.4 to C:\MKLC1.4 , this way there is no spaces in the path.</li><li>run the program in that folder as administrator</li><li>load my klc</li><li>ensure current working directory is set to C:\MKLC1.4</li><li>Project -&gt; Build DLL and Setup Package</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, it errors out with:</p>
<p>---------------------------<br />
Standard output information<br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
USIntl16.c<br />
<br />
cl : Command line error D8027 : cannot execute 'C:\MKLC1.4\bin\i386\amd64\c2.dll'<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
CL.EXE returned 2<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file 'USIntl16.obj'<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
LINK.EXE returned 1181<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
---------------------------<br />
OK &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
---------------------------<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Looking at the build folder, it has successfull built the &nbsp;i386, ia64, and wow64 dlls. It is only failing on my architecture, amd64 (which, despite the name, is for both amd and intel core i processors). At the time fo the error, the LOCALDATA/temp directory
 does have an amd64 directory, but ti is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reran this as the administrator account after enabling it with "net user administrator /active:yes", just to ensure my account name wasn't the problem (because my Local Data is under "Users\RobertoTomás"). Any ideas?</p>

</p><p>no this is all with the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator v1.4 ! the only changes I made from the version that I have already compiled (on windows 8, some time ago) are the addition of some new alt-Gr key assignments for yen, yuan, and rupee.</p>

    <title>Music stops with display turning off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saltgrass  say:</h3>
<h2>            Music stops with display turning off</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell XPS 13 9365 with which I have a major problem.&nbsp; It seems this system has a vPro processor and is effected by the Modern Standby situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system works fine except when the Power setting are set to turn off the display, background processes, such as iTunes, cease to operate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several Dell systems and this is the only which stop iTunes and other operations when the Display turns off.&nbsp; Even such things a virus scans stop when this happens.&nbsp; It is almost like the system goes to sleep when the display turns off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the Modern Standby, which this system supports, is flawed.&nbsp; There is NO reason the music should stop when only the Display is turned off for power considerations.&nbsp; I have four Dell systems and this is the only system which exhibits this objectionable
 behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I am asking if folks with Surface Pro 4 systems exhibit the same behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft has determined this is the normal behavior, I cannot accept such a situation.</p>

            Normally the nvd3dum.dll&nbsp; error relates to graphics as you seem to be aware.<br />
- I would suggest not using the most recent Nvidia drivers though.<br />
The most recent Nvidia drivers have been causing a lot of issues. I can vouch for 310.90<br />
working with my GTX560ti faultlessly. The 134.22 are also said to be good.<br />
- Another option is a conflict with a service or starup&nbsp; programs, including your Anti-Virus<br />
or various over-clocking/tweaking&nbsp; tools such as EVGA precision, and&nbsp; ASUS smart doctor
<br />
(if I have the correct name).<br />
Try running in Clean Boot to troubleshoot these possibilities -<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a>
<br />
<br />
However<i> -<br />
"I installed a new motherboard, did a reinstall of windows, to find that it won't let me activate it."</i><br />
<br />
More an issue for the <i>"Install, Upgrade and Activate"</i> forum, but briefly -<br />
Windows activation is linked to your motherboard. If your motherboard fails, and&nbsp; if the machine is recent enough, you may get someone on&nbsp; 'phone activation' that is sympathetic to your plight<br />
who will give you a new activation key.<br />
If not, you have to buy a new key (A new OEM from on line retailers is about the same price,<br />
but don't buy from e-bay, or similar - Too many illegitimate Chinese copies ). <br />
Windows will only fully function for a period of&nbsp; ??? before various functions start failing<br />
(I believe updates is one),&nbsp; so not activating is not tenable in the long run.<br />
<br />

<p>You shouldn't ask yes/no questions unless you expect the answer to be either "yes" or "no". You probably wanted to ask&nbsp;<em>How can I get this to stop?</em>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say that it keeps happening. Your first step should consist of making a note WHEN it happens. Regularly? At what times? Randomly? When you do something specific? Since we cannot see your screen you need to do the basic detective work yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could, of course, run rstrui.exe in order to set Windows back to a point before you became aware of this problem.</p>

<p>My guess is that you've caught some malware or a virus. I recommend that you get the machine examined by a computer-savvy friend. You might also type this phrase into a Google search box:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>zcash cuda miner</em></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><em>what is zcash</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns up some intriguing stuff, e.g. this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

            <p>Hi Carol21463,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the delay in response. In your Windows Live Mail quick view, are you reading the email messages under&nbsp;unread emails? If yes, once you have read the emails it will automatically disappear from the quick view and can be viewable in either your
 Inbox or personal folder where it should be under and will be sorted by the date where the email was sent or depends on your email settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For us to isolate the issue, we suggest that you search for the specific email first for us to determine if the email was deleted from your account. Get back to us with the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. </p>
        </p>

            <p>Thank you for replying. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my first email I already&nbsp; mention that I've looked in my inbox both online and in Live Mail for those lost emails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While waiting for your response I have changed my settings and&nbsp;unticked&nbsp; "remove from server", which explains why it wouldn't appear online, but not why it disappears from Live Mail. Anyway, as you can guess it hasn't quite solved the problem, but at least
 now I have more of a chance of finding a lost email. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is obviously a hassle as it forces me to go online to find a lost email and clean out my different folders in each of my emails, which should be unnecessary if I'm using Live Mail - don't you agree?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, problem is still there. Let me add that this doesn't happen with all mail, only with some of it. Problem is I always seem to need to go back to the ones that&nbsp;are lost - ugh!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for providing us those information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible that there is a problem with the syncronization of your account that is causing the emails to be lost. To troubleshoot the issue, please try to reconfigure your account by following the steps in this article:</p>

            <p>It would help if you mentioned the version of WLMail that you are using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have more than the Hotmail account setup in WLMail?</p>
<p>If you only have one account, then why are you using Quick view?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do you have the Hotmail account setup using pop3 protocol?&nbsp; Only Inbox messages will download and folders and messages will not sync with the server.</p>
<p>Do you ever access your account with a browser?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every folder in WLMail can have a different setting for displaying read and unread messages.</p>
<p>While viewing a folder, View tab, Filter messages, select Show all messages.</p>

            That is the problem.&nbsp; The message disappears entirely.&nbsp; It no longer is in Quick View and it can't be found in the inbox.&nbsp; Tonight I had three important contract emails disappear.&nbsp; Luckily I printed them before leaving quick views.&nbsp; Why is this happening.&nbsp;
 I'm using Windows 7.

    <title>File Explorer not opening - &#39;refreshing&#39; screen and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hannahcook  say:</h3>
<h2>            File Explorer not opening - &#39;refreshing&#39; screen and deselecting items.</h2>
                    This morning I noticed that the task bar kept disappearing and reloading, however I didn't think much of it as everything seemed to be running fine (I was only using Firefox). I was able to turn it off fine.<br />
<br />
This evening I came home and turned my laptop on. Again, everything seemed to be running fine. Until I tried opening file explorer. Then the toolbar and my desktop kept turning purple (my background colour) before reloading. I tried opening the App page so
 that I could search settings, however every couple of seconds it refreshed, resulting in a return to the normal App screen, removing my search. This has made it hard to check settings and even turn off my laptop.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Firefox seems to be the only thing working fine, however when the desktop etc 'refreshes' it deselects the box so I have to click before I can continue typing. Task Manager also opens fine, however when I click on an item the system refreshes before I
 can do anything and deselects the item. It refreshes before I can open commandline or powershell etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After Browsing for solutions I found that sometimes it is the antivirus which can affect the system this way - But Norton wasn't open in my tool bar and I couldn't open it due to the refresh issue, making it impossible to either disable it (even in task
 Manager) or run a virus scan.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After 2 hours the windows messages finally appeared in the toolbar, and I managed to click and open Windows defender, which is now running a scan (my computer seems to think that Norton isn't running despite my Task Manager saying that it is open).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Running the scan has seemed to 'calm' the refreshing down - it now does not constantly refresh, however it still refreshes when trying to open File explorer (Even when reaching for a file via the app screen then selecting "Open File Location") and command
 line, and I suspect many other programmes.<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>Anyone know how I can fix this? (Windows professional support is currently unavailable)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I should probably mentioned that I HAVE turned off and on again - several times. Although I couldn't do it from the menu, I was able to do it my pressing the power button (thus putting my laptop to sleep) and then waking it up and turning it off from the
 Log in Screen (Which seems unaffected).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for reading all this! Looking forwards to hearing any advice.</div>
                </div>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>First of all I suggest you to remove any third-party tools, if installed on your system. Then run the
<b>SFC /SCANNOW</b> command in <i>administrative Command Prompt</i> to fix the corruption related to system files. Reboot and see if that solve your problem.</div>
