<h2>            Windows &#40;built-in&#41; VPN service</h2>
                    <p>Hello </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have asked a similar question before but did not have complete all round good results. I know this question/discussion is not completely in the realm of the Microsoft Community listings, and should probably be in the Tech Net area but the answers
 you get from the Tech Net can be can I say 'scattered' no offence to the Tech Net community but the questions asked there can well are usually&nbsp;and quite rightly so very complex, as the questions that are asked there are mostly very complex and &nbsp;literally are
 questions being asked by computing masters and answered by master users. The answers are&nbsp;usually quite 'isolated' if you will and not very 'Community driven' I.E I feel the Tech net is for mainly masters. Do not get me wrong I have found and asked many questions
 in the Tech net site that have been answered magnificently maybe to magnificently if anyone can understand that. I.E answered in a very factual but complex manner. Anyway I will not waste anymore time justifying my self posting here instead, although I probably
 will end up asking on the Tech N&nbsp;too! well here goes. For some time now I have been trying to run the Windows built in VPN service with little success. I have configured on once but to be honest I have forgot how I did it! As I was trial and error-ing so much
 that when the VPN did finally connect and begin to work as far as I know! I had forgot what I had actually done! Dow! joking aside the tunnel Tap9 was the option I got to configure correctly the CMD showed that the traffic was going through that particular
 address before reaching our LAN. One of the main questions in this bundle is can one or any or all of the VPN protocol options be set up for free? I mean with the right know how and luck can one run the Windows built in VPN feature free of charge&nbsp;indefinitely?
 Also and tips on how to set up these adapters as quick and as painless as possible would be appreciated very much. And like I mentioned I did have one adapter running fully&nbsp;functional for a while I think and the adapter is still there if I go into the control
 panel internet connections (along with a lot of other failed attempts of configuring VPN's and other assorted adapters. Well that is not quite true all the adapters worked for a short while at leased some are the free trial VPN's that certain international
 company's will let you trial but then ask for the credit card details after you start to rely on them. That is all well and good for a company that is making money from Internet activity's or online banking but I do not fall in to that category. I like to
 try and get things for free no that sounds wrong and that is not my overall goal at all. I like to understand what is actually happening and work out how I can program, configure and or setup ect my own what ever service it is I need&nbsp;or should I say do not
 really need&nbsp; I just like to work out and do things on my own as much as is possible. Will not enter any bank details into my device well devices on this network anyway like mentioned I like to see if I can learn how to do these things myself instead of paying
 someone else to do them for me. This is very frustrating and time consuming but when project works out well I think most of us know that feeling. Anyway here I am raving on when we should be getting straight down to business. In the built in VPN options there
 is obviously the VPN provider that is Windows (built in) then connection name and then Server name or address then VPN type and finally type of sign-in info. I have a basic understanding of the VPN types and Type of sign-in info, Recently&nbsp; I have been trying
 to configure an old Raspberrypi to use as a VPN source. I have installed all the software required i.e updating ect and finally installing the Open VPN project I can report that it is not as easy as it used to be but it is possible I have used the Pi as a
 successful functioning VPN I think! I had to configure the router manually for a lot of the project but in the end this did work! the open VPN port is 1194 I will not tell you the ports I used for Basic input and out put traffic for obvious reasons. Which
 leads me to my main questions could or is there any known software ect that can/would work similar when setting up the Windows built in VPN. Also I notice that there is similar 'Types of VPN' I.E I use Putty and Puttygen for the Linux side of things while
 using this Windows OS I wonder if Keygen will work for the Windows when 'creating' Types of sign-in info I.E sometimes I will use Puttygen to create encrypted public and private keys when transferring data on the WAN's as one does! question does anyone have
 extensive experience with the Microsoft equivalent of Puttygen I.E Keygen I have used well tried to use Keygen in the past for the same purpose but as I remember I had little to no success. Anyway this discussion has got a start I hope anyone with and easy
 to understand basic typed information would be very appreciated an information that you guys can offer would be much appreciated. And the same goes the other way if anyone has any questions about anything I have mentioned in this discussion start up I am happy
 to answer and will ASAP. I think this may be the beginning of a long set of discussions? But when concluded hopefully everyone involved will have the Windows built in VPN options mastered? and maybe some extra useful knowledge as a bonus!? Thanks for the time,
 hopefully this is where my total understanding and mastering of Windows (built in) VPN begins!??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :)</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just wondering has any one in the community ever successfully used the built in VNP in windows 10? I understand that a VPN connection could be created and used in previous versions of Windows but what are the main differences with the Windows 10
 version except it is built in with options created by Microsoft? and are the VPN options compatible at all with other OS codes or do all the devices using the Windows VPN have to be configured to work with Microsoft software? could anyone just give a brief
 description on how they would go about starting to create a VPN using Windows built in VPN? just a basic start no encryption's just a basic server&nbsp;with a IP address,&nbsp;that Internet traffic can be routed through before reaching the LAN?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            error 0x00ce556 in Wondows 10</h2>
                    I have had a number of booting issues with my Win 10 desktop, where it would not boot to windows but would boot to BIOS. I now have the machine up and running but I am greeted by an oxc00ce556 error that is related to framework that I am sure is causing
 issues. I checked my system files and they are all ok. Is there a way to get rid of this error short of doing a complete reset of my Windows install?

            Hi Rob.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There are some specific fixes for that error here:
<br /><a href="https://appuals.com/net-parsing-error-0xc00ce556/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://appuals.com/net-parsing-error-0xc00ce556/</a>
<br />
<br />If that's not enough you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Vijay thanks for your response. I was planning to update this the next time I booted and will do so soon. I was hoping for a Microsoft sourced solution, as I am usually not comfortable with 3rd party solutions that claim they will fix your issue and then
 run a "diagnostic" that finds hundreds of errors. The sfc command found nothing. I will get back shortly.

<p>Vijay yes my problem is discussed in the link. My error is "Error parsing C:\\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\config\machine.config &nbsp; Paser returned error 0xC00CE556. So I will try the replacement of the config file, by copying the one that
 is on my Surface Pro 2017, and see if it clears up my other issues. I am sure it will remove this error. MY desktop was recently rebuilt by me. I added a new motherboard and a faster chip and did a new install of the operating system. Everything worked fine
 until the latest update. I may go ahead and do a clean install if I don't get things running better, as I sometimes still have problems booting past A0, but I can get it to boot if I hold down the power key for about 5 sec. In any case one step at a time.
 I will post again after I try the fix.</p>

            Greg thanks for your input. If you look at my latest response to Vijay , I do have the problem described in appuals. I will try and replace the config file tomorrow by copying the one on my laptop which is working fine. As I said to Vijay, I may go ahead
 and do a clean install later if my issues continue. I already have the media creation tool and originally used it to try and get my machine to boot after the update, but nothing I tried worked. The upgrade wiped out my previous setpoints, so I could not roll
 back and even the automatic restore which the machine went into was not able to repair the machine. I finally got it working with the 10 count power key trick, and that is when I saw the parsing error. So when I make this next fix if things don't improve,
 I think I will do another clean install. I have a clone of my previous install but I even had trouble using that as that drive was not even being recognized by Acronis SW to copy it over to my SSD, which has never happened before. I have b

<p>Hi..ive read through&nbsp;many of the points raised in the link above but cant really find anything of substance. The plain fact of the matter is that in Windows 7 configuration...<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Backup worked perfectly
</span>and now in Windows 10 ..doesn't. As far as my external drives are concerned (1 is the old 320GB HDD I replaced with a Samsung 250GB 850 EVO before upgrading to Win10 ) and although I have no software for it, has worked perfectly for the last 5 years
 and still does. The 1TB Samsung M3 Portable&nbsp;does have diagnostic software and on test proves to be 100%. I have dragged several files into each of them today with no problems. So both can be ruled out.&nbsp; Backup recognises both when they are connected. The snapshot
 I enclosed earlier shows that File History is OFF and unless or until that can be fixed then im going nowhere.&nbsp;Despite yet more inconvenience, would resetting the whole Windows installation be of any use?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Update...in trying to create a system image from a different route with an external hard drive attached (which was recognised as being suitable ) ..I received the Error 80070422..Ive read up about that and it seems its to do with Windows Update ?..although
 what ive read was for Windows 7 I have been into services.msc and tried altering the status of Windows Update from manual to auto with no result so ive returned it to manual..I know there is a repair tool for 80070422 errors but again that is Windows 7 notices
 so I'm not going to do anything until advised</p>
</blockquote>
Hello to any MVP or Microsoft Engineer or Geethu or Vanessa...ive solved (hopefully) all my problems by resetting the Windows 10 Home OS Build 10586.0&nbsp;Update 1511 download...which has restored any alterations I was advised to make or did myself. File History
 is restored and 'ON' and Backup is also now functional.

            Hello ChristyTaylor1
<br />I'm peter F 
<br />Please follow these steps 
<br />Open the Store app, search for Windows Camera app and then install the same.
<br />
<br />If that didn't work 
<br />Note : be careful with these steps 
<br />Step 1: Run Windows PowerShell as administrator. To do so, right-click on the Start button on the taskbar and then click Windows PowerShell (Admin) option. Alternatively, type PowerShell in Start/taskbar search field, right-click on Windows PowerShell entry and then click Run as administrator option.
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 2: At the PowerShell window, copy and paste the following command. Press Enter key to execute the command.
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage –AllUsers
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 3: Now, look for Microsoft.WindowsCamera entry. Select the PackageFullName of Camera app and use Ctrl + C hotkey to copy it to the clipboard.
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 4: Execute the following command to uninstall the Camera app.
<br />
<br />Remove-AppxPackage PackageFullName
<br />
<br />In the above command, replace PackageFullName with the actual PackageFullName that you copied in the previous step.
<br />
<br />
<br />You may close the PowerShell window now.
<br />Finally, open the Store app, search for Windows Camera app and then install the same.
<br />
<br />I hope it helps

    <title>I want to move photos from Windows Photo app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reginarz  say:</h3>
<h2>            I want to move photos from Windows Photo app</h2>
                    <p>I have photos in the Windows Photo App that I want to move.&nbsp; They were placed in the Photo app when I connected my phone and chose import photos.&nbsp; I did not have a choice of where to put the photos.
</p>
<p>I have checked a photo, clicked Copy (either right-click or using COPY at the top of the app) and sometimes I can click in a folder on my PC, use CTRL V and paste the photo. Only sometimes.&nbsp; Always when I move a photo like this I get a copy of the photo
 in the Window Photo App.&nbsp; Also when I try to delete the extra copy in the app, the copy I wanted in the PC file gets deleted too.</p>
<p>This gets very messy. Example: Move 10 photos, maybe get 8 or 10 photos in the PC file folder, definitely get 10 more photos in the App. I am very frustrated. I no longer want to copy photos to my PC, I want to move them out of the App.</p>
<p>I want to get all photos out of the App. Kill the App. And then I want to be able to choose where photos go the next time I import from my phone (android).&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

            <p>All of Photos' folders are listed at the top of its Settings (upper right corner). &nbsp;Take a look and see what's there other than Pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right clicking is the easiest way to locate any photo but you must be in full screen mode to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for copying and pasting individual pictures to a folder, MS has written that this is unsupported and that the only function of Copy is to paste to the desktop. &nbsp;Always use Explorer if you want to copy files, but Photos' Album feature is supposed to largely
 eliminate that need.</p>

<h2>            Cannot update Windows 10 features and drivers</h2>
                    <p>I bought a hp laptop from Walmart just recently. I am not able to update. I have tried several times. I tells me Windows could not configure one or more system componets. To install Windows, restart the computer and then restart the installation. My laptop
 must be missing some update when I bought it. I have been told that I might be missing updates that were made after my laptop was sent to stores for sale.</p>

<h2>            Chrome Crashing Windows 10</h2>
                    Sometimes whenever I try to go into google chrome, it won't respond. But whenever that happens, windows 10 freaks out. For example, My taskbar won't work for awhile. And once it does work, I can't put the computer to sleep. And if it ever recovers, I can't
 open any apps forcing me to turn off my computer. I've scanned my computer for viruses and nothing came up, does anyone know any way to fix it?&nbsp;

<h2>            Game Refunds</h2>
                    I bought Sea of Thieves, twice. I refunded the first time because I didn't like, then after caving in again I bought it at the request of my friends, because they said we'd play the game together, and it would be fun. Then it wasn't fun, they didn't actually
 play the game with me, so then I tried to refund it. But now I can't because of the Terms of Sale? How can I get the game refunded.<br />
<br />
<br />
(I'm refunding it because I need to buy other things, and 30 dollars is a lot for me)

<p>Saw this on the avatar marketplace today: <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Ghillie-Suit/00000ffc-1f4f-22b1-c84f-d7a858580850?cid=SLink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Who is the manufacturer of the speaker?<br />
•&nbsp;Is this the first time you are trying to connect the speaker?<br />
•&nbsp;Was there any software (CD) that came with his speakers?</p>
<p>Windows 7 does support 4.1 speakers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Check the speaker configuration. Make sure that the cables to speaker and computer are connected properly.</p>
<p>“How do I test my speaker configuration? “ <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Sound-cards-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Sound-cards-frequently-asked-questions</a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Run the audio troubleshooter</p>
<p>“Open the Playing Audio troubleshooter” <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If the above does not fix, then you may want to update the sound card with the latest drivers.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update lost my Desktop Assistant and my Video Player - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jenniferfurrow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update lost my Desktop Assistant and my Video Player</h2>
                    I installed all the updates on my PC and it instructed me to uninstall manually the Toshiba Video Player and reinstall the update. Fine. I did ask instructed. When I tried to back track to the update, the Desktop assistant no longer shows on the, well,
 Desktop, or anywhere else I searched in the PC. I tried to update my PC and it says I am all up to date. Really? Well, there's no Toshiba Video Player. There are also several other suspicious blank spaces on my desktop where icons used to be. Not sure what
 they were (sigh). Any ideas on what happened? And some much needed help, please? I am a computer semi-dummy, so go easy on me. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.

    <title>XBOX controller battery issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            XBOX controller battery issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p><p><br /></p><p>My XBOX&nbsp;360 controller has recently been playing up and not switching on. Changing the batteries makes no difference. If I apply a small amount of pressure to the back of the battery case, the control comes on, and if I remove that pressure it switches off. I&nbsp;have tried my other controllers battery case in the faulty controller, and makes no difference. I&nbsp;am wondering if there is something I can do to fix it, or if buying a rechargeable battery pack would help?</p><p><br /></p><p>Cheers</p>

            <p>Actually, no problems anymore. Found a youtube video about inserting a small piece of cardboard into the divet in the battery case. There is some piece of plastic on the xbox controller that digs into this divet in the battery pack. Must need to depress the metal strip in the case to form a circuit for the batteries to power the controller, but for whatever reason it wasn't depressing properly, and so the cardboard just gave it that extra bit of pressure. Hope this helps someone else with the problem. </p>

            <p><span>Hi Muhammed,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and&nbsp;I am glad to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There is a feature in Windows 10 called paging file&nbsp;and helps you in this difficult situation. It is a feature present in your operating system that lets your computer balance for scarcity of physical memory by momentarily moving pages of data from
 RAM to disk storage.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click&nbsp;on </span><strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong><span> and open the
<span>System</span> window by clicking on <span>System</span> icon.</span></li><li><span>When you see the <span>System</span> window opened, click on the <span>
Advanced system settings</span> link which is obtainable from the left pane of the window.</span></li><li><span>The <span>System Properties</span> dialog box will turn up on your screen and you will get in the
<span>Advanced</span> tab. See the <span>Performance</span> section of the&nbsp;<span>Advanced</span> tab and click on its
<span>Settings&nbsp;</span>link</span><span>&nbsp; </span></li><li><span>This action will bring up the <span>Performance Options</span> dialog box for you. Take your attention to the
<span>Advanced</span> tab. To proceed further, click on the <strong><span>Change</span>&nbsp;button.</strong></span></li><li><span>The <span>Virtual Memory</span> dialog box comes on the screen. This is the place where you will do all the required modifications. Windows, by default,&nbsp;itself controls the paging file size. You will deselect the option
<span>Automatically manage paging file size for all drives</span>.</span></li><li><span>Now, to set the paging file size of the drive, choose the required drive. After that go to the next section and selects the option of
<span>Custom size</span>.</span></li><li><span>Provide the <span>Initial size </span>and<span> Maximum size</span> (in MB) of disk space in the respective boxes.</span></li><li><span>These sizes will be set as the paging file for your selected drive. </span>
</li><li><span>Once done, click the <strong><span>Set</span> button</strong>. Do these settings for all the drives.</span></li><li><span>Now onwards, Windows 10 will utilize the disk space mentioned by you. There are quite few clicks, but it is not that hard to finish the things.</span></li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps. Get back to us for further queries. We are happy to help!</p>

            <p>Sometimes, very rarely, manufacturers include a setting in BIOS that allows you to increase dedicated video RAM for integrated graphics - but it is rare!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no way in Windows to do this - Sorry!</p>

            The only way to "increase" video ram (vram) is to&nbsp; replace the video card.&nbsp; You cannot add memory to video cards<br />

            <p>OK so it is not a PC, on a MacBook Pro up to 1.5gb is dynamically allocated to the IRIS graphics if and when it is needed
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot upgrade the graphics card on a MacBook Pro, it is normally integrated into the main processor</p>

            Instead of us trying to guess what you mean you might want to tell us what you are trying to do.&nbsp; On ANY system that uses built in video you canot change the amount of ACTUAL video ram.&nbsp; On some systems you can change "shared" video memory but that will
 not help improve gaming performance.<br />
