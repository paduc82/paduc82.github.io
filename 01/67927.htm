<h2>            Bitlocker usb support</h2>
                    I ran the drive preperation tool for bitlocker.&nbsp; It restarted when restarted my bios doent have the TPM.&nbsp; In the help it says I can use usb drive instead to hold the key.&nbsp; I tried restarting with the usb in it then clicked bitlocker still told me about
 tpm and didnt allow me to choose the drive to encrypt.&nbsp; I restarted with out usb plugged in same thing.&nbsp; I tried reruning the drive preparation tool again but it tells me my drive is already ready for it.&nbsp; It changed made adjustments in my volumes making my
 other volume active and placing the boot info on there.&nbsp; But I cant encrypt my drives or get it to work with my usb to set key.&nbsp; What am I doing wrong?

<p><span><span>Hello Nef1979,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>BitLocker can also be used without a TPM. To use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, you must change the default behavior of the BitLocker setup
 wizard by using Group Policy, or configure BitLocker by using a script. When BitLocker is used without a TPM, the required encryption keys are stored on a USB flash drive that must be presented to unlock the data stored on a volume.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Refer the below article for more information on this:

<p>Backuppare i salvataggi di un gioco mi pare francamente eccessivo.</p>
<p>Io non ne ho mai perso uno.. se dovesse succedere amen.</p>

<p>Backuppare i dati profilo invece è davvero inutile poichè il tuo profilo è costantemente backuppato in automatico sui server microsoft.</p>

<p>Il sistema Cloud di Xbox permette di memorizzare i salvataggi e il profilo. Ma NON tutti i giochi supportano questa possibilità inoltre NON tutti i giochi permettono di avere una duplice copia dei salvataggi su cloud e sulla periferica locale.</p>

            First, thank you to those that responded.&nbsp; But this is what solved my problem:&nbsp; Searching for for about 3 days I found a post (https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-10-creators-update-version-1709-bug/b0f93200-1121-4abb-85bd-e15627e899a6?rtAction=1514415003889)
 that exactly mirrored my problem.&nbsp; As soon as I followed this poster's reccomendations my problem was solved.

    <title>Can&#39;t Personalize&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thelma-n-louise  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Personalize&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just recently upgraded to Windows 10, and for some reason I can't personalize my lock screen, and my taskbar won't auto-hide! I have tried everything I found on here. The taskbar hides once or twice, then locks up again, over and over... The lock screen
 won't let me in PERIOD. I have done all but two suggestions from here, and that would be because those two suggestions, when I try I get a warning that the computer may become 'unstable' as it is interfering with the system programming. I am ready to quit
 Windows 10 and go back to 8... not that I cared too much for that version, but this is the worst. It keeps saying that 'some programs are controlled by your organization', which is irritating, as I didn't set one up. However, when looking into it, my computer
 says 'organization: workplace'. So, 3 things here:</p>
<p>1. How do I PERMANENTLY unlock the taskbar so it will PERMANENTLY and CONTINUOUSLY auto-hide?</p>
<p>2. How do I fix the settings to personalization, so I can change the screen that is there now?</p>
<p>3. How do I change the 'organization' so that it no longer controls what I can or can't do on my OWN COMPUTER?</p>

<h2>            Update has made screen nothing but coloured fuzz</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 has been updated - not by my choice...thanks again Microsoft.&nbsp; This has been happening since the update in the fall.&nbsp; I would come to work, see this (in a variety of colours) reset to an earlier version and work away.&nbsp; So annoying - probably did
 it at least 20 times, losing hours in my workday.&nbsp; Someone said resetting the entire computer would fix it, so reset everything and clearly that did not help.</p>

</p><p>This is what it looks like now.&nbsp; So obviously I cant see to reset it to an earlier version or update anything or change any settings.&nbsp; Is there any point taking it in to be fixed somewhere if nothing can be seen?&nbsp; Just looking to find out if something can
 be done or if I should chuck it out the back window and go buy a Mac?&nbsp; I am so tired and frustrated by technology lately.....Thank you in advance for any advice.</p>

    <title>Xbox Live Boykott as a sign from the gamers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Live Boykott as a sign from the gamers</h2>
                    
<p>Dear fellas,</p>

<p>what would you think about a massive Xbox Live boykott?</p>
<p>Mean, maybe we could use a live boykott on the weekends, for one day maybe, as a sign of demonstration.</p>
<p>We should get as many people as possible on the boat.</p>
<p>I'm not the right person to planning these steps, but love the idee of forcing MS to react via a virtual demonstration.</p>
<p>Maybe some of you have more ideas and organistion talent. Let's think about &nbsp;how WE can react to this poor behaivior by MS in a polite but clear way.</p>
<p>So what do you think?</p>
<p>See ya all,</p>
<p>Goover</p>

<p>Are you saying you think there'd be a positive impact to complain about Microsoft's policies, by people not using any XBL features over the weekend?</p>
<p>Seems to me that that'd just reduce the cost of Microsoft's server usage and technical support, etc., as opposed to drawing attention to the fact that you dislike their policies.</p>
<p>If you want to make an impact, maybe cancel your Xbox Live all together until the release of the Xbox One or until your specific desires are met. If Microsoft saw a mass cancellation of XBL accounts, that might cause media attention and make them address
 your concerns.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Why do you think that?</p>
<p>I honestly believe one of the only things that will REALLY catch the media's attention and Microsoft's is a mass cancellation of XBL accounts. It's measurable at the top management levels and it might have significant financial and operational impact.</p>
<p>In fact, Microsoft has stated that everyone who is currently an XBL member OR joins in the future will get free Xbox 360 games. So you don't even have to worry about losing those rights by killing your subscription for a while.</p>
<p>If you use some online petition or Facebook, etc., Microsoft can ignore you because they can justify to themselves that maybe you're just from Sony or not an Xbox supporter. If you hit their operations and revenue, you can cause change.</p>

<p>Though a "Cancel Gold" idea sounds good and would draw attention, it probably wouldnt work.</p>
<p>I think the majority of people (inc me) have already paid for 12 months in advance, so in affect it wouldnt hurt them financially at all. My gold is due to expire next April, so I would be handing them 10 months of subs for nothing.</p>

<p>All because Xbox One costs $499? &nbsp;Or is it cause it's supposed to work amazingly with voice and &nbsp;video commands? &nbsp;Which is it?</p>

<p>BTW &nbsp;my Wife just renewed her Gold account for 3 months yesterday, &nbsp;I think its cause she likes to game on the Xbox. &nbsp;Just thought I'd share how upset we are here in this house.</p>

<p>Yeah, I too pay in advance (as do other family members and friends in other households). I think the logistics really have to be worked out, but are you saying that you know for sure that Microsoft keeps every buck I invested? I thought they'd give me a
 partial refund for unused time.</p>
<p>It'd still probably cause a bit of a stir at both Microsoft and major media outlets, if, say, 250,000 folks cancelled their XBL subscriptions in one week. But I figured that maybe Microsoft would have to refund some of our bucks and spend an increased amount
 of time dealing with the processing of all those cancellations!</p>

            Install Chrome to have another browser available when needed. You can have several browsers installed and pick one to be the default.&nbsp;

<p>I don't know anything about this issue, but I wanted to make a few points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Edge is *not* the only browser that comes with Windows 10. You also have Internet Explorer 11 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. As far as I'm concerned, Edge is a poor browser, and that are several better choices available, including IE11 (IE 11 isn't great either, but it's better than Edge).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. You say "I don't want to add another browser to Windows 10," but I recommend that that's exactly what you do. With several better choices available, why do you want to continue using Edge? My personal favorite is FireFox, but I recommend that you try
 several and choose the one *you* like best, not the one that I or someone else likes best.</p>

            Thank you for the replies. I had preferred Edge over IE because It is faster and much more reliable. I have had zero problem with it. Im familar with Firefox and will download it.&nbsp;

<p>The warning message on Citibank's home page is gone so I assume the flaw is fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did try Internet Explorer and received the typical warning on script pages not working etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry guys I think Edge is much better then Explorer, just my 2cents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for all the responses.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I love Windows 7 but hate Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>You shouldn't force Windows 10 on people. The least you could do is give us a choice. So here's my question:</p>
<p>Are there any alternatives?</p>

<p>There are no alternatives to Windows 7, just different operating systems. Linux is not Windows and most of the software designed for Windows can struggle to operate with it and sometimes not at all. Some offer dual boot to get around this problem. But it
 is far from satisfactory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft could charge Windows 7 users for updates for those not prepared to go to Windows 10. Or they could farm out the updates service to another company to charge the users for this service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft obviously want people to keep using their service. But they have to except that a growing number of users hate Windows 10 (including myself) and are not going to update to the 10 system. If they except that, they they could still make money from
 royalties by farming out Windows 7 services to other companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft need to remember there are some people out there using XP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Killing windows 7 will cause economic turmoil and you know it but being so wrapped up in your profit margin I know you don't care and that's why at our company we will switch to apple products. We have tried windows 10 and it is NOT user friendly like
 windows 7. You know the saying, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it!'

            Does Panasonic make a Windows 10-compatible driver for your camcorder? Without a Windows 10-compatible driver, your camcorder is not going to work properly (or at all.)

<h2>            Unable to disable touchpad after Windows 8.1 update</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Since updating to Windows 8.1, I can't lock my touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since updating to Windows 8.1 on my Dell Inspirion laptop, I can't lock my touchpad. as I could in the past. &nbsp;Now it scrolls, the cursor moves and it generally ticks me off. &nbsp;How can I lock it? &nbsp;I use a wireless mouse but all other fixes suggest I permanently
 disable it. &nbsp;I don't want to do this but just want to have it easily disabled. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there an easy way? &nbsp;I've tried going through my PC Access - didn't work. &nbsp;I could only set the delay as short, medium or long.

            <p>Hi Candace,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you installed&nbsp;Dell Quickset in your computer?</li><li>What is the model number of the computer?</li></ol>
<p>At first, I would suggest you to install Dell Quickset and try disabling it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like the driver for touchpad may not be compatible for Windows 8.1. You may visit
<a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/Products/laptop/inspiron_laptop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Dell's website</a> to download the latest touchpad driver and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the website does not have driver for Windows 8.1,&nbsp;you <span>can install Windows&nbsp;8 drivers in compatibility mode.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press the ‘<strong>Windows + W</strong>’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type <strong>compatibility</strong> in the search box and then press
<strong>enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click “<strong>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</strong>” option from the list appeared in the left side.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)</span></span><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span>Select the drivers and install</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you update the latest drivers, try to disable touch pad.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also try the following steps and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Press ‘<strong>Fn</strong>’ + ‘<strong>F3</strong>’ key to disable or enable the Touchpad on your computer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Click “<strong>Start</strong>” and type <strong>Device Manager</strong> in “Start Search” to open the “Device Manager”.</span></p>
<p><br />
b. In <strong>Device Manager</strong>, click on the arrow beside “<strong>Mice and Other Pointing Devices</strong>”.</p>
<p><br />
c. Right click on “<strong>Dell TouchPad</strong>” and click on “<strong>Disable</strong>”.</p>
<p><br />
d. Select “<strong>Yes" </strong>if you receive a warning message.</p>
<br />
e. Close the “Device Manager” and check the issue.
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know the result, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Which driver for Mobile Intel 915GM&#47;GMS,910GML Express graphics controller&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have installed Windows 7 (32-bit) on a laptop computer with a Mobile Intel 915GM/GMS,910GML Express graphics controller. Obviously there is no Windows 7 driver for this controller, so the standard VGA driver is installed instead.</p>
<p>The Windows XP driver for the graphic card first installs under Windows 7 without any error messages, but when restart the machine the system tells me that it can't install the graphics driver.</p>
<p>What is the best way of using the 915GM/GMS,910GML graphics controller under Windows 7 - stick with the standard VGA driver?</p>

    <title>Acer Laptop backlight turning off 9 seconds after splash screen cold - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mnswede2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Acer Laptop backlight turning off 9 seconds after splash screen cold booting Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>While in my care (I own/operate a computer repair shop), a customer's Acer Aspire E15 Touch laptop running the latest updated version of Windows 10 Home has started to have a backlight issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Booting from powered off, I'll get an Acer logo, and about 9 seconds later (every time), the backlight will turn off, continuing to boot and operate otherwise normally... just no backlight. A bright flashlight allows me to see enough to RESTART, and upon
 restart and waking from sleep, it'll go through the boot process and work just fine, backlight included.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could tell her to NEVER turn it off, just sleeping and restarting, but that's (as far as I know) NOT how it was when it arrived, and not how it should leave my shop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>She originally brought it to me to have a tune-up performed. She'd complained of a long-running script that kept trying to run and it would fail (I never saw it).&nbsp; She wanted me to uninstall McAfee. Removed McAfee and performed my usual tune-up, and among
 other things, I installed a pretty long list of Microsoft Updates. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done a Power Reset (battery removed, no AC power attached, pressed and held power button for 30+ seconds).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have incrementally "updated" (a downgrade) </p>
<p>the Intel HD Graphics driver from a digitally unsigned version:&nbsp;&nbsp; 12/21/2015 v10.18.10.4358</p>
<p>to a Microsoft Windows Hdwe. Compatibility Publisher version: 08/17/2015 v10.18.10.4276</p>
<p>
</p><p>Might it be a tired inverter board, that on a boot from powered off would fail after 9 seconds EVERY TIME, but come to life and work just fine upon a _Restart_ EVERY TIME from that condition (backlight off)?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched for most of a day and found no clues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading. </p>

<p>A follow up...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Customer took it home to use while I continued to search for solution. </p>
<p>
</p><p>She'd left it sleeping and unplugged overnight. Next day, she opens lid to find the battery had run down to nothing. Plugged it in and powered up to find the same problem exists: backlight works until about 9 seconds past logo/splash screen and goes out.
 She doesn't have a strong enough flashlight to see cursor to choose to restart (which somehow is immune to the backlight issue). Calls me and brings it in for me to help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open the lid, waking it from sleep, and to our surprise, the backlight works. To test, powered off. Powered back on, expecting backlight issue to persist, but it does not. Repeat power down, power back up three more times while she's in the shop, and it
 continues to work fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I wonder, would/could a glitchy sleep switch (when closing laptop's display) possibly have something to do turning the backlight off after a very predictable number of seconds, but NOT put the computer to sleep?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do welcome comments by anyone experiencing something similar, or with any insight.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem APPEARS to have resolved, for now.</p>
<p>
Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>It WAS NOT solved (as previously stated/hoped), but with a further search, and I found a solution...</p>
<p>
</p><p>See:&nbsp; https://community.acer.com/en/discussion/374017/brightness-issue-on-aspire-e5-511</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem appears to have started with a Windows 10 update in my customer's case. The user (that found the solution) says it's due to a Windows 10 "upgrade".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A BIOS update from v1.02 to the latest v1.10 has solved it for my customer's machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mission Accomplished! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone else.</p>

<h2>            Family member can&#39;t join after receiving the email invite</h2>
                    I invited a family member to create a log-in for them on a new windows 10 PC. The family member received the invite email but when they click "Join" it asks for a password. They don't have a password yet and therefore can't finish the joining process.
 This is a cray way to add users, what happen to the simple control panel process?????

            Hi.<br /><br />As of December 2018, if you purchase a Skype Number and don't have Caller ID enabled, your Skype Number will be automatically set as your Caller ID for the countries that this is available in.<br /><br />To change to your Skype Number if you had Caller ID enabled with another number:<br /><br />Sign in to your account.<br />In the Manage features section, click Caller ID.<br />From the bulleted list displayed, select the Skype Number that you want to use as your Caller ID.<br />Click Save Settings. Your Caller ID is now set and ready to go.<br /><br />​In Skype (version 8) on Android (6.0+), Android tablet, iPhone, iPad, desktop, and Skype for Windows 10 (version 14), you can also enable Caller ID by selecting your profile picture &gt; Settings &gt; Calling &gt; Caller ID.<br /><br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is...</a>

    <title>AMD Phenom II X2 and Windows 10 compatibility - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> old2k15  say:</h3>
<h2>            AMD Phenom II X2 and Windows 10 compatibility</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently upgraded my Windows 7 Pro 64 bit System to Windows 10. The system seems to work fine. Afterwards I've upgraded my cpu from an AMD Athlon 4850e to AMD Phenom II X2 550. The systems began to freeze randomly without any error message in the system
 protocol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried many things to solve this issue without success. Bios upgrade, hdd firmware upgrade, another power supply, clean installation etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem persists. When I use the old Athlon CPU the system is stable. When I use another OS like Windows 7 32 bit it works. Checked Linux Live CD, works without freezes or crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mainboard: &nbsp;K9N2GM-FIH</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I gave up to find the problem. My Question: Are there known compatibility issues with AMD Phenom II X2 processors and Win10? I really don't understand this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So long</p>
<p>old</p>

    <title>Problems with Outlook Caused by Windows 1809 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andyludlum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Outlook Caused by Windows 1809 Update</h2>
                    Twice I've tried to install Windows 10 update 1809.&nbsp; Both times it corrupted Microsoft Outlook 2013.&nbsp; When I'd try to open Outlook, I'd immediately get a blue screen saying the entire computer (not just Outlook) had to be restarted.&nbsp; I tried to fix Outlook,
 tried rolling back the update to 1803, but nothing repaired the corruption to Outlook.&nbsp; I finally had to re-image the computer with an image with 1803.&nbsp; (Another minor thing that happened was that my desktop background photo disappeared, leaving me with a
 black desktop screen.)&nbsp; I can't seem to find a good answer as to what to do.&nbsp; I have Windows 10 Home so I've had to fool the computer by saying I'm on a metered connection so it won't keep downloading the update.&nbsp; But sometime I'm going to want to update and
 I'm looking for a solution.&nbsp; Is Microsoft still working on bugs related to 1809?&nbsp; Thanks to anyone for your suggestions.

            Hi Andy, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />Blue screen errors can indicate more issues with your system, so see if the System File Checker can repair any corrupt system files:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type cmd.
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />- Type sfc /scannow
<br />- Press Enter.
<br />
<br />I'd also recommend running and Office Repair, which may resolve the Outlook issues:

<br />
<br />You could also try running Outlook in Safe Mode:

    <title>How can Windows Explorer be configured to traverse the folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can Windows Explorer be configured to traverse the folder hierarchy instead of behaving like a browser&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am working with files in a folder hierarchy.&nbsp; I want to traverse this folder hierarchy just like I did in the original Windows Explorer in Windows XP.&nbsp; I want to use the arrow keys to navigate up and down, and when I am in a folder and hit the back button,
 I want it to go up a level in the folder hierarchy just like it used to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, when I hit the "back button", <strong>Windows Explorer behaves like a browser</strong>, and goes to the last folder that I viewed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is so frustrating!&nbsp; It interrupts my thought process and the flow of my work.&nbsp; If I wanted to use a browser, I would use Internet Explorer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How can Windows Explorer be configured to traverse the folder hierarchy instead of behaving like a browser?&nbsp; Remember the "unwebified" version of Windows Explorer from Windows XP?&nbsp; That is what I want so that I can return to working efficiently!</strong></p>
