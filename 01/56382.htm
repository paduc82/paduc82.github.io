<h2>            Xbox One will not read game or movie disks.</h2>
                    
<p>My problem started a couple months ago. It started not reading any game disks. I would have to put the disk in several times to finally get to work. It would read movies just fine at the time. Now it won't read either of them without having to put the disk
 in dozens of times. Really kills the gaming mood. My Xbox isn't in an enclosed space and it and my disks are clean and well taken care of. Any solutions?</p>

<p>I have also experienced this problem. It has infuriated me to no end and I'm ready to just call it quits and get a PS4. I refuse to download a second copy of a game I already own on disc. What's the deal Microsoft?</p>

<h2>            Computer freezes 2 to 3 mins after boot up, sometimes says &#34;Windows not genuine&#34;</h2>
                    <div>Hi!</div>
<div>I have a Toshiba Satellite L750D. Windows 7.</div>
<div>All running smoothly when I bought the laptop 3 months ago.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Few days ago, this started to happen:</div>
<div>The computer starts running fine, Windows boots up, shows user login screen. All running fine till here.</div>
<div>Desktop shows, Windows runs as usual. Two to three mins later, it becomes terribly slow. So slow that just trying to open Explorer takes like 5 minutes... The situation then becomes unbearable, it's like the computer freezes up.</div>
<div>I have then to shut it down manually (pressing On/Off button for 5secs).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In another times, apart that problem, it appears in bottom right of desktop that the copy of Windows isn't genuine.</div>
<div>I know it's genuine, I bought the laptop and I activated Windows correctly. But well, that's a minor issue and only happens 1/3 of the times I try to start up the computer. The primary issue is that infinite pseudo-freeze of Windows.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Starting in Safety Mode doesn't change the problem at all. It will start well, and like 3 mins later, becomes terribly slow again.</div>
<div>I can solve problem in any way (run antivirus, etc) because I can't run it smoothly...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Appreciate feedback regarding this issue,</div>
<div>best regards,</div>
<div>Joel Möllering</div>

            Hi!<br />
A lot of thanks for the feedback, but since the computer is a Toshiba, it has a Default Configuration system that allows me to restores the laptop to the fabric, without booting windows.<br />
I did that, I lost a couple of files, but now all is ok.
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

<h2>            Age of Empires III&#58; The Asian Dynasties unable to install the &#34;Art5.bar&#34; file and would not proceed past that file. I</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:</p>
<p>Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a couple years with Ages of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties uninstalled I recently attempted to install it. When the installer was unable to install the "Art5.bar" file and would not proceed past that file. I have attempted multiple installs with
 the same result. If it is a scratch or issue with the disk, is there no way, short of purchasing a new copy, that would allow installation of The Asian Dynasties or would repair the disk? Would it be possible to force the installation to skip past installing
 the "Art5.bar" file and attempt to find the file online from a patch or other source?
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I found similar issues addressed online and was in the process of attempting a possible solution, which was to copy the files from my disk into another folder and attempt to install from there. I then discovered that windows could not copy a certain file
 on the disk called "YPack_~1" correctly. The copying process would stop, much like the installer of The Asian Dynasties had previously, and would not proceed past the "YPack_~1" file. I was also unable to copy the "00002.tmp" file, but I was able to skip past
 copying the file. I do not know if this file is corrupted and critical for installation, and have not been able to determine if so when attempting to run the installer from the folder as the installer cannot begin installing The Asian Dynasties without the
 "YPack_~1" file. I have not found similar issues online and do not know if this concerns the issue of installing The Asian Dynasties or indicates corrupt files on my disk.</div>

            <p>Hi, I also couldn't copy the 00002.tmp, but I think it might be due to a cyclic redundancy check indicating a damaged disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe try downloading that file from the internet and (after making sure that it's the right file) replacing the version on your CD.</p>

<h3> gunnmann  say:</h3>
<h2>            I installed a game from the Microsoft Store, tried to transfer it to another hard drive, the transfer crashed, now I can&#39;t uninstall the game.</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded Sea Of Thieves onto my secondary hard drive and it was running really slow. So I made space on my SSD and tried to transfer it over using the Move command in the Settings panel.. My computer crashed half way through the transfer and now I can't
 resume the transfer or uninstall the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Store still thinks the game is still installed, but under the Apps &amp; Featured menu there is a blank application that is the same size as the game but it won't uninstall...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to hunt down the files and delete them manually? I have tried some 3rd party uninstall programs but none of them register the program as installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the program is eating up 40 gigs of space on both of my HDs and I want to play it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the item in the Start Menu it gives me this error:&nbsp;We’re updating ms-resource:AppNameShippingClient. It should be ready to use again shortly.</p>

<p>Reinstalling the game on an SSD is not going to make it run smoother. The only benefit to using an SSD for games</p>
<p>is a <em>slightly</em> faster loading time.</p>
<p>The primary factor in games not running well is not having an adequate graphics processor, and to a lesser extent an inadequate cpu.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp; I don't use the MS Store, so don't know how it works. Does the Windows Store client software have an option to transfer a
</p>
<p>game to another drive, or did you just try to move the files ?</p>
<p>This would be a tricky option requiring the Store client to make changes in Registry or the file path would get stuffed up,</p>
<p>which seems to have happened anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If the tool linked by Vijay doesn't fix your problem you may have to locate the game in Registry and delete the keys.</p>
<p>These are commonly found in the <em>Current User &gt; Software</em> section, but I wouldn't put it past MS Windows Store to put them</p>
<p>in an uncommon location.</p>
<p>Also delete any remaining files in the folder the game was installed in as well as any files you can find in your
</p>
<p>User Document or User AppData&gt;Local or Roaming folders.</p>

    <title>pdf printer not showing in printer list - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            pdf printer not showing in printer list</h2>
                    I have now spent countless hours trying to resolve using Acrobat 9 Standard (updated now to 9.3.3) with Windows 7 Professional on a new 64bit Dell laptop.&nbsp; Originally, ALL of my printers would disappear once I opened a pdf. I uninstalled the Reader that
 I had downloaded prior, also restored my system to a previous date and reinstalled&nbsp;the Acrobat. Seemed ok for a couple of weeks until I lost all printers again. Now I have uninstalled all Adobe products AND reinstalled 9.0 (it wanted my code for 6.0 also)
 downloaded and installed all updates sequentially and now I see all BUT the pdf printer.&nbsp; SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME!!!&nbsp; I am not very computer savvy, and this is absolutely frustrating me.

    <title>Error code 0x8004011d - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> misterdk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error code 0x8004011d</h2>
                    Running 32-bit Win 7 Pro with P4 and 1 gig ram. Office 2007. I'm on a MS Exchange server that I cannot connect to. Earlier in the day it was working ok but not tonight. I have verified Internet access. In Outlook 2007 when I open the program, in lower
 right corner it says "trying to connect to Microsoft Exchange" but it won't connect and the message changes to "disconnected". If I click on Send/Receive, in the window that appears it says Microsoft Exchange-sending-Completed<br />
The next line says Microsoft Exchange-Processing. It stays that way for a while until the error code above appears. Earlier in the evening I installed Skype software and Logitech audio software. Not sure if that could have any effect.<br />
<br />
Anyone seen this and know a solution? Thanks.

<p>Hi, thanks for the reply yes as u mentioned i have tried almost everything to sort it out but all went in vain and now i am pretty sure that its a hardware issue not software. i have updated the windows chrged it whole night while the pc was off cleaned
 the plugs and pin connectors unistalling the drivers the two button restart and etc but nothing worked for me .Now as this my device was purchased in Us and i bought it on amzaon i am living in pakistan so its now literrally impossible for me to reach to the
 microsoft retail store in Us and if i somehow reach there the replacemnet cost is 600 dollars so this whole thing will cost me more the 750 dollars waste of my money i wish that the surfacebook was designed in a way that a third party repairing companies could
 also solve its issues.</p>

<p>Is anyone or has anyone played this game? I saw it on the Games on Demand section and thought it might be fun to play. The graphics look nice and it looks like a management/strategy style game or RTS. Is it hard to play or learn? Any glitches or game breaking
 issues? I would appreciate any input on Tropico 3 you might have. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>It's a very fun game and a different experience than you typically find on the 360, however at this point you might as well hang on and grab Tropico 4 coming out in...August I think. It's pretty soon. There's a demo on the marketplace, download it and try
 it out.</p>

<h2>            Upload Studio lagging&#47;straining clips</h2>
                    
<p>Hi for the past 3-4 months now whenever I record clips, they are fine as individual clips but when merged in the upload studio they lag and get strained on play back, I have spoken to support online via the chat but they couldn't resolve my issue.</p>
<p>What I have tried:</p>
<p>1)clearing my cache<br />
2)reseting internet<br />
3)clearing mac<br />
4)re-installing upload studio<br />
5)making new clips after the re-install<br />
6)my upload/download speeds are fine.</p>
<p>If anyone has any solutions that would be great!. It just sucks not being able to put clips together etc</p>

<h2>            File Explorer Search is slow when searching the entire OneDrive</h2>
                    When I run a File Explorer search on my entire OneDrive file it finds files very slowly (several minutes at least, with a 'Working on it...' message displayed), when previously it was almost instantaneous. However, Search functions correctly (instantaneously)
 when I run them within individual files within the OneDrive file. However, I need to run searches with all files within my OneDrive 'drive'.

<h2>            Gold membership not working</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to sign onto xbox live today but it came up with a message saying that my accounts been suspended and i have to update my payment options. This is due to the card iv been paying a annual auto renewal gold membership is due to expire shortly, so i
 put on a new card (everything on the card is correct and verified) thinking that i just needed an up to date way of payment for auto renewal which (i believe, but am not 100% sure about) was last done 2 months ago, meaning that i shouldn't be billed on the
 new card as i have already paid for this years membership, which i done on the console itself. I thought that would be alright and it said that i have gold membership but i went to check my friends list and it had been wiped, and the option for xbox parties
 said i couldn't go in one, and when i checked if i could play online it said i didn't have the right membership! Even if i was wrong about me already having paid for my membership, then surely my new card should have worked, because everytime iv renewed my
 membership before it was instant payment to play, no delay. Iv logged onto my account on the website and i can see my friends list and messages and stuff, and it still says i have gold membership but on my xbox i can't play games or see my friends list even
 though that also says im signed in on my gold account! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It completely unfair that microsoft can charge me twice for a years subscription within the space of two months, and yet still not let me have access to xbox live!</p>
<p>I'd really appreciate any help with this problem! if not then im just gonna have to cancel my membership, sell my xbox and get myself a ps3 (i joke). But seriously am considering cancelling my membership if i continue to be messed around.</p>
<p>Many thanks, Charlie</p>

<p>Suggest you contact a Billing Agent. You can choose Option <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">

<p>finding your country's support line: See <a href="http://tinyurl.com/XBLnumbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>but a faster way to speak to a Billing Agent is to go to <a href="http://xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>sign in there if you can - then go to</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 VPN Window Disappears</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.&nbsp; I've had network issues with the WiFi on my laptop which seems to be intermittent.&nbsp; However, I had 2 VPN connections from my Windows 8.1 install.&nbsp; When I click on the WiFi icon in the Notification Area, the
 2 VPN connections are displayed in the top panel of the popup window.&nbsp; When I click one, it appears to show a window on the screen but it disappears in a split second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've deleted both VPN connections.&nbsp; I have gone into Control Panel-&gt;Network and Sharing Center to Setup a New Connection.&nbsp; The wizard takes me through the steps to configure a new VPN connection where I select Use my Internet Connection, enter the IP Address
 of the remote VPN host and a description.&nbsp; When I click on Create, the VPN connection shows in the&nbsp;Network Connections (Adapters) as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My VPN</p>
<p>Disconnected</p>
<p>WAN Miniport (IKEv2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I right click on the entry and select Connect/Disconnect, I get the same window flashing up and disappearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would appear I get an Event Log entry each time I attempt to click on the VPN entry in the WiFi connections.&nbsp; This is:</p>

<p>TURN WINDOWS FEATURES ON OR OFF </p>
<p>Click on LEGACY&nbsp; COMPONENTS</p>
<p>Check that DIRECTPLAYER is ticked.</p>
<p>I found that these boxes were unticked so I ticked them and now my PSE Organizer can be&nbsp; accessed</p>

<p>Have you recently installed an HP Printer? - did you have a problem with the install?</p>
<p>Try rinstalling the software, or at least inserting the disk.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 and USB MIDI conflict with Microsoft GS Wavetable synth - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulkuklinski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and USB MIDI conflict with Microsoft GS Wavetable synth</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a MIDI sequencer (Forte3) on my laptop running windows 10. and am having trouble connecting it to my MIDI keyboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forte is a legacy (x86) software tool</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have connected my midi keyboard to the laptop using a USB to MIDI cable</p>
<p>The midi cable is recognized in Device Manager under Sound,Video and Game controllers as&nbsp;</p>
<p>USB 2.0 MIDI</p>
<p>
</p><p>General info</p>
<p><span>Sound, Video and Game controller</span></p>
<p>(Generic USB Audio)</p>
<p>Device status&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Device is working properly</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Forte&nbsp; I've selected USB 2.0 MIDI as my MIDI input/output device and when I test it (using the FORTE test function) it plays properly through my MIDI keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I start the sequencer playing a midi sequence, it plays through the Microsoft GS wavetable Synth and not the USB MIDI 2.0 device that was selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In earlier versions of windows this problem was fixed by selecting the USB device as the Default windows MIDI playback device.</p>
<p>I can't find anything that corresponds to this in windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can provide.</p>

<p>OK&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done some research and have found that to fix my problem I will need to change my Default Midi Device using Regedit and was wondering if anyone knows how to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default device is Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want it to be my USB MIDI device</p>
<p>
</p><p>As windows after XP no longer has a user controllable midimapper it will have to be done manually</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found the following tutorial on youtube for changing the default to another software based synthesizer but nothing to change it to a USB connected Synth.</p>

    <title>Keyboard language toolbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eric winkler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard language toolbar</h2>
                    I agree with the query:&nbsp; there is an easy route to removing the language bar (i.e. the way to control the keyboard language) in Windows 7, but not to restore it.<br />
Windows 7 Help says that one is to do it via Toolbar selection after right-clicking the taskbar.<br />
Unfortunately, that is wrong:&nbsp; there are only 3 toobars on offer in that pane:&nbsp; Address, Links and Desktop.<br />
Please restore.<br />
And BTW:&nbsp; might I suggest that the Support Engineer remove the response from "rockmoibebe", as it does not solve the problem.

<p><span><span><span>Hi Eric,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To add Language Bar to the Task Bar you would first need to add different languages for the keyboard and then only you will be
 able to see the Language bar on the Task Bar. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To add input language</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click on Start</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Go to Control Panel</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Select Clock Language and Region</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Under Region and Language select Change keyboards or other input methods</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>On the Keyboard and language tab click on Change Keyboards..</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Select the language you would like to add as the other language and apply the settings.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Now you will be able to see the language bar on task bar. Also, now you will be able all or remove the same by right clicking
 on the task bar and going to toolbars.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>For more information on add input language follow the link given below.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t play videos with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since about 2 days ago, each time I'm trying to play a video file&nbsp;I'm receiving the following error messages:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can't play.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To continue using this app, install the latest version.</strong></p>
<p><strong>0xc1010003 (0x80040154)</strong><strong>OR</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Choose something else to play. This item is in a format we don't support.</strong></p>
<p><strong>0xc00d36b4 (0xc00d36b4)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very strange since I was able to play all kind of videos after Windows 10 installation. My drivers are updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to open the video with Windows Media Player I'm&nbsp;receiving the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<strong>Windows Media Player encountered a problem while playing the file.</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your assistance is very much appreciated.</p>

            I have went through all this as well. Videos were working last week, and now nothing at all will play. It isn't seeming to matter what format it is in. I can open them on classic media player, but I get no sound at all. When I try to open it with windows
 media I get the exact same error as above. This is happening on not just my desktop, but my laptop that is also upgraded to windows 10.

            An earlier reply (EvaBAC) suggested uninstalling a certain Adobe module.&nbsp; Altho I didn't have that particular module I uninstalled Adobe CS 5.5 and it solved the problem.&nbsp; Thx again to EvaBAC...
