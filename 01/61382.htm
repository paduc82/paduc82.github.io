            <p>Which version of Windows 7 are you running?<br />
Starter, Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate?<br />
<br />
Did you edit the video or just burn it directly <br />
to the DVD?<br />
<br />
How did you burn the DVD...did you use <br />
Windows DVD Maker?<br />
<br />
Insert the DVD in your DVD drive and go to...<br />
Start / Computer. Right click the drive letter <br />
for the drive the DVD is in and choose...Open <br />
or Explore. <br />
<br />
This should reveal the directory of the DVD...<br />

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />
<br />Run the activation troubleshooter on the new device using the below steps:
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. and select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />
<br />(Please note that Activation troubleshooter requires you to have digital license linked to Microsoft Account.)
<br />
<br />If the troubleshooter hasn't helped, you can get in touch of an agent using the link below who can help you to get your copy activated:

            Hi Arthur
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new Motherboard or PC, if it is OEM it will not . .. 
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence a Retail licence?

            Thanks, Abdul, I appreciate your time, but two things:<br />
<ol>
<li>It's not really a client side issue, since some clients can see the contents from the local member server and can see the contents if I switch to another member server (on a different site). Also some clients are XP not just Windows 7.</li><li>What made you think I'm NOT in the IT department?!<br />

<p>&nbsp;Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you can't sign in to a game on Windows 10, this may be due to an issue with your Xbox profile or your in-game account. For us to determine the root cause, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried signing in to other games to check if the same issue occurs?</li><li>Are you able to access your Xbox account?</li><li>Are you signed in to the Xbox app?</li><li>Are you using the same email address to sign to the Xbox app and the game?</li><li>Have you made any changes to your device before encountering this issue? </li></ul>
<p>If you're not signed in to the Xbox app, we recommend that you sign in first. Make sure you're using the same Microsoft account with the app and the game. See
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-windows/getting-started/signin-xbox-app-on-windows-10#Scene1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to sign in to the Xbox app on Windows 10</a> for more information. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response regarding the status of this issue.</p>

<p>I have been having the same problem for the past couple of weeks (it was fine before that).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answers to your questions, in my case:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Yes, I can access Solitaire card games, and it signs me in without difficulty.</p>
<p>* Yes, I can access my Xbox account, where it shows my user name as usual.</p>
<p>* Yes, I am signed in to my Xbox account.</p>
<p>* Yes, I am using the same email address to sign into the Xbox account and the game.</p>
<p>* No, I have made no changes to the device before encountering this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate it if you could help.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Technically, some games such as Jigsaw or Sudoku will not sign in, although I can still sign in Xbox in Solitaire or Word Games. Moreover, I don't have ideas about what I should change to my device before encountering the issue. So can you please tell me
 what changes I have to make?</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to your answer.</p>

            We also suggest resetting Microsoft Jigsaw from the Settings menu to resolve any corrupted game data.<br />
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start </strong>and click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Apps &amp; features</strong>.</li><li>Find Microsoft Jigsaw and click <strong>Advanced options</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Reset</strong>.</li><li>Restart your device so that the changes can take effect. Sign in to the game and check if it works.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Another solution we recommend is to uninstall and reinstall the game. This will replace corrupted game files. Refer to
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/how-to-uninstall-reinstall-game-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I have been having exactly the same problem and have tried all the given solutions, none of which help! I see there was an update to my Jigsaw game a couple of days ago and all the problems seem to stem from that. If none of these solutions help, what
 on earth do I do?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>OK! I've now realised I hadn't tried uninstalling it. Doing this was made more difficult because MS Jigsaw doesn't not appear in the programme list for 'uninstall' from the control panel. But by right-clicking on the name in the pop-up programme list from
 the start button I was able to uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I reinstalled it from the Windows apps store it installed ok, but without any of the jigsaws I had previously downloaded. So had to download them again, although this went smoothly and I wasn't asked to 'pay' for them a second time. As far as I can
 see, now they are downloaded, and all of the information from the times I have played them before is there apart from the very last jigsaw I completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this does appear to have solved the problem.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Homegroup problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> malcolmswire  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Homegroup problem</h2>
                    <p>I'm running a laptop and a desktop on an ethernet cabled LAN.&nbsp; Both were upgraded to 10 from Windows 7.&nbsp;
<br />
First of all I couldn't get a Homegroup password from the [master] desktop to use on the laptop.&nbsp; So I turned off both m/cs and then started the laptop.&nbsp; It created a Homegroup on the laptop and let me change the password but when I started the desktop there
 is no Homegroup on the desktop. <br />
I went through the routine to delete idstore.sst and in Services to ensure Peer Network Grouping &amp; Identity Manager and HomeGroup Listener &amp; Provider were enabled but without effect.
<br />
I've been through several Troubleshooter routines [Networking and file sharing and looked at lots of forums [Microsoft included] and tried what is suggested with no success.&nbsp; I've tried to remove the Homegroup form the laptop, in an attempt to start again but
 it will not remove it only disable.&nbsp; <br />
No matter what I do there is no Homegroup on the desktop.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>So essentially what you are saying, is that if you have two computers that have been upgraded to Windows10, if one has the professional version, and one the home version, they cannot join together in a Homegroup?&nbsp; This is the situation I find myself in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the recent upgrade, which assured me that nothing had been changed, I can no longer access shared printers, or join my computers in a homegroup. Truly poor form Microsoft.</p>

            <p>But Homegroup was available in Windows 7 Home Premium Edition and worked on borg my computers so why is it not now available in Windows 10 Home?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When making the upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10&nbsp; Mictrosoft led us to believe that the features of would be the same or better.&nbsp; That is not now true?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot now revert to Windows 7 without re-installing Windows 7 because I am outside the time allowed.

</p><p>Both my computers are on a LAN and are Windows 10 upgraded from Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; One of them has a Homegroup but the other does not and on it I get the message 'this computer can't connect to a Homegroup' and the Troubleshooter has no effect.&nbsp; Why
 is that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I connot get get Metworking to work either because it will not recognise my password in Network Credentials login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not very good from Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Not sure my problem was the same as yours, but after upgrading my laptop and desktop to Win 10 the Homegroup connection failed.&nbsp; It would run and run and eventually ask for the password, then never connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was unable to create a new password on either of my computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solution was:</p>
<p>1. turn off secondary machine.</p>
<p>2. on primary computer, go to \Network and Internet\Network and Sharing Center\Advanced sharing settings</p>
<p>and under select Homegroup section, deselect "Allow Windows to manage homegroup connections" and select "Use user accounts and passwords to connect to other computers"</p>
<p>
</p><p>For whatever reason -- and only w/ the other computer off -- this allowed me to create a new homegroup. Turned on the laptop and said "Join Homegroup" and it set up automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>I'm running Windows 10 home upgraded from Windows 7 Home Premuim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gather that Homegroup is only available on Windows 10 Professional.&nbsp; When I uograded to Windows 10 I understood that the features in my Windows 7 version would transfer to Windows 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:</p>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that not the case and is Homegroup not available in Windows 10 Home?<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Homegroup is not available in Windows 10 Home, why does Homegroup appear in the Control Panel of Windows 10 and you can still apparently use the Troubleshooter [even though it has no effect.]?</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My wife's laptop is running Windows 10 Home., also upgraded from Windows 7 Home Premium and Homegroup has apparently set up correctly on that m/c - I say apparently because we only have two PCs and since it doesn't work on the other one [mine], I can't
 test it.&nbsp; Why is that?</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot get Networking to work on my PC because it will not accept the Windows Credential password that I set up in Windows 7.&nbsp; How can I reset and/or change the password on both PCs.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for keeping us updated on this query.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We apologize for the wrong information provided earlier in this post and also for neglecting your questions asked in this post. HomeGroup is available in Windows 10 Home edition.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before going through the below steps, make sure your system is connected to a network either wired or wireless and to home or office network. Shut down all the systems connected to the network and switch on that particular PC in which you wish to change
 the password on. After resetting the password, enter the same in the connected HomeGroup PC‚Äôs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To change the HomeGroup password, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows logo</strong> key on the keyboard and type
<strong>Change HomeGroup password</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select the top most search result from the window and follow the on-screen instructions to check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Please do not forget to write down or save the changed password on a piece of paper or in a device, so that next time when you are adding a PC to HomeGroup you need to enter the changed password on the devices joining the network.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the link below on <strong>HomeGroup from start to finish </strong>
(Applies to Windows 10 also):</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/homegroup-help#homegroup-start-to-finish=windows-81&amp;v1h=win81tab3&amp;v2h=win7tab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/homegroup-help#homegroup-start-to-finish=windows-81&amp;v1h=win81tab3&amp;v2h=win7tab1</span></a></span></strong></p>

            <p>Thank you for confirming the HomeGroup should be available in Windows 10 Home edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I have with passwords is not in Homegoup, it's the netwrork Credential password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the real problem is that I cannot get Windows 10 to even recognise the existence of HomeGroup on my own desktop PC, whereas it does recognise the existence of Homegroup on my wife's laptop wihich is on the same ethernet LAN.</p>
<p>The only relevant things shown on my Windows Expplorer homepage are:</p>
<p>"Network</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MALCOLM-PC</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAUREEN-PC"</p>
<p>But there is no Homegroup shown [as there is in my wife's laptop's Windows Explorer homepage] and I cannot accesss MAUREEN-PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Homegroup is present in Control Panel but accessing that feature gives 'Change homegroup settings', 'This computer can't connect to a homegroup' and 'HomeGroup is not ready yet,&nbsp; Please try again in a few minutes.&nbsp; If this message continues to appear, click
 the link to start the HomeGroup troubleshooter.'&nbsp; </p>
<p>Using the troubleshooter has no effect.</p>
<p>I have tried both the links you gave but to no effect.&nbsp; your&nbsp; attach </p>

            The gold lock at the bottom left? That just means you're not sharing the folder with anyone. It doesn't affect your use of the folder.

<h2>            FAT32, exFAT, NTFS, which one is the best for recovering deleted data&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a usb 3.0 (Kingston 100G3 16Gb) to store my important data. I read the article in this site:&nbsp;http://www.ntfs.com/ntfs_vs_fat.htm</p>
<p>and they say recoverablitity of exFAT is "Yes<span>&nbsp;if TFAT activated". I dont know what TFAT is and how to activate it, and which kind
 of file system I should use (FAT,exFAT,NTFS) for the highest ability of recovering data if they are deleted?</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are willing to recover deleted data and want to know some information about TFAT.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A transaction-safe FAT (TFAT) file system is a file system designed specifically to provide transaction-safety for data stored on a disk. TFAT requires a hardware-specific driver designed for the type of media on which the TFAT volume will exist. Assuming
 that a transaction-safe hardware-specific block driver exists, and that the driver provides the standard FAT file system interfaces, TFAT can operate on removable media such as Compact Flash cards and secure digital cards, as well as non-removable media such
 as hard drives and NAND Flash. </p>
<p>
</p><p>By design, the FAT file system is not a transaction-safe file system. FATFS can be corrupted if a write operation is interrupted in the middle of a transaction. Interruptions occur due to power loss or the removal of the media. The FAT volume is corrupted
 when the content of the FAT table does not match the directory or data sections of the volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to refer the article mentioned below and see if it helps you to recover deleted or lost data on your computer.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have backup created then it would better to get in touch with local technician or manufacturer of your computer. There might be some software available for this task. So, you may search any third party software by using your favorite search
 engine and see if you find any. If you could not then try to get in touch with local technician or manufacturer of your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><span><em>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from

<h2>            Could someone give me the run down on DLC..</h2>
                    
<p>Just bought the game and I was wondering about all the DLC im seeing. Would anything be of good use to a n00b like my self?</p>

<p>I suggest playing the game BEFORE you buy any dlc. &nbsp;You absolutely don't need any of the weapon packs to beat the game easily. &nbsp;If you are going to buy a weapon pack I suggest the Martial pack strictly for the Force gun. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dlc "Severed" is focused around a different character. &nbsp;His actions take place around the same time as Isaac's. &nbsp;I suggest playing this AFTER you play through the main game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I see you haven't played the first game. &nbsp;I assume you bought the second game since you posted this on the DS2 forums. &nbsp;Hold off on playing the second one until you play the first one, which is $20 brand new (even cheaper used obviously). &nbsp;If you have
 any interest in the story play the first game first. &nbsp;No matter what anyone says YOU WILL be missing out on important details right from the beginning if you start with the second game. &nbsp;If you only care about blowing *** up then it doesn't matter, and shame
 on you.</p>

<p>Lol. Well thanks for that. I have read the Force gun is good stuff but 400 MSP is a little steep for just a gun if its the only useful thing in the DLC.</p>
<p>I have played the first one at a buddies house here and there but never all the way through. As well as watched the anime film.

<p>the dlc CONTAINS A FEW GUNS AND SUITS which are useful if you find yourself getting stuck, the force gun is in the martial law pack which also contains a suit that gives you +damage to the force gun, which is very useful when attempting a harcore runthrough
 as having a fully upgraded force gun is like havin a cheat code. although i bought the supernova pack for my runthrough as it has a suit with +15% health per pack used, which i found more useful, although am still on my hardcore runthrough i have already completed
 game and am also halfway through zealot runthrough on new game+. all in all the dlc packs contain about 6-8 guns with 2-3 suits that cn be very useful :) hope this helps</p>

<p>The Martial Law pack is very useful, you wouldn't regret the purchase but it's not really needed if you feel like you caught on quick enough. And also, you should do your Hardcore run first and then celebrate that achievement by running through Zealot with
 your special gift you receive.</p>

            Hello AwesomeX04The,
<br />
<br />I had this very same issue occur to me with my gaming laptop not too long ago. I would plug in my charger, but Windows would not say that it was "plugged in". Turns out that the charger had gone bad and needed to be replaced.
<br />
<br />I would recommend reaching out to your computer's manufacturer for support and see if they can provide you with a replacement charger.

            From Windows 10 side, you can try following and check after each step -
<br />

<br />Do it for Microsoft AC Adpater
<br />
<br />2. Troubleshoot Power
<br />Type troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &gt; Click Power &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow on-screen direction.
<br />
<br />3. Restore Default for Power Settings
<br />Right click on battery icon in system tray &gt; Power options &gt; Click Change Plan Settings &gt; Click Restore default settings for this plan
<br />
<br />4. Disable Fast Startup

            That means the charger is not operating, simple.<br />Try using a spare one if exists or confirm by using the charger on a different laptop.

===========================================================<br />
</p>
<p>Does the system have RAID? If so that is also&nbsp;very suspect.<br />
<br />
This error is usually a driver&nbsp;issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though it<br />
could be others.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software issues<br />
can also cause the error. When you get to the driver section of the troubleshooter use my generic<br />
methods in the next message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed. <br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel - Windows<br />
Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-<br />
spyware/security programs.<br />
<br />
When you get to the driver and memory sections of the troubleshooter refer to the next message to<br />
update drivers and test memory and then refer back to the troubleshooter if needed.<br />

<p>The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To<br />
interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the <em>Ntstatus.h </em>file that is located in the<em>inc</em> directory of<br />
the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enough disk space. </li><li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the
</li><li>manufacturer for driver updates. </li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p><em>If you plan to debug this problem</em>, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2<br />
(the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system<br />
was started with the <strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly,<br />
make sure that a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the <strong>
/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame supplies additional information.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware that is installed is listed in the
</li><li>Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List. </li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be
</li><li>responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts,
</li><li>and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error. </li></ul>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable<br />
or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup<br />
sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe<br />
Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process<br />
in Safe Mode, you must start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote<br />
control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the computer<br />
by using the Recovery Console and then deleting the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the<br />
device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.</p>
<p>You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS might to try to resolve the error. You should also<br />
run hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies.<br />
For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or<br />
after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system<br />
BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows installation that are associated with lack of disk<br />
space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary<br />
files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and<em>.chk</em>files that<br />
contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more<br />
free space for the installation. You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version.<br />

<p>It scares me that the game is slated for release in a lil over a month and there is virtually NO information about this game. I didn't even know it was being released. &nbsp;You go to Double Helix Games website (developer) and there isn't anything about it...
 their last blog post was from July 2011!! &nbsp;Zero screen shots.... can't even get confirmation if the other 37 European nations who didn't qualify will be included in the game.</p>

    <title>2Spooky 3-Month Xbox Game Pass &#36;9.99 Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> big tyler 08  say:</h3>
<h2>            2Spooky 3-Month Xbox Game Pass &#36;9.99 Error</h2>
                    <p>Hello Xbox Forums:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Xbox Game Pass, there is a special where you can buy 3 months of Game Pass for $9.99.&nbsp; However, when I go to click subscribe, it says the payment cannot be processed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my billing and payment stuff is current an up to date. I have $25 account balance with credit card as backup payment. I have more then the required $9.99 but no matter what I do, it says "Trouble processing payment".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 14-day trail currently active but I doubt that would be causing the issue?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or since the deal was released this morning, it is just a waiting game as the system/servers get themselves situated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards, Tyler </p>

    <title>Windows Vista Support Ends April 2017 - What are Your Options&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andre da costa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Vista Support Ends April 2017 - What are Your Options&#63;</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Intermediate
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />After 10 years, Microsoft is ending support for the Windows Vista operating system in April 2017. Windows Vista came to market in
<a href="http://www.groovypost.com/news/windows-vista-turns-10-years-old-history-rewind-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
January of 2007</a> with a focus on security, making the PC easier to use and manage and providing a great user experience. In this article, we discuss some of the options users have going forward and what you should do before and after April 2017; if you decide
 to continue using Windows Vista. The decision to stick with Windows Vista can happen for a variety of reasons: application and hardware compatibility, nostalgia, inability to run later releases of Windows on existing hardware or it just works.
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><p>Even though <a href="http://www.groovypost.com/news/windows-vista-turns-10-years-old-history-rewind-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Vista </a>support ends in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
April of 2017</a>, the operating system will continue to function, but will cease to receive important security updates.
</p>
<p>Users have the option of running Windows Vista after April 2017 or they can upgrade to a modern version of Windows such as Windows 7 or
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">
migrate to Windows 10</a>. You will have to perform a custom install if you are migrating to Windows 8.1 or later versions. This means,
<a href="http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
files must be backed up</a> and applications will need to be reinstalled along with new hardware drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some cases, your PC, depending on the age might not be capable of running Windows 10 or even Windows 8.1.
</p>
<p>If you want to risk using Vista after April 2017 until you can either purchase a modern version of Windows or a new PC preinstalled with Windows 10, then you will need to do everything to protect yourself which includes:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Switching to a different web browser such as <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1303827" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mozilla Firefox 52</a> which will continue to support Vista; Google Chrome no longer supports Vista. I would also recommend you install a good third party Antivirus utility such as
<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/premium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Malwarebytes</a> and a decent Firewall such as Zone Alarm. </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Also, switch to using a Standard User Account for daily usage and make sure User Account Control is set to high.
</li><li>Limit your Internet usage on the device until you can migrate to new release of Windows or PC.</li><li>Limit connecting writable external storage devices such as hard disks and thumb drives, as this can be a potent vector for infection.</li><li>You can perform some advanced tasks such as <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee198684.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
disabling script host in Windows Vista</a>. </li><li>Perform regular <a href="http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
backups of your files</a> just to be safe.</li><li>If you can avoid activities such as on-line banking and sensitive communications, do so.</li><li>Uninstall any applications or outdated utilities you are no longer using example:
<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/news/apple-quicktime-windows-security-risk-uninstall-now-homeland-security-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Apple QuickTime</a> or Adobe Reader (switch to Foxxit Reader).</li><li>If you have extensions such as Adobe Flash Player installed, make sure it is disabled or removed.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Purchase Windows 7:</strong></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Because Windows 7 is in limited stock after Microsoft ended sales in October 2013, this has created demand due to its scarcity. This means retail boxed copies demand a premium, while OEM System Builder copies remain relatively
 affordable.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Full version (Retail):</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>- Doesn't </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>- Expensive</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Upgrade version (Retail):</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>OEM System Builder version:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>There is nothing particular wrong with using it too, especially since all future releases of Windows will be full versions anyway.
</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>You can find OEM System Builder software from dozens of online merchants. The current price for OEM Windows 7 Professional at

</p><p><strong>Migrate to Windows 8.1 or Windows 10</strong></p>
<p>My personal view, if I had to choose between Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, I would go with Windows 10 if your hardware can support it. Windows 10 features a more familiar experience for Windows Vista users, such as the Desktop, Taskbar, Start menu&nbsp; and floating
 application windows. Before you can consider either operating system, you need to ensure your operating system can actually run either operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To install Windows 8 or Windows 10 on your PC, the processor (CPU) must support the following features: Physical Address Extension (PAE), NX, and SSE2. Most CPUs have support for these features, so if you receive this error, it is likely because the NX feature
 is not enabled on your system. You can use a free utility such as <a href="http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
CPU-Z</a> to determine if your processor supports this extensions:</p>

<strong>32 or 64 bit</strong>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span><span>64 bit Windows comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more RAM. 32 bit Windows can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit
 Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting
 your system performance. Windows 7 or 10 64 bit is more secure too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7 or 10.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span><span>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in 64 bit versions of Windows 7
 or 10, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, no 16 bit installer or uninstallers. Also, if you decide to move to 64 bit Windows in the future, there is no upgrade path from 32 bit Windows, clean install only.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">I personally recommend Windows 10 or Windows 8.1 32 bit for hardware 5 years or older. If your computer originally came with Vista, the 32 bit version is highly recommended and actually might add a performance boost. Studies have
 shown, 32 bit versions of Windows experience a 9% performance increase on 64 bit capable hardware.

            <p>Actually Vista updates are not stopped, I suggest you look at Vista updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after the total finishing of Vista support, MS states some spiel about XP on the page it diverts to. It then says about updating to 10. Go there and it will tell you how to do it from 7, so MS are totally giving up on Vista, (the most stable platform
 we have had) and probably going to say it was not theirs!!!!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Andre de costa, sir there is a comment I would like to make BUT not on here. Lookit not everybody whipped out and bought Vista the day it was made. Some did not install for a long time after the first versions came about. Secondly, whilst you may think there
 are reasons to throw away a machine that works perfectly well and I am asuming you have the financial resources, many have not nor need to do so!</p>
<p>&nbsp; It is VERY condescending to take THAT attitude. There is no easy way to migrate to 10 for example, there are still many Bsods and only techies can solve them often. For example someone using the machine as a purely on internet device and word processor
 and say skype the machine works well and reliably. Why change. The attitude taken is similar to that of cars but the difference being that by law car manufacturers have to supply bits from the last day of production. How about doing THAT.</p>
<p>&nbsp; If upgrading were easy then your comment would be possibly valid, but it is not, also stuff does not run on 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I could go on but realise that not everybody is using a 2017 car, has a 4 bedroom house, and getting a salary of say $60,000.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>For information 7 had so many problems it was taken off sale in some areas and did not go on sale eg France until mid 2010. Even then in many areas Vista was on sale for another year due to problems with 7 as someone who has built and installed quite a few
 machines found that new machines with manufacturers warranty and boards made after jan 2011 were sold with Vista so that brings it down to about 5 years. Or are you suggesting that the suppliers never got the Vista from MS. Mine was from 2008.</p>

<p>comment on an additional&nbsp; obvious deficit regarding the inability to install security updates
<strong>LONG BEFORE</strong> the proposed termination of support re: Vista.&nbsp; I can almost guarantee you that
<strong>a great</strong><strong> deal of time and effort</strong> went into trying, in vain, to figure out the presumed problems behind the hundreds of "failed" update attempts.&nbsp; I certainly know that I am<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">included</span></em>
 in that wasted time .. and frankly I resent it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see that you're an accomplished man, Mr. Da Costa, so you are probably a reasonable one as well.&nbsp; If you would be so good as to advise your peers, on our behalf,&nbsp; that there are many of us out here "hanging" because we're trying to conduct business
 just like you are .. and will be greatly handicapped by your company's actions. Don't you think at least partial
<em>assistance </em>toward the purchase of one of those more up-to-date devices to which you refer might be a nice gesture for
<em>our </em>troubles ... now that Vista "<em>has had a good run</em>" as you put it ... for
<em>YOU </em>guys!?! </p>

            <p>Hopefully you are of course making it that those with Vista can just redo Vista if they have the disc and not make it that one cannot do a reinstall. To stop the reinstallation of the software in the event of a glitch will certainly put MS in the "F U I
 am a bxxxxxd". Having only run Vista for the aforesaid 7 years it pales into the verge of taking the michael when one considers that I run a series 2/3 land rover and can still get parts (1969 109 soft top.) and still do repairs. Sure it does not comply with
 current emission status, but are you aware of the ecological impact of scrapping it and buying something not as good, for a lot more money, that does not what i want to do. OK so charge for the update if you so desire, but better would be to make sure that
 updates work with all your previous fare. Lets be honest, some things like replacement lamps, tyre, fan belts and the like are still available for cars 80 years old, is it too much to ask that MS allow newer programs to keep on running as some programs developed
 for Vista, and I have 2 that I paid for will not run on later versions, yet in conjunction with MS were not even available for several years after Vista became available. It is bad business to upset those that have habitually used your products, a very good
 way to encourage a new competitor on the block and certainly encourage a migration to a newer competitor who may have learnt lessons!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just something that is passing my mind. Take empires, Greek, gone and now in a state of just Greece hanging on, Rome, Italy is in the Merde, so is France, and Germany lost hers. The UK is about to commit Hari Kari and is now about to fall on its sword to
 the extent that the Union jack be a thing of the past. Businesses are the same. MS will soon break up again with bits hanging in and on like skype. (I was one of the first to use skype using it some 12 years ago on dial up XP and with my name as the about
 600,000 user.) Other bits like OS will be phased out and all software self starting without an OS like one from a certain Tandy electrical store some 20+ years ago. In fact a computer professor who I showed it to felt that eventually it may be more reliable
 than the then 3.1, he used it a lot after I showed him it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, updates currently are coming through for vista, my machine is still getting them. If you are not as of Mar 4th 2017 then you have other problems.</p>
