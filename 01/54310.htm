<h2>            Why can&#39;t Microsoft use the Notification facility to tell us about major WU changes&#63; Win10</h2>
                    <p>I had major problems with the failure of the April Cumulative WUs - in a period of less than a day, I went from v1709 16299.40 to 16299.214, then to 16299.309, then to 16299.371 and finally to v1803 17134.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An MVP later told me that I was </p>
<p>"<span>updating during a transitional period when Microsoft is promoting Windows 10 1803 as the flagship version of Windows 10" and that</span></p>
<p>"<span>when I checked Windows Update, it initially scanned for Windows 10 1709 cumulative updates, but eventually found a feature update it would prefer you update to".
</span></p>
<p>Also that "<span>feature updates take precedence over cumulative updates".</span></p>
<p><span>And, finally, that "Microsoft's </span><span>philosophy these days is, you should be running the latest version regardless. Microsoft's view of keeping around old versions is considered unhygienic. Windows 10
 is delivered as a service and users must let go of particular versions when a new release is available".
</span></p>
<p>I understand Microsoft's goals and fully appreciate the dangers of many users not bothering to update in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it wasn't <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>me</strong></span> who checked for WUs at a bad time - it was Microsoft who delivered so many WUs in a very short time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, I understand that Windows 10 v1803 is a complex and complicated program. delivering so many features. I also understand that Microsoft has to deliver WUs when it suits them, not me. but why oh why can't Microsoft use the Notification facility to tell/warn
 us, its customers, that these changes are about to happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft was better at communicating with us, we'd have lower expectations and wouldn't complain so much. In most other areas of business where customers are involved, it's a very basic management tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, why doesn't Microsoft use the Notification&nbsp; facility/tool at such times?</p>
<p />

    <title>Windows Firewall Not Starting Due To BFE Service Error 1083 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> _entrepreneur  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Firewall Not Starting Due To BFE Service Error 1083</h2>
                    I noticed today that the firewall on my Windows 7 PC was not turned on. &nbsp;I tried to turn it on and got a message about the Base Filtering Engine not being started. &nbsp;I started the service and got an access denied error. &nbsp;I browsed the registry and noticed
 all the folders under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\BFE were not present. &nbsp;So, I exported the keys from a working system of same OS (Windows 7 64-Bit SP1) and imported them into the broken system. &nbsp;After setting permissions in the registry
 I still am not able to start the BFE or Windows Firewall Service.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The newest error message I get is error 1083, "the executable program that this service is configured to run in does not implement this service".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am racking my brain and can't come up with a solution. &nbsp;I have tried an SFC /SCANNOW and it comes back clean.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</div>

<p>As you have tried all the general troubleshooting steps provided by "<span><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcvgsharepoint%2f_layouts%2fimages%2fblank.gif" /></span><span>Hetti</span></span>

 hence the only troubleshooting left to resolve the issue is to perform Repair installation/In-place upgrade of Windows 7. Performing a repair installation/In-place upgrade&nbsp;will not damage files and applications that are currently installed on your computer.</p>

    <title>Windows Update Readiness Tool - Information Please - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aberfoyle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update Readiness Tool - Information Please</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 Home Premium</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to install Windows Update Readiness Tool&nbsp;in the past, I think the first time it was installing for so long I clicked cancel, after that I always received&nbsp; a does not apply to this system message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today it installed after a short initialization and a very long install period. It finally said Installation Complete</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the Microsoft sites say:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The System Update Readiness Tool can help fix problems that might prevent Windows updates and service packs from installing. For example, an update might not install if a damaged system file prevents the update from recognizing the version of Windows that's
 running on your computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This tool is being offered because an inconsistency was found in the Windows servicing store which may prevent the successful installation of future updates, service packs, and software. This tool checks your computer for such inconsistencies and tries to
 resolve issues if found</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question, what do I do with it now? </p>
<p>Does it run after install and find and fix update problems?</p>
<p>Does it report errors anywhere?</p>
<p>Do I just try and install whatever did not install in the past?</p>
<p>Also it said it installed but I do not see it in installed updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I installed it to try and fix an IE11 will not install problem, Windows Update 9C59.
</p>

            <p>Okay, thanks, I did not scroll down far enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please explain in layman's terms. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Open %SYSTEMROOT%\Logs\CBS\CheckSUR.log. %SYSTEMROOT% is the folder in which Windows is installed. For example, the %SYSTEMROOT% folder is C:\Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in all normal cases substitute C drive for systemroot because that is where the OS usually is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on a different computer right now, probably does not have the system readiness tool installed on it but I see C\windows\Logs\CBS and I can "open" that by sending it to documents. I assume a computer with system readiness tool installed will have C\windows\Logs\CBS\CheckSUR.log</p>
<p>
</p><p>The corrupt or missing file will be clearly indicated as the example?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Copy to C\CheckSUR\packages directory (I assume). By default, this directory doesn't exist and you need to create the directory.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I create that directory?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum. I understand that you are getting an error message that Live Mail stopped working.
It is most likely that this is due to Live Mail related files that became corrupted. As an initial troubleshooting step, please repair Live Mail. I provided the steps below:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Press
<font><b>Windows</b> + <b>R</b>, type <b>AppWiz.cpl</b>, click
<b>OK</b>.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Select
<font><b>Windows Essentials 2012/Windows Live Essentials</b>, click Uninstall<b>/Change</b>.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Click
<font><b>Repair all Windows Essentials Programs</b>.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks I tried to use the repair program several times to no avail.&nbsp; However, I found a third party software "Fix It"&nbsp; ( a 40 dollar solution, ouch)&nbsp;that finally for some reason got my system back.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I have&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem understanding&nbsp;is why the problem
 persisted after&nbsp;I did a deep removal of Essentials.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;unfortunately since I had removed Essentials and reloaded it in one of my attempts all my storage folders appear empty.&nbsp; I made the assumption the content files would have been preserved in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hi SUFCvoyager,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me help you with your issue that Windows Live Mail is not working on your computer. Since you have tried repairing Live Mail and it did not resolve your issue. Kindly try to uninstall&nbsp;Live Mail&nbsp;to make sure that there are no corrupted files from it.
 Also kindly make sure that before you uninstall the program you have back up your files. For the steps on how to do this follow the steps on the following links below:<br />

<h2>            Right Click Crash &#43; Chrome not opening</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in need in some help. Almost three times a week I get this issue, and it's driving me crazy. Sometimes, when I right click in the File Explorer, the whole thing crashes and restarts the explorer.exe. I've also noticed that when this happens. Google Chrome
 doesn't open. This is a big issue as whenever I try to do work, it happens. A temporary fix I've been using is just to restart my computer, but that didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've done so far...</p>
<p>- sfc /scannow (didn't work)</p>
<p>- Context Menu check using ShellExView (didn't work)</p>
<p>- Different browser (All other browsers work, but I need Chrome for the plugins)</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Details:</p>
<p>Windows 10 64bit</p>
<p>Intel i3 Core Processor </p>
<p>Intel HD Graphics 4000</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for a permanent fix or a long lasting fix if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            In this situation your system specs aren't needed, but thanks for posting them. d3dx9_26 is part of DirectX, and apparently it being missing is sometimes a fluke which can be solved by restarting the computer. If it still says missing, download the latest
 version of DirectX 9, and that should solve the problem.

            Hi  AlG9 
<br />
<br />Advrcntr2.dll is a component of Nero Burning ROM, the only way yo will get that file is to uninstall and then re-install Nero.
<br />
<br />You will find websites on the net that offer that file for download, avoid them at all costs, you should never download a dll file from the web, it is very dangerous . . .

<p>
</p><p>If you gave them access to your PC its likely they have put malware or logging software onto it, and maybe even locked it somehow. If you bank on your PC then contact your bank and let them know as its possible ( not certain but possible ) the scammers may
 have got hold of your bank details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you can get back in consider backing up your data and fully re-installing Windows and then restoring your data to the PC and then change ALL your passwords. At the very least update your AV program and run a full scan, then download, install, update

<p>Hi Bernadette,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, are you still able to access your Surface and trying to reset your Microsoft account password? If so, you can follow these steps to reset your password:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Reset your password page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Choose the reason you need your password reset, then click <strong>
Next</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter the Microsoft account email address you're trying to recover.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter the characters you see on the screen, then click <strong>
Next</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you have security info on your account, we'll send a one-time code to the alternate phone number or email address you gave us. After you enter the code on the next screen, you'll be able to make a new password.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you can no longer access your Surface and need to reset the password, you can refer to DR-GOLFMASTER's post on this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_rt-security/ms-surface-password-has-been-lostchanged-and-now/6a59146b-9bcf-4d9d-98da-23bb01f15718">
thread</a> on steps how to regain access on your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also contact our <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>-Nice catch! &nbsp;I updated my list with those&nbsp;7 games. Up to 88 total now. &nbsp;:)&nbsp; The list goes in order of release date at some point. So the most recent should be toward the bottom.</p>
<p>-Cant believe I forgot to add Syndicate and RDR.</p>
<p>-If they really added a co-op mode to Max Payne 3 that would be awesome. I will have to keep an eye on that. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyone have any details on what the Max Payne 3 Co-op will consist of?</p>
<p>I know that their content got all combined and the Co-op will be in October.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As for some more games that feature co-op....</p>
<p>WARHAMMER: SPACE MARINE (Free Co-op DLC)</p>
<p>COD:MW3 (Spec-ops/Survival)</p>
<p>MORTAL KOMBAT (Tag teaming)</p>
<p>CALL OF JUAREZ: THE CARTEL (3P co-op)</p>
<p>BINARY DOMAIN</p>
<p>INVERSION (2P story)</p>
<p>NEVERDEAD (separate modes)</p>
<p>TENCHU Z</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I'd like to see the list in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>But some other edits are needed...</p>
<p>You have RE:ORC &amp; BF3 as not released yet.</p>
<p>And you shouldn't have your own personal comments on if the game sucks, lmao.</p>
<p>If you must, then Neverdead, Inversion, &amp; COJ: Cartel are all pretty bad.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As for Upcoming:</p>
<p>BORDERLANDS 2</p>
<p>RESIDENT EVIL 6</p>
<p>ASSASSINS CREED 3</p>
<p>HALO 4</p>
<p>COD: BLACK OPS 2</p>

<p>Can you still play Chromehounds online? Because the servers were taken down a few years back weren't they? I don't know if that was just the Persistent online world server or if it affected all the Multiplayer.</p>
<p>Tekken 6 co-op is terrible, it's only a handful of alternative missions not the actual campaign</p>
<p>Tenchu Z co-op is fun, but it is also really stupid in that only the host gets achievements or saves his progress.</p>
<p>Kane and Lynch 2 has been out for almost 2 years now, not sure why you listed it as not out yet.</p>

                    <p>After installing the official 8.1 update 1 from Windows update, for example, when I close Windows Store - I am brought back to the desktop.</p>

            <p>I have found that if the "Show Windows Store apps on Taskbar" option is selected, when closing a Store (Metro app) it returns to desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I remove the option for store items in taskbar, then it goes back to start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft, should this be the case?&nbsp; it seems that this option is interfering with the separate option to return to desktop/start..</p>

    <title>Windows 10 and issues writing to Jmicron-based USB 3.0 &#40;dual&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kjw_pk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and issues writing to Jmicron-based USB 3.0 &#40;dual&#41; HDD enclosures</h2>
                    <p>I have a variety of systems running Windows 10 v1511.&nbsp; I have tried a couple JMicron - based USB 3.0 disk enclosures:</p>
<p>
</p><p>TeckNet UD037 Dual-bay USB 3.0 HDD dock</p>
<p>Thermaltake BlacX Duet 5G USB 3.0 HDD dock</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any time I try to write to a drive in one of these&nbsp;enclosures over USB 3.0, Explorer just sits there until a 0x80070079 Semaphore Timeout error pops up.&nbsp; Reading from the disk works fine.&nbsp; This happens with a Surface Book and a Gigabyte Z170x-UD3 motherboard-based
 PC.&nbsp; If I use a USB 2.0 cable instead, it works fine.&nbsp; Drivers and OS&nbsp;updates are all up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, I have a Dell Latitude E7450 with USB 3.0 which can&nbsp;write just fine to the disk / enclosure over USB 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced an issue like this with a USB 3.0 enclosure and found a workaround that doesn't involve reverting to USB 2.0?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to force Windows 10 to&nbsp;run these enclosures&nbsp;in USB 3.0 BOT mode?&nbsp; It seems as though the problems lie somewhere within the combo of&nbsp;the enclosure chipset and&nbsp;Windows 10 trying to transfer in UASP mode.</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We do understand your concern and we will be happy to help you regarding this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I request you to try the below methods:</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>I request you to place the computer in Clean boot and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows.
 You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the link to place your computer in Clean boot:</span></p>

</p><p><strong><span><span>Disclaimer: </span></span></strong><span><span>To start the computer in normal mode refer the section,
</span><strong><span>"How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"
</span></strong><span>from the link above.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span><span>Use the hardware troubleshooter to fix the issue</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</span></span></p>

            <p>Yes, I have seen these steps dozens of times and followed them.&nbsp; The Surface Book in particular is freshly re-imaged with just Windows and Surface updates applied.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same issues occur in clean boot.</p>
<p>The troubleshooter does not help.</p>
<p>There's no AV aside from Defender, and even turning that off does not help.</p>

            I'm having this same issue. &nbsp;If I plug the external drive into a USB 2.0 port the problem goes away. &nbsp;But it's 2016 and I'd love to use the 3.0 ports I paid for. &nbsp;Have you figured out a solution to this?

            <p>I had this problem too.&nbsp; It seemed to be a problem with it running as a USB Attached SCSI device and the Jmicron chipset.&nbsp; It now seems fixed.&nbsp; It's been a month or two since I've tried playing with my enclosure so I'm not exactly sure when this got fixed
 but today I was able to (complete the) transfer multiple 10GB files to a SSD drive in my inateck enclosure at 90+ MB/s.&nbsp; Previously it would start transferring and then give the semaphore timeout error within a few seconds when connected via USB3 to my Lenovo
 notebook.&nbsp; If I connected the enclosure to an older notebook running Windows 10 that supported USB3 but not USB Attached SCSI it would transfer fine.&nbsp; It would also work fine via USB2.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'm glad MS finally fixed this.&nbsp; It's been a real PITA for a while now.</p>

 but today I was able to (complete the) transfer multiple 10GB files to a SSD drive in my inateck enclosure at 90+ MB/s.&nbsp; Previously it would start transferring and then give the semaphore timeout error within a few seconds when connected via USB3 to my Lenovo
 notebook.&nbsp; If I connected the enclosure to an older notebook running Windows 10 that supported USB3 but not USB Attached SCSI it would transfer fine.&nbsp; It would also work fine via USB2.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'm glad MS finally fixed this.&nbsp; It's been a real PITA for a while now.</p>

<p>Looks like I spoke to soon.&nbsp; I'm having timeout errors again.&nbsp; :(</p>

<h2>            Where can i download the standard basic notepad.exe from &#63;</h2>
                    Somebody please help me ! <br />
<br />
Today, my notepad was infected with a virus (trojan), and my antivirus (avast!) deleted the notepad.exe from my computer. I tried to find it and download it again from internet, but i can't find it ! There are millions of different versions of notepad, but
 i can't find anywhere the most basic <br />
standard notepad that comes with every windows. All i want is the most basic version of notepad, and that's all ! I am using Windows 7. I tried downloading all kinds of versions but they were all different. They had all those plugins and toolbars and etc. etc.
 Please somebody help me find the <br />
most basic standard notepad. <br />
<br />
Thank you !<br />

<div>it is a link to the XP version of notepad.exe</div>

<div>I don't believe that notepad has really changed between versions.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just download this and stick it in "C:\windows\system32\"</div>

<h2>            Windows 7 64 bit blue screen of death </h2>
                    I've had this error a few times in the past weeks was hoping someone here would be able to look at the dumpfile to help me find out what is causing the conflict, &nbsp;I've tried clean booting like I read in some other post on here etc still didn't help me
 to really figure out what is causing my problem, as far as I can tell it's not tied to any specific event (that I'm aware of). &nbsp;I have a feeling it's something with the printer but have no real proof of it as it's not something i can force to happen (the blue
 screen) it just randomly happens every so often. Anyhow here's the error and the dumpfiles

            Hi Shrek.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt by typing CMD in Start Search, right click result to Run as Administrator, copy and paste or type the following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) Read over this Complete Guide to Managing Updates after Version 1803: <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-update-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-up...</a>
<br />
<br />6) If Updates still won't run go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to follow these methods:  
<br />
<br />Method 1.
<br />Run the Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />  
<br />1.Download the ﻿Windows Update Troubleshooter, and then select Open or Save in the pop-up window:
<br /><a href="https://aka.ms/wudiag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/wudiag</a>
<br />
<br />Notes
<br />	• If the pop-up doesn’t come up, you might have a pop-up blocker on. If you’re using Microsoft Edge, instructions for disabling the pop-up blocker are here. For Internet Explorer, instructions are here. If you are using a different browser or separate pop-up blocker, check the website of the browser or blocker’s manufacturer.
<br />	• If you select Save, you need to go to the folder where the troubleshooter is downloaded to after the download is complete, and then double-click the latest wu.diagcab file to run the troubleshooter.
<br />	
<br />2.Select Next and follow the steps in the wizard to find and fix problems with Windows Update .
<br /> 
<br />Method 2.
<br />
<br />Download the most recent Servicing Stack Update (SSU)
<br />
<br />Determine whether you are using 32-bit or 64-bit Windows:
<br />	1. From Start, choose Settings.
<br />	2. Select System.
<br />	3. Click About.
<br />	4. Scroll down to System type.
<br />Download the version of the latest SSU (KB4456655) that matches your version of Windows from the Microsoft Update Catalog. 
<br />Restart your device and check for updates.
<br />Did this resolve the issue?
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 3.
<br />
<br />Download the most recent KB
<br />
<br />	1. Go to the Update history page. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12387/windows-10-update-history?ocid=update_setting_client" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/12387/window...</a>
<br />	2. Find the most recent update KB for the version of Windows 10 you have – it’s usually at the top of the list – and either write the KB number down or copy it.
<br />	3. Go to the Microsoft Update site and search for the KB number. <a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Hom...</a>
<br />	4. Select the link for the download, and then choose Download. Select Save if you are prompted. 
<br />	5. When the download completes, select Open to start the update.
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 4.
<br />
<br />Fix Windows file corruption
<br />
<br />Important
<br />You need to run both the DISM and SFC commands shown below, not just one of them.
<br />	1. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, right click the Windows button, and then select Command Prompt (Admin). If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow or Yes.
<br />	2. Type the following command, and then press Enter.
<br />	DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />	Note It might take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<br />	3. Type the following command and press Enter.
<br />	sfc /scannow
<br />	Note It might take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<br />	4. Close the command prompt, and then run Windows Update again.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Method 5.
<br />Perform an in-place upgrade
<br />
<br />Download the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool (MCT) <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/win...</a> and use it to perform an “in-place upgrade” of Windows 10. We have a video that can show you how if you aren’t sure. <a href="https://aka.ms/W10CleanInstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/W10CleanInstall</a>

            My error code was different (can't locate it at the moment) but I'm guessing the "fix" would be the same? I'm going to run through the whole list so may be awhile. This problem has been going on for weeks but I haven't had a chance to address it before
 now.

<h2>            Surface laptop won&#39;t turn on</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I can't turn on my Surface Laptop. Nothing comes on the screen, but the keyboard lights up. A red right flashes when I turn in on, but the screen remains black. Can you please advise?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Petar</p>

<p>Hi Petar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try a couple of other things, besides checking for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Restart your display by pressing the <span>Windows logo key</span><span>+Ctrl+Shift+B</span>. You will hear a beep and your screen may turn back on.</p>
<p>2. If all else fails, you can hold the power button for 20 seconds until the logo appears. This will reboot your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mod Edit. On 11/2 a fix was published on Windows Update that addresses this issue on Windows 10 Creators Update (1703) devices. Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (1709) devices are not affected. To get the update, select
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; securit</strong><strong>y</strong> &gt;
<strong>Windows Update</strong> and then <strong>Check for updates</strong>.</p>
