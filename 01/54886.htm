<h3> gavinmcd  say:</h3>
<h2>            MIcrosoft account and two skype accounts</h2>
                    I had two different skype accounts the created a microsoft account.&nbsp; One of the skype accounts was of course associated with my MS account, but not the one I wish to be.&nbsp; Is it possible to change this? Perhaps if I delete the skype account currently associated
 with the microsoft account I could then link the one I wish to be associated?

<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, it is not possible to <em>merge/link</em> an existing Microsoft account to a Skype account. What possible is, to merge a Skype account to a new Microsoft account created within the process of merging.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In line with that, even if you delete the Skype account associated with your Microsoft account, it still cannot be&nbsp;possible to link the two accounts together.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Access 2007 source code is Microsoft copyright so you would need to contact Microsoft. I would imagine that MSDN would have access to source code; if this is the case you would need to be a subscriber, but I would certainly find out first before spending
 that sort of money on an MSDN subscription. While it may be possible to view the source code it isn't saying that Microsoft will actually allow you to use any of it.</p>

<p>Hi Ali. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.
<br />
<br />
You can do a Repair Install which reinstalls Windows over itself saving files, programs and most Settings. This repairs most problems but is not&nbsp; nearly as good as a Clean install.&nbsp;&nbsp; https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-repair-windows-10-using-in-place-upgrade<br />
<br />
Then next level would be a Reset which reinstalls Windows but only saves files if you want. This can be started from inside Windows or from Repair Mode:
</p>
<p>http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/reset-windows-10-pc</p>
<p>https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit cleaner is the Fresh Start which reinstalls Windows and saves files but will not reinstall the Factory Bloatware which can cause issues and throttle performance. Many manufacturers customize the Reset so it reinstalls all that crap. The Fresh Start
 is Windows 10 developer's nod to the great reputation of the Clean Install since most enthusiasts won't run anything except the Clean Install.&nbsp; https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-fresh-start-feature-in-windows-10-creators-update/<br />
<br />
Speaking of which there's the gold standard Clean Install like the one in this link which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is
 better than any amount of money could buy:&nbsp; http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
</a></p>
<p><br />
Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />
So there you have all options. I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            CutePDF Writer won&#39;t uninstall until Print Spooler starts</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: Catch-22: Print Spooler refuses to start, CutePDF Writer won't uninstall until Print Spooler starts<br />
Big print spooler dilemma here, folks.</p>
<p>I tried to print a document today and received an error that I needed to install my printers. When I try to install my printers in the Control Panel, it says that Windows can't open Add Printer because the local print spooler isn't running.</p>
<p>I've gone into the Services area of the Control Panel and tried to force the print spooler to start, only to receive Error 1068: The Dependency or Group Failed to Start.</p>
<p>I've checked all print spooler dependencies and each one is running fine.</p>
<p>The one thing that I've identified that I think may be causing problems is the program CutePDF, which allows you to create PDFs from webpages, etc. It does that by emulating a printer, and I think that might be one of the issues. I've tried to uninstall
 CutePDF, but it won't uninstall from the Uninstall or Change a Program window. Instead, it tells me the print spooler must be running before i can uninstall CutePDF.</p>
<p>But I can't run the print spooler until CutePDF is deleted.</p>
<p>Help!</p>

<p>Is there anything strange about this Registry Key and the Value data which on this working Windows 7 machine only has a Data Value of "RPCSS http" listed?&nbsp; I don't run CutePDF.</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\Spooler, the&nbsp; Value "DependOnService"</p>
<p>Purely using this as a bit of a rough guide only, look in your Registry for varies entries that have a value of "DependOnService" and see if you can pick up anything odd or strange for the Services that are having problems.</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for some reason, Windows&nbsp;Update keeps automatically installing the Synaptics trackpad driver on my old Dell XPS 15z that's running Windows&nbsp;10 Pro even though the laptop has a Cypress trackpad and the driver for it is already installed. The Synaptics driver
 breaks the multi-finger gestures and functionalities of the trackpad. I tried manually&nbsp;just uninstalling the driver but Windows Update just automatically reinstalls it at a later point. How do I override&nbsp;Windows Update for this?&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Original title : forgotten server 2008 express SA password - reset ? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of my applications (Rockwell FactoryTalk View Studio) uses SQL Server 2008 Express.<br />
<br />
When I start the app. I get error message...<br />
<br />
"FactoryTalk View cannot authenticate with the SDQL Server 2008 Express Instance 'FTVIEWx64TagDb' on machine 'xyz' using the 'FTVIEWUSER' account. Please run 'FTVIEWUSER Account Reset' utility on machine 'xyz'to reset the 'FTVIEWUSER' account.to its default.<br />
<br />
When I try to run this utility, I have to log-in to the User Account "SA", but I have forgotten the password.
<br />
<br />
How can I reset this password, so that I can get access to reset the 'FTVIEWUSER' account.</p>

            I, and it appears, several other people made the mistake of running Registry Mechanic from PC TOOLS and it is NOT compatible with 8.1 and it destroyed the ability to search in Explorer or Outlook or just about anywhere in Windows 8.1 that uses wsearch.exe.
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, I didn't have it set to make a Restore Point ( I do now -- too late ) so I cannot just restore back before it screwed up Windows 8.1.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can you tells us how to re-install the Search function in Windows 8.1?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Running sfc/scannow does NOTHING.</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shared folders may have encountered this due to network permissions. Since you've already tried some troubleshooting steps, we suggest that you try to change the shared folder permissions by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click a shared folder icon.</li><li>Choose <strong>Properties </strong>from the shortcut menu.</li><li>In the folder’s Properties dialog box, click the <strong>Sharing </strong><strong>tab</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Advanced Sharing</strong> button. The Advanced Sharing dialog box shows up.</li><li>Click the <strong>Permissions </strong>button. The shared folder’s Permissions dialog box appears.</li><li>
<p>Select a group or username.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Set the permissions for the selected group or user. Select
<strong>Full Control</strong>, this gives a user the same control over the folder as your account has. Choose
<strong>Allow</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong>OK </strong>to close the Permissions dialog box.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong>OK </strong>to close the Advanced Sharing dialog box.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong>OK </strong>to close the folder’s Properties dialog box.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly get back to us with the results.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Start from the beginning, get rid of the Bonjour.</p>
<p>Put the laptop near the Router and...</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wireless card entry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wireless card's Drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wireless Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility the utility is Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</p>
<p>If everything above is OK and it is not connecting to the Wireless router. Log from any computer that is, or can be connected to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, make sure that the Wireless broadcast is On, and try to connect with
 No Wireless security.</p>
<p><strong>When working turn On the Wireless security.</strong></p>
<p>Note* People sometimes make mistakes in writing and retyping the security passphrase.</p>
<p>Alternative way is to copy it from the Router's menu, and then paste when asked by the Wireless card.</p>

            What kind of router are you using and what is your connection? Also, what kind of videos? What is the strength of your wi-fi connection? Does it improve if you are closer to your wi-fi router?
<div><br />
<div>If it is a downloaded movie in HD, it may require a higher performance router. Some wi-fi isn't fast enough for HD content.&nbsp;</div>

            Thanks for response.&nbsp; Using Netgear router provided free by comcast,USB connection.&nbsp; Videos are mostly those that you find in everyday news.&nbsp; No better close to router.

<h2>            Problems with  unzipping &#42;.exe file.</h2>
                    
<p>I have gotten a zip-file from a friend containing 2 files, one *.txt and one *.exe<br />
<br />
I know the sender, I know the file and I want to unzip the file to run the program. But when I try tu unzip it I keep on getting the message that "windows has blocked access to&nbsp;the file". Here are exactly what it says:<br />
<br />
Extracting to "C:\Users\Asus\AppData\Local\Temp\jon\" <br />
Use Path: yes&nbsp;&nbsp; Overlay Files: yes <br />
Extracting JULEMORO.EXE <br />
Windows has blocked access to the file<br />
<br />
Why does windows do this? Why does windows take control over my computer like that? I don't want windows to block any files that I want to open. So how the heck can I turn this stupid thing off? This goes on my nerves, I like to have control myself, not to
 be controlled like this.<br />

            Did you try running Process Monitor to see what happens in the background.<br />
Add the file name in the Include Filter, and start monitoring.<br />
Try to reproduce the issue, and stop monitoring.<br />

            Hi Bronfire1 
<br />
<br />After the call, the recording is finalized and then posted to your chat where it is available for 30 days. 
<br />
<br />You and everyone on the call can save the recording locally or share the recording to your contacts any time during the 30 days.
<br />
<br />How to save a Skype call recording:
<br />
<br />To save a call on desktop, go to your chat and click the 3 dots, and then select Save to Downloads to save to your downloads folder. 
<br />
<br />You can also select Save as and navigate to the folder where you want it saved. 
<br />
<br />The recording will be saved as an MP4 file.
<br />

</p><ol>
<li>Plugin your device(it can be your External Hard Drive, USB etc) to your PC.</li><li>Open the Command Prompt. You can press Windows Key + X command and select Command Prompt.</li><li>Now, type c<em>hkdsk E: /f /r. Here, ‘E’ can be replace with the Drive Letter of your external device connected.
</em></li><li><em>The above steps will run CHKDSK to check and repair File System Corruption, errors, corruptions or bad sectors on your device which might be causing such error – ‘</em>Drive Is Not Accessible. The Parameter Is Incorrect'.</li></ol>

            Hi mohanmehra
<br />
<br />I think  this may be caused by using the drive letter B for that hard drive
<br />
<br />In Windows the letters A and B were always used for Floppy disc drives. While it is reported you can use those letters for a hard drive, I'm not too convinced by that!
<br />
<br />Please try this, right click the partition on that drive in Disk Management, choose 'Change Drive letter and Paths
<br />
<br />Assign another letter to that drive, either D or E
<br />
<br />Save that and restart your PC, then check to see if you can access that drive . . .

<p>Raw is not a good file system type your drive has been compromised. If data is not important you will need to format the drive to NFTS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the data is valuable you will need a recovery program like like the one I used to recovery from the latest Microsoft Windows update of Windows 10.</p>

    <title>Stopping multiple instances of Windows picture viewer opening - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phil_bennett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stopping multiple instances of Windows picture viewer opening</h2>
                    
<p>We have to open many gif images sequentially, the key feature of 'windows picture and fax viewer' in XP is that as you send it the next image it 'closes/overwrites' the previous one so that only one image and one instance of the program is open at once.
 With windows photo viewer in windows 7 the same process results in hundreds of image files being opened simultaneously which then have to all be closed manually. We cannot find a solution to this or alternative software that will replicate the same feature
 of xp windows and fax viewer. This is such a problem that it preventing us from buying new hardware unless it has XP on. This is getting increasing hard and expensive to do, and from all other aspects we would prefer to move to windows 7.</p>
<p>Any help or suggestions round this would be very gratefully received.</p>

            I just got a Windows 7 machine and am extremely annoyed by the multiple instances of Windows Photo Viewer that pop up every time you click to view a photo.&nbsp; Even with the taskbar grouping this becomes unusable when you open more than 3 or 4 photos.&nbsp; Has
 anybody figured out how to stop this yet??

            Actually I just figured this out......I stopped trying to use Windows Photo Viewer as my default picture/photo viewer.&nbsp; I found another online posting that recommended using FastStone image viewer.&nbsp; So I downloaded that and am very happy!&nbsp; It works just
 like Windows Picture and Fax Viewer did in XP--meaning it only ever opens one instance of itself, no matter how many pictures you click on.&nbsp; It has some good basic edit capabilities, does full-screen nicely....in other words, everything I was looking for.....and
 more!&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            How To Know Where The Windows Spotlight Photos Were Taken&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just got a small problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 Pro ver. 1607. Few of my Friends are running same version of Windows and they can check where the picture showing on lock screen was taken when using Spotlight. This is not the case for me... Below I've pasted two screenshots showing
 the problem. Did anyone came across this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>More info about the Windows Spotlight feature in this article:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">http://www.intowindows.com/know-where-a-windows-spotlight-picture-was-taken/</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p>Here you can see location of the pic plus some additional options:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc162f06-3f45-4024-86f6-22604131e3b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc162f06-3f45-4024-86f6-22604131e3b5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's screenshot of how my lock screen looks like, without information where the pic was taken. Only option to like or don't like the image:</p>

            <p>Thanks Ralph, but it has nothing to do with my problem. He's pointing to the picture location on the HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to have option like on the screenshot above. When I lock my PC I want to be able to see where the picture was taken. That's the feature in Windows 10 that should be available after anniversary update ( version 1607 or above ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can read more about this Spotlight feature here:&nbsp;</p>

    <title>HP Officejet J3600 Series device driver for Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryan millet  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Officejet J3600 Series device driver for Windows 7</h2>
                    I cannot get my printer to work! &nbsp;I have installed different versions of the software, and each time I am told that there is not a driver that exists for the HP Officejet J3600 Series. &nbsp;Does anyone have any suggestions?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have uninstalled the software a few times and I have attempted to install by having Microsoft plug and play make the decisions. &nbsp;I have gone the other direction and I have asked HP what is desired and installed it from their point of view.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have just upgraded my computer from Windows Vista to Windows 7. &nbsp;There is an important update from Windows Update that attempts to install, but it fails&nbsp;every time. &nbsp;This update is HP - Printers - HP Officejet J3600 Series &nbsp;63.9 MB, and it was published
 7/2/2011, but it gives me "Code 800F0246 Windows Update encountered an unknown error". &nbsp;I did find that the Print Spooler was not running, which supposedly allowed other printers to work, but not my HP Officejet J3680.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you in advance,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Bryan</div>
                </div>

            Palcouk,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your assistance in this matter!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes, I did contact the PC maker and the printer hardware makers support site for the software, both are HP. &nbsp;I also tried installing both the basic printer driver and the full software, but neither attempt would fix the problem. &nbsp;These attempts did include
 a complete removal of the software from my system, rebooting and all. &nbsp;I tried by not connecting the printer until instructed to do so, and I also tried to connect the printer, using the plug-n-play so as to have Windows find the correct drivers, but neither
 attempt would work. &nbsp;Those are great ideas!</div>
<div><br />
<div>The solution ended up being a removal of the printer driver for another printer that was previously installed when I was using Vista. &nbsp;This driver was not compatible with Windows 7 and was causing the "Print Spooler" to stop and to cause any other installation
 to fail.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The help desk at the university said that they ended up deleting the other printers from the computer system; &nbsp;then restarting the Print Spooler by clicking on the Start button, searching for "Services", opening the program, scrolling down to "Print Spooler",
 selecting it and clicking on "Start the service"; and then to install the printer software as normal. &nbsp;The printer is working just fine now! &nbsp;Yippee!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>P.S. &nbsp;You are absolutely correct as to there being a difference between the important update and the recommended update. &nbsp;When I had my printer connected to the computer and I attempted to update using windows update, I believe that it said that it was
 an optional update, but when the printer was not connected, the update did not show up. &nbsp;I think that you are correct, it was only a recommended update. &nbsp;Thank you for that correction!</div>
<div><br />
<div>P.P.S. &nbsp;I'm sorry, I can see how you might have thought that there wasn't any driver for the printer. &nbsp;There were, I think, 5 drivers for the printer that were to be installed. &nbsp;Four installed without any problem (I think that they were for the scanner,
 fax, USB printer device, and one other, but the one for&nbsp;<span>the HP Officejet J3600 Series did not work and it said that there wasn't a driver that exists for the installation). &nbsp;After the correction from the University,
 it installed without any hiccups.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope that this helps those of you that may have similar problems!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sincerely and Gratefully,</div>
