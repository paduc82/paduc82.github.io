            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender in Vista/windows 7 is an Anti-Spyware Program, not an Anti-Virus Program.</p>
<p>You should have an Anti-Virus installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using <strong>Norton, AVG, Avira, Microsoft Security Essentials, McAfee, etc</strong> the default action is for&nbsp;Windows Defender to be disabled, as those AntiVirus Programs have their own Antispyware Applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is nothing to be worried about.</p>
<p>Using the two Programs at the same time can cause System conflicts, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a different Anti-Virus, please read this:</p>

</span></span><span>You can change your password to something you will remember from another administrative user's account. If you only had one administrative user account and you've forgotten the password, you can use one of the methods
 below instead. You might then want to follow the general recommendations for setting up user accounts in Vista that I'll give you at the end of this post.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Doing all this requires a certain level of computer skills. You know yourself best and whether taking the machine to a competent local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place) is the better solution for
 you.</span> <br />
<span><br />
If you have a Vista installation DVD (not a recovery DVD) you can boot the system with it. Select the default language, then choose "Repair your computer". Then select "Command Prompt". At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:yes<br />
net user [insert your user account's name here] [insert new user password like 1234 here]<br />
<br />
[Note: Do not type the brackets!]<br />
<br />
Now you will be able to log into your user account using the password you set; i.e., 1234. If you don't have a Vista installation DVD you can either make a bootable Vista Repair DVD from the file at this link:<br />

<a href="http://home.eunet.no/~pnordahl/ntpasswd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.eunet.no/~pnordahl/ntpasswd/<br />
</a><br />
3.&nbsp; Log into your administrative user account (not the Built-in Administrator) which will either require no password or something simple like "1234".<br />
<br />
If you used Method 1, after you have logged into your administrative user account you should disable the built-in Administrator again for security purposes:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: cmd<br />
When cmd appears in Results above, right-click it and choose "Run as administrator" [OK]. Now you will get the command prompt. At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:no [enter]<br />
<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
<br />
</span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline; font-weight: bold">General Recommendations For Setting Up Users In Vista:</span>
<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, All Users, and Guest. These accounts should be left
 alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it will require third-party tools and working outside the operating system.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your
 regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</span> <br />

<h2>            Windows Live Mail 2011 Version Problems</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded from Windows 7 to 10.&nbsp; I have been using Windows Live Mail 2011 for years with no problems.&nbsp; Now all of a sudden whenever I try to get email, a pop up asking for my user name and password comes up and when I x out of it because my name
 and password are already saved there, a notice that I can't receive or send email because of incorrect password comes up.&nbsp; It says account is locked by another session or for maintenance.&nbsp; Try again.&nbsp; I've called my web mail provider (time warner cable) and
 the problem is not with their server.&nbsp; My settings are on POP3 server.&nbsp; Do I need to now be on IMAP for Windows 10?&nbsp; It doesn't give me the option to click on anything but POP.&nbsp; Not sure what to do and very frustrating to not be able to get email on my windows
 live program.&nbsp; Can someone please help?&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It would have been helpful if you'd posted the entire error message - it explains what's wrong. I'm going to guess that you're seeing an error message including this:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Server Response: -ERR [IN-USE] account is locked by another session or for maintenance, try again.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a server error, as the message says. The&nbsp;usual cause is not that the mailbox is undergoing maintenance (which might happen very occasionally, but only for a few minutes or an hour or two), but that some
 other device has an active connection to the mailbox. There can only be one POP3 connection at once. If you're accessing this same mailbox from a mobile device that's configured for push mail, it will monopolize the mailbox and other clients - like Windows
 Live Mail - won't get a look in. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Because the server response is interpreted as an authentication error, it is presented to the user as a fault with the username or password, but this isn't always the case. That's why it's important to read the whole error message.
 Try disabling the account on your phone for a while to see if the problem goes away (this might take a day or two). If it does, reconfigure the account not to use push mail, but rather POP3 at a different interval from whatever Windows Live Mail is set up
 for.</p>

    <title>Programs Starting when Windows 10 Starts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adelphia.interactive  say:</h3>
<h2>            Programs Starting when Windows 10 Starts</h2>
                    <p>Since the update to <strong>1709</strong> there are several issues which are driving me nuts (currently I am on build
<strong>16299.125</strong>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, my NumLock has started to be in an off state when my system starts despite it being set to on in the BIOS/UEFI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly and much more of an annoyance is the startup of programs either starting without them being set in the registry OR shell:startup OR shell:common startup and the ones that are set in my shell:startup ignore the window style set in the shortcut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first program which starts is Outlook. The fact it is starting without me telling it to is an issue in it's own right and I'm sure it's against protocol to make this happen (a bit like IE being forced in the old days).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another program I have an issue with is a VM (using Oracle Virtual Box) where the program is set to start minimized but it always starts in a normal window. This is not a big issue except that I don't want to see it starting every time and then having to
 minimize it, I want it to start as I've set it to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there is a so called "feature" to have the system complete setup as and when the system is updated or restarts (from what I have read, this should only be on an update but the option clearly states update or restart) but I have disabled this and no
 matter what I try I cannot control how programs and more importantly WHICH programs start when the system boots or restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a brand new system with a fresh install of <strong>Windows 10 Pro x64</strong> but I'm really getting annoyed with the way these roll-outs are happening without them being tested by MS before they are rolled out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">PLEASE</span> tell me where I can stop these programs starting which I don't want and start the programs I do want they way I want them to start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched high and low using various search engines but non of the can give me a definitive answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure it's a registry setting but even a searching through it I cannot find any reference to Outlook so I'm at a total loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last thing, I am an IT Support Engineer by trade so <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
PLEASE</span> don't treat me like a moron and don't suggest I do things that I have already tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time and I hope I can get this sorted sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur if the system still picks up quick the program from where you left off and resume being productive. We need to ask you a few questions for us to better assist you. Please provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What are the troubleshooting steps you've tried so far?</li><li>Have you tried uninstalling the Windows update and check if the issue persists?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, please try these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Mothod 1:</strong> Configuring registries:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>regedit</strong> &gt; <strong>hkey local machine</strong> &gt; <strong>system</strong> &gt;
<strong>current control set</strong> &gt; <strong>contro</strong>l &gt; <strong>session manager
</strong>&gt; <strong>memory management Enable</strong> "<strong>Prefetchers</strong>" and Modify it to "<strong>1</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Disable third party application services running:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Press Windows logo button + R then type in: msconfig.</p>
</li><li>
<p>then please go to "<strong>Services</strong>" tab.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have carried out the tasks you suggested but neither have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the registry, the original setting was 3. I set it to 1 as requested, rebooted and the programs (including Outlook) continued to start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then disabled all services (except the Microsoft ones which I hid as requested) and rebooted. On the first reboot Outlook didn't start but the other programs started in a normal window and not minimized as I set them. However, after another reboot (without
 making any further changes or resetting the values) Outlook started again when my system restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now reset the registry value back to 3 and re-enabled the services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for uninstalling the update I'm not sure if I can do that as a new update came down today (which I hoped was going to fix this). Is there a way I can check the installation media (which was created with the Media Creation Tool) to see what version would
 have been installed during a clean boot?&nbsp; I don't really want to have to start over, especially if the version I originally installed from is the same version (1709).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, one last thing, my NumLock functioned correctly one time (the same as Outlook) after the disabling of the non MS services but now it's back to as it was again with it being off rather than on when I start my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Awaiting your next suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh yeah, what happened to Method 2?</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for posting back. We would like to know if you already tried disabling the
<strong>fast startup</strong> under the power settings? If yes, are you still having the same issue? Let's check this
<strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">tool</a></strong> and give it a go. As for your question regarding on checking the installation media, the option that you're looking for is
 not yet applicable.</p>
<p>

            OK, I have just tried disabling Fast Start-up and it made no difference, hence I have re-enabled it.<br />
<br />
I had downloaded that tool previously and have it setup on my system but no matter what I tried Outlook keeps insisting on starting when my system starts but ONLY when I don't exit from it before restarting; if I let it shutdown automatically when shut down
 or restart my system Outlook always fires up again when I restart my system.<br />
<br />
As for the items starting in a normal window I have since learned it was the way I was starting the program. This has now been resolved so it's now just the issue with Outlook and NumLock every time my system starts.

<p>OK. I tired clean boot (although I had tried this previously but just wanted to make sure); the issue still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried safe mode and the issue does NOT occur, but then Outlook refuses to start in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am just doing an online repair of my installation and will then try again. I will edit the post once I have done this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: The repair did not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also want to add that after reading <a href="http://www.techjaws.com/solved-outlook-keeps-opening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Link to external site">
this post</a>&nbsp;I tried what they suggested and created a new profile. This still didn't resolve the issue. I have now disabled scheduled send/receive to see it it's that that is causing the issue.&nbsp; I shall return...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now tried the following to try and resolve this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>checked event viewer for instances of Outlook - nothing shows any errors</li><li>disabled all tasks in task scheduler that relate to Office</li><li>tried a clean boot</li><li>tried safe mode (Outlook doesn't start at all in safe mode)</li><li>repaired my installation of Office</li><li>created and tried a new profile</li><li>tried disabling all plugins for Outlook</li></ul>
<p>There's probably other things too but I'm beginning to run out of ideas except to reinstall Windows 10 which I don't really want to do as this is my production / development PC.</p>

<p>I had already sent feedback prior to reporting here but it has had no response and only has 1 "upvote" which I'm presuming is mine at the time of the submission, I decided to post it here to see if I could get a response sooner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It tells me to create a capture but as this is something that happens after a reboot that's impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also wanted to point out one final thing I tried last night and that was to switch to a local account rather than my MS account and this did not resolve the issue either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really think it's going to come down to a re-installation of my system if there are no forthcoming fixes but, as previously stated, I don't really want to do that as that may not fix the issue either.</p>

            I just want to add that last night I shut my PC down with Task Manager open and this morning, when my system started, Task Manager also started so it's not just Outlook that's starting, it seems to be other parts of Windows too.

<h2>            Blue screen &#38; error code 0x0000000A, </h2>
                    Hi. I'm using a Dell D600&nbsp;laptop with XP (SP3). I've had a lot of trouble with this error. The machine has been wiped and reloaded but I still get this problem. Anywhere from 1 to 3 times a day I suddenly get the 'Blue Screen of Death' with the following
 codes; IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, ***STOP: 0x0000000A (0x017F0304, 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0x804D9B64) The screen says that it's dumping physical memory. So far I've been able to shut down the machine with the power button and restart it after a few seconds and
 it will run fine. Our own IT people are stumped. Any ideas?

<p>If the problems occur after a clean/factory install, then there are hardware issues. I would start with the RAM. If it is anything more than just the RAM, like the motherboard, it probably will not be cost-effective to repair and this older laptop should
 just be replaced.</p>

    <title>Movie Maker error 0xC946002C won&#39;t save from valid .avi file - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Movie Maker error 0xC946002C won&#39;t save from valid .avi file</h2>
                    I recently installed Win10 and successfully used Movie Maker to compress some .avi files into .mp4 format. Now when I try to do that, I get the above error message demanding I remove my .avi from the project before it can go further. I'm using the same
 video capture software (FRAPS) and the .avi plays fine on my system. Any ideas?

    <title>GTA San Andreas Disc Read Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waymundo  say:</h3>
<h2>            GTA San Andreas Disc Read Error</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, GTA SA consistently freezes with the message along the lines of "Disc read error, dirty disc" right after the credits/ initial load screen.</p>
<p>I've deleted and re-downloaded. Didn't work.</p>
<p>Deleted, cleared cache, restart, re-download. Didn't work.</p>
<p>Recovered profile on another hard drive, download. Didn't work.</p>
<p>On the recovered profile on new hdd attached to different Xbox 360: deleted GTA, cleared cache, restart, re-downloaded. Didn't work.</p>
<p>All downloads have been 2.87 gb onto official MS hdds.<br />
<br />
Currently I am downloading ~3gb of demos. Then I'll try to download GTA SA again.</p>
<p><br />
Rockstar and Xbox should have addressed this issue when it came out. Google results show way too many threads about this problem. What a huge waste of time. This is f****** absurd.</p>

<p>Hello there Austin131 and Task Kurai! I'm sorry, to you both as well, for the frustration! I hope you'll be willing to help out our investigation on the issue. To do this, can you each create your own thread after doing the following:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>◦Can I have you try deleting the game from your downloads</p>
<p>◦Clear your <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
cache</a></p>
<p>◦Download 9GB of alternate content (to write over the space on the HDD)</p>
<p>◦Restart your hardware</p>
<p>◦Download GTA again. Let us know if it's still not working at this point!</p>
<p>◦Lastly, can you tell us what the size of the GTA file you have been downloading is?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>This information will help us look further into it and hopefully find you a speedy resolution. :)</p>

 we are definately entitled to a refund!!!!</p>

<p>Hey guys, this is a known issue with this game. Xbox support has been dealing with this for months now. I understand all of you want refunds, and I hate to say it but most of you will never get this refund.
</p>
<p>What you should do is call into support (1-800-4my-xbox), explain to them the issue, and then they should escalate this as they know it is an issue. This is the best that they can do for now.

it helps those answering your questions if you provide: <br />
what <strong>version of windows</strong> (32bit or 64bit) and <strong>service pack level</strong>.<br />
what browser (exact version) you are using.<br />
what <strong>anti-virus application or security suite</strong> is installed and is your subscription current?<br />
what third-party firewall<br />
what antimalware software you may have installed. <br />
which update(s) are you trying to install? (KB Number)</p>

The application requested data from a web site, but the response was invalid. Using Event Viewer, check the log 'Application Logs \ Microsoft \ Windows \ Bits-client \ Operational' for more details.</p>
<p>If the update in question is a .NET update then strongly suggest you manually download and *save* it from the MS Download Center.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx</a>&gt;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter the KB number of the update in the 'Search All Download Center' field and then click the magnifying glass icon to start the search.<br />
Once the download completes close *all* open programs and browsers prior to installing it.</p>

    <title>DCOM setting reverts on its own - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fluxblocker  say:</h3>
<h2>            DCOM setting reverts on its own</h2>
                    <p>We have a small LAN with one domain, (one forest),&nbsp;and Windows 2008 R2 domain controllers.&nbsp; 3 Windows 2008 R2 domain controllers and about 100 Windows 7 workstations.&nbsp; The domain functional level is Windows Server 2008 R2.&nbsp; We have some group policy objects,
 but I do not think any of the GPOs&nbsp;contain settings that apply to&nbsp;the DCOM Config on workstations.&nbsp; The workstations we are having the issue with are&nbsp;64-bit Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; We have some Windows 7 x86 machines, but this issue only affects the x64 computers.&nbsp;
 The specific setting setting I am having the issue with is -&nbsp;in DCOMCNFG.EXE,&nbsp;expand Component Services, Computers, My Computer... right-click My Computer and go to Properties, then go to the Default Properties page.&nbsp; The settings we need to use are: the Enable
 Distributed COM on this computer box is checked. The Enable COM Internet Services on this computer is not checked.&nbsp; The Default Authentication Level: this is the setting that changes by itself.&nbsp; We need it to be set to Connect.&nbsp; However, it keeps reverting
 back to "None".&nbsp; Weirder still, is that this behavior does not affect every computer, but it is not limited to one computer either.&nbsp; There are several computers that are doing this.&nbsp; We have scanned for malware and found none; we are behind a robust hardware
 firewall and we run real-time anti-virus and check for updates all throughout the day every day.&nbsp; So I do not think it is malware.&nbsp; Is there a GPO setting that could be causing this?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>More notes: There is&nbsp;a setting under DCOM Config, with ID {DF4FCC34-067A-4E0A-8352-4A1A5095346E}, with local path "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe". &nbsp;If we set the authentication to 'Connect' on this DCOM application, then it should fix our
 issues (i.e. make it so that our programs work) without having to go to the My Computer - Properties, and set the Default Authentication Level to Connect.&nbsp; And it DOES fix our issues on 32-bit computers, but it doesn't on 64-bit computers!&nbsp; I think this is
 because the 64-bit computers are using the 32-bit version of Internet Explorer, and the path to it is C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe, but the {DF4FCC34-067A-4E0A-8352-4A1A5095346E} DCOM object's path is the same is it is on 32-bit computers,
 without the (x86), so the DCOM setting is not taking effect on the 64-bit computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help me figure out how to make the DCOM setting of "Connect" take effect on Internet Explorer on 64-bit computers, without having to set it at the My Computer level, OR, help me figure out how to keep the Default Authentication "Connect" setting,
 at the "My Computer" level in DCOM,&nbsp;from changing itself back to "None", which it does by itself... I will be a very grateful person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks, in advance!</p>
<p>

<p>Mon abonnement étant expiré, je ne peux plus y jouer.</p>
<p>Est-ce que cela veut dire que les téléchargement de jeux faits ne peuvent être utilisés que si je renouvelle l'abonnement?</p>

<p><strong>[Mod Translation -&nbsp;During my Xbox Live Gold Test Month, I downloaded a free game.</strong><br />
<strong>My subscription has expired, I can no longer play it.</strong><br />
<strong>Does this mean that downloading games made can only be used if I renew the subscription?</strong><br />

            Yes as chiefjoboo mentioned you need an active subscription to play those games. They are your games to keep forever but you need a subscription to play them. All Games with Gold Titles work that way.

<p>The games from Games with Gold can only be used while you have an active Xbox Live Gold Membership.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your subscription expires you can not play those games anymore but if you subscribe again you will have access to play them again.</p>

<h2>            1325.Hewlett-Packard is not a valid short name</h2>
                    I am trying to upgrade to WIN 10 on an HP machine only to have the upgrade fail 10 times.&nbsp; After researching this, I found that the HP Security Tools was the culprit.&nbsp; You cannot uninstall this with the standard installer&nbsp;which is needed to proceed.&nbsp; In
 order to do this,&nbsp;use Revo Uninstaller (free) and download it.&nbsp; I had to take two passes at this, a reboot and then a delete of the folder using the Revo to finally rid the pc of the tool.&nbsp; Thanks to someone else's post on this.&nbsp; The upgrade is now working.

</p><p>My resolution is set to the recommended value and the scale is at 100%. Even though the icon display is set to small icons, they appear big. Also I tried resetting my font size to defaults but that didnt work too.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Media files suddenly and randomly stop playing properly</h2>
                    
<p>I have an ongoing system problem where any type of media file may suddenly stop playing properly.&nbsp; Basically the media begins to play very slowly. If it's a sound file the sound can no longer be heard although the volume control meter apparently registers
 a very small input and the time bar (eg. in ITunes) will continue to move but much slower.&nbsp; If it is a video file, the video will play but in slow motion but without any accompanying sound.&nbsp; This can happen apparently randomly.&nbsp; A system restart always clears
 the problem which may reoccur again minutes, hours or even days later.&nbsp; The problem is both with streaming media and media present on my hard drive.</p>
<p>My system is Windows 7 64 bit with 6GB of Ram&nbsp; Two 500 Gb hard disks are installed.</p>
<p>I would be very grateful for a solution or at least some hint as to what may be going on.</p>

<p><span><span><span>Hi kevin4george,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Do you experience the same problem if you try playing the media files using Windows Media Player?</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method1</span></span></strong><span><br />
<br />
<span><span>Try playing the media files in a clean boot to identify if any of the third party startup/services is interfering with the playback.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To perform clean boot follow the steps provided in the below article:</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Clean Boot</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start&nbsp;as usual as mentioned
 in&nbsp;step 7 in the above&nbsp;article.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Method2</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>You can also try to run sfc/scannow. The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct&nbsp;Microsoft
 versions.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To run sfc scan follow the steps provided:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Open
 command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:&nbsp;<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>A
 message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 any files require a replace SFC will replace them.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>After
 the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the</span><span><span> computer and check.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method3</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You can also try to update the drivers for your video adapter and check if it resolves the issue</span></p>
<p><span>To update the drivers refer to the following link:</span></p>

<p>Dear Naman,</p>
<p>Tthank you for your help and suggestions</p>
<p>Yes, the problem occurs regardless of what player I am using - it seems to affect the whole system as far as media playback is concerned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try Method 1 and 2 above and see what happens.&nbsp; I have already tried 3 without any sign of improvement.</p>

            The SFC scan needs to run in an administrator Command Prompt: open the Start Menu, go to&nbsp;<strong>All Programs</strong> -&nbsp;
<strong>Accessories</strong> , right-click&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt</strong> , and select&nbsp;
<strong>Run as administrator</strong> . Then, the&nbsp;<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command should work correctly.<br />

<p>I have now completed all three of the above and the problem still persists.&nbsp; It returned after about 8 hours of the last reboot today -again apparently randomly.&nbsp; That is even with all third party start up services disabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scannow function returned no errors and the drivers are up to date.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have noted the read out from both the resource manager and the latency checker and there doesn't seem to be an issue here when the problem is occuring.&nbsp; Indeed far from it, there seems to be quite a bit of spare capacity.&nbsp;</p>

When trying to custom install of Windows 7 32-bit to upgrade from XP, I get an error message at any partition of: "Windows needs the driver for device [Primary IDE Channel]"&nbsp; I don't understand what it is looking for or where I would find the proper driver.&nbsp;
 Should this be on my XP discs that came with the computer?&nbsp; <br />
Also, I get an error every time I try to run the compatibility advisor.

            Your BIOS setup may have an option to use something else for a 'controller' of the hard drive. The Dell support documents for your system will probably tell you that. Going to the Dell site may also show you Vista or Win 7 drivers for it. You need to find
 out what the device is called. In XP, go to start/run, and type: <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong><br />
<br />
Yopu may find the controller for your hard drive listed under "IDE controllers' , and the name will help you find a driver. Put found drivers on a flash drive so they can be found during setup.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows
 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Try to create new user account:<br />

            <p>What? I surely don't need a clean boot to proceed... it's a defect with Windows 10 most likely causing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop with Windows 10 is brand new... I just opened it up and started working with it. And the "restore down" doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty much every window has three icons at the top right (like every version of Windows before Windows 10). Those icons are a "dash" (Minimize), a box (Maximize) and an "X" (Close). When you are in "Maximize" mode (full screen), the middle icon becomes
 a double box (one box laid partially over the other). This double box icon is the "Restore Down" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that's the issue. This is a brand new Windows 10 laptop, and like everyone else here, the "Restore Down" isn't working. I suspect Microsoft has done away with this functionality... they want you to stuff everything onto the same screen, or split screen,
 and everything has to be Full Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think we're going the way of Apple, no extra windows allowed. Maybe the only way to open a second browser window is to use a second browser. At least my Mac still allows the window to be "Restore[d] Down" and I can move the window around.</p>

            <p>Same problem.&nbsp; WIndows 10 installed for several months working fine then 'min,max,close' buttons disappeared in Edge or still appear in other apps but the Maximize/Restore Down button does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get round by dragging the window to one side of the screen which then occupies half of screen allowing you to open another application in the other half, but this is less functional than before when you could Restore Down and then drag a window to
 half or quarter screen allowing 4 applications visible at one time.</p>

            <p>I have also had the same problem. In addition, I have been very frustrated that, when I close an email in Outlook or close a document in Word etc, the program minimises right back to the Taskbar which means opening the program again. Another frustrating
 issue is that the Calculator app opens full screen.</p>

</p><p>For me the solution has been simplicity itself. In fact, so simple, I am almost reluctant to share it in case I have completely misunderstood this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open System and turn Tablet Mode off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            Hi HaFin 
<br />
<br />it should be cd c:\users\harry\foldername 
<br />to get to the 'foldername' within the harry folder
<br />
<br />however
<br />use file explorer to open command prompt in the relevant folder so that you can skip the cd step
<br />open file explorer and navigate to the folder in question click on file in the menu then open command prompt
<br />
<br />the command prompt will open in the current directory
<br />then type dir &gt;file.txt
<br />press enter (note the space between dir and &gt;)
<br />you wont see anything in command prompt.
<br />but go back to file explorer to find file.txt in the folder, you can open that in any text editor such as wordpad

<p>Yes, this worked!&nbsp; &nbsp;Critical info was "leave space between dir and &gt;" !&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, this worked!&nbsp; &nbsp;I realized I did not look for new file called "listing" in my selected folder!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I may have failed to leave a space between "dir" and "&gt;"&nbsp; in my earlier attempts.&nbsp; However, when I copy and paste your "dir &gt;file.txt", it worked.</p>

            Hi HaFin 
<br />
<br />Here is a trick that will help . . .
<br />
<br />Open any folder in File Explorer
<br />
<br />In the Address bar in File Explorer, type cmd and hit Enter
<br />
<br />That will open Command Prompt in that folder, you will have no need for CD commands . . .

<div><span>Here are five way to do this:</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Select all the files, press and hold the shift key, then right-click and select Copy as path.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>This copies the list of file names to the clipboard.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>Paste the results into any document such as a txt or doc file &amp; print that.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Go to a command prompt and issue the command</span></div>
<div><span>dir [drive:folder] &gt; c:\tempfilename (you can use any name and put it in any folder you want)</span></div>
<div><span>Then open notepad, open tempfilename, and print it from there.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>3. Write (for example in Notepad) a 1-line text file:</span></div>
<div><span>DIR %1 /O &gt;LPT1:</span></div>
<div><span>Save it as "printdir.bat" in the "Send To" folder.</span></div>
<div><span>Then, to print list of files in any folder, right-click that folder and select Send to | printdir.bat</span></div>
<div><span>To include subfolders, change the command to DIR %1 /O/S &gt;LPT1:</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>4. Go to http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q321379 and follow the instructions there.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>5. Download and use any of the several freeware/shareware utilities that can do this, such as the popular

<h3> traian mechenescu  say:</h3>
<h2>            VIDEO_DXGKRNL_FATAL_ERROR</h2>
                    <p>Hello. In the last two days I have been experiencing multiple BSOD's with error message VIDEO_DXGKRNL_FATAL_ERROR, so here I am asking the community for suggestions on what to do because the **** online chat support from microsoft didn't help at all, even
 though this is a licensed version of Win10 Home for which I paid when I bought my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked that the drivers are up to date on the manufacturer's website. What should I try next ? The BSODs occur in a very random fashion, but usually when doing nothing except reading text on the monitor, without any input or noticeable processor/hdd
 activity. I should mention that I use the laptop hooked to an external monitor. Didn't check if the error occurs when using the laptop screen because I almost never use the laptop this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Machine is an Asus Zenbook UX501JW with Nvidia GTX960M 4GB as dedicated video card.

<p>I have used the system restore function of win10, to restore my laptop to a previous state from 3 days ago, before having installed PCMark 8. I am now waiting to see if I experience the BSOD again, and if I still do, I will upload the dump logs and sysinformation
 as you suggested.</p>

            As you have used System restore to restore to an earlier date and time I suggest you uninstall your anti-virus software, restart your computer and reinstall.

<h2>            Nothing works.</h2>
                    
<p>My credit card recently got stolen so I canceled it and got a new one. Now that I'm trying to update my account with a new credit card NOTHING will work. I've gone through all of the help pages and every time I click "Manage Payment Options" on my account
 it goes straight to an error page saying "Uh oh... that shouldn't have happened." Every time I go to "Your Membership" and select "Xbox LIVE Gold" on my actual account it says "Sorry, this payment option didn't work the last time it was given to us, we can't
 use it this time. Please use a different credit card or other payment option. More info is available at support.xbox.com." It might be because the credit card DOESN'T WORK? So I figure "Might as well remove the old one." Nope. "Payment option VISA ********
 can't be removed. Visit www.xbox.com/accounts for additional payment options." Well, that doesn't help, I went there, the site's completely broken and has tons of errors. "Well maybe I can just change the number on the old one." Nope, the number's greyed out
 and when I select it it does nothing. "I'll add a new one and select it." Nope, when I select it it still uses the old one. So basically my card getting stolen screwed me since absolutely NOTHING will work.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed all steps carefully as advised but nothing worked i am getting error code -&nbsp;0x80246002, As i already mentioned i reinstalled windows and checked for any error with "scf/ scannow" and found there is No Violation. i am able to install other applications
 like Forza motorsport 7 smoothly. I don't understand why this only game/App Forza Horizon 3 giving the same error over and over again. Is there any solution to it. I already checked with Xbox support and they tried all troubleshoot but nothing worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i found a link for the same issue and they solved it with some PI setup, but i could not locate any PI in my system, its so annoying and am almost loosing hope to get over with this error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some troubleshoot trick which i haven't tried yet....Please help&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
