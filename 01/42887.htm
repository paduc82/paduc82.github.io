            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for responding, I have just finished doing everything as listed, no change at all except that now when trying to open Windows Mail , you have to click everything twice to come up with the same errors, as we now have 2 Windows mail folders 1 x old
 and the new one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memory on the computer is 2GB </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Computer is Dell Vostro 400</p>
<p>Windos Vista Home Premium&nbsp; Service Pack 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intel Core DUO E6550 @ 2.33 GHz</p>
<p>32 bit operating system</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I seem to be getting nowhere. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there&nbsp; a problem with Vista and Intel Matrix Storage Console 8.9.0 1023</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a back up done by Norton Save &amp; Restore 2.0 on an external hard drive, so not sure if to try that.?</p>
<p>All I have done is replce a failed hard drive with a new one and followed the instructions from the Intel Matrix Storage Console manual.</p>
<p>When you click on windows update,&nbsp;it has a red stripe and shield with a cross.&nbsp;The check for updates on the left pane&nbsp;is greyed out. If you click the check for updates&nbsp;on the right pane the pop up ; Window Update cannot currently check for updates, because
 the service is not running. You may need to restart your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows Mail</p>
<p>when you click on Windows Mail, it tries to recover the mail database&nbsp;from windows mail storage recovery. the pop up&nbsp; Mail could not be started, unable to open the mail message store, unable to locate its message database. If you have moved the files to
 a new location click OK to reset the database path otherwise click cancel to proceed, any existing messages found will be available under Orphaned Accounts (0x00000000)</p>
<p>click cancel next pop up windows mail could not start unable to open message store Your computer maybe out of memory or your disk is full (0x80070002,2)</p>
<p>click OK next pop up&nbsp; mail could not be started because MSOE.DLL could not be initialized</p>
<p>If you click on Windows Mail as above , but click ok rather than cancel&nbsp; after the (0x00000000) pop up you then go to Browse Folder, which now I have Windows Mail and Windows Mail.old</p>
<p>select window Mail .old then OK, you get&nbsp; a pop up&nbsp; again could not start, unable to open message store maybe out of memory or disk full (0x80004005)</p>
<p>click OK next pop up could not start MSOE.DLL could not be initialized</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do i do with the rename.bat file on my desk top??</p>
<p>I could not check to see what files had errors after the scan check?? tied a number of times, nothing happens, so the 2nd and 3rd part of Method 2 (SFC) KB929833 could not be performed. Is there something missing from the text?</p>
<p>Help ??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for yoyr reply</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note 1) ok have deleted</p>

<p>Method 3 will not allow to go online to get latest updates, ( although I am connected)&nbsp;click OK,&nbsp;
</p>
<p>your computer will need to remain connected to the internet throughout the installation process</p>
<p>Read licence terms, tick accept</p>
<p>which type of installation do you want? Upgrade has been disabled, The upgrade cannot be started. To upgrade, cancel the installation and choose to upgrade to a version of Windows more recent thean the version currently running</p>
<p>Only option left is Custom ( advanced) install clean copy</p>

<p>I have just noticed thaton the replaced drive, Port 0, the physical sector size is 3072bytes and the logical sector size is 512bytes. Port 1 ( the original drive ) both physical and logical sector size is 512bytes. Does this help with solving why Window

            <p>Hi <span><strong>Jeffdeckers</strong></span>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Cause:</b></p>
<p>I think the most likely cause of the problem is that the corrupt data was transferred to the second drive when the first drive was failed. And this resulting in bad copies of system files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since an SFC scan didn‚Äôt fix it, you will need to backup what you can and reinstall Windows at this point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Warning</strong>: It takes the same amount of time to do the upgrade or to reinstall the operating system. Before you perform reinstallation, you should be prepared for a worst case scenario that results in your existing data on your computer

            I've just encountered the exact same problem after imaging a hard drive. There must be a fix for this other than an OS reinstall?<br />
<br />
Problem still persists after deleting the mailstore and Winmail reg settings. Surely it can build a new empty mailstore ala Outlook Express when one doesn't exist.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>It may be an overheating problem and that&nbsp;is normally the main reason for your problem.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If it was a Hardware problem, it would tend not to restart.</p>
<p>Having said that, it is possible to have a hairline crack in the Motherboard, etc, which only becomes obvious once it heats up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check the vents for dust, hair, etc&nbsp;and do not use a Laptop when it is resting&nbsp;on material surfaces: bedspreads, blankets,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem persists, as it is a Laptop, take it to a local and reliable Computer Repair Shop and get them to open it up and clean the dust from inside it..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is an interesting discussion about the varied reasons for your problem:</p>
<p><a href="http://pc-trickandsolution.blogspot.com.au/2011/07/fix-laptop-overheating-shutdown-problem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://pc-trickandsolution.blogspot.com.au/2011/07/fix-laptop-overheating-shutdown-problem.html</font></a></p>
<p>N.B&gt; However 9 out of 10 cases of overheating are caused by an airflow blockage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            Used Storage Space Almost Full When No files Stored in laptop</h2>
                    I am unsure why my laptop displays Used Space of 25.3GB and Free Space of 2.54 when I have no files nor applications stored on it. The Disk Cleanup is not even helping.&nbsp; Right now it is not allowing me install office 2016 Pro Plus. Any idea how I can restore
 some space?

            Hi , you would be amazed how many users with 32GB (28GB usable) of internal storage ask the exact same question . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h2>            Settings app does NOT work with Windows 10 Pro 32-bit</h2>
                    I've recently upgraded three machines from Windows 7 to Windows 10 in the week after Windows 10 came out officially:<br />
<br />
Two were Home Premium (one 32-bit, one 64-bit) while the other was from Windows 7 Professional to Windows 10 Pro (32-bit). &nbsp;The two Home Premium upgrades went through perfectly as did the one on Professional, however, on Windows 10 Pro 32-bit, when I click
 "Settings," that flashes for maybe a split-second at best and closes back up immediately. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Anyone know what is causing this to happen and how this can be remedied? &nbsp;Thanks for any help on this!

            Tried that, still having the same issue:<br />
<br />
This seems to only be a problem with Windows 10 Pro 32-bit. &nbsp;As noted in my original post, I upgraded two other machines from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Home (one 32-bit, the other 64-bit) without this or any other issues. &nbsp;It was noted in some other
 posts (before this became official) that they were having this issue and this is the same build of Windows 10 Pro (32-bit) as that one (Build 10240). &nbsp;Something is not allowing the settings feature to work properly and it appears a fix is needed for that.<br />
<br />
Thanks.

    <title>SSD Activity at 100&#37; by System.exe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielgruszczyk  say:</h3>
<h2>            SSD Activity at 100&#37; by System.exe</h2>
                    <p>Like in the topic, activity (and disk transfer rate)&nbsp;of my SSD is almost all the time at 100%, this is because of System.exe reading/writing something like crazy.</p>
<p>It is causing a major lag in running pretty much anything, even my mouse and keyboard are lagging so much the computer is literally unusable.</p>
<p>Is that some known problem? Are there any fixes?</p>
<p>Thanks...</p>

            <p>‚ÄãHi Daniel, </p>
<div><br />
I can understand the inconvenience which you are facing on the computer. We will work together to try and resolve this issue further.</div>
<div><br />
I would request you to add some information in context of this issue related to the system performance:<br />
1) Do you face this issue while transferring any particular set of files on/from the computer?<br />
2) Have you installed any software or application on the computer recently prior to this issue?<br />
3) Are you using an external or an internal hard drive?</div>
<div>4) What is the Make and Model of the computer as well as the SSD drive(if it's an external drive)?</div>
<div><br />
This issue, related to the performance of the computer, usually occurs when the hard drive is not able to communicate with computer which leads to high usage.<br />
<div>If it‚Äôs an external hard drive, check if you find the same performance after disconnecting the hard drive from the computer.
<div><br />
If it‚Äôs an internal hard drive, I would suggest you to run the system maintenance troubleshooter and check if it solves this issue. You can follow the methods:<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> <br />
Please follow the steps to run the troubleshooter:<br />
a) Press <strong>Windows and X</strong> key together and select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
b) Click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.<br />
c) Click on<strong> View all </strong>option on the left side of the Windows.<br />
d) Click on <strong>System Maintenance </strong>option.<br />
e) Click on <strong>Next </strong>and follow the onscreen instructions to troubleshoot the issue.</div>
<div><br />
Check if you find any difference in the performance. If not, move to method 2.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to optimize the SSD drive by defragmenting the drive. You can refer to the link:</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/optimize-hard-drive#1TC=t1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/optimize-hard-drive#1TC=t1</a></div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> If Trim is supported; Trim optimization is unavailable for FAT and FAT32 file systems. So, SSD drives which are in NTFS format can only be defragmented.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
Let‚Äôs check if you face the same issue in safe mode. You can follow the steps:<br />
<strong>Step 1</strong>:<br />
You can refer to the link to boot the computer into safes mode:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072bc">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</font></a>
<br />
If you don‚Äôt face the same issue, you can navigate to step 2.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
If you find that the computer performs well enough, it could be some other non-Microsoft application that is causing this issue. Let‚Äôs place the computer in clean boot state and find out what exactly is hampering the performance.
<br />
Refer to the link to place the laptop in clean boot state:<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate
 software conflicts.<br />
‚Äú<strong>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8</strong>‚Äù<br />
Follow the section ‚Äú<strong>Windows 8</strong>‚Äù<br />
You can follow the section ‚Äú<strong>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</strong>‚Äù to check for the application or program that is causing this issue:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072bc">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</font></a>
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>Please go through the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot
</strong>of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</div>
<div><br />
If you don‚Äôt find an improvement in the performance after method 3, I would suggest you to update the firmware for the SSD drive. You can refer to the manufacturer website of the hard drive to do so. You may also contact the manufacturer SSD drive (if external)
 for further help on this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Please post back with the status of this issue to help you further.<br />

<p>Left-click on the folder and drag it to the desktop. That creates a copy on the desktop.
</p>
<p>Doing the same and holding the Shift key while dragging moves the file to the desktop.</p>

<h2>            Windows installer freezes on spinning dots&#63;</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Hi,&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I recently moved and tried to turn on my Windows 10 PC for the first time and got the BSOD. After trying a few of the fixes for
 that with no success, I decided I would simply just clean install a new Windows 10 off my bootable USB. So I used my MSi motherboard settings to format my SSD and tried to boot off the USB after restarting.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">However, when booting off the USB, the system freezes as soon as the small spinning dots come up. To be more specific, it displays
 3 dots and then freezes on them no matter how long I wait.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Things i've tried:&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">- Reformatted SSD.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">- Tried 2 different Windows ISO's on 2 different USB's (Home &amp; Education edition).</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">- Unplugged HDD inside case incase it was a faulty secondary drive causing issues.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I'm not really sure what to try now. Please note I didn't add a disk drive when I built this PC because it's 2018.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />

            Hi Vincent.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.    
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I will give you all possible steps to troubleshoot installation failure which work in about 90% of cases.  If not we'll go from there:
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI. 
<br />
<br />Create the latest new Windows 10 Installation Media by installing Media Creation Tool and following the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all - thanks for the awesome, quick response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed the steps as far as I can, however no matter what I can't boot into the bootable USB drive made using the media installation tool. I've used the tool on 3 different USB's now, and every boot attempt looks like this:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/265efae4-53db-486e-97b7-9006ac902b65?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/265efae4-53db-486e-97b7-9006ac902b65?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Remains stuck on that screen every time with the 3 dots not moving.<br />
</p>
<p>Also, please note, that between these steps I tried swapping SATA cables for my SSD and HDD and also reset the BIOS via both removing the battery from the MOBO and placing it back in, and also restoring default settings in the MOBO interface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more suggestions? I'm scared it could possibly be hardware that I can't get at the moment :(</p>

            Are you removing all but the SSD? 
<br />
<br />Did you try booting the flash sticks in another PC to compare and confirm it works?  
<br />
<br />It looks like it's skipping the BIOS/UEFI and trying to start Windows or there shouldn't be a picture on the screen.  
<br />
<br />Did you try pressing the key shown to enter Setup?  You can try setting UEFI flash stick to boot first, although you'll then have to remove it before restarts or it will restart the install over. 
<br />
<br /> For UEFI the Windows Boot Manager should remain first to boot at all times (except for this test) but if you don't have UEFI it will be booting as a normal flash stick with hard drive set to boot first.  
<br />
<br />If it persists to fail post back the exact BIOS settings and other choices for UEFI, CSM, Legacy BIOS, Secure Boot (disable), Fast Boot (disable) and Boot Priority order.  
<br />
<br />You can remove the SSD to another PC to install as a last resort, move it back where it should start if hardware is working properly.   You can also try DVD installer.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no other PC to put the flash drives into nor my SSD to install Windows that way unfortunately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have booted into my BIOS setup and manually set the flash drive to boot first however it still results in the same screen with the frozen 3 spinning dots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How would I go about posting all the BIOS settings for you to see? The MOBO is an MSi X370 SLi Plus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Go into BIOS setup and look for UEFI settings to report back:   UEFI enable or disable, CSM or Legacy BIOS, Secure Boot (disable), Fast Boot (disable), Boot Priority Order (windows Boot manager should be first).  
<br />
<br />If none of those it's not UEFI but Legacy BIOS.  SATA controller set only to AHCI.  The hard drive should remain set to boot first, use the Boot Menu key to trigger flash stick.
<br />
<br />Reset the BIOS/UEFI to optimal defaults, see if the flash boots now, if not then again check and report back all of those settings.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inside my BIOS setup there's no Secure Boot or Fast Boot option (i've looked myself and used the BIOS in-built search function and nothing comes up).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, in the boot priority, Windows Boot Manager isn't even one of them. Just my SSD and a range of USB and DVD options (in which only 1 USB is actually in the PC and there isn't even a disk drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may also be worth mentioning I plugged my secondary HDD back in and that's not even showing in the devices list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I restored BIOS to factory optimised settings once again, and still stuck on the 3 dots when booting from USB. My current config. for boot is SSD then USB but I press F11 on start-up and boot from USB and get stuck.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Vincent.  OK, we've finally established that you don't have the modern UEFI BIOS.  
<br />
<br />Unplug the secondary HDD, plug the SSD into SATA1.  Is it detected in BIOS setup under Storage drives (often by only the Serial number you can google to see)?  
<br />
<br /> Do you have an older WIndows or other media to try booting into to see if it loads and makes it to the install screen, where you can delete all partitions.  
<br />
<br />Or at first screen press Shift + F10 to access a Command Prompt, run the CLEAN command I gave in my first post troubleshooting steps.       
        </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I can plug the SSD into any SATA port from SATA1 all the way to SATA6 and when I select boot device it has:</p>
<p><strong>SATA1: SSD MAKE AND MODEL</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if it makes any difference, it says "UEFI: USB NAME" and then also has the USB by itself without UEFI as well on the boot menu. This is the Windows 10 bootable USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any other bootable media as it is, but could get hold of a Windows 7 bootable USB if it's worth a try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Thatsfortune,</p>
<p><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</p>
<p><br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;When was the last time it was working?<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;What is the version of Windows installed on the computer?<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Does it only happen with photos?</p>
<p>First I would suggest that you try searching for the photo using the file extension and check if it works.</p>
<p>The easiest way to locate and view pictures on your computer is by using Windows Photo Gallery. By default, Photo Gallery shows all the pictures and videos that are located in the Pictures folder, but you can add other folders to Photo Gallery. You can search
 for pictures and videos by typing in the Search box or by clicking tags, ratings, or dates in the Navigation pane.<br />
<br />
<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Open <strong>Windows</strong> <strong>Photo</strong> <strong>Gallery</strong> by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking <strong>All Programs</strong>, and then clicking
<strong>Windows Photo Gallery</strong>.</p>
<p>Refer the below link for more information.<br />

<p><br />
If you are unable to fix the issue I would suggest that you run a virus scan on the computer to remove any malware or virus infections.<br />

<p>Thanks for your reply Rolando, I have uninstalled the printer three times now and reinstalled the software from HP three times. still not able to print directly from my laptop, it will scan ok, but not print.</p>
<p>The laptop has recently had Windows 10 re-installed prior to this it worked fine and my other computer (windows 10 desktop) has no problem scanning or printing.&nbsp;I think the problem is a missing driver but all updates have been done and used device manager
 to update all device drivers, still having the problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this issue greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Christine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be an issue with the settings of your printer or it is possible that the driver of your printer is corrupted. These can be the reasons why you're unable to print. We would like to know if you already performed the steps found in the link that was
 provided by <strong>Rolando Vil</strong>. If not, we suggest that you do all the steps found in the link to resolve the issue. If you're also using an HP printer, we also recommend running the tool found in the link that was provided by
<strong>A. User</strong>. Upon checking, the tool usually resolves common printer issues automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We await for the outcome.</p>

            Hi William, that device uses the generic Bluetooth driver in Windows . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager
<br />
<br />Find that device in Device Manager, right click that and choose 'Update Driver'
<br />
<br />Select 'Browse my computer for driver update'
<br />
<br />Select 'Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my Computer'
<br />
<br />Select 'Generic bluetooth Driver'

<p>Then I get this white dialog box: "To use this app , you need to sign in with the Microsoft account that was used to download it.&nbsp; Go to the Windows Store, select Settings, Accounts and Preferences, then sign in with the purchasing account.&nbsp; If this doesn't
 help, uninstall and reinstall the app at the Windows Store".</p>
<p>I have only used one Microsoft account to purchase, download and play the game.</p>
<p>If I go to the Windows&nbsp;Store and swipe in from the right to get SETTINGS, there are options for "Your account", "Preferences", "App updates", "Terms of Use", "Help" and "Permissions".&nbsp; No "Accounts and Preferences".</p>
<p>I select "Your account" and re-login with the only account I've ever used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still no joy.</p>

<p>Hello Longchenpa,</p>
<p>Thank you for reporting your issue. We've passed it on to our production team for an investigation. &nbsp;Can you confirm if your LIVE login is associated to your Windows Login? &nbsp;If it isn't, access the Charm Bar on your device, select Settings, then PC Settings.
 The steps listed below will ensure your account with the license to play the premium version of Minesweeper is logged in during the initial installation. Please attempt these steps and let us know if you're continuing to have issues or if it has been resolved.</p>
<p>1. Select Accounts or Users depending on if you have Windows 8 and Windows 8.1</p>
<p>2. This is where it will show if your account is tied to your Windows Login</p>
<p>3. If it's not tied to the account, attempt to associate your LIVE account to your Windows Login, you will be able to remove this at any time.</p>
<p>4. Uninstall Minesweeper</p>
<p>5. Restart your device</p>
<p>6. Login to your device, this may now be your LIVE login information, and access the Windows Store</p>
<p>7. Download and Install Microsoft Minesweeper from the Windows Store</p>
<p>8. Once the download is complete, attempt to launch the title to see if you receive the same issue</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>MS Win8 Games</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>My account appears to be tied to my Windows Login. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I uninstalled Minesweeper, restarted tablet and logged in with my LIVE account credentials (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</p>
<p>I downloaded and installed minesweeper OK.</p>
<p>When I start Minesweeper it says, "Checking price" and then "Do you want to install this item? Price: Free Description: Activate your game". &nbsp;All the while the "Xbox Games Signing In" box in the upper right corner keeps spinning and spinning.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0 is not working&#33;</h2>
                    I download a game and the game requires&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0.&nbsp;Anyway, I went on&nbsp;Microsoft.com&nbsp;and downloaded the program. When it finished installing, nothing happened. I went to the installer and clicked on it and it said "Repair".
 After clicking "Repair", it said it completed&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;then I went to my game I downloaded, it said&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0 is not installed. I went back to the installer and it had the repair option again, I clicked the repair button
 and got a&nbsp;successful&nbsp;message again and it still had a repair option. Please help. Contact me at *** Email address is removed for privacy *** if you can help or answer below. Thanks!&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing in Microsoft Communities.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Before we start troubleshooting on the issue please provide us with the additional information by answering few questions
 mentioned, this will help us to troubleshoot better.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Which game are you referring to?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check whether the game and Microsoft XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0is compatible with Windows 8 from the link provided.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/Home</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If it is not compatible with Windows 8, then I suggest you to install the game on the computer in Windows 8 by choosing the compatibility level.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run the Program Compatibility Wizard</span></b><span>, by pressing
<b>Windows key + W</b> and then type <b>Control Panel</b>,
</span></p>
<p><b><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></b><span>Click
<b>Programs</b>, and then clicking <b>Use an older program with this version of Windows</b>.
</span></p>
<p><b><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></b><span>Follow the instructions in the wizard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Reference:

<h3> diriver63  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD driver corrupted expool bugcheck 0xc5</h2>
                    <p>Recently we updated a few PCs from win7 pro to win10 pro via LTI. Since then, we get a blue screen very often (almost once a day), typically after an automatic restart early in the morning ~4am. Sometimes we get a DMP file, sometimes we dont. Here's
 an extract of the dump file .... Any idea how to fix&nbsp; this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the DMP file&nbsp;http://1drv.ms/1pc19VX</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a Dell optiplex 7010</p>

<h2>            In W10 can I create shortcuts to built-in tabbed dialogs&#63;</h2>
                    <p>(Windows 10 Home version 1803 build 17134.165)</p>
<p>I know that I can create shortcuts to top-level dialogs like Settings but can I also create them for sub-dialogs? The one I want most is to virus signature update. Even a special case shortcut to this one thing would be an improvement but there are others
 for which I would like a general capability. In this particular case I have to do Start &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Security &gt; Open Windows Defender security Center &gt; Virus &amp; threat protection &gt; Virus &amp; threat protection updates to get to "Check for updates"--
 ouch!!</p>

            I can only get it as far as the protection window.
<br />Try this.
<br />Right click your desktop select new - shortcut.

            I have found the answer to my own question as regards the specific case of Windows Defender. It is a discrete program and doesn't need to be a URI of explorer but can be invoked directly with command line options. "C:\Program Files\Windows Defender\MSASCui.exe"
 opens the same dialog as explorer.exe windowsdefender: But it can also take arguments that do what I wanted. -Update goes directly to the updates screen and invokes Check for Updates. Other arguments are -UpdateAndQuickScan, -QuickScan, -FullScan, whose operation
 is obvious.<br />

            From Microsoft:
<br />
<br />We are aware of a problem that resulted in an incorrect driver update for some AMD Radeon HD 2000, 3000, and 4000 series adapters. The driver update has been corrected. If you were impacted by the incorrect driver, follow these steps for all versions of Windows 10 to delete the 22.19.128.0 driver from the system and recover the recommended driver version (8.970.100.9001):
<br />Start Device Manager. To do this, press and hold (or right-click) the Start Menu icon, and then select Device Manager.
<br />Expand Display adapters, right-click the adapter that has the problem driver installed, and then select Properties.
<br />Select the Driver tab and verify driver version is 22.19.128.0.
<br />Select Uninstall Device.
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.‚Äù This step is important and will prevent the problematic driver from reinstalling in the future.
<br />The system may require a reboot at this point. Reboot if needed, then reopen Device Manager.
<br />Select any device, then click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />Recheck the driver version.  If it still reports 22.19.128.0, repeat steps 4 to 7 until the recommended driver (8.970.100.9001) is re-installed.  If this resolves your graphics problems, you can stop here.  If a different driver version is installed, follow the next step to check for the driver using Windows Update.  
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.

            Option 1.Try Rolling back if you have an option:
<br />Go to Device Manager by typing in Devmgmt.msc in Run dialog box. 
<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version. 
<br />Option 2. Remove drivers completely and Install the the newest ones available from the OEM or the maker.
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of Display driver using DDU
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the driver from the OEM or the maker like AMD
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I am using Windows 10 on my HP Spectre x360 Convertible.&nbsp; I had Traditional Chinese (SAR HK) language pack with handwriting options installed before, and was able to use the handwriting pad.&nbsp; After the last windows update, my handwriting keyboard disappeared.
 I try to remove the Chinese language pack previously installed and&nbsp; add it back ,but it keeps indicated the handwriting option is not available for this language. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have in uninstalling Twitter app from the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft offers a Settings interface for uninstalling apps (Modern, universal) and desktop applications. You can find that in Settings (WINKEY + I), System, Apps and Features. From here, you can uninstall apps and applications, and if you choose to uninstall
 a desktop application, it‚Äôs uninstaller will run directly without any need to invoke Programs and Features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the setting and reply with the results, we are happy to help&nbsp; you further.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately you cannot uninstall UWP apps from Apps and Features.&nbsp; They don't appear in that list in the Control Panel.&nbsp; The fact that it doesn't appear&nbsp;was mentioned&nbsp;in my response to Ruth Buruga.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the app shortcut does not appear in the appdata Start Menu directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sfc and dism commands did nothing either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The blank blue Twitter icon as pictured in my previous post is still present.&nbsp; Please let me know where else the Windows 10 operating system registers items to display in the Start Menu All Apps list?&nbsp; There must be some way to modify the list and remove
 the icon.&nbsp; What file, directory or registry entry specifies this listing of Apps?&nbsp; Please let me know.</p>

            <p>Hello, it's not really a Twitter app problem.&nbsp; It's the all app list in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd rather not recreate my user account and configurations.</p>
<p>I'd just like to know what registry keys or directories, etc control what gets listed in the Start menu All Apps list.</p>
<p>Please let me know, thanks!</p>

            Info was helpful but another step or 2 would have taken me to the exact spot needed.
