<h2>            change font size and in-game &#39;press this button to action&#39; hints</h2>
                    <p>hi all,&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Not sure if this is the place to ask, but i'm stuck with this tiny yet so dissapointing thing. I have recently bought an xbox one and loving it to bits, but i can't seem to figure this one out and browsing around i can't help but think i'm definitily not the only one. The in-game fonts are damn hard to read and the suggested 'press this button to make this action' hint as well. And that counts for all games i have played so far. Sure, i could set my xbox to a lower resolution, say 720 or 420, but that's not what i bought a new xbox for, to downgrade.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Anyone around here that knows how i can increase or perhaps change the font? Hope to hear from someone, thanks in advance. <br /></p>

            Hi,  Lou
<br />
<br />My name is Phillip and I am an Independent Advisor. I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />Try to repair your internet connection.
<br />Go to those steps, from the Start menu or by pressing the key combination Win + I open the Configuration and click on the option Networks and Internet. Once there, we select the option Status of the left side menu and within the settings and options that are loaded in the right panel we have to look for network restoration.
<br />
<br />Clicking on this option will show us a new window from where we will be able to perform the network reset in Windows 10. In this way, all the network adapters will be removed and reinstalled and the original configuration of other components of the network will be re-established. net. This implies that if we were using some software such as a VPN client or virtual switches, we will have to reinstall them.
<br />
<br />A process that is carried out automatically by the system by clicking on the Reset button now shown in Network Reset in the Windows 10 configuration. It is normal that the process does not take too long, although we must wait until the end completely and restart the computer again to proceed with the network configuration in Windows 10 as we had until now.

            Hi Lou. <br /><br /> Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:<br /><br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  <br /><br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    <br /><br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers:  <br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a><br /><br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    <br /><br />5) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time t

    <title>Primary Monitor goes black - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Primary Monitor goes black</h2>
                    <p>I posted this same exact question in January.&nbsp; I was able to get it resolved by performing&nbsp;<span>an In-Place upgrade, as suggested.&nbsp; That worked, until about a week ago.&nbsp; Now I am having the same exact issue again.&nbsp;
 I tried doing an In-Place upgrade again, and it did not resolve the issue this time.&nbsp; I also confirmed that my NVIDIA drivers are up to date as well (I installed them yesterday).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 graphics cards in SLI and 2 monitors (a Dell connected via DVI and a Samsung connected via a DVI-&gt;HDMI -&gt; HDMI mini)&nbsp; About a month ago after the Windows Feature Pack update, I started having issues with my monitors.&nbsp;
 When only one is plugged in they work fine, so I know there isn't an issue with the cables.&nbsp; When I plug in the 2nd monitor, it works, but the primary screen goes black.&nbsp; If I open any programs, the still open on the primary screen and I have to use Windows
 + &lt;Left or Right&gt; to move it from the primary monitor to the secondary monitor.&nbsp; If I open the display settings, and switch which monitor is marked as primary, it disconnects both monitors, then brings them both back on, and both display properly.&nbsp; But the
 primary goes black again when my computer goes to sleep or is restarted.&nbsp; I have confirmed installed the latest NVIDIA driver this afternoon, and I still have this issue.&nbsp; I have tried the following:</p>
<p>- changing which ports/graphics cards each monitor is plugged into</p>
<p>- confirmed the Dell monitor's drivers are up to date (the Samsung is a generic PnP)</p>
<p>- uninstalled the Display Adapters completely (it switched to using the default windows driver, but still didn't work)</p>
<p>- unplugged the computer and the monitors for 5 minutes then reconnected them</p>
<p>- scanned my computer for corrupt files using&nbsp;<span>sfc /</span>scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help you be greatly appreciated, as it is very annoying to have to guess that I'm logging in, and then switch my main display every time I want to use my computer.</p>

            Hi Cody.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Have you tried with only one video card, then the other?
<br />
<br />The adapter cable is also a suspect based on what I've seen over the years.
<br />
<br />To troubleshoot dual monitor not detected the are three excellent tutorials here:

<p>I had this same exact issue in January.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I know all the cables work fine, because the problem is repeatable.&nbsp; Every time I turn on my computer, or wake it up, the primary monitor is black.&nbsp; I can either
 unplug one of my monitors (either one) and then the log in screen will show, or I just hit enter, type my password and log in without seeing what I'm doing.&nbsp; The secondary monitor will then work, where I can open the display settings, change the secondary
 monitor to be the primary, then both monitors start displaying.</span></p>

 moment,pls try later. I also find it difficult to upgrade my inbox profile which insists I'm from GB, though I'm in Nigeria.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>ok, I HAD this problem too - the operative word here is HAD. &nbsp;I got good at figuring things out for myself. &nbsp;Iinitially set up the 2-step verification on my computer. &nbsp;Problem is, that to get outlook on your iphone - you also need to set up something like
 that on your iphone. &nbsp;Soooooooooo, I removed the 2-step verification from my computer, and now I can get into my hotmail account on my iphone. &nbsp;It really has nothing to do with passwords. Microsoft sucks!</p>

<p>I always saved a couple of stasis packs for brutes. &nbsp;On my hardcore run I kept the contact beam with me at all times to sell the ammo, and to kill brutes. &nbsp;Even a non-upgraded contact beam can take out a brute in stasis pretty fast. &nbsp;Even if you your stasis
 isn't upgraded, just save or buy a few stasis packs so you can spam that son of a ***. &nbsp;Just spam that and run in a counterclockwise manner around the brute unless you hit a wall.&nbsp; Then go in a clockwise manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My suggestion for a hardcore run is to upgrade your health first, and then one weapon. &nbsp;After you do all of the health upgrades and a few weapon upgrades, I recommend doing a couple stasis upgrades. &nbsp;They can save ammo by allowing you to make the most out
 of your shots through better accuracy. &nbsp;Other people might say otherwise but don't even worry about kinesis upgrades. &nbsp;I also recommend upgrading and keeping the Plasma Cutter with you at all times. &nbsp;Ammo is cheap, and it's pretty power when upgraded. &nbsp;You
 might have more luck with a upgraded PC than a javelin. &nbsp;Either way either one SHOULD work for you, as long as the brute is in stasis, and you're running in a counterclockwise manner. &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What weapons are you using and how far have you upgraded all of them? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't know already once you reach the disc swap point, that's a free checkpoint. &nbsp;This means if you die from that point on, you will revert to the start of disc 2 instead of your Ch. 5 save. &nbsp;However, you have to choose to continue. &nbsp;If you quit the
 game by pressing B or turn off you Xbox, you will lose that checkpoint, and have to start again from Ch. 5 next time you play the game. &nbsp;I saved close to the same spots you did/want to, and had no problems. &nbsp;You absolutely want to save you last save for the
 eye drill press thingy. &nbsp;Trust me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven't already, you should read all of the Hardcore guides and tips on these forums. &nbsp;I found some of the tips to be very helpful. &nbsp;</p>

<p>[/quote]It makes sense.&nbsp; The enemies are as strong as they are in Survivalist difficulty, but ammo drops are as if you were playing on Zealot difficulty.&nbsp; The enemies aren't really that hard to kill, but they can still kill you very fast.&nbsp; That's why most
 people will tell you to upgrade your health first.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see you beat the game on Zealot.&nbsp; That difficulty has more difficult enemies obviously, but Hardcore is much more difficult because if you die, you will most likely lose hours of progress.&nbsp; Check out more tips from others and myself

<p>Yes it is ^^ Thookins already said most of the tips but what I used for weapons is PC, Force Gun and switched to a Seeker Rifle and ditched the PC but the Force Gun (or Contact Beam if you prefer) will be a great asset. Just take your time and use that stasis.
 My saves were at 5, 8 and 11. It's a great experience and I know I felt like I accomplished something when I was done, very few games give me that feeling lol.</p>

<p>T is right about the Force Gun. &nbsp;It is hands down the most useful gun in the game. &nbsp;It's essentially a shotgun. &nbsp;If anything gets close, just shoot. &nbsp;You don't even need to aim. &nbsp;This gun is your best friend, as it knocks back or kills anything that gets
 too close. &nbsp;If you carry two guns, carry the FG, and anything with range. &nbsp;I also carried the Detonator. &nbsp;It's really good for laying down traps. &nbsp;If you've played the game a few times, you'll know exactly where to place a few. &nbsp;One of those can save you an
 entire clip from another weapon. &nbsp;Anytime you remember parts where enemies spawn, just lay a few and wait until they walk into them. &nbsp;It's a great defensive and offensive weapon. &nbsp;Plus I always treated it like a grenade launcher. &nbsp;Just put something in stasis,
 and hit it with a direct hit. &nbsp;To recap my weapons for Hardcore were the Detonator, the Plasma Cutter, the Force Gun, and the Contact Beam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah T, my heart was pounding out of my chest by the very end lol. &nbsp;Can't think of another game that did that to me. &nbsp;Man, I can't &nbsp;imagine using the last save so early. &nbsp;How many times did you die? &nbsp;I used my last save at the eye machine and died three
 times after that at various points before I beat the game. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I didn't die any after my last save lol. It was at the end of 11 right before you start chapter 12 so you know I was sweating bullets when I got to the eye poke machine lol. That would have been a huge let down to die and go all the way back but I did it.
 I only died twice during my Hardcore run, once in Ch.10 and once in Ch. 8. When I was in Ch.10 I got greedy and didn't save yet and made a real stupid mistake so it sent me back to 7. Me, being stubborn tried again right away, frustrated, I ended up dying
 in Ch.8 then! Got really pissed and wanted some kind of progress from basically the 2-3 hours I just lost so I started from 7 one last time and saved at the end of Ch.8 and the rest his history :) great experience, ready for more, bring on DS3!</p>

<p>O yeah Seeker Rifle is my favorite gun, can take out enemies pretty easily, especially on brutes when you hit they weak points. I'd say all you need is that and the Force Gun. That's what I used on my run anyway.

<h2>            Files Disappear When Sorting Documents</h2>
                    I have one document folder with 108 Microsoft Word files.&nbsp; When I have the files sorted by "Folder," all 108 of the files are visible.&nbsp; When I attempt to sort them using "arrange by date modified" or "arrange by name," only 105 of the files appear (3 of
 them disappear).&nbsp; I can't, for the life of me, figure out why this is happening.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp;

            Hey bells621,
<div><br />
<div>Palcouk was right when he said the item your computer was&nbsp;referring&nbsp;to was a printer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do you use that kind of printer? Is it working properly?</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you do not, I recommend checking your control panel for the Lexmark printer program and removing it.</div>
<div>That should stop the error. Thanks and Happy Holidays!</div>

Many of these devices such as HP Stream came in a variety of colors with a full copy of Windows 8.1. Attractive qualities include an affordable price and a 11 or 13 inch display. Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations. This makes it difficult to install Windows 10 the conventional way.

Symptoms
<hr />
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span><span><span><span>After installing the February 13, 2018 security update,&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4074588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>KB4074588
 (OS Build 16299.248)</span></span></span></a><span><span><span>, some USB devices and onboard devices, such as a built-in laptop camera, keyboard or mouse, may stop working for some users.</span></span></span></span></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
Cause
<hr />
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>This issue occurs when the Windows Update servicing stack incorrectly skips installing the newer version of some critical drivers in the cumulative update and uninstalls the currently
 active drivers during maintenance.</span></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
Resolution
<hr />
<div>
<div>
<div>
<span>Method 1: Restoring your system when a working keyboard is available</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>If a working wireless or PS2 keyboard is available, or if you can use the on-screen keyboard via a working touchscreen, follow these steps to restore your USB functionality:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>In the search box on the taskbar, type&nbsp;<span>cmd</span>.</span></li><li><span>Right-click (or tap and hold)&nbsp;<span>Command Prompt</span>&nbsp;in the search results and select&nbsp;<span>Run as administrator</span>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt window, type the command listed below for your version of Windows and press ENTER.</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 40px"><span>For 32-bit versions of Windows:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px"><code><span><span><span><span>dism
 /online /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~16299.248.1.17</span></span></span></span></code></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px"><span>For 64-bit versions of Windows:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px"><code><span><span><span><span>dism

<ol>
<li><span>Restart Windows.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Method 2: Restoring your system without a working keyboard</span>
<p><span>If a working keyboard is not available after installing the update, your keyboard and mouse should work within the Window 10 Recovery Environment, which you can use to restore your
 system.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span><span><span><span>Start the Windows 10 Recovery Environment.</span></span></span></span></span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 40px"><span>If you restart the system before Windows finishes loading the desktop three times in a row, Windows should automatically start the Windows 10 Recovery Environment.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px"><span>If Windows will not automatically boot to the recovery screen, you can also use installation media to enter the Windows 10 Recovery Environment:</span></p>

<li><span><span><span><span><span>Use the Command Prompt to uninstall the update:</span></span></span></span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><span><span><span>At the recovery screen, select&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Troubleshoot</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>,
 then&nbsp;<span>Advanced Options</span>, and then&nbsp;<span>Command Prompt</span>.

</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After a recent Windows update, my computer could no longer see the camera. At first it was not visible in Device Manager, but after a couple of reboots, it reappeared. The properties box indicated that
 the camera was not connected to the computer and that there were no drivers installed. Attempting to install drivers got a failure message.<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">From there I went to the Intel RealSense site where I attempted to download and install the appropriate drivers. The wizard first had me uninstall the previous drivers, but an attempt to install new drivers
 required me to do a firmware update-- which failed. (I could post the log of that, which it kindly stored to my computer).&nbsp;</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Additionally-- there is no restore point on the computer except the on from four hours ago when I attempted a Windows update to try to fix this. The nice man at HP helpdesk would like me to restore the
 entire machine to factory condition, wiping out everything on it. I'm hoping something other than this nuclear option is possible.<br />

<p>I ran the Windows Update diagnostics and it found several errors that it corrected.&nbsp; When I reran the upgrade to Windows 8.1, it is still failing with the same error.</p>
<p>Where are there logs that will show more detailed information identifying the actual problem?</p>

            <p>Okay.&nbsp; Here is what I found after digging some more on the Internet.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I found information from the technet.Microsoft.com Web site.&nbsp; The error log that I asked about was c:\$Windows.~BT\Panther\setuperr.log.&nbsp; (I'm pretty sure that is the path.&nbsp; I didn't copy it and now that the update is complete, the directory no longer exists)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Using a text editing program I searched for Error.&nbsp; I found a message relating to BCDEDIT not finding the DISPLAYORDER option for the boot manager.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On my PC I have the recommended small partition for doing recovery, therefore I use the Windows Boot Manager.&nbsp; I had set the default boot option so it would start Windows and then I had removed the DISPLAYORDER so the Boot Manager displayed nothing and went
 directly to Windows.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Well, the setup program did allow&nbsp;for that condition and it failed with a generic error.&nbsp; Key to finding the solution was finding the log files.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I changed the Boot Manager option so that it displays the two options and waits only 5 seconds to choose the default. When I reran the update, it worked fine.&nbsp; Of course, I had tried several other options before finding the logs so&nbsp;I had to reinstall several
 programs&nbsp;afterwards.</p>

<p>No you don not lose your game saves and progression if you uninstall a game or remove your account from console as this data is saved in cloud and when you login to any console, even if it's a new one and you start a game the data will be synced. Same even
 works for Play Anywhere games where you can continue from your last saves on your PC or Xbox One.</p>

            Hi <strong>L752734,</strong><br />
<br />
When did it stop working? Did you make any changes to the computer recently?<br />
Did you install any update recently?<br />
Do you get any error message while you use certain keyboard shortcuts?<br />
Which shortcut are you trying to use?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Try using another keyboard and check.<br />
I would recommend you to check the assigned keyboard shortcuts in the settings and make sure that the shortcuts are not duplicated.<br />
<br />
Hope to hear back from you soon.<br />

<h2>            Windows 8.1 - Cannot wake from sleep, Print Spooler doesn&#39;t start automatically</h2>
                    Hey guys,<br />
<br />
Upon updating to Windows 8.1 I'm having two major problems:<br />
<br />
* I can't wake the computer whenever monitor goes to sleep. Every device that is wake_programmable is wake_armed now (it looks like keyboard, clickpad, touch screen and Intel Wi-fi) but still I can't wake the computer. Even if I turn off the possibility of
 monitor going to sleep, the computer will after not using the computer for a while it'll enter a state where the standby pilot is on but everything else seems to go off (audio doesn't play, USB's don't charge, etc.) and I can only bring it back by resetting.
 Another problem has to do with hibernation: if I leave the computer in hibernation mode overnight AND the laptop lid open, it will automatically reset so that when I reboot the computer I lost all my work. Event log doesn't seem to register anything in the
 middle of the night that I've noticed.<br />
<br />
* Print spooler isn't automatically starting. Error message mentions that "endpoint is a duplicate". If I run the troubleshooter everything goes back to normal, but whenever I restart the computer the problem is back.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Because of this issues I decided to repair windows 8, and then reinstall windows 8.1. The issues are still here!<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help figuring this out<br />

            Hi Praseetha,<br />
<br />
Thanks for trying to help!<br />
<br />
My laptop is a Sony Vaio Pro 13, Intel Core i7-4500 CPU, Windows 8.1 64-bit.<br />
<br />
I've tried most of what you suggest. Safe mode doesn't help here as it blocks me from sending the computer to sleep or add printers. I have all the updates and have re-installed a couple of relevant drivers. I have also performed a "refresh" where it basically
 re-configured the whole computer to factory settings. The problems persisted before I added any third-party application.<br />
<br />
Probably I wasn't clear before, but the issue I have doesn't pertain to a single printer, but all of them, including Adobe PDF or the XPS document writer. Whenever I boot the computer they aren't active as the print spooler is not active, due to duplicate endpoints.<br />
<br />
My sleep issue continues. Though everything is wake_armed, whenever I put the computer to sleep I can only wake it using the power button; if the monitor goes to sleep there's no way to wake it except forcing a reset. When I hibernate the computer, most of
 the times I loose all my work and the computer boots as if it was just reset. I've changed everything I can in the power settings to address this. An integrity scan comes back clean.

 the times I loose all my work and the computer boots as if it was just reset. I've changed everything I can in the power settings to address this. An integrity scan comes back clean.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had a similar problem with my Lexmark... After uninstalling the software\drivers, rebooting, and then attempting to reinstall, I received the message that the drivers were already installed.</p>
<p>My only options were to install another copy, or update the existing ones... Neither worked.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After 2 days of trial and error this is what got them to install....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It has to do with the Print Spooler interfering with the uninstall\reinstall process. I had read about a recommendation to turn off the Print Spooler before uninstalling the software quite some time ago, and I had tried that, but it didn't work. Here are
 the tricks to hopefully get it to work.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Note: Bidirectional Support is needed, and for some reason the upgrade process turns it off. This may also be related to the Print Spooler....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1) Turn on and hook up your printer... This needs to be done just this one time to get it to show up in Devices and Printers.... Otherwise, all I get with my machine is the Lexmark Fax, and as a result, you can't "Remove" the printer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2) Once the printer is visible in Devices and Printers, physically unhook it..</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3) "REMOVE" the Lexmark Printer and Lexmark Fax (if you have one) in Devices and Printers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4) Stop the Print Spooler in "Services"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>5) Uninstall the software\drivers... In the process of doing this, I got two popup Security messages from Windows Firewall concerning "Allowing" Printer Communication... I selected "Allow".
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I then ended up with two printers in Printer Preferences...</p>
<p>I started over, and unchecked the "Shared" box on the first message... Only one printer this time...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>6) At the prompt from the Lexmark uninstaller, Reboot.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>7) After rebooting, STOP the Print Spooler again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>8) Reinstall software\drivers... I used both XP SP3 and Vista Compatibility Mode on different attempts, and both worked... Hook the printer back up when prompted by the installer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>9) Unhook the printer again and reboot. Bidirectional Support must be Enabled, and the setting won't stick if the printer is hooked up.. You need to reboot to clear things up before the next step.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>10) Enable Bidirectional Support and Reboot. To do this, go to Devices and Printers and select "Printer Properties" and then the "PORTS" tab... The check box is near the bottom.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>11) Set any Printer Preferences you use, if any, and it's ready to go.</p>

Hi slance310,<br />
<br />
Thanks for sharing your story as far as the printer is concerned. In my case, though, this issue is not associated with any specific printer, but rather to the print spooler itself. I won't initiate automatically, so I cannot access any of printers, including
 the Adobe PDF one. I have to manually activate it in order to even be able to see my printers.<br />
<br />
The wake issue, I was talking about Device Manager (I think, I used the cmd powercfg -devicequery prompt). I have reset my BIOS since the problem started and it didn't solve it. Anything else I can try? For now, I'm just not allowing the screen to go to sleep,
 but sometimes it still freezes on me, like when awaking from hibernation and such.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Raul<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problem with the print spooler is most likely due to drivers that didn't uninstall, or activate properly with the upgrade....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Are you talking about multiple physical printers, or printing from multiple applications.....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may be able to go to Print Management in Advanced Tools and delete any drivers that don't appear correct.
</p>
<p>The process I described was necessary to get a complete uninstall of the printer, so that it would reinstall properly... Otherwise, the same problem kept reoccurring.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not sure about the sleep... most of the issues I have been seeing are problems with GOING to Sleep...</p>
<p>You might double check your Bios to make sure your keyboard, mouse, etc. are enabled to WAKE...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If these are disabled, the Device Manager settings won't matter..</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I know laptops function a bit differently than desktops, and I'm not very familiar with them...</p>
<p>I just purchased my first on a couple of weeks ago... and it's a Win 7 Pro model.</p>

<blockquote>Hi Praseetha,<br />
<br />
Thanks for trying to help!<br />
<br />
My laptop is a Sony Vaio Pro 13, Intel Core i7-4500 CPU, Windows 8.1 64-bit.<br />
<br />
I've tried most of what you suggest. Safe mode doesn't help here as it blocks me from sending the computer to sleep or add printers. I have all the updates and have re-installed a couple of relevant drivers. I have also performed a "refresh" where it basically
 re-configured the whole computer to factory settings. The problems persisted before I added any third-party application.<br />
<br />
Probably I wasn't clear before, but the issue I have doesn't pertain to a single printer, but all of them, including Adobe PDF or the XPS document writer. Whenever I boot the computer they aren't active as the print spooler is not active, due to duplicate endpoints.<br />
<br />
My sleep issue continues. Though everything is wake_armed, whenever I put the computer to sleep I can only wake it using the power button; if the monitor goes to sleep there's no way to wake it except forcing a reset. When I hibernate the computer, most of
 the times I loose all my work and the computer boots as if it was just reset. I've changed everything I can in the power settings to address this. An integrity scan comes back clean.

In my case disabling secure boot option in bios solved the problem.<br />

            Hi! John,
<div><br />
<div>I tried flushing DNS as per the steps you had advised. DNS is clean and there are no negative cache entries or dynamically added entries to discard.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;Flushing the dns still <u>DOES NOT ALLOW</u> me to</div>
<div><b>1) Access My Adobe page</b></div>
<div><b>2) Sign in to Adobe</b></div>
<div><b>3) Activate Adobe Photoshop Elements 12 and Premiere Elements 12 from the desktop</b></div>

<div>I have 2 browsers IE and Google Chrome. Tried both browsers and the messages are the same</div>
<div>- check internet</div>
<div>- webpage address is not available</div>
<div>- error 100</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have a <b>Windows 8.1 operating system</b> in my laptop. It allows me to update the Elements 12 software just 5 minutes ago and downloaded the updates. But IT WILL NOT ALLOW me to register the product, sign in to Adobe and access My Adobe page</div>
<div><br />
<div>The problem is confined to Adobe website and the Photoshop Elements only. I <u>
did not</u> have a problem with Adobe Flash.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried accessing My Adobe and Sign In to Adobe using Google Chrome on Windows XP and Windows 2000 operating system. Both XP and 2000 did not give me any problems</div>

            On a Chromebook you would utilize Skype for Web, though some people have found ways to run repackaged Android releases. &nbsp;If there was any way to test the camera it would be in the settings. &nbsp;I do not believe the option exists in Skype for Web. &nbsp;The remaining
 options to test your camera would be to use the Camera App that comes with your Chromebook or by placing a test video call with another Skype user.

    <title>Scheduling a task to trigger off a registry change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dkstrausser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scheduling a task to trigger off a registry change</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am currently trying to recreate Windows 7 bubble screensaver behavior on Windows 8. I am using a dual screen display with a slideshow desktop changing one of the screens desktops every 15 minutes. I am running a scheduled task for on idle
 trigger to run a simple .vbs script the runs bubbles.scr via a shortcut on my desktop. This circumvents the Mono-color background behavior that bubbles exhibits through personalize on idle (not preview). The problem is (and I presume the reason for the mono-color
 screen being set) that when the desktop changes on one of the screens the displayed bubbles speed up to shocking speeds. I have confirmed this behavior. My intention is to in the end create an image of the screensaver process just before the change and load
 it again after if possible. My hope is that I can observe the when LastHighTick and LastLowTick registers in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Personalization\Desktop Slideshow are changed (marking the change of one of the desktops) via task scheduler, but I
 can't figure it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is if it is possible to monitor registry events via task scheduler as triggers and if so how.</p>

<h3> buzzdroid218  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless connection drops after about 10 seconds on my Windows 7 laptop...</h2>
                    
<p>I just got a Lenovo 550 laptop with windsow 7 home premium.&nbsp; I went through the procedure to establish a wireless connection with my router.&nbsp; My laptop 'sees' the wireless network, I click
<em>connect</em> and it appears to connect (four bars show down in the corner).&nbsp; After about 10-20 seconds, or when I then hit Explorer to go to the internet, it tells me I'm not connected and I see the concnection&nbsp;drops.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have tried the usual things like
 reestablishing my network connection, etc.&nbsp; but every *@$%! time it does the same thing on me.&nbsp; I've checked out the router (d-link) and it appears fine.&nbsp; The laptop sees other networks and I have connected to others so I know the system bascially works.&nbsp;&nbsp;My
 wireless is&nbsp;secured and I have the password&nbsp;properly entered.&nbsp; On my first night of trying maybe 20 times it all actually worked and I got on the internet.&nbsp; But since that one time this problem keeps happening.</p>
<p>What in the cyberworld am I missing?&nbsp; My XP computer can use the wireless w/o issue (but I use ethernet with that one).&nbsp; Why would the system connect to the internet one moment (and says
<em>internet access</em>) and then just drop the connection (I'm right next to the router and it still does it).&nbsp; ANY ADVICE PLEASE???&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<span>Hi Buzzdroid218,</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to visit router manufacturer’s website and install the latest firmaware compatible for Windows 7 and check if the issue is fixed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may also run Network troubleshooter from the below mentioned link. The Network troubleshooter helps to diagnose and repair the problem.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Using the Network troubleshooter in Windows 7:</span></strong></p>

</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would also suggest you to use Network troubleshooter event logs to solve network problems. When you run the Network troubleshooter, any problem found, along with any solution, is displayed
 in the Network troubleshooter dialog box. If more detailed or technical information about the problem and potential solutions is available, it's saved in one or more event logs.</span></p>

<p>Hey there Brandon,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding, have you already tried to connect the controllers to a different console? If you still have not tried this then I would advise that you try and connect to a different device to see if maybe it's the console or we are indeed having
 these issues with all 3 controllers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also maybe try to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Factory Reset and Keep Games and Apps</a> on the console to see if this makes any difference. This would do exactly as that says, keep all games and apps while factory resetting the rest of the console. Make sure you have your account login information so you
 can add your account back on the console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if this has helped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Brandon!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try to update your Xbox One Controller?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a similar issue with a controller until i update the controller and after that works perfect!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Link:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Description:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to Xbox Live on your Xbox One console and install the latest system update if prompted to do so.</li><li>If you have a stereo headset adapter, plug it into the bottom of your controller so it can also get updates.</li><li>If you're using a stereo headset adapter, plug in a headset (a headset must be plugged in so the adapter will turn on).</li><li>Press the&nbsp;<strong>Xbox&nbsp;</strong>button&nbsp;&nbsp;to open the guide.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>System</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Kinect &amp; devices</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Devices &amp; accessories</strong>, and then select the controller you want to update.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Device info</strong>, select the&nbsp;<strong>Firmware version</strong>&nbsp;box, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Continue</strong>.</li><li>When the update is complete, you can update additional controllers. If they can only be updated via USB, see&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headse
 via USB</a>. Otherwise, select the&nbsp;<strong>Update another</strong>&nbsp;button on the screen after the first update is complete, and then follow the steps.</li></ol>

            You can try, remove the batteries, connect with the Micro USB, then after 1 minute try to sync it again with&nbsp; batteries.

<p>We just did the reset and save games and apps. So far it looks like it fixed it. it has been 5 minutes and still running. Longer than we could use it before. I thought it had to be the console because we do have another xbox one in this house. The other
 works fine with my controllers and we have tried my brothers controllers on mine and it would still disconnect. His has no issues at all .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far so good.&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for the response and the help!</p>

<p>Hey there BrandonSitts,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding and letting us know the controllers are working better now. At this point only time will tell if this has resolved the problem.
</p>
<p>If you do happen to run into further problems then another thing to look at would be your connection to the outlet, If you are plugged into a surge protector then I would advise connecting directly to the wall to see if there is any changes. If you are already
 plugged into the wall then don't worry about this step.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Happy Gaming!</p>
