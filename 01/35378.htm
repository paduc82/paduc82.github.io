<h2>            Xbox 360 PC Wireless Gaming Receiver</h2>
                    I recently bought a wireless receiver and my laptop says it needs its drivers updated, unfortunately i have not found anything remotely close to what i am looking for, if anyone could help me with my little problem it would be much obliged.

<p>This does not help my problem, the receiver works fine (at least id assume considering it has the green light and my controller supposedly connects to it) and the page linked only helps if the receiver is to fail, my laptop is the one missing a step. when
 i plugged it in it never gave any hint to starting a driver download nor did it actually do anything.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Martha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue may arise due to a faulty hardware or the operating system is already corrupted. To help you resolve your concern, kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
</ol>
<p><span><strong>Method 1: Use the inbox Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool. Then, install the Windows update or service pack again.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Search</span>. Or, if you are using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, and then click<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Search</span>.
 Type<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Command Prompt</span><span>&nbsp;</span>in the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Search</span><span>&nbsp;</span>box, right-click<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Command Prompt</span>, and then click<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Run as administrator</span>. If you are prompted for
 an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Allow</span>.</li><li>Type the following command, and then press<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Enter</span>.<br />
It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<div>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</div>
<span>Important</span><span>&nbsp;</span>When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions. However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running Windows installation as the repair source,
 or use a Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD, as the source of the files. To do this, run the following command instead:
<div>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:<strong>C:\RepairSource\Windows</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>/LimitAccess</div>
<span>Note</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Replace the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>C:\RepairSource\Windows</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>placeholder with the location of your repair source. For more information about using the DISM tool to repair Windows, reference<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824869.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair
 a Windows Image</a>.</li><li>Type the following command and press<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Enter</span>.<br />
It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<div>sfc /scannow</div>
</li><li>Close the command prompt, and then run<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows Update</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>again.</li></ol>
<p>DISM creates a log file (%windir%/Logs/CBS/CBS.log) that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. %windir% is the folder in which Windows is installed. For example, the %windir% folder is C:\Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Perform a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot</a>.</strong> <span>It helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 3: Update the drivers.</strong> You may refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/ad5a063e-5f57-c715-2566-b983195752c1/update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>You've probably done this already, but in case you haven't, did you open Task Manager? In Windows 10, it gives you much more information, especially regarding the hard drive. I had a similar problem, and when I opened Task Manager, I found out that the hard
 drive was always at 100%, causing my computer to slow down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up having to uninstall my antivirus, which was Avast, and install Windows Defender. Basically, Windows 10 hates it when you use any programs which aren't Microsoft, and driver conflicts arise so often, holding on to them isn't worth it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'd like to take issue with your last piece of advice - updating the drivers. </p>
<p>You, more than anyone, should know that Windows 10 (latest update) doesn't allow you to update any drivers, even if there's a conflict.</p>
<p>I had a bluescreen yesterday, with the cause being pinpointed as problems with nwifi.sys. All the advice I found online said I should update my wifi drivers, which was funny, as I thought I'd updated them in May. In fact, the update file from Intel was still
 in my downloads. </p>
<p>What I found out was that Windows 10 refuses to update because it says my drivers are up to date, even though there's a newer one from Intel available. When I try to manually update, it does nothing. Last month it went through the motions and pretended to
 update, but didn't. Yesterday it literally did nothing - I double-clicked on the file, went through the User Account Control rigmarole, gave permission, and it vanished.</p>
<p>So I have my own solution - if this happens again, I'm going to roll back the update. I've had enough - every time there's a Windows 10 update, my Windows 10, 6 month old laptop goes insane. This isn't actually the first problem I've had with the Developer's
 update - at first my wifi wouldn't connect automatically after a restart. That was nothing more than an annoyance, but this is more serious. I'm not putting up with repeated bluescreens because Windows can't get its act together.</p>

<h2>            Killer Instinct TE2 arcade stick not working</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, so I just recently bought a brand new arcade stick for Killer Instinct. I followed the directions with the procable on the front of the fight stick (twisted the cable on) and plugged it into my USB port on my Xbox one. Nothing happens...I've tried
 turning off the system, I've tried different USB ports. I've tried holding down the home button before plugging in the arcade stick...nothing works.</p>
<p>This is really frustrating because I just bought it and I don't think its faulty. It may be a simple fix, but I'm completely at a loss on what I need to do in order to get it to work.</p>

<p>I'd suggest contacting MadCatz customer support on this one. I know they have a lock on them that prevents the view, menu and Xbox buttons being used. I don't have one myself but it is possible you can't use it to navigate the dashboard and it will only
 work within certain games. </p>

<h3> joan in oregon  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I hook up ear buds to an HP Pavillion HPE PC&#63;</h2>
                    A friend suggested that in order to hear the very poor audio on a UTube video, I use earbuds or earphones instead of speakers. &nbsp;How do I hook up ear buds to a HP Pavillion HPE P? &nbsp;There are 6 or 8 jacks on the back, one of which has the speakers hooked
 up. &nbsp;All are color coded but I don't have the key to the codes. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can someone give me some insight. &nbsp;What I have tried. &nbsp;While the video was playing, I inserted the male plug from the earphones into each jack in succession. &nbsp;The jack which had had the speakers attached gave some static but no there was no volume at all
 on the ear buds. &nbsp;Similar to the total lack of volume when using the speakers. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

Several things need to be fixed before we can find the underlying issue.&nbsp; First is you need to update to SP-1 (that may fix it in itself)<br />

<div><b>Please run the System Update Readiness Tool (SURT)&nbsp; and then update to SP-1</b><br />

            I tried almost everything.
<div>I downloaded SURT, run it and when something popped up that i needed to download/update it failed.</div>
<div>Tried downloading SP1 and install it manually, failed again.</div>
<div>My Windows Update had a SP1 ready to download &amp; install, failed aswell..&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I think the problem here is that my OS is corrupted, and i am thinking of reinstalling it. After i reinstall my OS, and see if the problem is solved i'll post something here.</div>

<h2>            Thinking of buying Xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>I am thinking of getting Xbox 360 but not sure if its too late in its cycle to get one or is it still a great gaming machine despite its age?&nbsp; Was looking at the 4GB and upgrading HDD later but just need to know a couple of things first.</p>
<p>How long does it take to install games - Disk based and Demo - I have a PS3 Super Slim and it takes 15mins just to install a demo, fed up with it so need a change, also is it mandatory installs like the PS3, appreciate any help on this.</p>

<p>The box 360 is a great platform. &nbsp;Downloads are much faster than PS3, you just can not be in a online game or the download will stop. &nbsp;I would say demos take 5 minutes on average. &nbsp;Updates to current games take usally less than a minute. &nbsp;Hope this helps

<p>Rumours say that the next generation console is coming out this year, but of course... it's just rumours. At this point I'd be kind of hesitant really though. If there is a particular game that tempts you though, perhaps go for it?</p>

<p>Even though there is probably a new console releasing this year, its still going to take a year or two after launch to see the really good games since developers are not going to want to waste 20+ million dollars on making AAA games that will only end up
 selling 500k to 2M copies. The best games will not come until there is a userbase to sell to except for maybe some advanced PC ports. You can expect to see the major console games stay on the 360 platform for a couple years after the 720 release. While they
 might make it to the 720 as well, they will only be updated 360 ports. Activision breaks sales records every year with Call of Duty. You can't expect them to stop and lose money just to sell next gen games to early adopters. And if you plan to play online,
 I would advise against the 4GB console. The hard drive by itself is pretty expensive as an add on.</p>

<p>Hi :)</p>
<p>I have had an Xbox since the old black style. Just after the 360 came out I admit I bought a PS3 . This did not last long, as I missed playing with all the friends I had made on Xbox live. The Xbox 360 is in my opinion the best console on the market full
 stop. I have been a member of Xbox Live for over 8 years now and will never go back to the PS3.</p>
<p>Not saying I'm a fanboy of Xbox ..just that it's a better all round console with more apps, games and everything in between. I often go to my friends house to play Fifa. Oh my god the PS3 takes an age just to load a game, by this time you could have easy
 played a good half a match on Xbox.</p>
<p>Also go for the 250gig Unit. You may think yeah 4 gig will do ..trust me it won't :) and you will be going out to buy a bigger HDD within weeks, which in the long run will be more expensive.</p>
<p>Go on buy one :) </p>

<p>By that you mean Indie games that consist of things like launching a baby into objects or simulated dating? While there is a market for this kind of simple stuff, when it comes to real games, they have been killing us for a few years now. Now of course as
 a new 360 gamer, you do have a back library to enjoy however when it comes down to new retail games or even bigger digital games, we are seriously falling behind.</p>

<p>And then you have apps such as Sky Tv in the UK &nbsp;which is not on the ps3 the online service provided by Microsoft is way better than Sony's</p>
<p>Better online community</p>

<p>Free apps? Which ones can you use that are not locked behind the subscription? You say better community. Appears you have not been in one of the countless threads on how everybody has to hide behind private parties because the community is so disgusting
 and racist. Sure more people have mics on the 360 however so many are people you never want to talk to in the first place. Can't say I've really been called the N word on the Playstation service. The slower downloads over there are also only a wifi issue.
 While Xbox does have better wifi, wired is more stable no matter what console you have.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>But why don't you get into some of the cons for a second because believe me. They exist on all consoles such as no map pack is allowed to be above 2GB and no game above 2 GB is allowed to be priced below 20.00. We have lost games and content for both these
 reasons. Or how devs like Epic and Valve cannot distribute their DLC free as intended because Microsoft forces them to charge even if that includes a 45.00 weapon skin pack thats already locked on your game disc. Not to mention arcade games and content cannot
 be bought at face value meaning to get a map pack for Left 4 Dead or Alan Wake, you have to buy a substantial amount of points in a pack without the ability to spend your change on your next purchase. This means you have to spend 800 points on a 560 point
 pack without the ability to use the remaining 240 points towards your next 800 or 1200 point game. It sits there forever unless you want to waste it on avatar gear just to get rid of it. Or how about the fact that we have never seen a large scale multiplayer
 game like Dust 514 or MAG because Microsoft caps our connection and we cannot rely on the bandwidth of our whole broadband connection not to mention does not include dedicated servers for games that need it. This last one was confirmed by a developer who posts
 here from time to time named Edios Chris. I could go on and on such as how they have done schemes as stupid and simple as molding an extra piece of plastic on your A/V cables just so you cannot use your Turtle Beach headset while running HDMI without first
 buying their 50.00 adaptor unless you want to rip the shield off the cables and play with bare wires wrapped in electrical tape</p>
<br />
<br />
Now I hate to sound so doom &amp; gloom because trust me. i really do like my xbox 360. I just don't think people should have this praise Microsoft attitude and act like everything they do completely blows away the competition. Competition who is now beating them
 in global console sales may I add due to the many problems I mention with the biggest one being the serious lack of Xbox exclusive games.

            <p>Hey, Skull!</p><p><br /></p><p>Sorry to see any issues with recovering your Crash Bandicoot game. I am assuming that you recently did a license transfer on your Xbox 360 for this and that is why you are running into this issue. Would my assumption be correct?</p><p><br /></p><p>If so, then check out your <a href="https://live.xbox.com/download/history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox 360 Purchase History</a>. This will give you full details of anything you have purchased for the Xbox 360. If Crash Bandicoot is not showing up there, it is likely that the purchase was made on another account on the console and was able to be played by you via a console license.</p><p><br /></p><p>However, if the license transfer&nbsp;is not&nbsp;the case, please post back so that I can help you dig further into this. I look forward to helping you out!&nbsp;:)</p><p><br /></p><p>--------------------------------------</p>

            <p>Hello thank you for being there, at the level of the account, it is possibly possible that it is étit buy with another account but I really do not see which ... Especially that it is an account so I do not own, So I would not have had the interest to buy a product without the possibility of recovering it. That said, is it possible after having a buy games of the first XBOX so the bill will not show up? In thanking you my friend.</p>

            <p><font color="#000000">Appreciate the follow up, Skull!&nbsp;</font>It has happened that buying the game would not show up in Download History on both consoles, but I do not think we have seen a case where it did not show up on the Purchase History link I have provided. If it is not showing up on that page, then it was not purchased on your account.</p><p><br /></p><p>The common scenario is that the game was purchased on another account and customers did not realize this. I have even done this with my account and my husband's account on occasion. ;)</p><p><br /></p><p>Have you checked all of the accounts you may have access to using the link I&nbsp;provided above? You may find the game doing that and find out which account owns the game if you used to play it. Let me know how that goes. :)</p><p><br /></p><p>--------------------------------------</p>

<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>When a game opens in 4:3 ratio, that means the game needs that much of screen resolution. Once you are out of the game,
 the screen resolution restores back. So basically we can’t do anything to the screen resolution. But we can check if there is any resolution setting in the game settings and change it over there. Else you can contact the manufacturer of the game.</font></font></span></p>

 software, malware, ccleaner, superantii spyware.&nbsp; They ran scans and said I was infected and I should buy these software packs for $79.&nbsp; Is this a real Microsoft service?&nbsp; I still have these softwares on my computer, should I delete them?&nbsp; What other threats
 may be present if this is not a real Microsoft service?</p>

Its a total scam. Uninstall their software and then run a System Restore back to before you
<br />
installed it. Change all your sensitive passwords on all sites - email, bank, credit cards and
<br />
others. (Do not do this on the compromised computer and it would be best to do on the
<br />
phone or in-person.)<br />
<br />
You may even want to revert your system back to factory fresh to be sure their software is
<br />
not breaching your security. (Means to re-install Windows Clean - removing everything on
<br />
the drive so backup any data before hand.)<br />

No, Microsoft would not call you unsolicited. Nor would they know if any errors existed on your<br />
computer. So those are frauds or scams, to get your money or worse to steal your identity.<br />

<p><strong><br />
Do these thoroughly :</strong></p>
<p><br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />

            HI AshaRucker ... what is the make and model of your PC?
<br />Normally when a device stops working it is best to rollback the driver.
<br />So go to search and type device manager and open it.
<br />Go to your mouse\touchpad and right click and go to properties and see if you can rollback the driver.
<br />If not then try downloading the driver from your vendors site.

<br />
<br />Usually the est option is to go to the support page for your laptop on the manufacturers website, then download and install the Touchpad drive they recommend . . .
<br />
<br />If you have nay difficulty finding that page, what is the Make and exact Model No. of your laptop - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing of your laptop . .

<br />Fix touchpad problems in Windows 10
<br />
<br />If your touchpad isn’t working, it may be a result of a missing or out-of-date driver.
<br />
<br />	• On Start , search for Device Manager, and select it from the list of results. Under Mice and other pointing devices, select your touchpad, open it, select the Driver tab, and select Update Driver. If Windows doesn't find a new driver, look for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.
<br />	• If those steps didn't work, try uninstalling your touchpad driver: open Device Manager, right-click (or press and hold) the touchpad driver, and select Uninstall. Restart your device and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.
<br />	• If that didn't work, try using the generic driver that comes with Windows. Here's how: in Device Manager, right-click (or press and hold) your touchpad driver &gt; Update driver software... &gt; Browse my computer for driver software &gt; Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer, select HID compliant mouse, select Next, and follow the instructions to install it.
<br />	• If changing your driver doesn’t help, there may be a problem with the touchpad itself. Contact your PC’s manufacturer for help.
<br />

<h3> benjamin mcmillan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Phantom mouse clicks&#47;drags and resets in near center of internal display</h2>
                    <p>About an hour after a fresh boot, and 30 minutes after being away from the laptop (it didn't sleep or anything in the meantime), my mouse pointer would jump to the [near] middle of the laptop display (from my external monitor), with random events (click,
 drag, move). Trying to move the mouse would work for a few seconds until it goes back to the middle. Also, only an external bluetooth mouse would work (albeit very shortly); the touchpad wouldn't really work at all. I touched the pen to the screen a few times
 just to see if that would resolve it, but it did not. I also touched the screen with my finger, but also didn't resolve it. Only a reboot worked.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If it works you are only missing the menu item not the program.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 very slow and unresponsive since april 2017 update...</h2>
                    <p>Last night my laptop underwent an automatic windows update. This afternoon after i started my computer, everything is super slow or unresponsive. takes between 2-7 minutes to load a simple browser window or program. I am in the process of using command prompt
 to scan for errors or corruption and it took 10 minutes to load command prompt.</p>

            The only suitable tip seems to be a clean reinstall - or a roll back. Thank you again Microsoft for creating more unnecessary work for the IT sector.<br />
