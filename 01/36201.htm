<p>I just tried to have a look at their site and while there are a number of links showing in a search, none of them are working.</p>
<p>Maybe they went broke, have done a hit and run scam, or possibly were shut down due to copywrite infringment ?</p>
<p>Whatever the case, as they seem to have been 'selling' physical items the topic is not Windows related.</p>

    <title>backwards compatibility issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> warhunter007  say:</h3>
<h2>            backwards compatibility issue</h2>
                    
<p>Cannot play any backwards compatible games. My son has played dead space and doom 1 and 2 in the past on his xbox one. &nbsp;He was trying to play halo reach last week and put the disc in. &nbsp;it completely downloaded and when he goes to the menu to start playing
 the game it disconnects him from xbox live then it tells him he needs to choose an xbox live account to use. &nbsp;when he goes to sign in under his gamertag it says he cannot login under that profile and he needs to download it again. &nbsp;we have tried uninstalling
 the game and reloading it. we have tried deleting his profile and downloading it again. &nbsp;i have deleted his profile off the xbox 360 and even deleted his halo reach saved game off his 360 and it still does not work. &nbsp;Then he tried to play doom 1 and 2 and
 it does the same thing. &nbsp;He tried dead space and it is doing the same thing. &nbsp;I have tried calling xbox support but apparently they don't know what is going on. &nbsp;Not sure what is going on. I would like this issue to be resolved. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey, WarHunter007!</p>
<p>I'm sorry that your child can not play such game. Have you tried hard resetting the console? But what you need to do is download the profile and/or if you have it on the xbox 360 I would like you to enable cloud storage. Its simple To enable cloud-based
 storage, you need:</p>
<p>A current Xbox Live Gold subscription</p>
<p>At least 514 MB of space on your console</p>
<p>Now, follow these steps:</p>
<p>Go to Settings and then System.</p>
<p>Select Storage and then Cloud Saved Games.</p>
<p>Select Enable.</p>
<p>Start the game on your Xbox 360 console. When you're prompted to select a device for saving your game, choose Cloud Saved Games.</p>
<p>End your game and leave your Xbox 360 on long enough for the console to upload your saved game.</p>
<p>Start the game on your Xbox One console. You'll pick up where you left off.</p>
<p>To confirm that your saved game has synced with the cloud, follow these steps:</p>
<p>On your Xbox 360 console, go to Settings and select System.</p>
<p>Select Storage, and then select Cloud Saved Games.</p>
<p>Select your game.</p>
<p>If it says "In sync," it's available to play on Xbox One.</p>
<p>If your game hasn't synced, start the game, save your progress, and exit again.</p>
<p>If you have any problems contact me on my profile or on the forum. I would be delighted to help.</p>

<div>Old Seasonc 600 Watt Bronze, blew up on this new build (Capacitor - literally). I then bought the new Cooler Master 550 Watt. I never had any BSOD's with old Seasonic PSU's. Then again, I didn't have the system very long. Maybe a week on this new build....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have ran Memory Diagnostics and other 3rd party diagnostics. No errors found on the memory modules. Temperatures across the whole system is perfect.</div>

</div>
<div>I have ran CHKDSK R/ F/ on HDD's and SSD &gt; No error found. This is the log in event viewer:<br />

Also, is it possible that because the PSU blew up (whilst on), could it have caused permanent damage to my motherboard? I can get a replacement if so.... Just really hope this isn't the case because of down time!<br />

<div>Ok, I know I am a little late in replying but here is the link for SkyDrive minidumps!<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=a9aa7f0836b4bd5d&amp;id=A9AA7F0836B4BD5D%21113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=a9aa7f0836b4bd5d&amp;id=A9AA7F0836B4BD5D%21113</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Also, on a side note, I decided to send back my newly bought motherboard and replace it (with exactly the same). I thought this may have fixed the issue. To my horror I just whitnesed another BSOD this morning after 2 minutes in Windows...<br />
<br />
I'm so sick of these BSOD's. My Computer components are brand new other than the HDD's (2x Spinpoint F1's which I have checked for errors and found none!)<br />
<br />
REALLY need some help on this!<br />
<br />
Thanks!!</div>

Ah thank you for reviewing those minidumps so quickly! So grateful!<br />
<br />
Am glad to hear that it's (at this stage) not a hardware related issue.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am currently backing up my files and creating a restore point.<br />
<br />
<div>I will report back after the verification has completed.&nbsp; </div>

Ok I have uninstalled it and now installed "avast!" free version.<br />

What about the driver related issues? How am I supposed to isolate which drive is causing the first BSOD?

<h2>            Weird noise coming from the latest Surface Pro &#40;without fan&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does my sufrace pro (i5 256gb) make weird noises? Even though the audio is muted and no audio is playing, so it seems like it is not coming from the speakers. It should not have any moving parts in it as it is fanless so it doesn't come from the fan
 either. It is not loud, I can barely hear it but I do hear it and it is disturbing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can possibly be wrong? Is it about to break?</p>

            Hello Peeterm,

Can you describe the noise in detail, is it a squealing or high pitched noise?

<p>It sounds like distant birds/chicken. Something like old computers used to make when reading hard drive or doing some heavy processing. Isn't SSD supposed to be completely silent? So I guess i5 processor is making this noise?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I should have bought the cheaper one instead (with the mobile m3 processor).</p>

            Actually you shouldn't hear any noise like that at all. Are you sure it's not coming from the speakers? If it isn't I would bring it to a Microsoft store or call in to get it checked out. Additionally the only noise you should hear from any surface related to operation is the fan. Only the i7s have fans so I would definitely get it serviced immediately.

            Not normal. If your Surface is less than 30 days old, return for full refund and repurchase. Don't exchange online if less than 30 days to avoid getting a refurb. If you are in the US, the physical retail Microsoft Stores can help https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/  

If you are past the 30 day return Window, and outside the US or not near a store, contact support https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers

<p>That noise is very silent, I have to be in completely silent room and put my ear against the back of the Surface to hear it. Maybe you could try and check if you hear anything on your device this way.</p>

                    <p>If your event log looks like mine you have audit success followed by audit failure with this string 51a92691-66f1-280f-d0db-59fad4f73491 for both the success and the failure. The success is 5058 the failure is 5061. I used the string in using find then f3
 for find next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the success it says algorithm unknown in the failure is says algorithm RSA if that help anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use regedit and found two entries for this string. first HKEY local Machine system control set001 cryptography ngc keytranspoet key perdevicekey keytranspot key d2bf6f-------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second in still Hkey Local Machine system now in courrentcontrolset control cryptography ngc same as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if the audit goes in order than the first I would think would be the 5058 and a split second later 5061 would be the second entry.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't done anything yet as I&nbsp;always put a lot of thought when working in regedit. So I'm posting this as and idea and for discussion. I think&nbsp;deleting the second&nbsp;string would stop this and also error 131 which&nbsp;on my Acer Laptop Asprire 7741z4433 is common.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Likely someone knows more than me and can say both are needed or not. </p>

<h2>            WinHlp32.exe for x64-based versions of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Tried to get help with an Old Widows based pregram -</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Following Link opened:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/917607</p>
<p>Explaining "The Help for this program was created in Windows Help format, which was used in previous versions of Windows and it is not supported in Windows Vista."</p>
<p>
</p><p>then offered me the opportunity to down load the following fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To resolve this problem, download and install the Windows Help program (WinHlp32.exe) for your version of Windows.
</p>

etc</a></li></ul>
<p>However , as I am using Windows 10, None of these 'fixes' would install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So - My Old Windows "Help" programs still don't work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Planned obsolescence??</p>

            If it is a plan, it is a very slow plan.&nbsp; The old help system was taken out in Windows 7 (or maybe in Windows Vista) in favor of the newer ways of doing help files.&nbsp; About 6 months or so after Windows 7 was released they release the installer WinHlp32.exe
 to bring back the functionality for the programs that were still using the old help system.&nbsp; And as you can see when Windows 8/8.1 came out they updated it for those.&nbsp; Most likely they will do the same for Windows 10, but of course I wouldn't know for sure
 (just my opinion).

            I'm becoming ever more p*ss*d off with Windows 10 and Microsoft's attitude to its installed base which may have ''''legacy'''' apps going back before the new 'thrusting' developers were even gurgling in their diapers. JUST MAKE IT WORK and don't make judgments
 about how I (emphasis IIIIII) should do things. The 'bright young things' might think that it's not cool to use certain apps - BUT I AM THE CUSTOMER - just remember that!! Microsoft's appeal is declining given the newer OSs - SO DON'T BE &nbsp;ARROGANT - just do
 what we expect and you might just be significant and still there in 10 years's time.

</p><p>the old HLP system was removed starting with Windows Vista but the updates from
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/917607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MS support KB article 917607</a> restored the old HLP system but only for Vista, Win7 &amp; Win8/8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>that article was revised on 10/18/2016 to have this notice:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-----</p>
<p>The Windows Help program is not supported in Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 or later versions of Windows Server. The Windows Help program&nbsp;is available for Windows Vista, 7, 8 and 8.1 only.
<br />
<br />
Microsoft strongly recommends that software developers discontinue using the Windows Help application. Software developers who ship programs that rely on .hlp files are encouraged to transition their Help experience to an alternative Help file format, such
 as CHM, HTML, or XML. For more information see the MSDN article&nbsp;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms728460(v=vs.85).aspx. While Microsoft develops future Help technologies, we encourage
 Help authors to continue using HTML Help 1.4. HTML Help 1.4 is included in Windows versions starting with Windows 7.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like Microsoft will not be offering a fix for old HLP files for Windows 10 anytime soon.</p>

            <p>Some of the programs I use do not and will not have developers to update the programs, AND THERE ARE NOT ANY NEW PROGRAMS GIVING THE SAME FUNCTIONS. THAT IS WHY THE OLD HELP SYSTEM IS VITAL!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other very large companies have failed or had significant set-backs due to deciding what their customers should want rather than providing what they want and need. No wonder so many people avoid MS like the plague.</p>

<p>But what if the developer cannot do that or one cannot buy a new program for what reason ever?</p>

            Same here! There are a lot of important programs developed in Visual Basic 6. Mostly by myself. They are still working great&nbsp;except the Help system. And I don't have the time to adapt them to new libraries. As microsoft is still supporting the very important
 vb6 runtimes why don't they support the old help system? Backwards compatibility is the only reason for me still using windows! Otherwise i'd use linux.

<p>Hi Justine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message "Preparing to configure windows. Do not turn off your computer." usually happens when you are performing a process and it was interrupted or encountered a corruption.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the concern, we want to ask the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</li><li>What was the last thing that you were doing before the error happened?</li><li>Were you able to login on the computer before you receive the error?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            I really, really wish that I could be asked if it is convenient to lose use of my PC for the next hour, ideally with an option to defer it to a convenient time, or at least be given some indication of how long the disruption is going to take...as I type
 this, my updates are leaving me with no resource other than my tablet.&nbsp; I'm learning I need another laptop, perhaps an Apple one...

<p>Hello Ravi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my knowledge, it is not feasible to adjust idle timeout period in Skype for Business for Mac. It has some differences with Skype for Business on Windows.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it is a good feature request. I have searched in the Skype for Business UserVoice forum and found a familiar request. It is highly recommended to vote in the following link for feedback:

    <title>Windows Media Player missing from Set Program Access and Computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brandon taylor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player missing from Set Program Access and Computer Defaults</h2>
                    
<p>I recently discovered that when I tried to set a default media player, Windows Media Player was missing from "Set Default Programs." When I ran a search on this problem, I got the suggestion that I enable access to Windows Media Player with "Set Program
 Access and Computer Defaults." However, when I tried this, I found that Windows Media Player was also missing from "Set Program Access and Computer Defaults"! Now, what I'd like to know is, how do I restore Windows Media Player to the Set Program Access and
 Computer Defaults list?</p>
<p>Here's a hint: I do have full access to Windows Media Player through the Start menu.</p>

            Hi Sorofina,<br />
<br />
<br />
To help your with your concern, please answer the following questions:<br />
<br />
1. What cable are you using to connect your 2nd monitor?<br />
2. Have you tried if the monitor works with other computers/devices?<br />
3. Have you checked if the 2nd monitor is detected in the Device Manager? You can open the Device Manager by typing "Device Manager" in the search bar. You can also right-click the Start button and select Device manager. You should see your Toshiba monitor
 listed under "Monitors".<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.

<h2>            right click on desktop very slow to display menu</h2>
                    Since upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 when I right click on the desktop, it takes about 30 seconds to display the context menu. It used to display instantly before the upgrade. I get no errors, the menu displays after waiting 30-40 seconds. Also
 now can't copy/paste any more. I was really trying to like Windows 8 and 8.1, but now I'm going back to 7. A simple upgrade shouldn't require hours of troubleshooting.

<p>The following link has some info and a download to ShellExView which you can use to selectively disable third party context menu handlers to find out a problematic one:</p>

<p><u><br />

<p>You could try disabling all non-Microsoft context menu handlers and then, if the problem resolves, re-enable them one at a time to see which one was the problem</p>

<p>Hello Sue,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reason why you were not prompted to type the new password for your Wireless Connection is because the device still has the configuration of the Wireless connection. To add the new password, kindly try the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Open <strong>Control Panel</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Manage Wireless networks</strong> in the left panel</li><li>Right click on your Network name and hit <strong>Remove</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>After doing the above, click on the <em><strong>wireless</strong></em> icon on the task bar and it will search for your network name. You can then key in the new password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this work.</p>

    <title>Download Issues with Xbox One X - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Download Issues with Xbox One X</h2>
                    <p>Hey, so I recently upgraded to the Xbox One X on Black Friday, buying the Battlefield V bundle from Best Buy. However, ever since I got it, everytime I try to download a new game, I get an average download speed of 500 Kbps. I am using WiFi in my room, which
 normally gets about 15 Mbps. I've noticed that whenever the xbox is on and downloading a game, the signal on all my other devices goes to crap too. However, the second I turn off the Xbox, the signal goes back to normal again on all my other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I do get expected download speeds (15 Mbps) on my Xbox, but it's only briefly. Also, for the most part, my Xbox does not seem to have trouble updating games, and runs at good speeds for that. Like I said, I got this Xbox after I upgraded from my
 original Xbox One and I never had any of these issues with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello SeabassTheGr899</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention that other devices have issues while the xbox is on, what are those devices?&nbsp; WiFi access speeds are dependent on the type of connection (a/b/g/n/ac etc.) and the number of devices connecting to the access point.&nbsp; If you are seeing issues with
 multiple devices, it could be interference between the devices, or the access point having a hard time supporting the number of devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try separating the devices (preferably by 10 feet or more) and see if the issue gets better.&nbsp; If that is the case they are interfering with each other.&nbsp; If separation does not make it better it could be a router limitation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also try the network solution page&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/connection-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If at all possible, a wired connection is always a better choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck!</p>

<p>I'm glad you mentioned this. The Wi-Fi in my room in fact is coming from an access point. However, the only things I have connected to it are a smart tv, a laptop, my phone, and of course, my Xbox. you sound like you are on the right track because when I
 got this Xbox I also got a new 4K TV now uses Wi-Fi that the previous TV didn't. And if that's not the case, you're thinking what I'm thinking, it's a router limitation or a bandwidth issue. I'll try disabling Wi-Fi on a few devices and see if that fixes the
 issue and then I'll get back to you.</p>

<p>I would like to do this and at the moment I'm trying to figure out where the other end of the ethernet cord is to plug into one of the hubs so I can have ethernet in my room, but that's a never-ending cycle. 😂😂</p>

<p>How did you upgrade to windows 7 ultimate? </p>
<p>Many of your Microsoft drivers are the original Windows 7 drivers and not those you would expect on a Windows 7 SP1 computer!</p>
<p>I suggest you download and run Belarc Advisor and see how it comments on whether all Windows Updates are installed:<br />

            Hi Gerry Its an Advent romma 2000 I put it to a shop for the upgrade I ran Belarc Avisor and all windows updates are done, I noticed last night that i had only updated the Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller which according to Belarc is unplugged but I
 updated the&nbsp;Realtek RTL8187SE Wireless LAN PCIE Network Adapter last night and played a flash based game for 1hour 20 mins before bed with a youtube video playing in the back ground and no BSOD so im not sure if this has fixed it but I will continue to try
 it out today and post back later on today.
<div>Thank you for your help in the mean time you have learned me quite alot :) If it continues I will take it back to the shop just thought there might be a quick fix for this.</div>

                    <p>I have been using bitlocker for a while and have no issues with it - other then one.&nbsp; I only have my D drive encrypted with bit locker (C is open).&nbsp; Is there way to have windows prompt me for the unlock password after I have logged on to the laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently,
 when I click on drive D - and if locked - I will get the prompt to unlock it.&nbsp; I DON'T want to auto unlock during logon or boot - just to be prompted after logon.</p>
<p>Is this doable via a script or some policy setting?</p>

<h2>            Laptop Volume Control Not Working and Headphones Not Connecting After Update&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So ever since the update my audio has been kinda screwy. I still have volume and can generally hear things just fine, but when I try to toggle my speaker's volume it just.... doesn't work. I have the option, and the computer THINKS it's working, but there
 is literally no difference between 2 and 100%. The only thing that works is the mute function!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of that, whenever I try to connect headphones, the laptop acts like they're not even there! Speakers keep working, they don't show up in my audio devices...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 2017 Dell Inspiron 13in. laptop. Please help. While it's not like, an issue that keeps me from using my laptop's functions fully, I don't want to live like this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that your device's sound drivers may have been affected by the update. As an initial troubleshooting step, we suggest you run sound the troubleshooter on your device. To do this, select the<strong> Start</strong> button, type
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>, and then select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> from the list of results. Select
<strong>Playing Audio</strong> &gt; <strong>Run the troubleshooter. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we suggest that you update your device's sound driver. To do this<strong>,
</strong>Open <strong>Start </strong>, enter <strong>Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the list of results. Under
<strong>Sound, video and game controllers</strong>, select your sound card, open it, select the
<strong>Driver</strong> tab, and select <strong>Update Driver</strong>. If Windows doesn't find a new driver, look for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</p>
<p>

 page), that should have opened synaptics control panel general tab, at the bottom find gestures,&nbsp;turn gestures off! Worked wonders on my laptop! Hope this helps, until someone finds a better fix!</p>

<h2>            Vista detects wrong monitor</h2>
                    I have an Acer X193W lcd monitor, however Vista detects it as E151H.<br />
I have tried installing correct driver but Vists will not let me saying that the best driver is already installed.<br />
Tried deleting driver and rebooting but Vista still detects incorrect monitor.<br />
<br />
Vista sp2<br />
Nvidia Geforce 8400gs<br />

            Hello SteveW57, welcome.<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity, does having the incorrect driver present any display problems?<br />
You can try this to force a different driver:<br />
<br />
1. Click START<br />
2.&nbsp;Right click&nbsp;'Computer' and select 'Properties'<br />
3. Click 'Device Manager' at the top left<br />
4. Expand the 'Monitors' category<br />
5. Right click the Monitor shown and select 'Update Driver...'<br />
6. Choose 'Browse My Computer...'<br />
7. Choose 'Let Me Pick From&nbsp;a List...'<br />
8. Click 'Next' and then 'Have Disk...'<br />
9. Click 'Browse' and navigate to where the driver is. If the driver is just one installer .exe or .msi file let me know.<br />
<br />
Confirm any prompts that come up. Restart the computer after you install it and see if it works.

<h2>            Send file browse does not show all files in source folder</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I click the Send File icon to browse a folder and I can see only 2 of the 8 Word docs and PDF files in the folder that I am browsing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clues?</p>

<p>Figured out the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had another drive that cannot be seen in Windows Explorer that contained an old backup folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That backup folder cannot be seen in Windows Explorer but can be seen in Skype for some reason.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I was trying to find a file (that did not exist) in an old folder on a hidden drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
