<h2>            How do I remove the Bluetooth profiles in Windows 8.1 Explorer</h2>
                    <p>I'm currently running on windows 8.1. The problem with me is that there are useless "bluetooth" profile/icons in the explorer windows is pretty annoying and looks junky. I have removed the bluetooth profiles from the settings menu. I have also tried going
 to the device manager, however the profiles were no there. Went to the printers and drivers settings as well, nothing to be done there.</p>
<p>I've had this useless icons hanging onto my laptop for years. I couldn't find any answers to it, so if there's anyone who could help me get rid of the bluetooth icons from the 'unspecific' section then it'll be great.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9aa948e-03fe-4c49-a667-30d2f19eeb60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9aa948e-03fe-4c49-a667-30d2f19eeb60" /></a></p>

            Hello Sir, Thank you for your reply. However there doesn't seem any need of updating the drivers as all my drivers are up to date. And moreover I don't need the drivers for those profiles which I'm not using such as the one I pointed above on the picture.
 I badly need someone to help me with this one. It's just some bluetooth profiles that were created or paired some couple of years back. I want it gone.

            <p>I think you need to edit the registry to delete these "drives". Check here: <a href="https://www.eightforums.com/general-support/45351-windows-8-1-how-remove-shorcut-device-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>Maybe, an easier way might be just to create a new user account or just ignore them.</p>

<h2>            Status Code 807B01F7 and Trouble Upgrading </h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;We just bought an xbox about a month ago. We signed up for xbox live and got the free month gold subscription. It is set to end in two days and so I've been trying to upgrade the account to the family plan. However, when I go to do this I receive this message
 online - "This action cannot be performed at this time. Please try again later." I have tried from the console as well and gotten this message - "Can't retrieve information from xbox live. Please try again later." Status code: 807B01F7. I have tried numerous
 times over the last couple of days.</p>
<p>I spoke with a&nbsp;support rep&nbsp;who told me that it was a problem with our internet service provider and something called "TMG" - threat management gateway. I have no idea what this means and AT&amp;T said everything is fine. I checked my credit card, which&nbsp;is good.
 I checked that all of my billing info matched and was correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am at a loss. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>OK, so I did a little research and TMG doesn't seem to have anything to do with your ISP. It seems to refer to a type of firewall, specifically tied to Forefront (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/server-cloud/forefront/threat-management-gateway.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/.../threat-management-gateway.aspx</a>).
 Do you have this kind of firewall running on your network? Let me know, thanks!</p>

<p>Also, is the account you're trying to purchase it with an adult account? A child account will not be able to purchase a family pack. Another thing, log in to account.live.com with the windows live ID for the account and make sure all info is correctly filled
 in. If you don't have a birthday specified, or the windows live ID isn't verified it can cause issues. As a last resort, you can purchase a $9.99 one month sub, then call support and ask that it be changed to a family pack instead.</p>

<p>I was still getting the same error when I tried online. But after my free trial ended on the 7th, I was able to sign up through the xbox. I am not sure exactly why this worked in one location but not the other. At least we were able to sign up though. Thanks

<h2>            Can&#39;t get genuine Windows suddenly&#63;</h2>
                    I just upgraded my computer. (bought new Motherboard, CPU, Ram etc.) I kept my SSD which had my windows 10 pro installed. I suddenly can't activate windows no matter what I try. I've done the troubleshooter, looked on the microsoft website for a solution
 and haven't found anything. I bought windows 7 years ago and upgraded for free when you could do that.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What can I do to make my Windows Genuine again?

            Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends)
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this: 
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/405170...</a>
<br />
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.

            Hi, 
<br />Unfortunately, free Windows 10 upgrade is licensed to a computer not a user so cannot be transferred. 
<br />At <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12435/windows-10-upgrade-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12435/...</a> Microsoft says
<br />After you upgrade to Windows 10, you can reinstall or do a clean installation on the same device. You won't need a product key to reactivate Windows 10 on the same hardware. 
<br />
<br />After motherboard change this is not a same hardware so if you want to use Windows 10 you have to buy a new license. 
<br />If you bought Winodws 7 as a box, you still may use it..       
        </p>

<p>I don't need to upgrade. I have a genuine win 10 pro key purchased separately. I should be able to activate it again? I sure hope so.&nbsp; Spent my money on hardware upgrades and cant afford brand new windows.</p>

<p>Then you need to contact support if your Windows 10 licence key is retail.</p>

<h2>            Failure Configuring Updates, getting error code 80071A90</h2>
                    When I turn my laptop on, it starts configuring&nbsp; the updates downloaded. <br />
After 15% it shows: "failure configuring updates. reverting changes..." <br />
I tried looking for, and downloading, and installing&nbsp; the updates manually. <br />
Only one of them has worked. 7/8 updates couldn't be installed because they "weren't applicable".
<br />
Now everytime i turn the laptop on i get the same problem.<br />

            1- I purchased the laptop more than one year ago. win7 64-bit was preinstalled (lenovo thinkpad).<br />
<br />
2,3,4- my NIS expires in 751 days.<br />
I've never installed any other Norton application. <br />
A Norton Internet Security one-month trial came preinstalled.<br />
<br />
5- In the installed updates i found every single one of those updates. KB2719985, not KB2721691<br />
<br />
6- It say I have Java 7 Update 4. Lately, every time Java wanted to install an update, I got a message saying "failed to download required files" or something.<br />
<br />
7- I use Firefox<br />
<br />
8- I do not use any registry cleaners.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

            <p>1a. Had the&nbsp;30-day Norton Internet Security free-trial period <em>already expired</em> by the time you purchased your (first) Norton Internet Security subscription?</p>
<p>1b. Did you upgrade the Norton Internet Security free-trial to the paid version or did you&nbsp;(a) uninstall the Norton Internet Security free-trial AND THEN (b) download/run the Norton Removal Tool &amp; reboot (c) AND THEN do a clean install of Norton Internet
 Security?</p>
<p>2. Did you upgrade Norton Internet Security v18.x to Norton Internet Security v19.x about three weeks ago, by any chance?</p>
<p>PS: I think your Windows Update problem &amp; your updating Java problem have the same cause.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,<br />
I would suggest you to follow these steps and check if it helps.<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
If you have installed any security software, I would suggest you to temporarily disable it and then try to update and&nbsp;check if the same issue occurs. Make sure you enable it once it is done.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2:<br />
</span></span></strong><span><span>Try disabling firewall and then try to update and check if the same issue occurs, here is the link:</span><strong><br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/883825" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/883825</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>Remember to turn your firewall back on. A firewall helps protect your computer from attack by malicious users or
 by malicious software. Malicious software includes viruses that use unsolicited incoming network traffic to attack your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:<br />
</span></span></strong><span><span>Try downloading the update from the below link, install manually and&nbsp;check if it helps, here is the link:</span><strong><br />
</strong></span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=33EC8C0E-1617-46BF-BD7F-2CE750F89D7F&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=33EC8C0E-1617-46BF-BD7F-2CE750F89D7F&amp;displaylang=en</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3:<br />
</span></span></strong><span><span>If the above steps don’t help, then try performing clean boot and check if it helps, here is the link:</span><strong><br />

<p><span><span>Make sure that you put back the computer to normal startup mode once it is done.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Azam,</p>
<p>I tried the suggested steps but I am still far from succedding.</p>
<p>Method2 did not work, Method1 step 2 did not work. Now on step 1 of method 1 i had problem disabling my security programs. I use AVG anti-virus business edition and microsoft security essentials. I disabled the MSSE but couldn't disable all the security
 components of the AVG. AVG doesn't show me a way to disable the anti-virus from not running. So as result I could not install the Security Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2032276).</p>
<p>Also another thing I have to mention is that my system already shows the issues against what that security update is made for. I mean programs delaying before showing up and not responding. So I was asking myself is not also the reason why that security
 update can not be installed???</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Sainclair</p>

<p>Have you tried to temporarily uninstall AVG, install the update, and just reinstall the AVG afterwards?</p>

<p>No the NAV free-trial period was not expired by the time I installed AVG. And I did not download/run the Norton Removal Tool before I installed AVG. I simply uninstalled it from the the programs features and that's it. Do you mean they can be some conflicts
 somewhere between these two anti-viruses?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Like any new OS, Windows 10 takes some getting used to but I'm finding that Windows 10 is very solid and stable and seems to be about as fast as Windows 8.1.&nbsp;

<p>I do not know when win10 was first available for install to beta testers but I had started using it in March of 2015.</p>
<p>So with that and the free upgrade running an entire year, so around two years to test all the bugs and that seems like a long time.</p>
<p>The start button &nbsp;and clicking programs issue was corrected by installing the video drivers from the card or chip maker ( this was during beta testing ) and after microsoft was over riding with their driver installs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my opinion, win10 was not ready for prime time and needed at least three to six more months of testing.</p>
<p>Hardware driver support is one of the main issues for win10, even on fairly new systems.</p>

            I recall Using rather new Apple Computers that ran Windows 1.0 and how excited I was that the tech school was getting new IBM computers that ran Windows 1.01. I like Windows 1.0 and also Windows 1.01. There was some glitches and the one that bothered me
 the most was I could make hearts and clubs and diamonds and such appear on the screen but they would print out as xo. I never could get Random to work either in a game program that I was making. I like Windows 10 and 10 Pro.

<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it:</span><br />

<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista Recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer to put it back to Factory Settings</span></span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>Also ask them if it is possible to make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Drive failure or System Crash, when you are up and running
 again.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their own way of making Recovery Disk/s.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD (not Dell, HP, Acer, etc Recovery Disk/s).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

When viewing control panel &gt; windows firewall the firewall is on (recommended)<br />

            <p>This problem has been solved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MSE did not recognize that windows firewall was on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem was solved by running the McAfee software removal tool followed by the uninstallation and reinstallation of MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon reinstallation, I rebooted and updated the definitions.&nbsp; It did not report any issues with the Windows firewall or lack of firewall or at risk status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran a full MSE scan and it found no malware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For others that may have the MSE/firewall problem run the appropriate software removal tool followed by the uninstallation and reinstallation of MSE.&nbsp; It takes time but it worked.</p>

                    <p>Look at the followings please-<br />
1) Screen saver is NOT working. I've set it for 1 minutes timeout and while NO OTHER program is running that can possibly prevent it from going to screens aver mode, Windows is STILL FAILING!<br />
2) Power and sleep settings are failing too! I've set my display to turn off after 5 minutes of inactivity and to go to sleep after 15 minutes. NEITHER ONE WORKS!<br />
3) Screen is NOT automatically getting locked! If I leave my PC UNTOUCHED, it'll NOT get locked until I lock it manually - be it after minutes or hours or days!</p>
<p>4) Mouse setting widget is crashing. I've tested with another mice and another PC's too, IT JUST CRASHES AFTER CHANGING MOUSE POINTER SPEED!</p>
<p>

<p>Reason found causing the problem: The **** THEME SYNC for Windows 10! -_- It sync.ed all my settings from previous installation &amp; forgot to export POWER settings! And it got loaded automatically after I finished up setting my new 1803 installation so,
 was causing NO SLEEP and NO SCREENSAVER issues!</p>

<h2>            Micro SD card not readable anywhere</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, I have a 128GB Micro SD card that when I insert it into my phone, nothing shows up and the phone says it is not mounted. Then I tried inserting it into my computer with a micro SD adapter (Windows 10 Acer Aspire XC-704) and still nothing shows
 up. I then went over to my 3DS to find that it "cannot display the software on the SD card. The SD card could not be accessed". I tried this with other adapters as well, but no luck.</p>
<p>Any ideas why this could've happened? Is there a problem with my Micro SD card?</p>

<p>This is common as a lot of devices can't see cards about 32 some up to 64 check the specs on your systems to see what it will handle. Here is some info I found by searching your issue:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(120, 120, 120, 1)">basically the original SD card standard supported cards up to 2GB. Then came SDHC which extended the capacity to 32GB
 and then more recently the SDXC standard was released to boost the capacity to 2TB. All the standards are backwards compatible, which means that a device with a SDXC support&nbsp;can use all three types of SD card, but a device with a SDHC support&nbsp;can only read
 SDHC and SD, but not SDXC.</span></p>

<h2>            Problems with payment methods &#40;Paypal&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello! I'm having issues to purchase items from xbox marketplace since the end of June. Didn't matter if I used my Visa CC or my Paypal Account, both of them got stuck after the first purchase.</p>
<p>This kinda got sorted out after contacting xbox support several times.</p>

<p>Now my problem is: I removed my paypal account from my payment options and I can't add it again.</p>
<p>I can add/remove it whenever I want on my secondary account and it still runs fine (without getting blocked or anything like this).</p>
<p>I've also tried adding a prepaid card to my secondary account, which went fine, but when entering the same card on my first account I get an error.</p>

<p><strong>What type of payment method are you trying to add? </strong>Paypal<br />
<strong>What error code or message are you receiving? </strong>"The&nbsp;reward method you chose&nbsp;is&nbsp;not authorized.&nbsp;Please use another reward method&nbsp;to&nbsp;request your cashback reward.&nbsp;If you get&nbsp;this&nbsp;message multiple times,contact customer support.&nbsp;Message 8017."<br />
<strong>What region is your account set to? </strong>United States<br />
<strong>What region do you physically connect from? </strong>Brazil<br />
<strong>What region is your payment method's billing address in? </strong>Brazil</p>

<p>I'm sure it's not related to my physical region, as I've been using the same info and stuff on both accounts since 2010 and the problem only occurs on this one.</p>
<p>I've been trying for months to get this sorted out but I couldn't.</p>
<p>PS: I migrated from Brazil region to U.S. region in the end of 2012 and I think that's is why I'm getting this strange issues, as I have already found on internet people with the same problem as mine. (My secondary account is native from U.S region and doesn't
 suffer from this).</p>

<p>Hey there reckless,<br />
<br />
Really sorry to hear you've been having issues with your payment options.<br />
<br />
From what you've described it sounds like you might be getting a lock placed on your billing because it is happening on a US account using a Brazilian IP and billing information. We always recommend having your account location and physical location match so
 that you don't run into billing and marketplace issues such as this one. <br />
<br />
You would really want to follow-up with <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Phone Support</a> on this one. I don't mean to just send you back but they would be best equipped to help work with you to get things sorted out with your account. You may want to mention the multiple accounts and your region mismatches to better understand
 why the issue may be occurring in the first place.</p>

<h2>            Weekly Windows update&#47;patch received 4&#47;14&#47;16</h2>
                    I received the weekly patch update for Windows 4/14/16 &amp; elected to take all except for one which I hid.. I tried several times yesterday to do the install but gave up after letting it run for a couple of hours HUH what's with that.. I started the download
 again at 3am this morning &amp; eliminated the optional's to relieve some of the issues (I thought) but now its 7am &amp; its still running with 0% complete.. WTH is the matter now.. I have turned off all of my Chrome extensions thinking that was the issue but nothing,
 nadda, zip so color me "disgusted"... &nbsp;Running Win7Pro on a laptop

<p>I just turned off all of my Chrome extensions not sure that's the issue because I had a Windows update a week ago &amp; no problems with that.. I think I'm going to skip this W-update &amp; wait Looking forward to buying Apple products... I keep a very clean pc

<p>Ok I went on the M/Soft Windows website &amp; to the Update problems page &amp; found the Update Troubleshooter link there also so did another try at a download from there &amp; it worked.. It cited some issues that they fixed &amp; some they ignored, so then I did a restart
 &amp; went to Windows update page on my PC &amp; saw they changed the update list &amp; once I read thru all of them to make sure none had to do with Win10 free upgrade I started the install of them.. Hopefully all is well .. Thank you again for your assistance..&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ran the troubleshooter twice &amp; still cannot download/install 'any' of the updates critical or optional.. According to some that are leaving comments on the M/soft Facebook page I am not alone with this issue IMO they have the Win10 updates either confused
 with Win7 end users OR they are hiding Win10 upgrade behind false updates.. I have a GWX Control Panel Monitor on my desktop because I know M/soft was sliding the Win10 upgrade in without users knowing it but the GWX will alert me.. Disgusted with M/soft as
 many others are now more than ever especially those end users that have Win10</p>

<p>ok what has that got to do with my problem of not being able to download updates? stop ignoring the question or problem &amp; not sure why I cannot post to the other link there is no duplication that is just a distraction from the issues.. fix the problem its
 on your side not mine.. &nbsp;FWIW I use Chrome browser &amp; running Win7Pro, using Webroot &amp; NEVER NEVER NEVER had any update download issues until this week &amp; I hid KB2952664 &amp; hid it months ago since I don't want Win10.. If you ck the FB page for Microsoft you
 will see other end users over the top angry with this problem.. Sent a tweet to Bill Gates about it&nbsp;</p>

    <title>PAL Original XBox game on NTSC Xbox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            PAL Original XBox game on NTSC Xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
I recently received a copy of FIFA '06 (one of my all time favorites) from a friend. I found out that the game is from Europe and is a PAL copy. To my knowledge there is no region restriction on this game, but I have heard that there is incompatibility between
 PAL games and NTSC consoles. Will this game work on my XBox 360 or will I have to find an NTSC copy?</p>

<p>The following are the ports (&amp; what type) you need to open for Xbox Live, not just the one above.</p>
<p>Port 88 (UDP) </p>
<p>Port 3074 (UDP and TCP) </p>
<p>Port 53 (UDP and TCP) </p>
<p>Port 80 (TCP) </p>
<p>Port 500 (UDP)</p>
<p>Port 3544 (UDP)</p>
<p>Port 4500 (UDP)</p>
<p>I was doing research for intermittent issues with GTA Online due to trouble not being able to open more than 8 ports on my Comcast Technicolor, so I broke out my old Belkin. The following are additional ports (&amp; types) that need to be opened for GTA Online
 and do not need to be added unless you're playing GTA Online:</p>
<p>TCP Ports: 80, 443</p>
<p>UDP Ports: 6672, 61455, 61457, 61456, and 61458</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Devices and Printers on Control Panel</h2>
                    When I click devices and printers inside control panel, it won't show the devices and printers. It's just a blank page and the green bar on top just keeps on rolling.&nbsp; Also the Safely remove icon on the task bar doesn't show the devices.&nbsp; It just says
 open devices and printers instead of showing the devices that are removable.

<span>Hi tsikinini,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>How long have you been experiencing this
 problem?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes to the
 computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are you using a laptop or a Desktop?</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If it’s a laptop, I would suggest you to follow Method 1. If not, then follow Method 2.</span></p>

 click on services.msc and then<span>&nbsp;</span>click “</span></strong><strong><span>Run as an Administrator</span></strong><strong><span>”</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><span><strong><span>Locate</span></strong><strong><span>Bluetooth
 service </span></strong><strong><span>and check if the service is started.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Method 2:</span></p>

<p><span><span>May we know what Skype app you are using when making a call is it the preinstalled Skype for Windows 10 or the classic Skype version (desktop)?
</span></span><span><span>Does it happen to all of your contacts or to just one contact only?
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We suggest to you to uninstall and reinstall the Skype application. If you are using the Skype for Windows 10, install the app from Windows
 store. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We look forward to your response.

    <title>Changed password on microsoft account, but Remote Desktop not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wotmate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changed password on microsoft account, but Remote Desktop not accepting ANY password</h2>
                    <p>So I have multiple devices on the same microsoft account.&nbsp; Because of the location of my media server, I usually log in to it via Remote Desktop from my main PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since changing the password on my microsoft account, and going through the 5 devices that use the same account and putting the new password in, the media server doesn't accept the new password via Remote Desktop.&nbsp; Or the old one.&nbsp; I've searched multiple
 fixes, and nothing seems to work, and I'm now considering a format and re-install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any fixes for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of the PC's (media server and main PC) and my surface go are running full windows 10 pro (no S mode).&nbsp; This has been working flawlessly since I set it up a year ago, and it is only the password change that has caused problems.</p>

<h2>            How to re-check my window 7 pc for eligibility to upgrade to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have an old duo core windows 7 pc ready to install windows 10. Microsoft check my computer and said that because of my video card was too old, it cannot be upgraded. Since then, I have removed that card and used the integrated video. But the windows 10
 installation still said my video card (which no longer installed in the computer) prevent the installation of windows 10. I went to the menu and clicked on check my computer. However it doesn't check my computer again in the new configuration. Instead it displayed
 the same message. Listing the old video card and therefore unable to install windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help? Thanks</p>

</p><p>To remain "free" Windows 10 installation&nbsp; and setup must be launched from within Windows 8.1, or Windows 7 SP1.&nbsp; If you right-click on any downloaded .iso file you might see an option to "Mount" the .iso file.&nbsp; If you take that option you will have instant
 access to the Windows 10 Setup.exe.&nbsp; You just need to right-click on that and take the "Run as Administrator" option to start installing Windows 10 (for free).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you don't see the "Mount" option then it might be necessary to make sure .iso files are opened with Explorer via&nbsp; Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Default Programs\ Associate a file type or protocol with a program.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Alternatively you can convert an .iso to a botable USB or DVD and launch Setup via that but still be within Windows 8.1, or Windows 7 SP1, if you want it for "free".</p>

            <p>Thank you for your knowledgeable and generous advice. I was nor savvy enough to get the command prompt dialog and manually re-check my computer. However either due to my fiddling of the Windows 10 invitation or Microsoft on its own did re-check my computer
 today. Without the graphic card, which must be old, that I removed, my computer was good for Windows 10. So I got the upgrade. Seems to be working fine. Thanks again for your help.</p>

<h2>            Task Scheduler will not save newly created task</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have around 30 "public use" PCs running Win 10 here at our library, and for statistical purposes, I'm trying to create a task that will log the current user off after 30 minutes of inactivity so that our asset management software can pick up on how many
 people use any given computer on any given day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found an example of a decent solution online, but when I follow the steps to create the task, then get to the end, I get the "you don't have permission to do that!" wrist slap. There are both administrator and standard user accounts on the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I create the task logged in as the admin account, the task saves fine. Problem is, when I log back in as the standard user (the default login for these machines), the task does not appear in the list of tasks. When I create the task while logged in
 as the standard user, I get the error, even if I select the admin account as the "author".</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get around this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thx,</p>
<p>Steve</p>

            <p>You would go to Intel.</p>
<p>Support (or lack thereof) of any hardware you connect to your computer running any operating system actually comes from (or doesn't) the manufacturer of said physical device - not the makers of the operating system(s) in question.</p>
<p><a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/default.aspx?iid=gg_support-EN_01+home_downloadctr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Intel's Driver web page</a></p>
<p>What is the specific motherboard manufacturer/model?</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">32-bit or 64-bit Windows 7</a>?</p>
<p>Although - truthfully - looks like you are out of luck.&nbsp; The manufacturer (Intel) just may not support it in that operating system.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;DwnldID=18576&amp;ProdId=1044&amp;lang=eng&amp;OSVersion=Windows%207%2C%2032-bit*&amp;DownloadType=Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">32-bit WIndows 7 support for the 865G chipset</a>
</li><li><a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;DwnldID=18576&amp;lang=eng&amp;OSVersion=Windows%207%2C%2064-bit*&amp;DownloadType=Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">64-bit Windows 7 support for the 865G chipset</a></li></ul>
<p><br />
I suggest you use the <a href="http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-009482.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Identifying your Intel® graphics controller</strong></a>&nbsp;page to verify what you have.</p>
<p>However, please take note:</p>
<p><strong>Will Intel release newer XPDM drivers for older graphics controllers?</strong><br />
Intel has no plans to release new XPDM drivers for the following older Intel graphics controllers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile Intel® 915GM/GMS, 910GML Express Chipset family </li><li>Intel® 82915G/82910GL Express Chipset family </li><li>Intel® 82865G Graphics Controller </li><li>Intel® 82852/82855 Graphics Controller </li><li>Intel® 82845G Graphics Controller </li><li>Intel® 82830M Graphics Controller </li><li>Intel® 82815 Graphics Controller </li><li>Intel® 82810 Graphics Controller </li></ul>
<p><br />
So, again, you may be out of luck in attempting to run a newer Windows OS (Windows 7) on a system with that video chipset without just purchasing a different video card and putting it in the system if possible.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>1. Were you able to preview before using DVD maker without any issue?
</p>
<p>2. What is the exact error message you get?
</p>
<p>3. Does this happen for all file types?
</p>
<p>4. Does this happen for the Sample Videos?
</p>
<p>a. You can access the sample videos by going to Start, click Computer, and then click the Videos section under Libraries.
</p>
<p>b. Try with a different DVD and check if you can preview the contents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to refer to this article and check if that helps.</p>
