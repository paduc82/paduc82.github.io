<h2>            Family settings for separated parents</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded to windows 10, and in order for my son's account to move on to windows 10 family settings, it prompted me to send him an invitation to my "family" (which he was already part of when it was Windows 8). However, it made him leave the family
 connection he has with his father before it would let him join my family. We are separated, and so my son has access to PCs at both my home and his father's home. However, it seems that Windows 10 will only let him be part of one Family. My son has moved to
 my family now, however does this mean that now the family safety settings will not apply at his father's house?</p>
<p>
Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Zombiclone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your son can only be in one family at a time.&nbsp; However, any parental controls you&nbsp;set up on his account, will apply any time he signs in using his Microsoft account.&nbsp; So as long as he's signing in with the same Microsoft account&nbsp;at his father's house, the
 same settings will apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(This only applies to Windows 10, since Windows 7/Windows 8.1 are considered "local accounts" on the website and are not tied to his Microsoft account.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

            Hi How,
<br />
<br />If you are viewing photos in file explorer that are stored on your PC and not on OneDrive, this should work:
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer 
<br />
<br />Navigate to a folder with jpg files 
<br />
<br />On the View Ribbon (tab), cheese large, medium or small icons 
<br />
<br />Then click the Options button at the end of the View Tibbon 
<br />
<br />On the View Tab on the resulting dialog, uncheck 'Always show icons, never Thumbnails' 
<br />
<br />Then click 'Apply to folders' and confirm that 
<br />
<br />Click Apply and OK       
        </p>

<p>I've done all that you suggested many, many times and I still cannot see thumbnails - just an icon. I understand this is a "default behavior" in Windows 10. I just upgraded the latest Windows 10 update and now, not only do I still have icons instead of thumbnails,
 my mail program - IncrediMail will not authorize my default account. I just don't understand why Microsoft encourages to update and not realize that one size fits all does not apply.</p>

    <title>Missing Game with Gold - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wolf610  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Game with Gold</h2>
                    
<p>So back in October a topic came up about missing games with gold that were downloaded via xbox.com prior to purchasing an Xbox One. I posted at the time that I had 3 games missing, since a few months have passed 2 of them have become available but I'm still
 missing Rayman Legends.</p>
<p>I know I downloaded it when it was available, but it still won't give me any option other than buy. The fact that So Many Me and Halo: Spartan **** appeared after a while tells me this is some sort of glitch, any help?</p>

<p>You said you were looking in the Store to see what their game pages say, but have you looked under Ready to Install on the console? If not, go to My Games &amp; Apps and scroll to the far right and wait there until the grey area that says "Get more content in the Store" (or similar wording) is replaced by a list with the title "Ready to Install". Do you see Rayman Legends in that list?</p>

<p>Yes, I already looked under ready to install under the console, it's not there. It's showing as never purchased even though I know I did. Like I said in the original post, I've had this issue with several other games with gold that I got using xbox.com.
</p>
<p>The best example would be So Many Me, it was the gold game back in July, but it didn't show up in my Ready to install until October, and even shows a purchased date of 10/7/15, even though I got it as a games with gold back in July. It seriously just decided
 that I did own it when I turned my console on that day and started the download.</p>

            This AMD's utility for flashing its video cards. Its currently not compatible with the latest version of Windows 10. Your best option is to rollback to your previous version if you need it.
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Are you having this problem even with the Windows generic graphics drivers <br />
installed ? They normally install when you re-boot after uninstalling the ATI <br />
drivers.<br />
Have you plugged both PCI-e power cables into the card ?<br />
<br />
That' a different definition of a working cable than I would use.<br />
Have you tried using a DVI or another HDMI cable ?<br />
Are you using the HDMI for sound ? If not DVI is more reliable<br />
and produces the same quality image.<br />
<br />
You could also try using another PCI-e slot on the MOBO.<br />
If you have another card you could try that to verify the rest of the system is<br />
OK, or maybe you can try your card in a friends machine.<br />
<br />
Failing the above and assuming you have the correct drivers, the drivers are installed correctly and the psu is delivering full power you may need to consider doing an RMA&nbsp; on the card.<br />

I'm pretty sure the graphics card only fits on the top slot

            I just looked at your MOBO and yes it does only have one PCI-e x16 slot, but<br />
I also noticed it has Integrated Graphics, so maybe that has something to do<br />
with your problem.<br />
[<span style="font-style: italic">A report from Driver View may still help determine if there is a conflict with other drivers. -oops</span>]<br />
<br />
The dmp report say the graphics driver is involved and the crash type is a TDR. <br />
If the TDR were happening in circumstances where the machine was running well<br />
and playing games generally well then there could be many possibilities regardless<br />
of the TDR blaming the graphics drivers. This is because the graphics drivers are<br />
running when a game crashes, so there are very often other causes. <br />
Sometimes it is an inadequate psu, or overheating. It can also be a software conflict, or even using too high graphics settings in the game,
<br />
but as the machine will not boot when the graphics drivers are installed this to me&nbsp; indicates the card is probably&nbsp; faulting.<br />
The machine will boot when no drivers are installed because the card is not really running. The video signal is only passing through it.<br />
If you can test with another card that would help verify.<br />

Are you sure? It gives the driver versions which can be checked to see whether they are the latest version but conflicts I think not?</p>

<h2>            Changing Windows Setting Security on root folder returns access is denied for some sub-folders.</h2>
                    <div>
<div>Hi,<br />
<br />
Changing setting Security on root folder returns access is denied for some sub-folders.<br />
<br />
I have an external HHD assigned with 'G' driver letter under my Computer. I have removed 'everyone' from the 'Groups and user names' on the root folder by choosing 'security tab' from the property options of root folder for that HDD, and while applying changes,
 'access is 'denied' was shown to me for some subfolders, although whenI added 'everyone' on that root drive folder, I have added 'everyone' in the Group or user names by choosing 'security tab' from the property options of root folder for that HDD, and I've
 taken ownership as ''administrators" under the current owner for that root folder. While applying new settings of removing 'everyone', whenever I have faced 'access is denied', I have clicked on 'continue'. Then, I ended up with no one taken access to this
 root folder. <br />
<br />
<br />
These some screen shots show the subfolders I have faced 'access is denied' with.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
My questions are:<br />
<strong>First::</strong> Why have I encountered 'access is denied' on some sub-folders, although they are personal data, and NOT System files?
<br />
<br />
<strong>Seoncd</strong>: Imagine I have faced far too many error messages (i.e a loop of ) 'access is denied', then how to manage this to arrive at the end. Since 'clicking on 'continue' separately would be not acceptible. There is no apply this settings of
 all.<br />
<br />
<strong>Finally:</strong> If my main folder have many subfolders inside it, then going through 'security tab' on each of them would be absolute nonesnese. So, If I want to only go to 'secuirty tab' on
<strong>the root folder</strong>, and add settings needed, then let the settings be applied on all the subfolders, and files inside main folder without going through all subfolders, and files, and apply the settings separately.

<p>
</p><p><strong>It seems that I messed the Windows security permission, and I couldn't undo the changes done to what it were</strong>.</p>
<p>I have another external hard disk driver cloned&nbsp; from the same hard disk having a problem permissions&nbsp; before happening the problem. However, when opening the cloned HDD, I found no Windows security permissions with it,&nbsp; 'everyone' is assigned as ownership
 of the&nbsp; root driver, and&nbsp; 'Administrators' is taken as the currnet owner.</p>

                    <p>I am using win7. 3 questions regarding windows media player:</p>

</p>
<p>(2) also when I go to the related site  see url below- none of the hyperlinks for individual stores work. &nbsp;Can anyone explain?<a href="http://onlinestores.metaservices.microsoft.com/serviceswitching/bas/BrowseAllServicesWMP10-1033.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onlinestores.metaservices.microsoft.com/serviceswitching/bas/BrowseAllServicesWMP10-1033.html</a></p>
<p>(3) I could not find window media player as a program when I looked for it under control panel- program and features. Why is that?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key is unavailability of the services in some countries like UK, India etc.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the following steps ( close windows media player before proceeding ) :</div>
<div>
<p><span>1. Click Start button, type intl.cpl in the Start Search box and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the Location tab, and then in the Current location list, click the location that corresponds to the region.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click OK. </span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: change the location to somewhere near US like </span><span>Canada</span><span> etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Then start Windows media player. you'll find an option at the bottom called media guide. There choose 'browse all online stores' and youull get what you want</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>As far as uninstalling Windows Media Player 12, you cannot since it is integrated into Windows 7. You can, however, disable it through Windows Features. You can
 find it under Media Features:</span></span></p>

            <p><span>Hello Mostafa,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing </span><span>with the "ESC key" of the keyboard
</span><span>and I appreciate your efforts taken to resolve the issue. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue can be caused due to hardware corruption or </span><span>driver corruption.
</span><span><span>Lets try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To narrow down &amp; resolve the&nbsp;"Esc key"&nbsp;problem, you can try the following steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Check the issue using <span>On-Screen keyboard.</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1. Press <strong>Windows Key + R. Run window opens.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>2. <span>Type <strong>OSK </strong>in the open box </span>and press
<strong>Enter.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3. <strong>On-Screen keyboard</strong> opens. Check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><strong>If the issue doesnt persist, then </strong></span><strong>check all the keys of the keyboard</strong>, check if there is any key
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>left pressed, damaged or have dust&nbsp;in it.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>If all the keys are fine, then try to use </strong></span><span><strong>the different keyboard</strong> and check if it works fine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>If the issue still persists with the different keyboard</strong>, then f</span><span>ollow the steps mentioned below in the Microsoft article and check if it helps:</span></p>

            Thanks for your reply. I used the OSK.exe in the past and still today here the "Esc" button works. The problem is when I play any game this virtual Keyboard by OSK do not appear in the screen during the game. So it is very difficult for me to continue
 with the game. In the past as I used both clean boot and kbdclass(regedit) update then for the time being the Esc button worked. I also checked there is no dust inside or under my Laptop's keys. I do not know what to do.&nbsp;

<h2>            Local account does not reflect after being created</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to set up a new local user account missing windows 10 that I upgraded from Windows 7 yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp; I created&nbsp;a new local&nbsp;user name, password and password hint.&nbsp; When I log out of the&nbsp;Windows 10 admin account, the new local user account does not
 show up for me to log into.&nbsp; When I try to add&nbsp;it a second time from my&nbsp;windows 10 administrator account,&nbsp;the&nbsp;account management interface software tells me&nbsp;that the account already exists and that I should&nbsp;create a second local account with a different name.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again
 that&nbsp;account does not show up.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new local user account does not show up in the /Users folder either.&nbsp; How do I fix this problem with Windows 10.&nbsp; The local accounts on the 3 other computers that I have upgraded to Windows 10 (all using the same windows
 10 administration account), do not have this problem.&nbsp; I can log into those administrator accounts with either my password or my pin.&nbsp; The same is true for this latest upgrade. Why doesn't the local user account show up on this computer that I upgraded from
 Windows 7?&nbsp; The other 3 computers were upgraded from Windows 8.1&nbsp; Is there a method to delete a local user account from windows 10, without going through the settings menu and even though it does not show up in the /users folder?&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 on multiple devices</h2>
                    &nbsp;My laptop came with Windows Vista when I bought it 4 years ago. I used my Gran's Windows 7 disc to reinstall the OS, &nbsp;using the same product key she used to activate her computer. We have both reserved a copy of Windows 10. Can we both install and activate
 it, or will whoever installs it last have to pay for a new product key?

<p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It could be the Windows Backup trying to back up files in the LocalLow, Contacts, and Searches folders or these folders are not present on your device. In order to prevent backup from failing, you can use one of the following methods to eliminate this error
 message during future backup operations:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:<br />
Create the missing folder <strong>C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\new</strong>, as listed in the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2:<br />
Exclude the folders from the files to back up in the Backup settings, and then include those folders in their original location. To exclude the folders in the Additional Locations and to include those folders in the original location, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Under the <strong>Control Panel</strong>, open <strong>Backup and Restore</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Backup</strong> section, click <strong>Change settings</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Set up backup </strong>dialog box, click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>What do you want to back up</strong> dialog box, click <strong>
Let me choose</strong> then click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Expand<strong> Data Files</strong>, expand &lt;var&gt;&lt;<strong>your user name</strong>&gt;&lt;/var&gt;<strong>Libraries</strong>, expand
<strong>Additional Locations</strong>, and then click to clear the <strong>AppData folder</strong>,
<strong>Contacts</strong>, and <strong>Searches</strong> check boxes.</li><li>Expand <strong>Computer</strong>, expand the item for your system drive (for example, expand
<strong>Local Disk (C:)</strong>), expand <strong>Users</strong>, expand &lt;var&gt;&lt;<strong>your user name</strong>&gt;&lt;/var&gt;, and then click to select the
<strong>AppData,Contacts</strong>, and <strong>Searches </strong>check boxes if they exist.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>, and then click<strong> Save settings and exit</strong>.</li><li>In Backup and Restore, click <strong>Back up now</strong> to perform a new backup. The backup operation should complete without errors.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes and feel free to get back to us if you need further assistance.</p>

            One of the security issues that's popping up with a lot of Windows machines lately is when your machine gets botted, then turned into a Botnet server relay.&nbsp; If your machine keeps waking up even after putting it manually into sleep-mode then it's possible
 you have a rootkit virus which has installed itself and is using your machine as a relay server.&nbsp; This is achieved by creating a hidden Bit-Torrent installation on your machine.&nbsp; If disconnecting your network cable, or disabling your wireless connection eliminates
 the waking up problem then you may have a botted Windows PC.&nbsp;

<p>Hello Bionic!</p>
<p>No, uninstalling and reinstalling the game wont make him lose his in game content. All of that is stored directly to the cloud as long as the Xbox One is connected to the internet. That being said I would recommend
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to restart or power cycle your Xbox One console</a>&nbsp;before the removal and reinstallation but either way his content is safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<h2>            Connection to internet only on some websites - all computers and internet devices</h2>
                    
<p>I am able to connect to a few websites, but not others. For example, I can connect to speedtest.net, microsoft.com or google.com, but not lifehacker.com, youtube.com or yahoo.com. The majority of sites will<em>not
</em>connect, but I&nbsp;simply get an error message saying the site is not available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have three computers running Windows 7 and two iPod Touches. They all have the same issue, and it happens both on wired and wireless connections. Using IE8, Chrome, Firefox or Safari also makes no difference. The strange part is that I can connect with
 no problem if I use Hotspot Shield, although I obviously cannot do this with an iPod. I have tried tweaking my router (D-Link 655) to no avail, so far, as well as my OpenDNS settings and Windows firewall. What to do? It's extremely maddening.</p>

<p><span>Hey ntwiebe,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Your ability to access those websites using HotSpot shield would indicate that those websites are being blocked either by your firewall or your ISP
 provider.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Please see if you can access those websites in safe mode with networking. Note that you cannot access internet with wireless connection in this
 mode. As such you enable wired connection for test purpose. Refer the links given below for help.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>Note that you come out of safe mode with networking mode&nbsp;by restarting the computer once youre done with the testing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2. Also, it would be a good idea to get in touch with your ISP provider to check if they have disabled those websites.</span></p>
