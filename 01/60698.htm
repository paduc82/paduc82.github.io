<h2>            Blocking Websites and hiding IP address.</h2>
                    Two questions.<br />
<br />
I have a son on my account that has hit his teenage years. <br />
<br />
1) I have found a few websites family saftey does not block that i want to block. However, when I click on it to block it, i get the following message. "When trying to block a website for a child, i am getting the following message "Sorry, you can't change
 your settings right now. Please try again later." I have tried multiple browsers and multiple times. No luck. I have gotten this message on multiple site i have tried to block. any help?<br />
<br />
2) My son is looking around trying to find multiple places that hides his IP address. This worries me. When he hides his IP address, does that mean family safety would not work (note, the site i am trying to block in 1 above is a site that does this that family
 safety does not block).

            <p>Hi mjhopler,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I understand that you are unable to block some websites and that your son is trying to hide his IP address.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to verify, are the websites (that your child is accessing) proxy sites? This kind of website has the ability to bypass blocked websites. We recommend you to block these sites but since you are receiving an error message when doing so, we would like
 to gather some additional information:</p>
<ul>
<li>To clarify, are you receiving the same error message when you are trying to block any website? (Not just the proxy websites)</li><li>If in case the issue doesn't happen on other websites that you are trying to block, can you please provide us the sites where you encountered the error message?</li><li>Are you receiving other errors when trying to save other settings aside from the web filtering settings?</li><li>If in case you have multiple child accounts configured, does the issue happen to the other accounts?</li></ul>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Guys,</p>
<p>Just a quick question, I'm taking advantage of the price reduction and downloading Tbogt, tried twice but unable to find it in game library. Do I need a copy of GTA-IV to play it? I thought it was a stand alone game.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>The Episodes from Liberty City disc is probably about Â£15 now, but it would be cheaper still if you know what you're doing on eBay bidding-wise. I would recommend the disc because then you get both DLCs. I really enjoyed The Lost and Damned, even with the
 gloomy atmosphere of Johnny Klebitz and the rest of the gang. The story was quite interesting because I think it's the first time anti-Semitism has been explored in the game (the primary antagonist is anti-Semitic, and your character during the DLC is Jewish).
 The Ballad is much more akin to San Andreas though I recommend the disc as being the way to go.</p>

            Okay, I had it happen again this evening.&nbsp; Now, I did some research and it said that there should be no Program Manager in Windows
<span>and it was the shell of <strong>Windows</strong> 3.x and <strong>
Windows</strong> NT 3.x operating systems.&nbsp; Basically it said it should not show up, but since it has that is an issue.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be very helpful.</span><br />

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to confirm, can you please perform the following steps so that we can verify Miracast really is supported on your device:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R&nbsp;</strong>and then type &nbsp;<strong>dxdiag</strong>and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Save all Information&nbsp;</strong>button and save the text file to your desired location.</li><li>Open the text file and look for <strong>Miracast</strong>. Beside it is the current availability status.</li></ul>

</p><p>Thank you for this information. Follow the steps listed below to connect your device:</p>
<ol>
<li>If your TV doesn't come with a built-in Miracast support, connect the external adapter into the HDMI port of your TV and power it on.<br />
</li><li>On your PC, open <strong>Settings </strong>and tap<strong> Devices.</strong></li><li>Under <strong>Connected Devices </strong>select <strong>Add a device.</strong></li><li>You can connect it by opening the<strong> Action Center (Windows key + A) </strong>
and select <strong>Connect</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If you are still unable to connect, try restarting your PC and the display/adapter. You can also remove the device completely and adding it once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, be sure to update your display and network adapter drivers . Else, you may want to consider using a
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/adapters/wireless-display-adapter-2/p3q-00001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><strong><em>do i need an adapter </em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you connect to the Internet?&nbsp; FWIW I normally use a wired connection but have found that&nbsp;Miracast works better if I have my Wi-Fi adapter enabled though it is not clear to me how it works.&nbsp; E.g.&nbsp; in&nbsp;
<strong>netsh wlan sh ne</strong>&nbsp; it seems that there are connections being used which could be related to it somehow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly in Control Panel's Network and Sharing Center I see Local Area Connections which involve "private networks" that start with DIRECT-.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 YMMV.</p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. Since you already uninstalled the graphics driver, we recommended checking the article posted by

<h2>            Getting blue screen error caused by display driver igfx</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:display driver igfx</p>
<p>My Toshiba Satellite L305-S5907 all of a sudden started doing all kinds of crazy stuff, the screen was all distorted and it was flashing and then it would crash.&nbsp; Then I would receive a msg stating that the screen was experiencing a display driver igfx problem
 and had been recovered.&nbsp; This happened about 5 times and I was trying to see if I could get some info on the help and support page and then the screen went black.&nbsp; Now my laptop refuses to open up at all.&nbsp; I have pressed the 0 button and held it down and then
 went through that recovery process and it will get so far and then a blue error screen appears and says it has shut down in order to not damage my laptop.&nbsp; That is as far as I can get and it won't let me on my computer to get to the control panel or to download
 any updates.&nbsp; How can I get back onto to my laptop to download any updates?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Since you are receiving a bluescree and unable to boot in normal mode, you can try booting from Windows Vista full version installation disc and perform a startup repair.
</span></p>
<p><span>If startup repair fails, then try a System restore booting from the installation disc.</span></p>
<p><span>For further information, you can refer to the following articles:</span></p>

    <title>Windows 8 Microsoft account password sync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> severin poå¡ta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Microsoft account password sync</h2>
                    <p>Let us have two computers running Windows 8 connected to internet, both with the same Microsoft account. Suppose Microsoft account password is changed on one of them. Is the second one supposed to automatically sync, so that user is able to log in using
 this new, changed password?</p>
<p>If not, where is the setting for this sync to happen?</p>
<p>Thanks, S.</p>

<font color="#0072c6">Praseetha</font></a>,</p>
<p>thank you for your reply. It's good to know how it SHOULD work. I expect the second computer should automatically sync after few moments, say several minutes (or sync should proceed maybe at the moment of login).</p>
<p>However, I have different experience. The second computer does not sync even after several days, and at the moment of login I still have to use old Microsoft account password.</p>
<p>Both are running Windows 8. Both have "Sync your settings" option turned On, and all "Settings to Sync" switches (Personalize, Desktop, Passwords, Ease of Access, Language, App settings, Browser, Other settings) are turned On.</p>
<p>What are the troubleshooting steps to undertake to resolve this issue?</p>

<p>well, using the new password, I receive only standard error message "The logon attempt failed." One important thing I forgot to mention is that I login to the second machine using Remote desktop.</p>
<p>(When I login locally to the second machine with this new password, I succeed, password is immediatelly synced and from that moment I can login also via Remote desktop with this new password.)</p>

<h2>            OneNote dictate not showing</h2>
                    <p>I got a laptop for my son to use the inbuilt Windows 10 OneNote and want to use the Dictate feature.&nbsp; It works fine on my profile on the same machine, but when I switch to my son's (child) profile the dictate button momentarily appears and then disappears
 again permanently.&nbsp; I tried a test where I changed his profile to an admin one but the Dictate still does not show up.</p>

We have a situation where 3 companies (companies A, B, and C) want to Use Skype for Business with one another.</p>
<p>All 3 companies are set to "On except for blocked domains" for external communicaions, with no domains in the blocked domains list.</p>
<p>Now company A can communicate with comapanies B and C. However companies B and C cannot communicate with one another and when they try, always receive the message:</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>This message wasn't sent to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** due to company policy<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This is a bit of a headache at the moment as there seems ot be no reason why the B and C cannot Skype with one another, if A can communicate with both B and C.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi John P OH,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know if the issue happens to all users in company B and C? Based on my experience, the error will appear when users are not allowed to send to blocked domains or the accounts of recipients are invalid (does not have valid licenses). Since you mentioned
 all three companies are set to â€œOn except for blocked domainsâ€ for external communications and with no domains in the blocked domain list, also A can send to B and C, please check if it just happens to specific users.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check if those users in B and C can send IM in <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a> (OWA) as below capture:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26974554-4e40-40f4-892d-db76364ad5cd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26974554-4e40-40f4-892d-db76364ad5cd?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, please confirm if users in one company can be added as contacts to another one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

<p>Hello and thanks for replying,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your first question. I am in company C and we have only just intalled Skype. So far the problem occurs between all users in companies B and C. I was able to add someone from company B ot&nbsp;my contacts (and that person could add me to&nbsp;their contacts)
 but&nbsp;it always displays as "presence unknown" and we always get the same "company policy" error message if we try to send messages,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i didn't really undertand what you mean by IM with OWA. I use owa,&nbsp; butI don't have and IM possibility as far as I know.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can communicate with users in company A, you should have valid Skype for Business Online lincense. Please refer to this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/IM-in-Outlook-Web-App-20e80ef4-3464-4d56-b7ba-01e6c451fde4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> to send a Instant Message (IM) to the contacts (company B) in your Skype for Business. After you sign in to IM, you should see the icon of Skype for Business and click to open it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update Error Code 80004005 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikevernon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update Error Code 80004005</h2>
                    <p>Hello I am trying to upgrade my Windows 8.1 HP Envy laptop using either the Windows update service or the media creation tool, neither of these options are working for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the windows update service, it downloads Windows 10, then asks me to accept a user agreement and restart my computer, then the computer restarts, saying it is configuring PC for the Windows 10 uograde. The percentages leap from 25% to 50% to 75% to
 85%. Then, my computer restarts to the regular Windows 8.1 login screen. When I check windows update, it asks me to download Windows 10 again like I never did it 5 times already. I check the update history and it tells me my windows update failed, displaying
 Error Code 80004005.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the media creation tool, it attempts to update the computer, I go through the motions, say I would like to keep my files, then it begins to update and says my computer will restart in a few moments. After hanging there for a bit, the blue update screen
 disappears and is replaced by the infuriating text box on my desktop screen stating "Something happened. Windows 10 upgrade failed" The only option is to press ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do? Is there a way to make either of these methods work propery or am I stuck with a PC that cannot upgrade to Windows 10 despite meeting all the criteria.</p>

            Hi John
<br />
<br />The latest Windows update seems to have a bug in it, lots of users are reporting loss of audio after the latest Update 
<br />
<br />The fix is to go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the audio device drivers they recommend, those will be compatible with your PC, unlike the ones installed by Windows Update . . .
<br />
<br />From listening to other users, it seems Windows is reporting you have Intel HD Audio, but the driver you need is a Realtek driver from that Support Page . . .
<br />
<br />If you have any difficulty locating the support page for your PC, what is the Make and exact Model No. of your PC - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . . .

    <title>Can only boot notebook with disabled driver signature enforcement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hanskrauser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can only boot notebook with disabled driver signature enforcement after crash</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 10 Enterprise Edition on an Acer notebook.<br />
Yesterday there was a short power outage, for about 5 seconds, which crashed my computer. After that I couldn't boot normally into Windows anymore. The computer just stays stuck at the Acer logo, even when trying to boot in safe mode.<br />
<br />
So, I tried various things from the Windows Automatic Repair menu and the console I could access through that.<br />
But nothing I did there helped.<br />
<br />
After all that I tried out all the options in the Startup Settings and with #7 Disable driver signature enforcement I can actually get into Windows again.<br />
When I boot like that, it seems to boot rather slowly though.<br />
<br />
<br />
I ran sigverif and that shows 2 files that haven't been signed.<br />
<br />
- basicrenderer.sys version: 10.0.16299.19<br />
- bthport.sys version: 10.0.16299.64 <br />
<br />
<br />
- How can I fix that and sign these drivers? I don't want to run the computer with that permanently disabled.<br />
- And are these 2 files not being signed even the actual reason for me not being able to boot Windows?
<br />
- Is it possible that that happened when my computer suddenly crashed?<br />
<br />
<br />
I also ran sfc /scannow and that returned:<br />
<br />
Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some<br />
of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log.<br />
<br />
I was then looking into CBS.log to find that, but that file has 37492 lines and I don't know what to search for.<br />
<br />
- Is that also related to the startup issue?<br />
- How can I find which corrupted files it hasn't been able to fix?<br />
<br />
<br />
I also had a look into SRTlog and it says there: <br />
- Number of root causes = 1<br />
- all the error codes are 0x0<br />
- Startup Repair has tried several times but still cannot determine the cause of the problem.<br />
<br />
- What is that telling me about the problem?

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern. It is good that you ran the signature verification of driver because that is the main issue why you can't boot to Windows properly. To help you with this, you can perform SFC and then DISM to fix and replace corrupted
 system files. Head over to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for the instructions. Also, Update the
 driver of your devices. If you are not using the updated Windows, please check for Update and install it.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting in this forum. I understand that ACPI battery wasnâ€™t working and you did a â€œResetâ€, however after the installation of some updates the issue with the battery resurfaced.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you perform a Clean boot and then install updates when they are next offered. Clean helps to disable the non-Microsoft services which may have caused a conflict for the issue to occur. Follow these steps to perform a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to perform a clean boot. </span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the <b>â€˜Windows + Râ€™</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the <b>â€˜Runâ€™</b> windows type<b>â€™MSCONFIGâ€™</b> and click <b>â€˜Okâ€™</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the <b>â€˜Bootâ€™</b> tab and uncheck<b>â€˜Safe Bootâ€™</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the <b>â€˜Generalâ€™</b> tab, click to select the option<b>â€˜Selective startupâ€™</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the <b>â€˜Servicesâ€™</b> tab, click to select the<b>â€˜Hide all Microsoft servicesâ€™</b> check box, and then click
<b>â€˜Disable allâ€™</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the <b>â€˜StartUpâ€™</b> tab, click â€˜<b>Open Task Managerâ€™.</b>In the<b> Task Manager window
</b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select â€˜<b>Disableâ€™.</b></span></p>
<p><span>g) Click <b>â€˜OKâ€™</b>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click to select half of the check boxes in the<b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click <b>OK</b>, and then click<b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the<b>Service</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items <br />
</span></b><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check
 box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the<b>Startup Item</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either
 step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem<br />
</span></b><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box
 for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the <b>â€˜Windows + Râ€™</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the <b>â€˜Runâ€™</b> windows type<b>â€™MSCONFIGâ€™</b> and click <b>â€˜Okâ€™</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the <b>â€˜Generalâ€™</b> tab, click the<b>â€˜Normal Startupâ€™</b> option, and then click
<b>â€˜OKâ€™</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click<b>â€˜Restartâ€™</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update the drivers and check if that helps.</p>
<p>a) Move the mouse to bottom left corner and right-click on the â€˜Startâ€™ icon.</p>
<p>b) Select <b>â€˜device managerâ€™</b>.</p>
<p>c) Expand â€˜<b>ACPI Batteryâ€™</b>, right-click and select â€˜<b>update driver softwareâ€™</b></p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply - instructions.</p>
<p>Disabling the various services made no difference and efforts to update the (Microsoft) driver indicated the driver is up to date. Rebooting the laptop will make the battery driver inoperative (scanning for hardware changes in the Devices window will bring
 the driver back up). Turning the laptop off and restarting will load the battery driver.</p>

            I too had the same problem and the only solution I found is to uninstall the updates. Which updates cause this problem is I don't know because I uninstalled all updates at once instead of doing it one by one and thus saving myself from restarting my pc
 at every step . If you have time then you can check them individually that which update is causing problem.<br />
Yes after uninstalling you may have to disable the acpi battery driver then restart than re enable it for it to work.<br />
Hopes this helps.<br />

This would be great is the ACPI device driver was in the device menu. It isn't.

<div>This whole method doesn't actually do anything, it's simply a diagnostic which proves that there's a problem.<span>

<br />
Same here, except that when I restart the driver, the system wont wake from sleep, so I have to do a hard reset (Re-Boot by pressing power button) then the system reboots with the ACPI ..... deactivated again.&nbsp; Of course leaving me with no power indicators,
 icons, etc....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything worked fine in Win 8,&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrading to Win 8.1, caused all the problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I think the problem is somewhere in the OS<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire Error Code 1170000</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft sucks!!!&nbsp; These scumbags know there are hundreds of posts complaining Microsoft Solitaire games have a problem, that pops up error code 1170000, yet the sorry folks from Microsoft have given no advice on how to correct the problem.&nbsp; I have uninstalled Microsoft Solitaire Collection and reinstalled it several times without success.&nbsp; I have cleaned all my old internet files and defragged my laptop, to no avail.&nbsp; You think the folks at Microsoft would figure this out and post the correction, but NOPE!&nbsp; I guess if they're not getting paid, they don't see any need to help their customers.</p>

<p>Windows 98 does not include support for USB devices.&nbsp; You'd need to check with the folks who make your USB device and see if they have Windows 98 drivers for it.&nbsp; If not then it won't work in your old computer.</p>
