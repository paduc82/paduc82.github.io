            Me? No<br />
The best&nbsp; "safe cleaner" is CCleaner, even then be careful when you use the registry cleaner if you must.<br />
<br />
Best place for drivers is not a cure all, so don't rely on one.<br />
<br />
Learn your pc, if intel or amd, visit their sites regularly using their driver utility to check for updates.<br />
<br />
Graphics? Basically every month.<br />
<br />
Realtek? As above nearly every month.<br />
<br />
If you get stuck download Driver View from Nirsoft (free) It will list your drivers, post it here or a link and I'll tell you what needs updating / you don't want anywhere near your pc (bsod's)<br />

<p>Hello Papa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question. If the Elite controller is within a year of purchase you can get it repaired. Microsoft does not carry them parts for the bumpers. You can go to

device support</a> and see if it is still in warranty. If cant there you can request a call from support.</p>

<p><span><span>When you go to
</span></span><a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Contact
 Us,</span></span></a><span><span>follow these steps to request a call from support:</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />

<h2>            Thinking of Purchasing SP4 256GB &#47; Intel Core i5 8GB RAM.</h2>
                    <p>Thinking of buying but there seems to be too many issues posted.&nbsp; Are these issues mostly with a particular configuration (i.e. i7, or smaller drive, smaller memory) or are they universal across all configurations?&nbsp; I know Microsoft is working to address
 the issues reported and I may still buy the i5 config if there aren't that many issues with that config.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any opinions?</p>
<p>

            I purchased the SP4 I5/256GB/8 in December.&nbsp; All updates are applied.&nbsp; It still has major issues regarding power consumption, overheating and not being able to use sleep mode.&nbsp; If I had to do it again I would not buy this machine, especially given Microsoft's
 nebulous "we're working on it"&nbsp; non-answers.<br />

            If you ask that question in a forum where most poster have issues you will get a very negative bias. &nbsp;Consider that most sp4 owners are happy with their device. I am! &nbsp;Also consider that if u buy from a Microsoft store online or retail(I recommend buying
 from a MS retail store if availalble) that u get 30 days to return it for a full refund, no questions asked. &nbsp;So what have u really got to lose?

    <title>How to get a HP Deskjet 5550 printer to work in Windows 7 &#40;64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hein haas  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get a HP Deskjet 5550 printer to work in Windows 7 &#40;64 bit&#41;</h2>
                    I got a new computer (Intel i5) running Windows 7 (64 bit) and connected my HP Deskjet 5550 printer via the USB cable. The driver got automatically installed with all green checkmarks during the installation process and finally showed up in Control Panel
 as "hp deskjet 5550 series (HPA)". When I print a test page (or whatever), the document sits forever in the print queue with the status "printing", but nothing comes out of the printer. (Obviously, the printer is switched on, and paper is available.)<br />
<br />
Any hints?<br />
<br />
Thanks, Hein

            Hello Yasreal,<br />
<br />
Thank you for returning.&nbsp; The next steps are totally dependant on the video card and sound card drivers you have installed.&nbsp; Both you should be able to access in Control Panel under sound for the sound card and Personalize for the video card.&nbsp; Each of the devices
 driver interfaces should have a option to have a icon display in the Notefication area of the taskbar.&nbsp; Please remember that these are not normal Windows interfaces but ones designed by 3rd parties for their hardware.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if this helps you.<br />

    <title>Chrome and&#47;or Firefox cause CPU usage to go to 100&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eric barnes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chrome and&#47;or Firefox cause CPU usage to go to 100&#37;</h2>
                    <p>My daughter recently upgraded a Dell desktop (that Dell stated was fully Win 10 compatible) from Win 8.1 to Win 10 Home. &nbsp;She said the upgrade seemed to hang at times during the process but eventually completely and she was able to log in with her Windows
 Live (Hotmail) account. &nbsp;She was even able to install whatever updates were necessary. &nbsp;However when she would launch Chrome (or Firefox) the PC came to a screeching halt. &nbsp;Once you could get the task manager to open you could see that the CPU usage was topped
 out but it was not the Chrome executable(s) or the Firefox executable that was using the processor. &nbsp;It was the System process that was using 99% of the CPU. &nbsp;Edge seemed to work but was really "laggy". &nbsp;We uninstalled Firefox, no change. &nbsp;I was able to get
 into the Chrome settings and clear all cache, history, etc. as well as reset the theme to the default. &nbsp;Chrome would open faster but would still bring the system to its knees. We set me up as a user on the PC and I logged in with my Windows Live account and
 everything worked great. &nbsp;Chrome was fine. &nbsp;Edge was fine. &nbsp;Everything was normal. &nbsp;We uninstalled and reinstalled Chrome. &nbsp;No change. &nbsp;She tried creating herself another account, a local one. &nbsp;Chrome still would not work for her. &nbsp;Any thoughts on this? &nbsp;I
 have been using Win 10 since the early preview versions and have done a couple of upgrades to Pro without any problems at all. &nbsp;This has me a little baffled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Side note...when you open a command prompt on this machine the text looks like the machine is set for Japanese. &nbsp;It looks like this:</p>
<p><span>C:¥Program Files¥Internet Explorer</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also the machine has an NVIDIA video card that we installed. &nbsp;After the upgrade the NVIDIA Control Panel items also contain Japanese. &nbsp;Any correlation?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>EB</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software.
 If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer

<p>Gracias por responder pero como antes menciono en Perú si hay servicio de netflix lo se porque tengo cuenta netflix y los uso en mis televisores led smart TV LG y Samsung...</p>
<p>Ya pude solucionar asi que para las personas que tengas este problema aca esta la solución...</p>
<p>Bueno ya pude instalarlo !!... bueno ahora les ayudo y que quede claro que nadie del foro me ayudo ni los administradores ni los moderadores...</p>
<p>Sino encuentras netflix en tu consola xbox 360 es porque tu cuenta gamertag es de España o otro pais donde no hay servicio de netflix por eso no aparece en aplicaciones y no se pude instalar aunque cueste creerlo en España no hay servicio de netflix</p>
<p>1.. Primero obvio que debes tener una cuenta xbox live gold</p>
<p>2.. En la pagina create otra cuenta pero pones todo EE.UU.</p>
<p>3.. En tu xbox create otro perfil y pones la cuenta nueva de EE.UU. que creaste</p>
<p>4.. Te aparece todo en ingles entonces vas a aplicaciones y ahi encontraras netflix lo instalas luego cuando te pida que tu cuenta de EE-UU lo hagas gold para poder usar netflix solo cambia de cuenta por la antigua que tienes que es gold.... y listo....</p>
<p>Bueno espero haber ayudado !!</p>

Hello Kievlianin,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Windows Vista Community site.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I suggest you try following the steps in this article in order to get the<span>&nbsp;
</span>codec</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>This is most likely a codec problem within Windows Media Player. You might try going to
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/knowledgecenter/mediaadvice/0079.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/knowledgecenter/mediaadvice/0079.mspx</span></a><span>
 and see about downloading some new codec's and reading the information that is given about using codec's.
<br />
</span><span>Try following the step in this article which another user had similar questions.:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistamedia/thread/b4edd646-4fab-442e-bffc-6a2908c801d2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Codec's</span></a><span><br />

</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Content given below is only partial content from the link above to keep the post from being too long.<br />
</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Why do I need a codec to play files in the Player?<br />
</span><span>Generally, Internet content providers compress the audio and video content in files or streams to make them smaller or use less bandwidth. This allows you to quickly download files or stream content. Media
 players, however, can't play compressed files or streams, so you need a codec (compressor/decompressor) to decompress the audio and video data so that it can be played.<br />
For video that contains audio, you will need two different codec's installed on your computer to play back the content correctly—one codec for the video and the other codec for the audio.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Where can I get codec's for the Player?<br />
</span><span>If you have the latest version of Windows Media Player installed, the latest Windows Media audio and video codec's are included so you can play Windows Media files—Windows Media Audio (WMA) and Windows Media
 Video (WMV). If you have an older version of the Player, its codec's may not be up-to-date. To acquire the latest codec's, just set up the Player to download the codec's automatically by doing the following:</span></p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<ol>
<li>
<span>In the Player, on the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Tools</span><span> tab, click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Options</span><span>.</span>
</li></ol>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<ol>
<li>
<span>On the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Player</span><span> tab, select the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Download codec's automatically</span><span> check box.</span>
</li></ol>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should resolve your problem.</p>

<li>The free upgrade does not have the option to&nbsp;switch architectures, so the architecture will remain the same. If you want to switch architectures, you will have to download the Window 10&nbsp;.ISO file in the appropriate architecture (32 or 64 bit)&nbsp;and perform

<p>I have a similar issue. I downloaded Windows 10 a few weeks ago to my laptop and it works perfectly. I had Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning, my son downloaded Windows 10 (He had Windows 7) and it has been a continuous reboot loop for hours. It starts like normal and goes to a "Welcome Back" page. The only option is to click on "Next" and it reboots. I have tried to start in safe
 mode but nothing seems to work. I tried holding the shift key down during one of the reboots and nothing happened. I never get an opening page with a "Start Menu".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put the original Windows 7 CD in and was able to boot from that. I tried the "fix windows" option and it showed that windows 10 was installed. It was "thinking" for a long time but eventually it was back to the same welcome page/reboot issue. Again from
 the CD I tried to restore to a prior time, but there is no prior time available. I also tried to fix the memory. When it rebooted it said it was fixing the BIOS, but again when it restarted I was back to the same welcome page/reboot hell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to install non-destructive Windows 7, but I can't do that without being in my system. I believe I could do a clean install of Windows 7 from the disc, but then all of my son's programs and information would have to be reinstalled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have any other options? If Microsoft does an update that would fix this issue, would it automatically install with one of the reboots? Even if I never am past the welcome menu?</p>

    <title>Screen Saver suddenly stopped working &#40;FIXED, SORT OF&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Screen Saver suddenly stopped working  &#40;FIXED, SORT OF&#41;</h2>
                    <p>The screen saver on our computer was set to use 3D text, and was working without any problems; power setting was working also without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the screen saver does work, neither does the power settings.&nbsp; No hardware has been updated, and the only update which occurred was:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Security Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 7 for x86 based system (KB4056894)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked to make sure no changes had been made to the screen saver screen and found none.&nbsp; I even checked the power settings and likewise found no changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was looking in the wrong location in the Registry to make sure Screen Saver was set to active, but finally found the location and it was set to active--both in Admin and User accounts.<br />
</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the time setting for the screen saver is set to 5 minutes in either of the two accounts on our computer, the screen saver works as it should.&nbsp; But resetting time back to 15 minutes and the screen saver stops working.</p>

<p>SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM OF THE SCREENSAVER SUDDENLY STOPPED WORKING:</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated in my original post, our home built system runs Windows 7 Ultimate.&nbsp; One Sunday the screensaver was working as it should but seven days later, the following Sunday it wasn't.&nbsp; This problem caused me to surf the web, trying to find a solution to
 the problem with the screensaver.&nbsp; The following is everything I tried but did not fix the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the Registry to make sure Screen Saver Active was set to 1, and it was.&nbsp; Also check any Power Management settings and they were also correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked GPedit.msc but since nothing was configured, there were no conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran cmd as administrator and performed both 'powercfg -requests', and 'sfc/scannow' but neither showed any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran Windows Troubleshooter and it too showed no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran through everything in Device Manager and made sure all drivers were up to date, which they were.&nbsp; I even unchecked the box in the Ethernet adapter which lets that device wake up the computer; found this on the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because we use Logitech devices, and Set Point, I downloaded Set Point again, uninstalled the one on the system, and reinstalled the new download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changed out one Logitech optical mouse for another Logitech optical mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the above actions changed, or fixed the problem that was affecting the Screensaver.&nbsp; But I did something out of curiosity which lead to something else which lead to the problem being fixed, sorta of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of curiosity I opened the Task Manager and looked at the Processes tab.&nbsp; Under that tab I found a file named Proxycheck.exe and it was up and running.&nbsp; Because I didn't know anything about the file, I check the web and found out it might be a Malware
 and should be removed from the system with a good malware removal tool.&nbsp; I found out most of it could be uninstalled through the Control Panel but not everything, folder included.&nbsp; And as a couple of web sites said, a good malware removal tool was needed to
 remove this file completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Malwarebytes had always been good on our system so I once again downloaded it and ran it after it installed.&nbsp; Upon it's completion, there were 44 things it didn't like and which I had the program quarantine.&nbsp; I then let our system run and soon found out
 the Screensaver was running as it should.&nbsp; Later when I check again, the display had shut off, as it should in one hour.&nbsp; Checking on the system some time much later, I found the computer had gone to sleep, as it should in three hours.&nbsp; The Screensaver and
 Power management was again working according to the settings within each one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which of the 44 items was the cause of my problem I can't say, I don't really care.&nbsp; I care that one of them was monitoring the screen for changes and stopping the whole screensaver process.&nbsp; And now it's not.&nbsp; The Screensaver is once again working and Malwarebytes
 is again watching for garbage like that which was on our system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe one of the first things which should be done by anyone with a Screensaver problem is to run a good malware removal tool first.&nbsp; I know, now, that if I had I would have saved several days of unwanted searching for solutions which weren't the problem
 in the first place.</p>

            <p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

</p><p>Microsoft's compatibility database is continually being updated with new data. What you can do is periodically run another scan to see if the database has updated information about your hardware. Even though you might get this message, you can always run
 Windows Update after installing Windows 10 and download the latest driver too. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently installed Windows 10 on an HP Elitebook to see how well the most recent Windows 10 build performs. The Elitebook is a fairly recent model notebook which includes an assortment of hardware technologies. Out of the box though I did not get a complete
 system, for instance the Intel HD Graphics 3000 was not detected and I was instead limited to the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from this, I had wi-fi ready, which meant, I could connect to the Internet right away.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Installing drivers through Windows Update</strong></p>
<p>Windows Update is the premier starting point to resolve most common driver issues you might experience immediately after installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply launch it from <strong>Start </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>
Update and Security </strong>and click <strong>Check for Updates</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Check for updates (make sure you have an active Internet connection). </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17c3c59e-db92-4e15-8629-49ca32cc8d04" /></p>
<p>Immediately, Windows Update will detect your system configuration and download all the appropriate drivers for your system. As you can see in the above screenshot, my Intel HD 3000 Graphics was installed automatically. I did not even have to reboot the system.
 In addition to that other hardware components were also detected and installed which includes my LAN adapter and card reader.</p>

                    I use UWP Skype is used on Windows 10 x64. When I right click on file in Windows Explorer and select "Send to" and&nbsp;then "Skype", old desktop version of Skype starts. How this can be corrected so right-click Send-file demand is managed by new UWP app?

<p>
I purchased a new Dell XPS 17 and have previously been a long time user of XP. One big reason I am already not a fan of Windows 7 is because while some things have improved other things have gotten worse. By far this is the worst problem.</p>
<p>
In XP my Duration online can be 1-2 days and would barely hit a million or a million and a half of packets for sent and outgoing individually. With the Same exact setup in Win7 what takes days in XP I experience in about 1 Hour in Win7!! As of right now I have
 over 19million outgoing packets! Similar for Received. What gives??</p>
<p>
By the way I have an Intel 1000BGN Internal Adapter but I have it disabled and am using an Alfa AWUS036h b/g adapter. My router is a Netgear N300 WNR2000v2. I am experiencing very low speeds 1-5.5 and occasionally a stable 11mbps. I firmly believe this network
 traffic is causing both my low speeds and my random and frequent limited access / disconnections.</p>
<p>
Please advise!</p>

            I have a AWUS036H b/g adapter too.. I've been using it for about a year now and realize that connection fails easily with this card on windows 7. I also realized that in most of the cases that I was connected properly, the adapter would disconnect or enter
 limited access mode which means there were no internet connectivity. I ended up running the Windows Network Diagnostics all the time in order to fix the connectivity failure.. Then I got fed up with that and came up with this idea.. to create an application
 that does that automatically for me after some specified time. Finally I can leave the computer unattended and it automatically repairs the connection in case it fails..
