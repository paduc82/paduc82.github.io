<p>You are missing the SATA drive controller drivers. You need to get them from the laptop mftr.'s website. The easiest way to handle this since you won't have a floppy drive is to slipstream the drivers into an installation CD.</p>

    <title>Files lost during cut and paste - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Files lost during cut and paste</h2>
                    <p>Apologies if this appears twice, but I'm unable to find my original post after an hour of waiting for it to appear on the forum.</p>
<p>I have an extensive karaoke collection (150GB) stored on an external drive.&nbsp; I couple of weeks ago I decided to make a backup on a second external drive which I did by connecting both drives to my Windows 8 laptop (Home Edition, OEM).&nbsp; There were no error
 messages and the task seemed to complete without any issues, however, I found today that only 17GB had been copied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to move what had been copied onto my laptop to clear the space and again everything seemed to go to without a hitch but this time none of the mp3 files were transferred across, although they had been removed from the source disk during the cut
 and paste process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's lucky that I still have the original copy otherwise I'd be facing weeks of re-ripping CDs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#Is this a bug in Windows 8?&nbsp; If so, it's a critical one as moving files around is a fundamental part of an operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd be interested in feedback from somebody from Microsoft, but please, don't tell me that I should use Ctrl-C instead of Ctrl-V.&nbsp; The function is available and should work - even DOS had an operational MOVE command.</p>

<br />
CTRL+C is copy.<br />
CTRL+V is paste.<br />
I have no idea why some one would tell you to use COPY instead of PASTE.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Did you mean CTRL+C instead of CTRL+X?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I have copied terabytes (at once) of data on Windows 8 to various external media - I have not witnessed what you say is happening.<br />

            <p>My apologies Shenan, you're correct, I meant Ctrl-X, not Ctrl-V - that's what happens when you have to re-type a whole post in Internet Explorer because the forum doesn't like to work in Firefox!&nbsp; :-/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry that you haven't witnessed this behaviour in Windows 8 but I can assure you that it happened.&nbsp; I've worked with PC's since 1989/90 and started out in DOS;&nbsp;I've installed OS's from Windows 3.1 to Windows 7 (haven't had a chance to install Win 8
 on a new build yet), cleaned viruses and recovered&nbsp;files from broken hard drives, so I'm more experienced than your average user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing I forgot to mention is that the drive that contained the backup copy of my files&nbsp;showed 74GB free space, but since I moved the initial 17Gb&nbsp;of files across onto my laptop, it now shows 241GB free - that's a heck of a lot more space freed up than
 the 16GB of data that ended up on my laptop.</p>

<h3> keithbroadbent  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adobe Acrobat</h2>
                    <p>I just noticed that, after upgrading to Windows 10, the Acrobat seems to be missing from my programs. This concerned me as I had stored some ecosign documents there. However by typing adobe ecosign in the search window I found my documents except for my
 electronic signature. Previously I had a shortcut to ecosign on my desk top. Does this mean that ecosign &nbsp;is a completely separate Program and I should</p>
<p>&nbsp; now just download the latest Adobe program which seems to be Version 11? Prior to going to Windows 10 I would be notified by Adobe of all upgrades.</p>

<h2>            Deleting private data from my laptop</h2>
                    I have heard that when you delete files and web pages that have been viewed on the internet, they still can exist in some hidden part of your hard drive. I am concerned about security especially credit card and other sensitive data being accessible to
 people who may have access to my laptop.&nbsp; How do I delete these files and preferably for free?

            I have advise, if you are using Internet Explorer 8 then you have something called InPrivate browsing under Safety bar. If you run with that when you are trying to put sensitive information whenever you close the browser (that run inprivate) everything
 in that section will delete.

<h2>            Windows 10 &#34;NTLDR is missing&#34; Created Windows 10 ISO, tried to repair, no luck</h2>
                    I have a two-year old top of the line desktop PC that I assembled with components.&nbsp; My main drive is a Samsung EVO 850 SSD where I installed the operating system.&nbsp; I upgraded the OS to Windows 10 from Windows 8.&nbsp; It has been running fine for months and
 months.&nbsp; When I returned from a business trip this week I got the "NTLDR is missing" message.&nbsp; I followed the directions to create a USB boot disk on a USB thumb drive (16 GB so plenty of room).&nbsp; I updated the BIOS to have the USB drive come first in the sequence
 and got the Windows setup screen.&nbsp; I selected "English, English, US" and got to the "Repair Your Computer" prompt and then the "Troubleshoot" option.&nbsp; I did a "Startup Repair" which didn't solve the problem and then tried a "System Restore" sequentially going
 further and further back in time (2/27/18 is the oldest of three choices, I tried them all).&nbsp; None of this has fixed my problem.&nbsp; Looking for other diagnostic/fix ideas from

            Thanks for the quick response. &nbsp;I tried to rebuild the BCD in the instructions. &nbsp;It didnt fix he problem. &nbsp;I also followed the instructions that you linked. &nbsp;Im concerned that the system found Windows installations on drives except the one where Windows
 10 is installed‚Äîmy C: drive. &nbsp;When i ran Bootrec.exe /ScanOs from the C: prompt it found zero Windows installations. &nbsp;Looking for more guidance.

 this I get the message: ‚ÄúNo device drivers were found. Make sure that the installation media contains the correct drivers, and the click OK‚Äù. If I knew which drivers were missing I might be able to find them. When I browse to look for drivers I see that the

            That error usually suggest your install media is corrupt. You should download and create it again.

 I'm getting the NTLR messages.&nbsp; Why I attempt to reinstall Windows it tells me I'm going to lose all of my installed applications.&nbsp; Is there a way to fix this without losing all of my applications?

<h2>            Keyboard and mouse randomly stop working</h2>
                    My keyboard and mouse randomly just stop working. My mouses DPI indicator flashes for a few seconds, then neither of them work. Regardless of what I' doing on my computer at the time, it normally happens smack-dap in the middle of a game. But it can happen
 at any time, from just starting up my computer, to hours after. I have tried re-installing all of my drivers, hard resetting my USB ports, and re-installing windows, nothing has helped me. Also, if I am playing a game, nothing changes except the fact that
 I can't move my mouse or type anything using my keyboard, if I'm skpying with someone, my audio, and mic working perfectly fine, I just can't use my keyboard and mouse. My mouse and keyboard are the standard ones that came with my computer, Studio XPS 8300.
 Regardless of the mouse I'm using, this always happens.

            Sorry, but yours words are not true. Running my PC in Safe Mode I can not delete unnecessary file (NOT programs!) in this mode. I am trying and trying.... and on the end exit from Safe Mode. I dont understand what I am doing but now I delete this file
 regulary in Windews Explorer without any problems. &nbsp; &nbsp;

<h2>            How to check user birth date&#63;</h2>
                    
<pre>I would like to check birth date which I've provided during registration.<br /><br />This date was probably wrong and now I have no way to add my son account to parental control on Xbox, Marketplace and Zune.<br /><br />I've created new Windows Live ID with correct birth date and changed Live ID connected to Gamertag - but it did nothing.<br /><br />This account still remains "adult". I can set some limitations on console. But that's not a point. I need to connect this account to my adult account to make transactions on Marketplace and Zune from my credit card. Especially because I bought Windows Phone for my kid and he want's me to buy some games and music for his phone.<br /><br />And of course I want him to use the same Gamertag and Live ID on Xbox, WPhone and Windows 8 in near future.<br /><br />Xbox support refused an ability to fix this birth date and their only suggestion was to create new clean account for my kid. But this solution is unacceptable because I have already bought prepaid Live Gold s

<p>EA Support said something different. They said that if I want to play on another account I need to buy another online pass and buy everything again including Premium.</p>
<p>Actually this is pathetic that no one can fix birth date issue. And I understand that this should be prohibited when some kids want to avoid parental control. But an opposite way?</p>
<p>Actually I got stupid situation because Windows Live ID connected to Gamertag is with user age under 18. And this has no influence on Xbox!</p>
<p>While Xbox Live takes user birth date from Live ID data during registration and demands parent permission - bit it doesn't indicate that after Live ID change user's birth date is under 18. Pathetic.</p>
<p>In my opinion this is just a bug that should be fixed. There is no excuse to make users to accept such situation especially if they spent their money on Gold subscribtions and content.</p>
<p>To be honest it is also against EU law. In my country there is a law that says that every citizen has right to review, correct and remove any personal data stored online.</p>
<p>But I'm unsure how these law has influence on MS as it is USA based company.</p>
<p>Is there any way to put some pressure on MS developers to change this situation?</p>

<p>That's not what I want to check. This is the birth date in Windows Live ID. Anyone can change/fix this date but is has no influence on Xbox Live! And that's a problem.</p>

<p>That's not quite how it works, it's whatever the DOB it was when the signup was completed so if you signed up with a birthdate ending in 1986 you would be showing as 26 years of age. Yes, that DOB is changeable and it has no affect on the XBOX Live account
 but if that date on the website is not touched and you just login to the account that would be the date of birth that the account was started with.</p>

<p>Sorry online passes apply to all profiles as Long as it is the purchasing console and ye purchasing gamertag is there</p>
<p>Goto ea.com and read their own FAQ</p>
<p>However bf3 premium is account specific and not multiplayer </p>
<p>It only let's you download premium content the premium would only apply to the purchasing account not any other</p>
O Other profiles can use the content as long as it is your purchasing console

<h2>            Taskbar changed from the traditonal circular shape to a square </h2>
                    I have just upgraded&nbsp;two Acer M265's from Vista to Windows 7 with the Acer official upgrade process.&nbsp; The taskbar on one PC is fine but the other&nbsp;is very different i.e. It is not&nbsp;the standard &nbsp;conventional Windows 7. icons and open link previews are&nbsp;mainly
 text with icons rather than page preview&nbsp;. Looking more like the old classic windows taskbar standard. The properties settings&nbsp;on both are the same apart from aero peek, both ticked, but on the problem machine is greyed out.<br />
<br />
Any ideas other than restoring to vista, then repeatingthe upgrade process. Thanks

<p>If I've understood you correctly then I suggest that you ensure that you do not have a High Contrast or Windows Classic theme set in Personalisation. If your able try picking a nice Aero theme. The themes I've mentioned have the classic rectangular Start
 button rather than circular Start orb of the others.</p>

                    <span>
<p><strong>Remember - This is a public forum so never post private information such as email or phone numbers!</strong></p>
<p>Ideas:I am running Windows 7 Ultimate and have an identical issue on two home pc's.</p>
<p>Windows firewall is off. Am using ZoneAlarm Extreme Security for anti virus and firewall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the auto application of upgrade KB976902 the computer no longer connects to the internet.</p>
<p>The network and sharing centre shows that the home network has been redefined as 'Unidentified Network' and classified as a public network, and because of this there is a red cross on the link from this to the internet.</p>
<p>1) Using the troubleshooter does not find the issue. It gives the error message "local area network doesn't have a valid IP configuration"</p>
<p>2) Going into homegroups I can set the network location to be home but the internet is still not connected. If I disable the network adaptor (NIC) and enable it I get the&nbsp;'Unidentified Network' again. Same happens if I delete the network adaptor in device
 manager and reboot.</p>
<p>3) When I ping 127.0.0.1 I get no replies, this confirms that the system cannot connect to the network adaptor</p>
<p>4) I've also tried running CMD as administrator and typing</p>
<p>netsh winsock reset catalog &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and pressing enter</p>
<p>netsh int ip reset reset.log hit &nbsp; &nbsp;and pressing enter</p>
<p>and then rebooting, no change</p>
<p>5) I have tried to go to a restore point prior to the application of KB976902 but this fails</p>
<p>6) Have also tried rebooting in safe mode - advanced, and with networking</p>
<p>7) Have gone into services and disabled bonjour.</p>
<p>8) Have checked that windows firewall is off and have disabled zonealarm</p>
<p>9) Have rebooted router, note other pc's in the house do not yet have this issue and some have got KB976902. But one of them needs the NIC disabling/enabling to find the internet after KB976902 was applied</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have run out of ideas, any help is appreciated</p>

<p>I have seen this problem several times before, and also had it happen on my PC, the very strange way that I found to fix was to un install Zone Alarm, the connection magically sprang back to life, and I was then able to re install Zone Alarm and had no further
 Problems.</p>
<p>Disabling ZA does not completely shut it down parts of it are still running in Services</p>

<p>Hello, today I was attempting to manage my payment options in order to remove a credit card from my payment options, but whenever I attempt to access that option, the site proclaims that there is an error or a "glitch in the system." My subscription to XboxLive
 automatically renews when unwanted and I am unable to cancel it because of said site errors. This is extremely frustrating, and money is being wasted because of it.</p>

<h2>            How do I solve error code 0x80004005 in Windos 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I installed Windows 10 on July 29, I have not been able to send emails using the email address given me by my ISP many years ago. Yes I can receive emails via this address, but cannot send any by it. And I did not have this problem with Windows
 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first noticed this problem, every time tried to send an email with this address, a note would come up saying that it could not be done because something was wrong with the certificate of the ISP. After many days trying to fix the email account, now&nbsp;
 a note comes up saying I have error code 0x80004005.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would very much appreciate help in solving this error.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went round the houses a bit on this one... told to do the registry changes and even install Windows Live Essentials 2011 (basically installing an old email client, movie maker, messenger on the lovely new shinny Windows 10!?!?!?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end I deleted the account, set it up again using the settings from my ISP and bingo it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the upgrade must have failed to work propertly on some of my mail accounts, perhaps messing up some of the account configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

</u>&nbsp;
<p>Boot from the Windows&nbsp;8 64 Bit&nbsp;DVD<br />
Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows&nbsp;8 Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers.</p>
<p>You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>

<p>-------------------------------</p>
<p>Windows 8 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 8 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 8 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 8.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 8 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers.</p>
<p>If you need to upgrade to the 64 bit version, you will need to do a custom over your 32 bit installed. You said you ordered the backup DVD with your order, so you will have the 64 bit disc.</p>
<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit. Lauch the Windows Easy Transfer utility in Windows 7 and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can
 have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 8 64 bit disk.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/</u></a></p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 8 64 bit disk. In Windows 8 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

            <p>I have Windows 7 Ultimate, 32-bit version. I am trying to install within Windows the upgrade to Windows 8 Professional 64-bit. When I try to run the setup.exe on the DVD that is the installation file, it gives me this message: "The version of this file is
 not compatible with the version of Windows you're running.&nbsp; Check your computer's system information to see whether you need an x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of the program, and the contact the software publisher."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to go to Windows 8 Professional, 64-bit version to make&nbsp;use of larger than 3.2 GB of RAM memory. That is the main reason. I was told by a Microsoft specialist it never matters if I have a 32-bit or 64-bit version, that Windows 8 Pro can be upgraded
 with the 64-bit version. I also have talked to others who have done this going from Windows 7, 32-bit to Windows 8, 64-bit. Tell me how I can do this successfully and how to correct this issue so I can do the upgrade within Windows, which is how it is setup,
 and the way I want to do it. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2>            Logitech WingMan Extreme Digital 3D Game Controller has no 64 bit drivers.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title: Logitech WingMan Extreme Digital 3D Game Controller.</strong>
</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently upgraded to Windows 7 64 bit from Vista. In the past I always avoided the 64 bit versions due to poor 3rd vendor support but nowadays most PC hardware come with at least 4GB of RAM, so honestly I think the 32bit era is for the history books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I have two old controllers from Logitech a Wingman Force and a Racing Wheel, both items don't work under Windows 7 64 bit. No device drivers available ! I contacted Logitech support and their answer is "It's Microsoft fault, they won't certify our drivers"
 I got a one time 50% reduction (valid for 30 days)&nbsp;on any of their new game controllers and that's it, end of story.</p>
<p>I did some further investigation and it seems that for the 64 bit version Microsoft requires a valid certificate to sign drivers, I think this is a good initiative since it ensures that the driver is a valid one but beside that I didn't see any requirement
 for extra validation.</p>
<p>What's the real situation. Is Microsoft imposing 3rd party vendors that each driver has to be certified by Microsoft or is this just Logitech hiding behind a false excuse?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drivers are manufactured by the product manufacturer. Since Logitech told there are no drivers for 64 bit windows, also,
<span>drivers designed for 32-bit versions of <span>
Windows</span> won't work on computers running 64-bit versions of <span>
Windows</span>.</span><span> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you may want to un-install the 64 bit Operating System and go back to 32 bit Operating system
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>For more information refer the section‚Äù If I'm running a 64-bit version of Windows, do I need 64-bit drivers for my devices?‚Äù

<h2>            formating a 32 gb flash drive in ntsf</h2>
                    I have been trying to format my 32 gb flash drive in NTFS and nothing seems to work. It works fine in fat32 but I need it to hold bigger files than 4 gb and in exfat but my TV does not read exfat so I need it in ntfs. Why is this so hard? I have changed
 the "optimize for performance" and no change. I tried to do this in comand promt and write format d: /fs:ntfs &nbsp;and convert d:/fs:ntfs but it always says cant inform other components or something like that. Is there anything I can do?

<p><span>Perform the following troubleshooting methods:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you check the status of the drive using disk management and reassign the drive letter then check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link ‚Äú<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Change-add-or-remove-a-drive-letter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change, add, or remove a drive letter</a>‚Äù to change
 the drive letter.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If that doesn‚Äôt work, then I would suggest you to backup data on another external drive then format the drive on different Windows Vista computer and check if it
 helps.</span></p>

<p>I have played Halo 4 EP4 CH5 on Legendary twice and experienced the following glitch:&nbsp; During game play, the episode ends suddenly and goes to the Carnage Report Screen and reports my score.&nbsp; Very frustrating that I cannot complete the chapter, especially
 when I am near the end.<br />

Anyone else have this experience?</p>

<p>This can happen if the host of the game disconnects or there is a transmission error between the 4 players and the game is unable to find a new host or catch up with the connection to all players. If possible, try to play it Legendary Solo and see if the
 game drops out at the same point and/or try to connect to more games. Could be that you were just unlucky with your host those couple of times it dropped you out of game early.</p>
<p>As mja3rd mentions, you should raise this on the Halo forums as well in case anyone there has some tips -

<p>I'm trying to figure out which level exactly you mean. I know for Episode 4 chapter 5 it is on Galileo Base and as far as I'm aware that mission can not be failed, but that is not true for Chapter Episode 5 Chapter 4. In the second one you're tasked with
 defending 2 generators and if they both get blown up you do lose. Now if it is the first one on Galileo Base then it is possibly a connection issue or if you're playing alone then I'm not sure. If it is the Cauldron defending generators one then you have to
 defend them both and keep at least one alive to be able to finish the mission.</p>
