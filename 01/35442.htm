<h2>            USB recognized but movies not showing up</h2>
                    
<p>I've looked around for the answer but no luck so far. I'm trying to watch movies on a USB stick on my 360. Seems pretty simple, configure it for FAT32 on my computer loaded the movies on it in .avi format and stuck it in my xbox. The xbox recognizes the
 USB stick but doesn't see any movies. What am I missing here? It seems to work fine for everyone else.</p>

<p>It sounds as if you're doing it the right way. At least if you try playing them in video player. The reason for it not to see your movies is probably due to unsupported encoding. Try with another file and see if it helps. This article tells you all you need
 to know about supported formats. </p>

<p>Thanks for quick response. I tried other files and made sure everything fit the requirements, which they did. And still nothing. When I plugged my USB back into my computer to put the different movies on it I did notice that the original movies I was working
 with were gone. In the place of the movies were two small plain data files with a weird squiggly arrow for the file name. No idea what that's about and could be a contribution to my issue here.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Auto detect error after upgrade</h2>
                    <p>So I upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; Now I can not get in because I have the AutoDetect Error(Analog output) optimal screen resolution error.&nbsp; The problem is I can not get to the safe boot or recovery screen and F8 does not work.&nbsp; How do I upgrade the driver if
 I can't start in safe mode and don't have access to another computer to make a USB boot stick?&nbsp;&nbsp; What good is the compatibility check if it doesn't work and someone moves forward with the upgrade?&nbsp;

                    I am running Neat 5 and it keeps crashing or finds that the database is corrupted. I eventually get it running, then install a backup of the data. Then it works for a while and then it crashes and repeats the cycle.&nbsp; This has happened many times to me,
 does anyone have the same experience and have a solution I can try? <br />

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Freezes on resume from Hibernation&#47;Sleep</h2>
                    Hi guys!<br />
<br />
So I made the move to windows 8.1 a few weeks ago and loving it so far. Not bad really but it took a while to get use too coming from windows 7. Anyways, I've been having an issues of Hibernation or Sleep freezing on resume at the Black screen with the windows
 logo. I've try everything from updating all drivers to reinstalling video drivers, and even resetting the powercfg but still having the issue. Anyone have an idea to why this is happening? I love using hibernation because I can save my work and resume from
 in instead of shutting down and waiting for it to reboot and all. <br />
<br />
My current system is a AMD 1090T, 8GB of ram, SLI EVGA GTX 570, all on a TA890FXE motherboard. Oh and a DG Xonar Sound board. Storage im using is M4 128gb SSD combined with a 1TB Seagate HDD<br />
<br />
I've tried disabling hybrid shutdown and still issue is there. I don't want to have to resort to reinstall it. I'm at that point right now but I figured I would post here to see if any more fixes I could try before that last resort option is used.
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
Andy Conolly<br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This issue occurs because the $Secure file becomes corrupted. When the system tries to recover the corrupted $Secure file,
 the default permissions are set across all files on the system. However, the default permissions are insufficient to enable the remote procedure call (RPC) endpoint mapper service to start. Because the RPC is important to the operation of Windows, the system
 freezes when the RPC endpoint mapper service does not start</span></p>

    <title>Left 4 Dead 2 Backwards Compatibility with Disc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ptosis gnosis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Left 4 Dead 2 Backwards Compatibility with Disc</h2>
                    
<p>Microsoft plugs that L4D2 is now backwards compatible. They also plug that you can do backwards compatibility either through disc or a digital copy. I just placed my disc in and it says, "This game isn't playable here." Then tells me to go to the website
 for the playable 360 games, confirming that L4D2, in fact, is a viable option. It's also giving me the error code: 0x8082000c.
</p>
<p><br />
This also happened to my friend on a different console in a different state. For some reason, One is not reading the L4D2 disc as compatible. Help, please.</p>

    <title>System image recovery disk and error 0x80070017 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuartschneider  say:</h3>
<h2>            System image recovery disk and error 0x80070017</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
I have a brand new Sony Vaio Fit 15 laptop running Windows 8.&nbsp; The only thing installed has been the English language pack (it's a Japanese laptop), along with the ~45 Windows Updates that are currently available.&nbsp; It is running Trend Micro Security Center
 (which I originally though might be holding up some of the progress with my system image recovery disk).</p>
<p><br />
I have been trying to use the Windows 7 file recovery system to create a system image.&nbsp; However, I continue to get an error message saying "The backup failed.&nbsp; Data error (cyclic redundancy check).&nbsp; (0x80070017)."&nbsp; I was trying to save the system image to a
 recordable 25 GB Blu-ray disc.&nbsp; If I do the exact same process on a Windows 7 machine I am able to create the system image, which would span multiple Blu-ray discs.</p>
<p><br />
On the same screen for creating the system image, there is also an option to use Windows backup.&nbsp; However, when recording the backup to removable media (DVD/Blu-ray) the program prevents me from saving a system image because "Scheduled backup of system image
 is not allowed on removable devices.&nbsp; You can try to save a single system image on this device by clicking Create a system image in the Windows 7 File Recovery Control Panel."&nbsp; It further goes on to say "Other people might be able to access your backup on
 this location type.&nbsp; The current device does not support setting security permissions on files.&nbsp; As a result, your backed up files can be accessed by anyone who has physical access to the device."</p>
<p><br />
The Windows 8 guidance essentially says that in order to be able to recover the OEM/Windows partition, you have to use a 32 GB USB drive.&nbsp;
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive</a></p>
<p><br />
Is there any way to create a copy of the system/Windows partition onto removable media (DVD/Blu-ray) like there is for Windows 7?&nbsp; Or is the only way to recover the system after a total HDD crash is create the system image onto a USB flash drive?</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for the help,</p>
<p><br />
Stuart<br />

    <title>dual monitor shortcut switches active windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> freeze06  say:</h3>
<h2>            dual monitor shortcut switches active windows</h2>
                    Hello.&nbsp; I am encountering an issue where the active window (regardless of program) switches between my dual monitors when I press the numbers 1 and 2.&nbsp; 1 moves the window to my secondary monitor, while 2 returns the window to my primary monitor.&nbsp; It happens
 intermittently, but it is incredibly annoying nonetheless.&nbsp; Is there a way to turn this functionality off or at least identify the behavior that initiates this response?&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.

            I know for sure that Windows itself can't do this with number keys (it uses the Windows+Shift+Arrow key combination to move an app to another monitor). &nbsp;But nVidia and ATI video card drivers both include some shortcuts like that. &nbsp;That'd be my first recommendation
 to start.

<div>Which video card do you have, if you know?</div>

<h2>            Minecraft Split-screen&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I play on a SD screen, and cannot play Minecraft in split-screen, contrary to what the game's original details had said.</p>

<p>I read on Kotaku Microsoft is offering full refunds to those who bought Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition and experienced the same frustration. How do you go about doing that, if eligible?</p>

<p>This is the information about Multip-Player and Split-Screen.</p>
<p>The game Minecraft was recently released on Xbox LIVE for 1600 MSP and supports both single and multiplay (local or LIVE) cooperative gameplay. Due to a editorial issue, the game description initially didn't include information that a HD TV is required for
 split screen mutliplayer. This has been corrected in the English description and is in process for other languages.</p>
<p>So unfortuantely, in order to so split-screen the requirements are HD TV.</p>

<p>I would also like a refund if I'm eligible. I bought the game on launch day and were looking forward to playing some split-screen co-op with my brother (TheBrainWashed on Xbox LIVE). But I later found out that I need a HD screen to play that "mode", which
 is a major disappointment. My fat SD TV still works even though it weighs a ton so I have no plans to get a HD screen in a near future as I don't have a big income. I already own the game on PC so splitscreen with my brother was one of the reasons of me buying
 it.</p>
<p>Sorry for using your thread aPeaTearGriffin but I felt like it would be better to write here than just make another thread.</p>

<p>Yeah, I get that. My question was how do you go about getting the refund that microsoft is offering because of that initial problem? I read on Kotaku that they were doing refunds for people who those in the same situation as myself. Kotaku's usually reliable,
 so I don't think it was inaccurate.</p>
<p>And yeah, it's no problem. I'm glad I'm not the only one who's wondering about this</p>

<p>For everyone that is wondering about the refund process for Minecraft , for those that weren't aware of the requirements for the Split-Screen, etc.

<p>What you will need to do is Contact Customer Support, if you contact them, let them know about what site it's on, and that you were not aware of the requirements needed. They'll be more than happy to assist you.

<p>My apologies guys, MS will ONLY do a refund, if you have purchased the game BEFORE 5/15. My friend called up there, because she was not aware, and they informed her that, they're only doing that for customers that has purchased it BEFORE 5/15.

<p>Thank you very much Jomel_G.&nbsp; It's very odd - when I started Skype, just as I have been doing, all the contacts were there; they weren't before!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to adding contacts, the link you gave illustrates that there are some icons at lower left.&nbsp; I don't have those - nothing is there at all.&nbsp; I can scroll down all the way and still nothing!&nbsp; Instead, at upper right there's a hint saying that I can add contacts
 by searching.&nbsp; So, where does one search?&nbsp; There doesn't seem to be a search box anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, we are halfway there with the contacts but still no way to add any!</p>
<p>

There are two product codes, but all fail.<br />
Please use this code or return the purchase amount.<br />
<br />
There are other questions.<br />
I do not have money now. Is your computer up and running when you use your computer without Windows 10 activation?

                    <p>When I originally set up an account for my kid to play on his Xbox 360 and then on the Xbox one, I set it up like it was for me (an adult) and allowed him to play on it with full access like he was the adult.

<p>Microsoft does not repair cracked screens (or anything else) they replace with a refurb. And unless you have Microsoft complete, they will charge you for this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are in the US, you can go to a physical retail Microsoft Store and they will advise you what your options are. Outside the US, you should call support and ask for Surface.

<p>Hallo ich hätte da eine Frage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hat vielleicht jemand von euch noch einen code für eine 48 Stündige x-box live gold mitgliedschaft bei euch Zuhause liegen den er nicht mehr benötigt. Weil meine
</p>
<p>Mitgliedschaft ist heute Abgelaufen und das vor dem Wochenende ist das nicht gerade prickelnd, und ich komme auch nicht mehr dazu mir einen zu kaufen also vor
</p>
<p>anbruch der nächsten woche. Und da das Wochenende eigentlich der perfekte Zeitpunkt ist um zu zocken, das aber jetzt leider nicht geht, würde ich mal fragen ob sich&nbsp;</p>
<p>jemand von euch Erbarmt und mir <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>eine Freundschaftsanfrage sendet und mir den Code dann so schickt also direkt über X-Box</b></span> da mein PC zur Zeit nicht gerade gut läuft und ich ihn Morgen zur Reperatur geben
 werde.Ich wäre demjenigen sehr dankbar und wir könnten natürlich dann auch miteinander
</p>
<p>zocken wenn die Person die mir den Code schickt&nbsp; <b>BFBC2 </b>spielt. Ich hoffe es findet sich jemand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LG Philipp</p>

<br />
Solche Threads werden hier sehr gerne gesehen; kannste mir glauben.&nbsp; <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-21.gif" /><br />

<br />
Ach ja:<br />
Wenn Du Deine Dose morgen ja eh zur Reperatur bringst, geh in einen Laden und KAUFE Dir einfach eine Gold-Karte für Live. Dann ist auch noch genug vom Wochenende übrig.<br />
Sollte Dir das aber zu teuer sein, versuche es mit Arbeit. Hat bisher auch noch niemandem geschadet!<br />

<p>Philip, kann es sein, dass du Spielsüchtig bist? Es hört sich nämlich so danach an. Ernsthaft, du solltest echt mal mit jemanden darüber reden. Ich bin mir sicher, das jemand bereit wäre, dir nen Code zu geben, doch ich bezweifel, dass das eine gute Idee
 wäre. Oh, und nebenbei... um etwas zu betteln, das so gesehen sinnlos ist im Gegensatz für Essen oder eine trockenes Plätzchen für die Nacht, zeigt dich in ein besonders schlechtes Licht. Dank darüber nach.</p>

<p>@Shadow666Ghost: Ja bei uns gibt es Strassen. Es war ja auch nur eine Frage ob jemand eine hat und sie mir geben könnte. Also da wo ich meinen PC zum Reparieren bringe kann man sich keine Gold-Karte kaufen, da der nur die Sachen Repariert die man ihm bringt
 und sonst nichts verkauft. </p>
<p>@Galbador: Nein ich bin nicht Spielsüchtig da ich ja auch noch ein Leben habe bei dem ich mich mit Freunden treffe und gerne mal Party mache. Aber dieses WE halt mal nicht und da ich auch unter der woche nicht gerade viel zocken kann weil ich erst abend
 um 18:00 uhr heim komme und dann auch nicht mehr so große Lust habe denk ich nicht das ich spielsüchtig bin.</p>
<p>@Pathfinder AUT: Ja die E-Mail das die Mitgliedschaft bald Ausläuft ist mir nicht Entgangen aber das es schon dieses WE ist habe ich vollkommen verschwitz.</p>

<p>In addition to my previous response, SP3 update includes additional and improved fonts, but the site I gave the link to does not list those (it does for XP SP2).</p>
<p>In my SP3 service pack I386 folder,&nbsp; there are 20 TTF fonts:</p>
<p>arial.ttf, arialbd.ttf, ariblk.ttf, comic.ttf, georgia.ttf, impact.ttf, kartika.ttf, lsans.ttf, lsansd.ttf, lsansdi.ttf,<br />
lsansi.ttf, micross.ttf, tahoma.ttf, tahomabd.ttf, times.ttf, timesbd.ttf, timesbd.ttf, tunga.ttf, verdana.ttf, vrinda.ttf</p>

<p>Adobe software&nbsp;comes with a set of its own OpenType fonts for licensed users, but we simply can't install it on everyone's computer, so I have to reformat some basic paragraph styles to use the Microsoft fonts that everyone has on their computer. The limited
