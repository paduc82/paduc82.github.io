<h2>            Solution for Windows 10 Store App problems - Windows 10 Store &#47; Calculator &#47; Photos</h2>
                    <p>Hello I have been having lots of problems with the Windows 10 Store at my firm and found a solution that worked after trying so (so so) many things, that I'm hoping putting up my steps will help others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I found was in our firm, the Windows Store problems were isolated to a specific user. If another user was logged in, they wouldn't have any problems with the Store app or Calculator / Photos apps. Creating another user didn't have any affect on existing
 users or accounts already with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows Version is Version 10.0 (Build 10240)</p>
<p>(run winver)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>The Store would not do anything when clicked. They might flash a window, but that would just disappear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Calculator and Photos Apps would get </p>
<p><em>This app can't open</em></p>
<p><em>Check the Windows Store for more info about Calculator</em></p>
<p><em>Go to the Store</em></p>
<p>Clicking on the store link wouldn't do anything.</p>
<p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>If wsreset was run the window a message box</p>
<p><em>ms-windows-store:PurgeCaches</em></p>
<p><em>The application cannot be started. Try reinstalling the application to fix the problem.</em></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>1. Open Powershell</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Start Button -&gt; All Apps -&gt; Windows Powershell -&gt; Windows Powershell)</p>
<p>Open powershell AS THE USER. I found lots of other instructions telling me to run as an administrator. The issue is if your account is a standard account, to run a program "as Administrator" you need to run the app under another account, this actually can
 sometimes make changes to the administrator account, not the standard account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. Get Full Package Names of the broken Apps</strong></p>
<p>type the following into the Powershell window</p>
<p>get-appxpackage | select name, packagefullname</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy the right column of the Microsoft.WindowsStore and any other apps that you are having problems with.</p>
<p>Best to highlight with the mouse and use Ctrl+C</p>
<p>For me it was&nbsp;Microsoft.WindowsStore_11602.1.26.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe</p>
<p>Open Notepad and paste (Ctrl+V)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3. Reregister the apps</strong></p>
<p>Copy the following line into notepad</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add-AppxPackage -register "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\xxxxxxxx\AppxManifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode</p>
<p>Now you want to replace the xxxxxxxx with the FullPackageName of the Windows Store.</p>
<p>Do the same for any other Apps that aren't working.</p>
<p>For me I had&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add-AppxPackage -register "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsStore_11602.1.26.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\AppxManifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode</p>
Add-AppxPackage -register "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.Windows.Photos_16.1118.10000.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\AppxManifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode<br />
Add-AppxPackage -register "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsCalculator_10.1604.21020.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\AppxManifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode
<p>Copy each line, paste this back into the Powershell Window and run each line separately starting with the WindowsStore line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I ran the windows 10 store, I was able to click the Store App and it was able to open.</p>

            Hi Tyseer, this keyboard shortcut will turn off Narrator:
<br />
<br />Windows Key + Enter
<br />
<br />A permanent fix would be to disable narrater in the Registry
<br />
<br />Open regedit.exe.
<br />Create the following key.
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options
<br />
<br />Right click Image File Execution Options and choose New - Key
<br />
<br />Name that key Narrator.exe
<br />
<br />Then click on Narrator.exe
<br />
<br />In the right hand pane, right click and choose New - String value
<br />
<br />Name that Debugger
<br />
<br />Double click Debugger and set its value to %1
<br />
<br />That's It, close the Registry Editor and Restart your PC for the change to take effect . . .

<h2>            Please help....Game purchased not showing up on acccount</h2>
                    Two weeks ago I purchased Red dead 2. After selecting purchase it said there is an error on our end. My paypal account was then charged the amount for red dead. Under my purchased games it doesn't show Red dead 2 on there. According to Microsoft they can't
 do anything and chat just keeps hanging up on me. Paypal says it's microsoft's deal not theirs. I don't have alot of money I can't just buy it again nor can I play what I purchased? Someone please help Microsoft and Paypal refuse to help me.

<p>Hey there Poolshark!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue concerning your purchase of Red Dead 2.
</p>
<p>What kind of troubleshooting have you done if any so far? </p>
<p>Have you tried to remove and redownload your profile unto your console as outlined on our support page entitled

How to add or remove a Microsoft account on Xbox One</a>? I'd give that a shot if you haven't yet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, what does it say in your <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Please let us know what you have already done on your side so that we can maybe clear up the situation.

<h2>            The network location in Windows Vista is greyed out and unable to use the external drive to perform Backup</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: <span>Vista backup not working with external drive</span></p>
<p>I have a WD external hard drive and I can write to it, read from it, map to it etc, all is working fine, however when attempting to backup&nbsp;using Vista "Backup and Restore" the option to browse for network location is greyed out and the option is not there
 to use my external drive. Note that I have 2 external drives, one a USB connection and one plugged into my wireless router via ethernet cable and both drives are working fine.</p>
<p>Why does Vista not recognize the external drives when attempting a backup??</p>
<p>Thanks, Joe</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Joe,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Were you able to backup before without any issues?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Do you have the same edition of Windows Vista in the network?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Do you receive any error codes?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Are you able to access the drive from other computer if its networked.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may check to see if an IP address is assigned to the drive. If yes then you will be able to ping to the network storage drive.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try the following steps and check if you can access the network drive:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click on Start, Go to Control Panel, in Vista Network and Sharing:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Network Discovery: ON (So it can see the other computers)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Network set to Private (Public is for WiFi hotspots, airports, etc)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. File Sharing: ON</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. Public Folder Sharing: ON (In Windows Vista the Public Folder is the same as other computer’s Shared Docs)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>f. Password Protected: OFF (unless you want to set up identical usernames and passwords on ALL computers in your Network)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information, you may refer the following links:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The original question/post and the&nbsp;replies were related to restoring the feature of viewing the file thumbnails instead of the file icons.&nbsp; The replies above solve that "problem."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your post implies you cannot view pdf files.&nbsp; Files with extension ".pdf" are opened by Adobe Reader.&nbsp; If your problem is you cannot open pdf files, verify you have Adobe Reader installed.&nbsp; Most web sites have links to Adobe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you know Adobe Reader is installed and when viewing a list of (or link to)&nbsp;pdf files do no see the Adobe icon or thumbnail, try the five steps below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&nbsp;know Adobe Reader is installed but cannot open a pdf file by double clicking on the filename,&nbsp;try the five&nbsp;steps below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Right click on a pdf file</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. You should see a dialog with a bunch of options</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Move the mouse pointer down to "Open With" and click on it</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. There will be an option&nbsp;like "always open with,"&nbsp;check that box</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;Move the mouse pointer down to the Adobe Reader icon and click it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, in step 5, you do not see Adobe Reader as an option, then Adobe Reader is not a registered application.&nbsp; In this case you will have to install or reinstall it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is another possibility.&nbsp; When you try to open a pdf file, if you get a message from Windows saying you do not have permission to open the file (location), you will have to contact the owner of the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>I dont know about you guys but I play legit with out hacking or exploits and expect everyone to do the same. Even though your scared of me and need to camp and noob tube me when you see me comeing. But when people exploit game mechanics to gain kills, It
 takes the fun out of the game. You cant win against someone that is cheating. It really does sucks that a mutli billion dollar company wont do anything about it its been going on for a long time now. They caught on to the javelin glitch but this one i think
 its too much work for them. sucks that companies dont actually play the game and balance it to make it fair for everyone. They are all greedy.</p>

<p>1.Camping is a tactical strategy.I dont know how many firefights you've been in,but people don't just run around in the open.</p>
<p>2.Noob tubes were designed to kill campers that you can't seem to get out of there spots(even though you apparently know exactly where they are)...Do people abuse them?Yes,thats why there wont be any one man army in mw3.</p>
<p>3.Yeah,it sucks that there are hackers but thats up to the developer to deal with and btw,not every on that beats you is cheating!!I know its hard to beleive but there are alot of people who are actually better at the game than you.GET OVER IT.</p>

    <title>Arc Touch Mouse affecting Internet availability - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> autopilot737  say:</h3>
<h2>            Arc Touch Mouse affecting Internet availability</h2>
                    <p>Probably sounds crazy but I've been able to track my slow to no wireless internet problems to using the Arc Touch Surface mouse I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was getting continuously worse in Win 8.1. When I&nbsp;changed to&nbsp;Win 10 the problem disappeared for the first 2 weeks and then gradually began to reappear to where now if I turn on the mouse no app or program requiring wireless will work. The program
 starts then searches forever to connect eventually giving up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I leave the mouse off and just use the Surface Pro Cover Keyboard, all the wireless issues disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a conflict between the keyboard and mouse, is the mouse driver faulty?</p>
<p>Ideas anyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<div>The Arc Touch mouse uses bluetooth in the 2.4GHz range, same as 802.11 2.4GHz</div>
<div>channels. So there could be a conflict. If you have a dual band router that</div>
<div>supports both 2.4 and 5 GHz, use the 5 GHz network on your Surface. If you only</div>
<div>have a 2.4 GHz capable router, try changing the channel used. </div>

<div>as a test ONLY, can you log into your router and disable the 2.4GHz band for say</div>
<div>20 minutes, enable BT on the surface and connect your Arc Touch Mouse - please</div>
<div>report results. This is a diagnostic only. Am not expecting you to keep 2.4</div>
<div>disabled on your router.</div>

            <p>Ok, did the test and disabled the 2.4 for 1/2 hour. As soon as I turned the Bluetooth back on and connected the Arc Mouse I had intermittent problems. Internet connections were inconsistent.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm back to both 2.4 and 5.0 working although only connected to 5.0. I also have the Bluetooth off and of course the Arc Mouse too. I do notice that with the Bluetooth off my battery certainly lasts longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this is odd since I was able to use Bluetooth and the Arc Mouse for the 1st year I had the Surface. This only happened about 3-4 months ago while using 8.1 and likely after a upgrade download. The problem persisted with 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do want to find a solution though as I want to be able to use the Arc Mouse and other future Bluetooth hardware.</p>

<div>are you saying that when you disabled 2.4 on the router you were able to use</div>
<div>5GHz AND your BT Arc Mouse? What I wanted you to try was 5GHz only on the router</div>
<div>(disable 2.4) and use your bluetooth on the Surface. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If in fact that is what you did, there is something in your environment causing</div>
<div>2.4GHz interference. To test this, you should take your surface and mouse to</div>
<div>another location, like a coffee shop with pubic wifi or a friend's house to see</div>
<div>if the problem exists elsewhere.</div>

            <p>I tried the Surface w/ Arc Mouse somewhere else and had the same problem so it appears not to be in my house somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back at home, for the past&nbsp;several days I have been using the keyboard cover mouse (uninstalled the Arc), disabled Bluetooth and only 5G and have had no problems. Internet working perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple days ago I re-enabled Bluetooth to test and experienced no problems. Worked for 2 days - no issues. Today I reinstalled the Arc Mouse and that works fine too. No internet or email issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not convinced my problems are over as time seems to bring back issues on this Surface. Perhaps uninstalling and reinstalling hardware has a positive effect due to driver issues - who knows. Time will tell.</p>

 prompt of pen driver error.&nbsp; </p>

<p><span><span><span>Hello TerrydF,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>How long have you had this issue?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Was it working fine before?
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Let's <strong>
reinstall Media center</strong> and check. Follow the steps below to reinstall Media center:
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Open the Control Panel from the Start menu.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. Open Programs and Features in the Control Panel.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note: If Programs and Features is not available, change View by to Large icons at the top right of the Control Panel.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. Select Turn Windows features on or off in the left column of the Programs and Features window.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4. Uncheck Windows Media Center and then click OK.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5. Click Restart Now to restart the computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>6. Re-enable Media center from control panel again.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>7. Try to launch Media center.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Also <strong>
run SFC scan</strong> to find missing or corrupt files that may be causing this issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>System File Checker (SFC) checks that all Windows 7 system files are where they should be as they were by default and not corrupted, changed, or damaged.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and<span>&nbsp;
</span>select Run as Administrator.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. Click Continue or supply Administrator credentials if prompted.</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. In the Command Prompt window type the following, and press Enter:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>sfc /scannow</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4. You should see the following on-screen message:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Beginning the system scan. This process will take some time.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Beginning verification phase of system scan.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Verification % complete.</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5. Once the scan has completed, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved or not.

<h2>            Kontrol Freeks ok&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone, <span>I was wondering if Kontrol Freeks (which are basically thumbstick accessories that you stick on top of the thumbsticks to make them longer, thus making them easier to aim) were allowed to use? I've heard of modifications to controllers
 being against the TOS, which I know mean no modded controllers with things like rapid fire, etc. But I was wondering if Kontrol Freeks were considered mods or if they were okay? They're kind of like how the Elite Controller can have extended thumbsticks I
 think, so I just wanted to make sure these accessories were ok to use. Thanks for the help!</span></p>

 has worked but I have no idea what my password is or username.&nbsp; Where do I find these please?

            Ok I haven't had my last response answered but I have found out from several people it is the pin security when you log in at the beginning that is causing&nbsp; the problem with my new lap top not being able to join the homegroup.&nbsp; Is this true Microsoft and
 if so are you going to fix this problem?&nbsp; I have just gone in to change my security options to password to be told that it is much better to have a pin for security reasons and accessing my accounts and store and so on.&nbsp; So Microsoft are you out there?&nbsp; Are
 you listening and are you going to answer this question because I am unable to access any of my printers from my laptop or anything at the moment and it is a bloody nuisance?&nbsp; Another time consuming exercise compliments of Windows 10. I wonder how much time
 I have wasted trying to resolve problems so far........I dread to think.&nbsp; Setting up a new computer has never taken so long.&nbsp; I look forward hopefully to a speedy response! Thank you!

<h2>            Skype - What have you done &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After a solid 13 years with Skype - an update occured that has me now searching for a new VOIP provider - why has this happened, why are there so many bad reviews of the new release and why is no-one at Skype listening to the complaints?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to have Skype back the way it was, when I could add new contacts or see which contacts are on line but it seems these two basic functions are no longer important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was a very sad day when this update was forced upon us. &nbsp;Skype, please reconsider. &nbsp;If you can't reconsider then please remember those failed and long forgotten dinosoaurs like Bebo, Myspace etc who all died a death.</p>

            I can't believe what MS has done too the android skype client. I've been a loyal paying customer for years. You have destroyed the functionality of the client. Unbelievable. Why would you remove functionality like people's status. And the icons are terrible
 too. Frustrated and angry user. Give me the old client back pls.

<p>This is amazing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can you take a great product which has no problems and turn it into rubbish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did anyone who even used Skype test the new version and actually say it was good to be released?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype now does not meet a minimum viable product. So i will have to stop paying for it and move to another package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and reverted back again but as soon as I cannot revert back I will have to stop using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant easily see if I am online or if anyone else is online. This is a minimum viable feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same goes for the desktop version its unusable and i have to revert back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets hope tbey allow old versions for a long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A simple understanding of the core requirements would have been a great start.</p>

            I can tell you what they did.&nbsp; They took a great app and turned it into a pile of poo.&nbsp; When mine updated I uninstalled the stinky mess and was able to download the old version from the Amazon app store.&nbsp; They probably updated that one by now also.&nbsp; I
 turned off auto update and will stop using skype when I am forced to update or find some other app that ties into skype.

<p>Everyone knew that Skype was going to die a slow and painful death when Microsoft bought it. &nbsp; So charging huge amounts for their product. Making changes to things that no one wants. &nbsp;Then not having customer service to address the problems that they create
 with unwanted changes. &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh and try calling customer service. &nbsp;Surprise you will quickly learn there is NONE. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am tired of how Microsoft inflicts us with unwanted, undesired, and unusable changes. &nbsp;Looks like they want people to go to other social networks and VOIP formats.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />If that does not work then try: 
<br />
<br />Right click your email/mail you're trying to send &gt; click send to &gt; mail recipient 
<br />
<br />Does it still throw an error? 
<br />

                    installed Windows server 2008 R2 SP1 64-bits and want to analyze user defined characters for which I got EUDC.TTE file. I placed it in Windows/Fonts folder and now when I tried to find eudcedit.exe for which usually should be in Windows/System32 folder
 is not present.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So i cannot proceed in my investigation for these user defined characters.&nbsp;</div>

<div>The actual issue is printing these characters though our application, which am investigating.</div>

<h2>            Cant get onto my whatsap&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a windows phone and cannot get onto my whatsap. Its asking me to install the latest update, but when I try to do&nbsp;this its asking me for my password for my live.com account. I don't know what the password is to this so cannot install the update
 and get my whatsap back on. Theres no option to change the password or say ive forgotten it. When ive gone on google to change my account its just sending me to change my Hotmail email address password but that account is Hotmail.com and this one on the whatsap
 is saying my name...then @live.com </p>
<p>Hope this makes sense, and if anyone can help I will be delighted! I&nbsp;have 9 messages that I cannot see and its driving me insane lol</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

 does not have a option for more than one page. </p>

<h3> karen-5960  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is it that when I run a Defragmentation it only goes to 3&#37; and stops.</h2>
                    1.&nbsp; When I try to run a defrag on my computer hard drive C: it begins and stops after 3%.&nbsp;
<br />
2.&nbsp; Recently I have had to go through the shutdown process twice every time before my computer will shut down.&nbsp; After the second try it always shuts down, but not before giving me a message that it can't read memeo and asks me if I want to close it.<br />
3.&nbsp; I am networked via wifi with an HP Printer and sometimes it prints and sometimes it totally ignores me.<br />
<br />
I don't know if all of these problems are related, but I thought the defrag might help and then it wouldn't perform the defrag past 3%.&nbsp; I tried shutting my computer down for several hours before trying again, but to no avail.&nbsp; I tried to do a "Clean-up &amp; Shutdown"
 from my desktop icon and it too reached 3% in the defrag and would go no further.<br />

<h2>            I messed up my drivers using a 3rd party program. Inputmapper&#47;scpds3</h2>
                    <p>Hello beautiful people of the world wide web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I was using Inputmapper, as the greedy man that I am I used a different program ( scp ds3 ) because I was told that one had less input lag.</p>
<p>I couldn't get SCP to work, but in the process it changed many drivers. I tried to fix this manually, with the help of several others to no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically what happened was Inputmapper worked fine &gt; my greed messed up drivers to use scp &gt; went back to inputmapper &gt; inputmapper doesn't work anymore. ( Doesn't recognize controller )&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted inputmapper itself, but they haven't responded, and I'd like this issue resolved so I can enjoy pc gaming again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that steam offers Dualshock 4 support, but Origin ( Fifa 17 ) doesn't..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance to anyone willing to help..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in quite a pickle..</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>At this point, the drivers may not function correctly while in a normal state. We suggest booting your computer in

</p>
<p>
</p><p>These steps will effectively "clean" the computer. If we come across an error code with SFC or DISM, we can start troubleshooting from there.</p>

<p>It seems the third-party program has permanently tampered with the drivers. To confirm, were all affected drivers updated while in clean boot? If yes, and you're still unable to the controller, we will need to

            Hi Daniel.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try to Reset and Repair Photos app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Photos app &gt; Advanced Options.  Your pictures will be safe in the User Pictures folder.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try re-registering the Photos app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can try a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback and may interact with you.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>When trying to launch the Netflix App and our Hulu App through our Xbox 360 game console; we also get the error code 80004005. Netflix was launching ok 2 days ago (can't confirm is Hulu was or not), &nbsp;but as of yesterday, 1/15/2015, we've been getting the
 code &nbsp; &nbsp;In the past 2 years, we've never experienced this error before. &nbsp;Gold membership is current, as well as Netflix and Hulu memberships. &nbsp;We haven't changed internet service providers and other mobile devices i the house are not having issues with the
 Wif service. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
