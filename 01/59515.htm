    <title>Miracast to Samsung TV is ABSOLUTELY BROKEN after Windows10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> je_22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Miracast to Samsung TV is ABSOLUTELY BROKEN after Windows10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 3 that has the latest drivers and Windows 10 updates. Prior to upgrading to Windows 10, I could miracast from my laptop to my Samsung Smart TV without an issue. Since Windows 10 was installed, I have not been able to connect. I see many
 people reporting the same issue and even Samsung's support site indicates that Miracast is broken on Windows 10. So, when will Microsoft fix this issue? I relied on this feature heavily. Is there an ETA? I would like to know, before I revert back to Windows
 8.1.</p>

<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
What is the model number of Samsung TV?<br />
<br />
Miracast is a wireless technology your PC can use to project your screen to TVs, projectors and streaming media players that also support Miracast. You can use this to share what you‚Äôre doing on your PC, present a slide show or even play your favourite game
 on a larger screen.<br />
<br />
If your TV is compatible with Windows 10, then I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
Projecting to a wireless display with Miracast (Applies to Windows 10)<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-8/project-wireless-screen-miracast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-8/project-wireless-screen-miracast</span></a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I have already done what you recommended that is why I posted the original comment. What has Microsoft done in Windows 10 to prevent this from working? Again, it worked in Windows 8.1, so I know it is an issue with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I ask, when will Microsoft have a fix for this or should a reverse my upgrade?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>FYI, for anyone else considering the Windows 10 upgrade and projects to a Samsung TV:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to Samsung's Windows 10 Upgrade document:</p>
<p>http://www.samsung.com/us/windows10/upgrade_windows10.pdf</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search for Miracast and you will find the exact problem:</p>
<p>"Miracast does not connect after Windows 10 upgrade or the screen closes or does not appear even after connecting"<br />
</p>
<p>Their resolution:</p>
<p><strong>"You should not upgrade to Windows 10 until Miracast is stable. "</strong></p>

            <p>Microsoft, I'm also experiencing this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question was asked 27th Aug, it's now 15th Sep and still not resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your patronising reply wasn't much help, as I suspect like myself most people with this issue will be well familiar with the process for connecting to Miracast.</p>
<p>

<p><span><span>Hi choi agus,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. When exactly do you get the blue screen?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. What‚Äôs the exact blue screen error message/code, if any?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>A crash can be caused by due to a lot of reasons. A few of them being the following:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. An outdated or misbehaving device driver.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Computer virus.</span></p>
<p><span>3. A corrupted program.</span></p>
<p><span>4. A problem with your computer's memory.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Hard disk or motherboard is corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, let‚Äôs boot into
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/what-is-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>safe mode</span></a> (to confirm if any third-party application is causing the blue screen crash) and check if the computer continues to crash and to verify
 if the <strong><span>issue persists.
</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft article for more information on how to log in to safe mode:</span></p>

<h2>            Blue Screen When WiFi Connecting &#123;Fix Included In Post&#125;</h2>
                    Problem:&nbsp;Blue Screen When Connecting To Wireless Networks/Routers
<div>
<div>Reason: Optional Windows Update To WiFi Card</div>
<div>- Update Name: Qualcomm Atheros Communications Inc. - Network - Qualcomm Atheros AR5007 802.11b/g WiFi Adapter</div>
<div>- Size 2.9MB</div>
<div>- Release Date: June 2012/Publish Date: July, 4, 2012</div>

<div>Fix: Roll Back WiFi Card Driver</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Computer Used/Had This Issue On</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;Compaq Presario C700 - (Windows Vista Home Premium OEMact)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upgraded To&nbsp;- (Windows 7 Pofessional {SP1})</div>
<div>- Intel(R) Pentium(R) Dual CPU T2370 @ 1.73GHz 1.73 GHz</div>
<div>- 2.00 GB RAM</div>
<div>- 32-bit System</div>
<div>

<div>Story/Description:</div>
<div>When you go to windows update you have important and optional updates right, i&nbsp;usually&nbsp;always do both, to help ensue proper and peek operation. But one thing i never expected was the "blue screen
 of death" caused by and WINDOWS UPDATE!!!! Seriously!!!! anyways fare warning and hopefully a fix in the near future.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyways, here is the issue. Under optional updates i&nbsp;receive the option to update my wireless card driver and maybe some other minor things associated with the WiFi operation. So i figure ok,
 click, and off i go, checked update history first all updates&nbsp;successful, awesome,&nbsp;everything's&nbsp;great right........wrong! The next day i try and connect to a router and i hit connect and 1 sec later BAM! Blue Screen, Process Dump, Computer restarts???????
 WTF lol.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I try three different routers/internet connections and the same thing happens. Come to find out for some reason the error codes later found in my c:/windows/minidump is info to suggest the driver,
 so i go in and roll back the driver, go to networks, hit connect "hold my breath" and presto, it connects, no crashing, no issues, nothing, just flawless connecting.</div>
<div>This was also tested on multiple networks and to date have no issues. Hopefully someone somewhere and get this issue fixed before many people are left with no way to connect to routers and get
 access when they need it. Because not everyone knows how to fix these issues like i do.</div>

            Just FYI - the driver uploaded to Windows Update for 3rd party products are provided by the 3rd party manufacturer (or the OEM of the system in some cases).&nbsp; As I recall these are accepted by Microsoft without being tested.<br />
<br />
As such I recommend NEVER updating drivers through Windows Update.<br />
I also don't recommend updating them from the OEM website unless the 3rd party developer doesn't offer them on it's website.<br />

<h2>            Scratch Disk Error</h2>
                    I get the same problem! Lucky I bought the Warranty from EB Games so I exchanged the disk for a brand spanking new one (with no scratch) I come back home and first thing I do is install the game on a USB flash drive so I don't have to use the DVD. During
 the installation I kept getting a scratch disk error.... I'm thinking What?!?! so I tried a trick using wood furniture cleaner (like Pinesol) and buffed it out nice and waxing and shinny and let it dry and try again... IT WORKED! I got the game to install
 and played for about an hour and a half Unfortunately I was online and right after the game when you see the UNSC eagle spinning around the game lagged and gave me a scratch disk error. I noticed the brand new copy starting to get an identical scratch along
 it that my old one had. I'm 99% sure its the laser lens (I did try cleaning it) I think its just starting to malfunction although all my other games work just fine (assassins creed, Injustice etc etc) so what can I do now? there is

<p>If it is an older model 360 the laser mechanism may burn a ring into the disc if the console is moved. Also is it laying flat or standing up? Laying the console on its side also helps to reduce the risk of laser burn.</p>

<p>You wont be able to get another persons gamertag even if it is inactive for a long time. Would be nice because there's some names I wanted in the past that are taken to this day by inactive profiles, but that's life. Maybe one of these days XBL will clear
 out inactive profiles that haven been absent for around 5 years. I think that'd be a great idea.

There was one particular gamertag that I wanted a few years back, decided to search the name as it said it was taken. According to Xbox Live, there was no user with that name. I didn't understand why it wouldn't let me have it but oh well, they should do
 clean sweeps though. Just automatically switch unused gamertags back to something like "Ambientdinosaur6" or something stupid.

<p>Some gamertags might not seem to be taken but are because they exist with different spacing.<br />

For example the gamertag <strong>vote DC</strong> will show as free by gamertag checkers and you wont find it on this site. However you'll be unable to claim it because my gamertag,

The LIVE system sees both of those as the same thing.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> danbartol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatic Update deleted all my files&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Last night my laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium Edition 64-bit on a Dell Inspirion Laptop performed an automatic update. After rebooting, all my personal files including two 15 page papers I was working on for my degree were deleted.
<br />
All my pictures, word docs, and personal files&nbsp;are gone. Only the shell of My Documents folder, including the sub folders I created,&nbsp;is left.
<br />
I ran the System Restore going back to a two day old restore point, but non of my personal files were recovered.
<br />
I searced the internet w/ " Windows automatic updates deleted/erased all my files" and came up w/ several threads reporting this automatic update issue, but no solutions.
<br />
&nbsp;Similar questions have been asked in other parts of this forum w/out satisfactory answers:

</a><br />
<em>&lt;removed link&gt;</em><br />
I even displayed all hidden folders and searched the entire hard drive w/ <strong>
*.doc</strong> and did not get a single file back! <br />
<strong>I need help!</strong> <br />
My papers are due in a week and all my course work is gone.</p>

<p><span>Losing your personal files is a serious problem.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Visit the Microsoft
</span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=242148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Virus Solution and Security Center</span></a><span>
</span><span>for resources and tools to keep your PC safe and healthy.&nbsp; If you are having issues with installing the update itself, visit

 for resources and tools to keep your PC updated with the latest updates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>It can be downloaded from here:<span>&nbsp;

</span>It can be used to retrieve files that seem to have been permanently deleted.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have used this program several times with great results. You will have the best results if you run this program as soon as possible after the accidental deletion.</span>
<p><span>I hope you are able to retrieve your data.<span>&nbsp; </span>It also serves as a reminder that System Restore will not actually restore your user files; it‚Äôs only for system files and settings.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To backup your data files, you need to use Windows Backup or some other backup program.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck,</span></p>

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>Have you been able to recover your data?&nbsp; If not, I have another idea (I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier).&nbsp; Although I stand by my previous statement that just running System Restore will not restore your user files; the act of creating a restore
 point creates "Previous Versions" of files and folders.&nbsp; All you need to do is right-click on the folder your data was located in (or the folder above) and choose
<strong>Properties</strong>.&nbsp; Click on the <strong>Previous Versions</strong> tab.&nbsp; Find the restore date you manually ran before the data disappeared and click
<strong>Open</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you will see now are what's called <strong>Shadow Copies</strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can copy files or folders from this window to the location you would like to have them restored to. Make sure to close the window when you are done, so you don't confuse the Shadow
 Copies with your current files/folders.&nbsp; If you look carefully at the address bar, you'll notice it includes the date and time of the restore point as well as the folder names.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would be a better resolution than the Restoration program above.&nbsp; You'd only need to run that program if no restore points are available.</p>
<p>Barbara</p>

<blockquote>Last night [28 Apr-10] my laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium Edition 64-bit on a Dell Inspirion Laptop performed an automatic update.</blockquote>
<p><br />
Please answer each of the following questions by number in your reply:</p>
<p>1. Had you upgraded to Win7 64-bit (from, e.g., Vista 64-bit) or is it a brand-new laptop&nbsp;that came with Win7 64-bit preinstalled
<em>by Dell</em>?</p>
<p>2. Is your computer still under Warranty or Service Contract?</p>
<p>3a. What anti-virus application or security suite is installed and is your subscription current?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Windows Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>3b. Has a(another) Norton or McAfee application <em>ever</em> been installed on the computer (e.g., a free-trial version that came preinstalled when you bought it)?</p>
<p>4. Were you working on one or both of the "two 15 page papers" when the reboot prompt appeared? If so, did you close both files before you rebooted?</p>
<p>5. Had all previous updates installed via Automatic Updates successfully?</p>
<p>6. Click on/open <strong>Start | Control Panel | System And Maintenance</strong> (If you are using Classic View, skip this step)
<strong>| Programs &amp; Features | Installed Updates</strong>: Is <strong>Security Update for Windows 7 64-bit (KB979683)</strong> listed? If it is, what's the Installation date displayed?</p>
<p>7. Click on/open <strong>Start | Control Panel | Programs | Turn Windows features on or off</strong> (If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation): Is the
<strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong> dialog box blank/empty?</p>

            The same thing happened to my daughter's&nbsp;Windows 7 Home Premium Edition 64-bit on a Dell Inspirion Laptop. &nbsp;The update was pushed last night, 24 August 2010. &nbsp;I am waiting for her to get out of class to assist her remotely. &nbsp;First thing this happens after
 owning 3 Laptops (Acer, Gateway, Sony) and multiple desktops running XP, Vista, and Win 7. &nbsp;All the work I completed to get her ready for college gone thanks to a Recommended Windows update. &nbsp;At least she learned a valuable lesson two days into her freshman
 college experience. &nbsp;I will be back if I can't resolve to visit the links. &nbsp;Thanks to all of you! &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I click on the upload button, select the file and start the upload, then nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see the clock icon indicating the upload is happening, but that is it. I've waited for up to an hour with no action. The progress display shows 0 bytes of 13 MB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Task manager shows 0% disk use and 0% network use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I can download from that same onedrive&nbsp; folder to the same computer.&nbsp; So I do have a good internet connection. I have uploaded files to that OneDrive folder in the past.

<p>Hi Joseph:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took a look at that page. This is not a Sync issue. I am manually uploading the file. I don't use onedrive sync at all.&nbsp; I have done manual uploads from this computer to this onedrive account in the past, no signficant changes since then.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 file is about 15mb, so it is way below the limit</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2</p>
<p>-not using sync</p>
<p>- not using sync, so I don't need a Windows account connecting to Onedrive account. I manually logged in to OneDrive and initiated the upload from Onedrive.</p>
<p>- no Onedrvie app to finish setting up</p>
<p>- no sync folders being used</p>
<p>- no Office upload</p>
<p>- file path OK</p>
<p>- I have permissions to folder/file</p>
<p>- no same name in onedrive</p>
<p>- lots of disk space</p>
<p>- no onedrive app</p>
<p>-I did run the rest Onedrive command (even though I'm not using onedrive app)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- The Onedrive troubleshooter does not work on Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I also looked at this other page:</p>
<p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fix-problems-uploading-files-on-the-OneDrive-website-9afcc4a0-e344-4bc9-9c9d-59d3e802247e</p>
<p>
</p><p>nothing there helped either</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then again, I guess I'm not. I can't get their "Feedback" form.&nbsp; Probably related.
</p>
<p>I'm contacting OneDrve support directly </p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;edit&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I can't contact OneDrive support using the link, I submitted directly to OneDrive</p>

</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was added on a previous occasion, try adding the account again and check if it fixes the issue. Probably, the account is not added properly. Before adding the account again, run the app troubleshooter and check if it finds and fixes issues with the
 apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the link and follow the steps to un the troubleshooter. If the troubleshooter doesn't work, uninstall and reinstall Mail app to try and fix the issue. You can find the steps mentioned under section "Reinstall the app"</p>

<p><span>Go to your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer Manufacturer's website &gt; Drivers and Downloads Section &gt; Key in your Model number &gt; Look for latest Vista Drivers
 for it &gt; Download/install them.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>

<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            My monitor has stopped working.</h2>
                    My monitor will work for about 30 seconds then just go black. I turn it back and the same thing happens. At this point I just want to use my tv as a monitor but I'm having trouble with that. I would appreciate some help.

            <p>I am guessing that your monitor is over 5 years....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Flat screen LED monitors built in those days had fluorescent back lights in them.&nbsp; That light will wear out and when it does, your screen goes to black.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since that time, all monitors come with LED back lights which last much longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line, you probably need a new monitor.&nbsp; 24" is the sweet spot right now.&nbsp; Cost is about $140.</p>

<h2>            Unable to play any video games after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am unable to play any video games after Windows 10 upgrade; which I was able to play previously on Windows 8.1. Below is my system configuration:</p>
<p>-Windows 10 OS (64-bit)</p>
<p>-6 GB RAM</p>
<p>-2 GB Intel Graphics</p>
<p>-2 GB NVIDIA GEFORCE GT 740M</p>
<p>- Intel Core i5 3230M CPU 2.6 GHZ</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I tried to resolve this issue(didnt work out):</p>
<p>- Re-installing games</p>
<p>- Re-instaling NVIDIA graphics drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is system is able to load the game in RAM; but however graphics processing after it is really slow that person cannot play a game with that speed. Its like slow-mo video with frame rate decreased to its lowest limit possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is frustrating me a lot as I am hardcore gamer. Please help me ASAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Abhijeet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several reasons which can cause this error in your computer. One of these is a corrupted or missing system file. You may run the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System File Checker</a> to identify and troubleshoot this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also follow the steps through <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fix Windows Update errors by using the DISM or System Update Readiness tool</a> to check for any update errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another troubleshooting method is to perform the Clean boot on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean Boot temporarily disables all third party applications as well as all Microsoft non-essential services so only basic drivers will run. This will help us find any third-party software which can be the cause of this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From <strong>Start</strong>, search for msconfig</li><li>Select <strong>System Configuration</strong> from the search results.</li><li>On the Services tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click to select the
<strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box, and then tap or click <strong>
Disable all</strong>.</li><li>On the Startup tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click Open <strong>
Task Manager</strong>.</li><li>On the Startup tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong>Disable</strong>.</li><li>Close Task Manager.</li><li>On the Startup tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click <strong>
OK</strong>, and then restart the computer.</li></ol>

</p><p>Note: Please check if your power option is set to "Performance" before launching any games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Sorry for late reply. I have tried everything which is said above; but still no luck.</p>
<p>I am thinking of "factory reset"(reinstalling Windows 10) OR "go back to previous build"(which is Windows 8.1 in my case) options.</p>
<p>Please suggest which option should I take.</p>

<p>Windows Live Mail is the new name for the 2010 edition of Windows Mail. &nbsp;Due to legal pressure, they were not allowed to include it with Windows, so they re-named it and made it an optional download. &nbsp;You can get it at http://get.live.com for free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Don't let the name fool you: &nbsp;you do not have to have or use a Windows Live email account to use this program. &nbsp;In fact, I use it with my Google and Yahoo email services entirely.</p>

<blockquote>where do you set up windows mail. not windows live microsoft windows e-mial</blockquote>
<p><br />
Windows Mail as in Vista? And you want to use this in Windows 7?</p>
<p>First, you need access to a Vista machine.</p>
<p>On the Win7 machine, find the "Windows Mail" folder in Program Files. Rename it to "OldWindows Mail" as a precaution.</p>
<p>Using a Flash or CD, copy the "Windows Mail" folder in its entirety from the Vista machine.</p>
<p>Go back to the Win7 machine and copy the "Windows Mail" from the Flash or CD to a location in Program Files.</p>
<p>Open it and right click on the WinMail.exe file and send a shortcut to the Desktop. Done.</p>
<p>A few caveats: EML and NWS files will not open in WinMail, but rather another e-mail client that you will need to have. WinMail also cannot be made the default mail or news client.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi Cotton Ball,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>For Windows 7, .NET Framework 3.5 with SP1 is shipped with it as one of OS component.<br />
For .NET Framework 3.5 with SP1, it includes .NET 2.0 with SP2 and .NET 3.0 with SP2 as prerequisite.<br />
This means, you&nbsp;have the <strong><span>.NET Framework 2.0 SP2, 3.0 SP2 and 3.5 SP1</span></strong> plus a few post 3.5 SP1 bug fixes on&nbsp;Windows 7. They are&nbsp;<strong><span>OS
 components</span></strong>.&nbsp;.NET 3.0 SP2 and 3.5 SP1 can be added or removed via the Programs and Features control panel.<br />
Thus, we don't need to manually install them. That's why you received the error message when you tried to install .NET&nbsp;2.0 on Windows 7.<br />
For more information, please check: </span><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2007/03/14/mailbag-what-version-of-the-net-framework-is-included-in-what-version-of-the-os.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2007/03/14/mailbag-what-version-of-the-net-framework-is-included-in-what-version-of-the-os.aspx</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>As for your concern, please&nbsp;use
</span><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/pages/8999004.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Verification Tool</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;to verify .Net Framework 2.0. If .Net Framework 2.0&nbsp;cannot
 be verified on your computer, you can try to follow the steps mentioned in the following blog to repair the .NET Framework 2.0 on Windows 7.<br />
See: <br />

 apply for Windows 7) <br />
If .NET Framework 2.0 can be verified, we can isolate the possible cause of corrupted .NET Framework 2.0.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also, I would suggest you to check if you have .NET Framework 3.5.1 check box selected</span><span><span>
 in control panel - Program and Features in the option </span><span><strong>Turn Windows features on or off.

 7 USB/DVD Download Tool in conjunction with my previously made ISO file.&nbsp; Downloaded and installed this Tool, then made a new DVD using this Tool, but when I try and run the installation from the laptop's DVD drive it says Bootmgr is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can some kindly tell me whether or not it is possible to create a Windows 7 installation DVD that will install to a USB hard disk drive.&nbsp; And if so, the exact steps as to how to do it...</p>

</p><p>Sorry if I did not make myself clear enough.&nbsp; Windows 7 will not run on an external USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your laptop have a second internal drive compartment, if so you can purchase a drive, install it in the compartment and install Windows to it. You will then have a "Dual Boot" system. When you turn on the laptop you will see a menu, just pick which
 version of Windows 7 you want to use.</p>

            <p>Ok, thanks for clearing that up.&nbsp; Strange, as several sites on the Internet claim it can be done...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it does have a compartment and a SATA connector for an internal drive but unfortunately, whilst I can install Windows 7 onto a hard disk drive in this position, I then cannot 'see' the inbuilt LITE-ON SSD 256Gb drive.&nbsp; That drive 'disappears' from the
 BIOS the minute a conventional SATA HDD is attached up to the internal connector.&nbsp; There do not appear to be any options in the BIOS that I can see, that will allow BOTH drives to be visible.&nbsp; Seems to be either or.&nbsp; Hence my reason for trying to see if an
 external USB HDD would work...</p>

            <p>Windows 7 does not support install on external USB drives, the interface is not supported. Also, the performance would be terrible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to install it on an internal attached hard disk. </p>

            <p>To J W Stuart, here are a couple of links I traced back, although I did read many others earlier:-</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To Andre Da Costa,&nbsp; yes, I appreciate performance would be real slow, but I needed to find a way to try and recover lost data on the crashed SSD drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I stated before, yes, I can fit an internal SATA drive and I can successfully install Win-7 on it, but the Acer BIOS will seemingly not allow both drives (SSD and SATA) to function

<h2>            Sister can&#39;t join my world on Minecraft both windows 10 edition</h2>
                    <p>Hi, so I decided to buy Minecraft in the windows store so I could play with my sister, she used my account to install Minecraft onto her PC, Logged into our own Xbox accounts friended each other and when I went to start up a world i'd invite her and she would join wait about 10 seconds to say that she was 'Unable to connect to the world'.. we tried vice versa, me joining her world but nothing.. I've tried searching for this problem on Youtube and other forums but it was all firewall java etc. but we had to windows 10 edition.&nbsp; Someone suggested to make a realm but I currently don't have the money to afford it. I've successfully joined my friend who was playing the pocket edition on his iPad and worked without failure and vice versa, but my sister can't join my world.</p>
