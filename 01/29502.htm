<h2>            magicJack not working with Windows 7 Home Premium.</h2>
                    <p>magicJack will not run in Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; After TEN chats with their Tech Support, they got it working, but I have to manually install the program every time I restart my computer.&nbsp; Please Microsoft, get those people at magicJack up to speed with
 Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>Again, I could never get the magicJack to install completely.&nbsp; I tried it on a friend's computer with XP and it worked fine.&nbsp; So, the problem is with the new Windows&nbsp;7 Home Premium, and magicJack is taking their good old time to get up to speed.</p>
<p>I tried the Troubleshooter and picked XP SP2 which should have worked, but Win 7 told me it was not compatible.</p>
<p>Anybody with similar problems?&nbsp; magicJack's tech support is pretty bad.&nbsp; You get what you pay for, AT&amp;T.</p>

            In reality, it's not Microsoft's job to make sure third-party suppliers are "up to speed".&nbsp; They should do their research.&nbsp; Windows 7 has been available for a while now and there has been ample time for the magicjack's developers to have obtained a copy
 and corrected their problems.&nbsp; Your beef is entirely with the magicjack developers.

<h2>            .Net 4.6.1 Updates Fail on Windows 7 With Error 0x648</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am responsible for updating ~1200 Windows 7 PCs using WSUS, and recently I have observed that many PCs are failing to install .NET Framework 4.6.1 updates. &nbsp;The error code returned is usually 648 (or 0x648), and looking into the update logs in %temp% it
 appears that the updates fail because the MSI evaluates the PC as having .NET 4.6, *not* 4.6.1 - which I base on errors such as the following which appear throughout the log:</p>
<br />
MsiDeterminePatchSequence failed for product code {94A631D5-B30A-3DD8-B65C-1117C09DA73E}, error: 1605
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this at the end:</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I manually uninstall .NET I can then reinstall it (along with the failing updates) from WSUS and it correctly recognizes the .NET version:</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the next month, any .NET 4.6.1 update will fail because it attempts to install to 4.6. &nbsp;I have checked everything I can think of and can find no reference to 4.6 anywhere on the systems:</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">Thanks for your response - I've tried following those steps, and while it does remove .NET from the system I get exactly the same problem again. &nbsp;Once I reinstall .NET 4.6.1 I am offered 6 security updates. &nbsp;If I install all 6 together,
 they will work, but if I install 5 of them, reboot, and try to install the 6th it will fail with error 648 again:</p>

            <p>Hi Jayant,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help with this - my testing time is a little limited at the moment, so I'm trying to work through the various suggestions in the different links and will let you know when that is complete! &nbsp;So far, the only possibility I have found
 is that there are sometimes entries for .NET 4.6 install files under the&nbsp;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Compatibility Assistant\Persisted registry key. &nbsp;However, when I have asked users to remove these values
 and retry the updates, it still gives the same error. </p>
<p>There was previously a GPO active to install .NET 4.6 to some PCs, and it seems to be mostly these ones that now return the error. &nbsp;Could it be that something is stuck in the registry as a result, and this is causing the clients to fail to determine the
 actual installed version of .NET (which is now definitely 4.6.1)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tom</p>

            <p>Hi Jayant,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been through the various tests and still nothing has resolved the error. &nbsp;However, I have confirmed that the affected machines are those that previously had the group policy applied - new desktops are able to update ok.. &nbsp;So, is it possible that there
 are values stored elsewhere in the registry that cause windows update these problems? &nbsp;Is there anything you can suggest that I could do to identify this? &nbsp;Re-imaging 1000 machines is not really an option, plus I would like to understand why this error is
 occurring so I can avoid it in future...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Jayant,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sticking with me on this, it's a very tricky issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't seem to matter what user account is used (new or old) the problem only occurs on PCs which previously had the GPO applied, and not on new ones - so, for example, a new account will fail when trying to update a PC that formerly had the GPO, but
 succeed on a newly imaged one. &nbsp;Therefore it cannot be the user accounts. &nbsp;Could the GPO have put something in the HKLM hive that we haven't found yet, and when windows update looks at it causes it to incorrectly identify the installed version of .NET? &nbsp;The
 GPO in question installed .NET 4.6 using a simple batch script and <strong>netfx_Full_x64.msi&nbsp;</strong>as the install file. &nbsp;Is there anything this could do to interfere with updates? &nbsp;The GPO is no longer applied, and an SFC scan shows only "diskmgt.CHM"
 as a corrupted file which is successfully repaired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tom</p>

            <p>Hi Again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else you can suggest for this? Maybe something that specifically deals with how Windows Update identifies which version of .Net is installed and how that translates into misidentifying 4.6 being installed instead of 4.6.1? &nbsp;I really can't
 think of anything else to look at, and I'm hoping there might be some .Net experts there who can help! &nbsp;Let me know if there is any other info I can provide (logs, registry values or the like)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

                    After my laptop wrong shut down (low battery), every start after "Starting windows" i get this message:

<div>Checking file system on \\7\volume{b4ca2094-965b-11e2-820d-806e6f6e6963}</div>
<div>The type of the file system is FAT32.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>One of your disks needs to be checked for consistency. You may cancel the disk check, but it is strongly recommended that you continue.</div>
<div>And then it goes in a 1 second: disk checking has been cancelled. It just can't check.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried regedit (<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">BootExecute со autocheck autoch)</span>, chkntfs /x c:, chkdsk. Nothing works. And it just don't want to check or cancel that message.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Help me. And no, I will not reinstall windows. Everything is perfect now except this. I don't want to.</div>

<p>I am using windows 10, in my laptop there two unnamed processes in task manager, which use too much CPU and laptop gets heated heavily.</p>
<p>When end the task, system will restart by showing "critical process died".&nbsp; If I open the details it shows as 'svchost' and file location is windows&gt;SysWOW64. Can you help with this. Is it a virus?<br />
Those processes run only when internet is on.</p>

                    I am trying to connect my Mac (macOS Mojave 10.14.5) to my work pc via VPN and Microsoft Remote Desktop. VPN will connect, but I keep getting Error code 0x204. If I create a hotspot on my iPhone and use this to connect it works. How can I connect without
 using the hotspot?

            Hi Tracy 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />I would first of all make sure you are using the latest version of the Remote Desktop app. I had issues connecting from my Mac to Windows 10, but later discovered it was due to having an outdated versions.

<p>I downloaded the app this past week (version 10.2.13)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took my Mac into work to get my IT person to set it up. She used her phone as a hot spot and it worked fine. I brought it home, and it gave me the 0x204 error. When I tried using my phone as a hotspot it worked. I can't seem to get it to work over my internet,
 but the VPN seems to connect fine.</p>

            Make sure Remote Desktop is able to communicate through your firewall.
<br />
<br />Find the IP address of the computer on your home network that you want to connect to.
<br />
<br />Open your router's configuration screen and forward TCP port 3389 to the destination computer's IP address.
<br />
<br />Find your router's public IP address so that Remote Desktop can find it on the Internet.
<br />
<br />Here are steps how you might be able to log into your router:

            Lets try to completely uninstall OneDrive: 
<br />1. Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode: Right-click on the Windows icon in the taskbar and select Command Prompt (Admin). 
<br />2. Type in taskkill /f /im OneDrive.exe to terminate any OneDrive processes and hit Enter. 
<br />Then type in either %SystemRoot%\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 32-bit Windows 10 or %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 64-bit Windows 10 and hit Enter. 
<br />
<br />
<br />After that Go to RegEdit on this path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive 
<br />You can remove all folders that include One Drive version 
<br />Account folders also can be removed 
<br />After that restart the pc and install One Drive latest version 18.091.0506.0007 from this link

<p>You don't have to download the entire Windows Essentials. &nbsp;When you run the setup, it will ask what you want to install. &nbsp;Just clear out the checkboxes for everything except for "Photo Gallery &amp; Movie Maker", so that only that is installed without the other
 stuff like Mail/Messenger/Writer/etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get the download from <a href="http://get.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://get.live.com</a> -- but be warned that these programs are offerred "as is" and are discontinued (and the download link itself will be gone in January). &nbsp;You can keep using them if you already have them, but they won't be offered for download after that.</p>

    <title>Scroll Up and Down on Mouse Pad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> newcomer 7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scroll Up and Down on Mouse Pad</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is Packard Bell EasyNote TS. Not sure since when I cannot scroll up or down by doing "friction" on it. I usually use a Microsoft wireless mouse but occasionally I use the mouse pad. So trying to sort this out. Have tried this: right click on personalise,
 change mouse pointer, look at ELAN - can see that Elan smart pad Enabled. If look at Option, Scrolling and Edge Scroll have been checked although "auto-scroll" is unchecked (I don't know what auto scroll is anyway). Tried to check auto-scroll but made no difference.</p>
<p>Advice please?</p>

            <p>Thanks Ganesh</p>
<p>I tried Method 1.&nbsp; There were a few optional update including Microsoft hardware USB mouse (or keyboard).&nbsp; So I did the mouse one.&nbsp; No change afterwards.</p>
<p>Then I tried Method 2 and opened the compability centre, typed in packard bell easynote ts, but not sure what to do next.</p>
<p>To answer your first two questions, yes, it was working properly.&nbsp; Since I use the wireless mouse most of the time, I do not know when this problem started.</p>
<p>Since, I do not know when this started, I cannot tell if I have made any change.&nbsp; However, basically I do not make any change except the usual stuff such as windows update, security essential update, backup, cleanup and defragment.</p>

            <p>Hi Ganesh,</p>
<p>I would first try updating the mouse drivers directly from the OEM website.</p>
<p>2nd I would remove all updates made before this issue popped up.</p>
<p>If neither of those work, do a system restore back to before the updates...don't forget to turn off automatic system updates.</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
1. Did you set up any network password&nbsp;earlier?&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Have you made any software or hardware changes to your computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div><br />
To work with the issue, refer these methods.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<strong>
<div><br />
</strong>Run the troubleshooter from the following link.

<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
Disable both Antivirus and firewall.<br />

<strong>Note</strong>: Make sure you enable the antivirus software, other security programs and firewall after the test.<br />

<strong>Warning</strong>:<br />
Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're
 done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>

<p>Yea, unfortunately you kinda *** yourself if you took the console apart. You could try to look for a local shop that does 360 repairs, or perhaps even Google it, but MS will not offer you any type of repairs now if you've opened the system.
</p>
<p>If you keep an eye out though, it's not hard to find a decent slim for $100~ on eBay or Amazon.com.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Lock Screen slideshow switches back to Picture</h2>
                    <p>As title says - I want to use a slideshow for my lock screen. I specify a folder with pictures. If I lock the screen, the slideshow seems to be working. However, after some time (either if a screen is locked for some time, or even without locking) I find
 the loking screen using a static picture. If I go to the Lock Screen personalization, the Background is indeed set to Picture again. What could possibly cause this behaviour? I tried removing and adding the folder again. It contains jpg images in it.</p>
<p>I use the same folder for Background slideshow (changes every day), and it seems to be working normally without switching back to Picture.</p>
