            I am sorry But I am old school and I struggle with the computer. The little blinking Ibeam is too wide I was told that is the insertion point well mine is too large (wide) and I would like to learn how to make it standard or smaller. Is this the place
 to find the answer? Thanks

            <p>I have a similar issue. I purchased the Gold edition and there is no season pass to download. The store tells me I&nbsp;can purchase it, even though I&nbsp;already did at the cost of $109 (taxes on digital, don't get me started). The edition my Xbox says I&nbsp;have install is the standard edition. Can we get some clarification on what is happening here?</p>

            <p>Hi there,&nbsp;<strong>monkeycatt</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>I haven't played Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands yet. But if the Season Pass is like most other games, i don't think you need to download it, it's similar to a ticket. What i mean is, when downloadable content (DLC) is released, you won't need to purchase it as the Season Pass is on your account, so the price will be overridden to 'Free'. I hope you understand what i'm trying to say, if not let me know and i'll try and elaborate some more. But that's the best way how i can describe it right now. Have fun.</p><p><br /></p><p>I hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Well. that's interesting. Both my son and I&nbsp;purchased the gold additions and his season pass is working but mine is not. So what they told you is not accurate. The season pass is infact working.&nbsp;He has the 5%&nbsp;boost but mine is nt showing. You may want to recontact them.</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t boot from USB no matter what</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So I've been at this for a little bit now with no luck so far. I am attempting to dual boot&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Linux</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;OS
 (thinking of a couple different versions), however I can't even get my SP4 to boot from multiple different USB devices. My flash drive gets registered by multiple PCs with no issues and I have my .ISO file on there. I did use Rufus to set up the flash drive
 to become bootable. I also disabled bitlocker and SecureBoot as I have read all different tips for how to do this. I set USB device as the primary device to boot form and my Surface still boots to Windows. I disabled Windows boot entirely and it still booted
 to Windows. I swipe left on USB device and it takes me right back to BIOS settings. I tried holding volume down and pressing power to boot directly to USB and I still boot directly to Windows 10. Running out of ideas. I've seen plenty have this same issue
 but have not seen a fix that works for me. I've attached some pictures of my settings and such. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</span></p>

            <p>After some research and experimentation I was able to create and boot a Ubuntu usb flash drive on my sp4.&nbsp; Before I go any further I want to let u know that I am not a Linux guru.&nbsp; Everything I know about Linux can be placed on a 3x5 card with room to spare.&nbsp;
 That being said I believe the problem is the Ubuntu distro u are using and/or the wrong partitioning scheme.&nbsp; The distro to use can be downloaded

HERE&nbsp;</a> and should be <strong>ubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso</strong>&nbsp; .&nbsp; The partition scheme should be

<p>You can use Rufus but you can also simply format the flash drive as fat32, mount the iso and copy all the files to the flash drive.&nbsp; It will boot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use Disk Management to verify that the partition is Active.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for the helpful advice, I do appreciate it. I did follow this advice, however unfortunately for me it still did not work. I attempt to boot from USB and get taken back to Windows 10 startup screen. I have tried multiple flash drives at
 different sizes as well. I don't quite understand why this isn't working. The most recent flash drive is a brand new USB 3.0 32gb drive.</p>

            Another update for anyone who might have more advice. I decided just to test things out and run my USB recovery media for Windows from boot and see if that works and it works immediately. Not sure if the system is rejecting it because it's not Windows
 or what, but I've tried several different versions of Linux OS as well as different methods of imaging the OS to the drive. This makes me think it has to be somehow related to the OS/how it's put on the drive, but I'm not certain.

<p>Thank you for the response, but yes I did try Rufus as well as ImageUSB (someone else's recommendation) and had no luck. I also just did a Fat32 format, mounted the drive, then copied the contents over. This still did not fix my problem.</p>

            <p>Both of the above recommended methods work on my sp4.&nbsp; I tested using a 16gb and a 32gb flash drive.&nbsp; The sp4 only supports booting from media that is prepped with a GPT partition for fat32 where the partition is marked ACTIVE.&nbsp; Additionally only Ubuntu
 distros that are AMD64 will have the necessary GPT boot software.&nbsp; If you didn't use the Ubuntu distro above the flash drive will not boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: if you didn't get the red banner when booting your sp4 is not unlocked and will only boot windows.</p>

    <title>USB flash drive keeps corrupting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> katarie  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB flash drive keeps corrupting</h2>
                    <p>Good day, I am having a problem with a 1TB flash drive I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 and it seems that the system doesn't want to read the flash drive, because when I plug it in, this error comes up: "You need to format the disk in drive L: before you can use it." I click format, since it has no content. The problem
 is that it does this everytime I plug the flash drive back in after ejecting it. It's just a cycle of formatting and formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I eject the flash drive, it doesn't look like it was completely ejected. The icon looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/28d113ca-1684-4a94-8569-49b9d57c10fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/28d113ca-1684-4a94-8569-49b9d57c10fa" /></a></p>
<p>I would also like to mention that the drive worked totally fine when I tried it on another laptop running Windows as well, so I assume it's something in my system that is causing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would anyone have a solution on how to fix it? Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Some consoles need refreshing or prompting. &nbsp;I've had success with the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Remove profile - SETTINGS page (far right from home page), select STORAGE, then find your profile and remove.</p>
<p>2. While in you hard drive under GAMES &amp; APPS look for any red or yellow icons with incomplete or unknown. &nbsp;Delete them.</p>
<p>3.Clear System Cache - SETTINGS page, select STORAGE and highlight a drive but don't select it. &nbsp;Press Y and select Clear System Cache. &nbsp;Agree when asked.</p>
<p>4. Be Patient - turn your console off for a full minute. &nbsp;This assists in resetting the console.</p>
<p>5. Turn on the console and download your profile - it is the icon next to 'create a profile'. &nbsp;Try again</p>
<p>If you still have issues please feel free to contact me or come to the ambassador chat room.</p>
<p>Good luck &amp; happy gaming</p>

<h2>            Win 10 iPhone 6 USB Tethering no longer works</h2>
                    <p>Hi -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've successfully upgraded the Asus T100TA to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I actually used my iPhone 6 tethered via USB to complete the downloads for the install process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Post Windows 10 install, iPhone USB tethering no longer works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WiFi tethering works fine. But WiFi tethering is much slower that USB tethering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've removed and reinstalled iTunes to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried resetting network settings on the phone - no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd guess that this might be an iTunes issue, but at a minimum I wanted to put this out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Mark</p>

            <p>I resolved my issue. The step I seemed to miss was using Device Manager, with Show Hidden, as noted below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What eventually worked was:</p>
<p>1) Removing all of the iTunes software: iTunes, Bonjour, Software Update, Application Support, Mobile Device support.</p>
<p>2) Using Windows Device Manager, removing all instances of iPhone (NOTE: This required that I set the option to SHOW HIDDEN).</p>
<p>3) Rebooted.</p>
<p>4) Installed only Application support and Mobile device support (there are posts elsewhere on the interwebs about how these are the only two files that are part of itunes that are needed for tethering - you simply unzip the iTunesSetup.exe to get
 them - I imagine that a full iTunes install would have worked as well).</p>
<p>5) Rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried tethering, and this time I saw that the Ethernet driver was installing. Success!</p>

<h3> circuitsoft  say:</h3>
<h2>            My computer&#39;s monitor randomly turns off, but the computer keeps running. How do I fix it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I built my own computer in July. Windows 8 had not come out yet, so I installed Windows 7 on it.&nbsp; It was working great for a month or so, then this problem came up. I would start the computer and at random times (sometimes right after startup, sometimes
 in the middle of my work) the monitor would go black and just show a line of colors about a pixel wide. The computer would not respond to any input, except for holding the power button for 4 seconds. This continued until around the beginning of August, then
 it randomly went away. I then upgraded to the Windows 8 RTM 90 day evaluation on August 20th.&nbsp; This problem came back and it hasn't gone away. On two&nbsp;additional notes, whenever the problem occurs before the Windows 8 lock screen, the line a pixel wide is just
 red, and&nbsp;after around 5 minutes this problem occurs, the computer shuts down, but I usually shut it down first, with the power button.&nbsp;And now, Windows 8 fails to start. It shows the Windows 8 GUI boot, but after that, it stays black, but the monitor doesn't
 turn off, and&nbsp;now sometimes the lines don't appear and the computer turns off after 2 minutes. I tried fixing some BIOS settings, but the problem appeared there too. I have important things on there, so I cannot refresh my PC. Also, if this helps, I have had
 trouble installing 2 updates, but I can't see the KB number of them, but one had something to do with RAW support and the other with OOBE and WinRE. Paint.NET also failed to install. I bought these parts from Micro Center in the Greater Atlanta/ Marietta store.
 The version of Windows 8 is 64-bit. The specifications for my computer are: </p>
<p>HDD: 500GB 7,200RPM</p>
<p>RAM: 12GB (8GB Kingston Blu) (4 GB Patriot)</p>
<p>CPU: Intel Core i7 3930K Ivy Bridge</p>
<p>CD: SuperWritemaster Speedplus (I can't see specific information)</p>
<p>Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-X79-UD5</p>
<p>Power Supply: Diablotek PSEL500</p>
<p>Case: Fractal Design Core 1000 (If that helps)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tell me if you need any extra details. I have a server, am programming a game, and do my school work all on this computer, so it would be nice to give me a solution as soon as possible.</p>

            <p>The GUI boot screen comes up, and then the&nbsp;monitor displays&nbsp;black, but doesn't turn off until after 2 minutes, when the computer turns off, so no I am not able to get into Windows 8. My drivers are up to date. I have tried another monitor and the problem
 still appears. At one point, I got a BSOD with the error code: BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG. I reinstalled Windows 8 and updated the drivers, that fixed the startup error. The monitor problem was fixed by cleaning this grey creamy substance (I think it is melted silicon)
 from my processor and CPU fan. I no longer have the problem.</p>

<h2>            Problems with Windows 10 and Spectrum E mail slowing down and then locking up.</h2>
                    This has been going on for a long, long time. On line log in support by Best Buy Geek Squad has not been able to solve the problem. An older lap top with windows 7 does not have this problem. Anyone with similar issues ? Spectrum on line techs can't find
 a cure either !

<p>Same issue here with a Lumia 520 with Windows 10 Mobile (Insider) that this week started to rebooting itself after 1 minute or so, none app can be loaded, like the internal memory is read only.

<p>i guess found the solution. seems there is something wrong with hard drives (especially samsung hard drives.) used in some lumia devices</p>
<br />
<p><br />
</p>
<p>but the solution is to disable eMMC write protection see below:</p>
<br />
<p><br />
</p>
<p>note: i have not test it on windows phone devices but i guess it may help</p>

<h2>            I don&#39;t get it &#40;new maps&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I bought the Defiant Map Pack a couple days ago thinking I'd have exclusive access to the DLC playlist to play on the maps and it turns out that you need BOTH packs to play in that. That's ridiculous, I've played a lot of games so far throughout various
 game modes and have not come across 1 new map. Is there an option that would let me play in the new maps or something? Very disappointed</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it sounds like you need to buy the other map pack. I'm not even bothering with Halo: Reach map packs because I'm not paying to play one map over, and over, and over, and over again due to the broken matchmaking system.</p>

<p>They used to have playlists for each map pack but I think they removed them because of low population.

<h2>            Windows freezes after entering Password to login</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to login to my system(Windows Vista) and once i enter the password The welcome screen comes then a black screen with the mouse pointer and all activity stops. The small led which flickers when CPU is being used shuts off completely which means
 there is no activity going on.The only way to get out of this is to hard boot the system.</p>
<p>I havent made any updates to the system. The last time i logged in it automatically ran a chkdisk.</p>
<p>I can start the system in safe mode and tried to clean boot and then start the system The system logs in and then just freezes like before. All my services (in clean boot) are turned off at this moment. I have also tried to recover and start from previous
 recovered point and that did not help as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to run a diagnostic on memory and hard disk. The diagnostic on memory passes but on harddisk fails . The message on boot reads the "cannot open files for direct access" and then the screen reaches the point where i need to enter the password and
 freezes.</p>
<p>Can anyone provide any insight as to what the problem may be and if i can resolve it somehow?</p>

<p><span><strong>Hi,</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Looks like the issue is with the hard disk.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1. What was the outcome of chkdsk?<br />
2. Did you get any message saying ‘bad sectors were recovered or could not find any bad sectors’?<br />
<br />
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Run the check disc (CHKDSK) command from WINRE [Windows Recovery Environment].</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span><span>: Performing this operation could cause loss of
<p><span><span><span>a. Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer using the computer's power button.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b. Do one of the following:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>•If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before
 the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>•If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to repair, and then
 press and hold F8.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight Repair your computer, and then press Enter. (If Repair your computer
 isn't listed as an option, then your computer doesn't include preinstalled recovery options, or your network administrator has turned them off.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d. Select a keyboard layout, and then click Next.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e. On the System Recovery Options menu, click on Command Prompt.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Access the link below to know more the System Recovery Options:</span></span></span></p>

 &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f. At the Command Prompt, type chkdsk<strong>DriveLetter: /p /r</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>where DriveLetter is C in your case.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The Chkdsk program checks the hard drive for errors and repairs any error it finds. Chkdsk takes at least twenty minutes, an hour or more
 is also possible.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>g. After the Chkdsk program is finished, type exit, then press Enter to restart the computer.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Attention KB4056894 Security Update Will Make your AMD X2 Computer unusable Win7 Win 8.1 Win10 and Maybe Other System too</h2>
                    <p>If you Install KB4056894 on Windows 7 it dont will boot anymore on windows 10 you will get after 3 Reboots the Update Rollback and you will be Able to Fix it then</p>
<p>
</p><p>We Get Yesterday 9 Computers with same Problem no matter what Chipset Via Or NForce
</p>
<p>and it was a Little bit Tricky but we get them all back to Life and found a way to Fix that Problem
</p>
The Only Solution Microsoft Support give Useless with new Install
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54a167ea-a82c-4047-beba-57f369da7e73" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54a167ea-a82c-4047-beba-57f369da7e73" height="354" width="473" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Try with Windows repair Results in not Repairable </p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>you need another Computer to get your HDD back again to Work</strong> Important you need an AMD CPU from one Upper Generation and if you get it once Booting you will be Able to Unninstall KB4056894</p>
<p>and Disable that for Further Updates on another Mashine then you must put your HDD Back to the System with the Athlon X2 CPU and you will get evrything Back to Life</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b29e31b-2a75-4914-9f9b-cb3110e9614f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b29e31b-2a75-4914-9f9b-cb3110e9614f" height="353" width="472" /></a></p>
<p>Attention have to be Pointed in Bios Settings IDE AHCI Otherwise it wont Boot on Other Mashine</p>
<p>
</p><p>on Windows 10 you will get after 3 Useless Boot the Option to Roll Back the Update</p>
<p>and then you will be able to unninstall that Update and with some Tools to Disable from further Installing
</p>
<p>
</p><p>i Dont Know How Microsoft will Fix That Problem thats like you Get the Virus direct from Microsoft that Killed your Computer its an Disaster
</p>
<p>If That is the Way to Bring People to Buy a New Computer or to Switch to Win10 Looks like thats not the Best way to Make peoples Computers unusable without Warning</p>

<p>I'm not sure in your post where you state a fix. The requirement for a second machine/HDD is strange. On my Dell Vostro which runs an AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core processor, the KB4056894 update fails but after reboot I selected the repair step to revert back
 to the previous restore point. That worked surprisingly. Once I got back into the desktop I set WU to check for "updates/not install them". Next I forced the check for new updates. When KB4056894 was discovered and listed, I hide the update. I did another
 force check for updates and WU reported my PC was up-to-date. There I will sit until MS (I hope) redelivers the "corrected" update on Patch Tuesday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, Is it possible for you to move this post to the "Windows 7 &gt; Installation, Updates, ..." forum? Seems to be the appropriate location for this discussion.</p>

<p>Isnt real Fix just a way how we was able to get Back on all of them to a Working System</p>
<p>
</p><p>i can Just explain in few Steps</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 Backup the HDD from the Mashine that doesent booted on any Other Working one (Acronis True Image or any Other Backup Software)</p>
<p>2 Put The Not Working HDD on a Mashine with for Example AMD Phenom CPU Athlon X3 CPU or Similar
</p>
<p>3 Try Booting the Not Working HDD on That Mashine if Fails Look for IDE AHCI Settings in Bios (DEPENDS on Installed System and Drivers)</p>
<p>4 After it Starts to Boot it will install the KB4056894</p>
<p>5 Go to system Settings Programs and Unninstall the KB4056894</p>
<p>6 Reboot </p>
<p>7 Maybe it will Install on that Reboot another Update think it was at most some KB with 18 at the end doesent looked Deeper from December</p>
<p>8 After Reboot go to Windows Update and let it Search for new ones</p>
<p>9 it will find the KB4056894 and maybe Drivers for The Computer where you Switched the HDD Disable the KB4056894 and The Driver Updates</p>
<p>10 Shutdown</p>
<p>11 Disconnect The HDD from The Phenom Computer put it Back to the Mashine where it was come From
</p>
<p>12 Boot and Hope that the next Update dont Makes Similar Things with your Working Computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was a Solution that helped us Yesterday to get them all back to Life where Windows repair was not able or where no Backups where existing or any Other Backup Point on the Windows 7 Mashines</p>

<h3> danila s.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with receiving messages</h2>
                    <p>Greetings!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though skype heartbeat shows that there aren't any unresolved connection issue i still continue to face them.
</p>
<p>I do not receive messages from several contacts (even though if i text them - they see what i wrote). Same is with several group conversations i have - cannot see new messages there, though sometimes they just blush with dozens of unread messages sent through
 a day.</p>
<p>In the same time - second half of the contacts and groups works fine, can chat with those and see the reply messages.</p>
<p>The issue persists for the last 5-7 days, on the Windows-Store-Based skype on Windows 10 PC, old-and-good standalone skype on windows server 2012 R2 and Windows Mobile 10 skype, all of those have the same problems, thus, i guess, it is not something device
 or platform-based. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to note - i have confirmed that i am not the only one with this issue, several of my colleagues have the same problems.</p>
