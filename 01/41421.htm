<h2>            question about transfering a valid license</h2>
                    I have a Valid license for windows 7 home premium on a dell laptop I no longer use. Can I transfer it to say a tablet if it will support the os? I need windows 7 for my work as its the only os that is compatible with some software I need for my company.
 I believe I have seen somewhere that I can do that but not certain and I do not want my device shuting down or stoping in the middle of programing an a/c system.

<p>If this is a laptop, it presumably came with Windows 7 pre-installed on it, and if so, it's an OEM version. Sorry to tell you that perhaps the biggest disadvantage of an OEM version is that its license ties it permanently to the first computer it's installed
 on. It may never be moved to another.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Laptop came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc), that Product Key that came with the Laptop is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines) is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>And Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

No, you cannot transfer it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font>
<p>OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system
</p>

            Ok then The windows xp version I purchased several years ago can be transfered. I didn't like how the oem version kept changing my settings or that version of xp I had alot of trouble back then remembering the changes I made and everytime it updated at
 the factory it put everything I removed back and there was was something that was not compatible, it crashed it was a nightmare for me. Is it possible to perhaps purchase and upgrade to windows 7 and never install xp if I have the license ? Or &nbsp;is it required
 to install xp first? I get confused about the rules.I normally just try things to see if it works but sometimes thats a hassle. I am pretty sure that it would be much better to not install xp first. I would actually be ok with xp but it won't run this software.
 I know how much I paid for the xp version and I simply do not have the money to spend. I just started my own business and I have shell out a bunch of money to get a license for what I do,time is a factor and I have to get this do

The only differences between a generic OEM and full retail licensed version of Windows (whichever) is licensing terms. &nbsp;It is the exact same operating system in all other ways.
<div><br />
<div>Buy a full retail version (not upgrade) of Windows 7. &nbsp;If you don't need Windows XP mode, bit locker, the ability to join a domain, etc. - just get Windows 7 Home Premium.</div>

            Can you try signing out of the current account? Its possible you might have been signed into the wrong Skype ID.
<br />
<br />Restart the computer, then sign in again using the email address and password associated with your Skype ID. 
<br />
<br />Also sign into Skype for Web to confirm if you are still unable to view contacts and send messages.

            <p>Hello tombutler06,
<br />
<br />
In an effort to focus more attention on your particular situation, I am going to split your post into a new thread.&nbsp; Splitting threads are done to mitigate confusion caused by more than one posting about similar&nbsp;&nbsp; topics, allowing us to focus on each customer
 individually.</p>
<p><br />
The original thread where you posted was: <br />
<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-performance/windows-cant-find-my-msconfig-file-how-do-i-find/202b89b1-f949-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5">Windows can't find my msconfig file. How do I find or get it back to diagnose
 problems?</a></span></p>
<p><br />
The path to the MsConfig.exe file in Windows XP is: <br />
%System%\Windows\PCHealth\helpctr\binaries\msconfig.exe</p>
<p><br />
Starting in Windows Vista and Windows 7 the path is:<br />
%System%\Windows\System32\msconfig.exe<br />
<br />
You can run SFC /scannow now to replace the file if you have the Windows XP installation discs.
<br />
Click on the following KB article for assistance. <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB Article ID: 310747</a> - Description of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 System File Checker
<br />
(Sfc.exe)<br />
<br />
If you don't have the installation discs,&nbsp; you might be able to copy the msconfig.exe file from another Windows XP computer and paste on your computer.
<br />
Just right click that msconfig.exe file you downloaded and choose "Copy", Now go into Windows Explorer, and open the C:\Windows\PCHealth\HelpCtr\Binaries folder and in the right pane right click an empty area and choose "Paste". This will place a copy where
 it belongs.<br />
<br />
Let us know if this helps. <br />

            Dear:&nbsp; &lt;Insert Microsoft Support Engineer Name Here&gt;:<br />
<br />
Running sfc /scannow will not replace the missing msconfig.exe file.<br />
<br />
Why don't you learn what sfc /scannow does and doesn't do?<br />
<br />
That is not what sfc /scannow does, that is not how it works and that is not what it is for and here is a test so you can see for yourself how sfc /scannow does work.<br />
<br />
Here is a simple test for you and all your Support Engineer colleagues:<br />
<br />
I implore you to run this simple test to learn how sfc /scannow works:<br />
<br />
Boot your system in Safe Mode or the Recovery Console so Windows File Protection is not running.<br />
<br />
For this example, let's use the critical system file msconfig.exe.<br />
<br />
Rename or delete your c:\windows\pchealth\helpctr\binaries\msconfig.exe file so the file is now "missing".<br />
<br />
That is a critical file, right?&nbsp; It is on the list of 3498 file that Windows File Protection and SFC knows about but now it is missing.<br />
<br />
If Windows File Protection was running, the "missing" file would be quickly and silently replaced (try renaming or deleting it in normal mode and it will be quickly and silently replaced).<br />
<br />
Now, with your msconfig.exe missing, boot into Normal mode and try to open the System Configuration Utility and you will see the error that the file is missing (now you have reproduced the error):<br />
<br />
Follow you own advice and run sfc /scannow to completion.<br />
<br />
The msconfig.exe is still missing, right?&nbsp; Did running sfc /scannow replace the missing&nbsp; critical system file?&nbsp; No it did not.<br />
<br />
How can that be if sfc /scannow is supposed to replace missing system files?&nbsp; That is because that is not what sfc /scannow does.<br />
<br />
Now you know what sfc /scannow does not do.&nbsp; It did not replace your missing system file (be sure to put your msconfig.exe back so you will have one).<br />
<br />
Now navigate to c:\windows\system32\dllcache and delete or rename the msconfig.exe file from there - and it will stay gone and not be automatically replaced since Windows File Protection does not look after that folder.<br />
<br />
Run sfc /scannow to completion again.<br />
<br />
The missing msconfig.exe file in the dllcache folder will be replaced, since that IS the folder that sfc /scannow looks after for missing files.<br />
<br />
Now you know what sfc /scannow does do.<br />
<br />
<br />

            There should be more files than that...&nbsp; and I don't know what uploadm is either.<br />
<br />
It could be that your system has a malicious software infection or your unspecified antimalware/antivirus application has quarantined (effectively deleted) the files.<br />
<br />
If your msconfig.exe is missing, running sfc /scannow will not replace it.&nbsp; That is not what sfc /scannow does, that is not how it works and that is not what it is for.<br />
<br />
Plus, and as usual, the Microsoft "experts" never mention that you are going to need a genuine bootable XP installation CD with Service Pack 3 on it or sfc /scannow is going to complain - alot.&nbsp; Most people do not have such a thing and even if you did have
 one, running sfc /scannow will still not help you.<br />
<br />
I uploaded a copy of the XP Pro SP3 file you need to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).<br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in these folders (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\pchealth\helpctr\binaries<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (that is where XP keeps backup copies of important files).<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39%21311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.
<br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, your browser may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.) so you will have to manually add the proper extension
 to the file when you download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called msconfig when the file name really needs to be called msconfig.exe (if the downloaded file has no extension you will
 have to change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />
<br />
You then need to put the downloaded files in the correct folders on your system.<br />
<br />
If you are missing all the other files, you could copy that folder content from a working system onto your system, or if somebody has the time and inkling, they could zip of their binaries folder and you can download it, but you may have other issues besides
 that.<br />

<p><span>Hello</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the keyboard device from device manager and check whether it
 helps. To do so, please follow the steps.</span></p>
<p><span>Click on start &gt; In search box type in devmgmt.msc, hit enter&gt; right click on keyboard drivers from the list of devices
 and then click on uninstall&gt; restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Try to reinstall the device and verify whether it works fine.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, then I would suggest you to download the latest drivers from Microsoft website and install
 the same on the computer. please refer the link mentioned below:</span></p>

<h2>            Unable to connect to xbox live&#63; error 80151909</h2>
                    
<p>Hello there! First time posting onto the forums and i'm not entirely sure of whats happened to my console. I've gotten a live connection error and the error &nbsp;number is 80151909. Because of this i am unable to connect to Xbox live through my xbox 360 console.
 &nbsp;I am able to connect to the internet just fine on my other devices. I have tried to troubleshoot this for a while, but to no avail. Any help from other people getting this error?</p>
<p><br />
<strong>What Country/State/Province do you live in?</strong><span>&nbsp;Florida</span><b><br />
<strong>Modem brand &amp; model number:</strong></b><span>&nbsp; N/A</span><b><br />
Router brand &amp; model number:</b><span>&nbsp; ActionTec, Model number MI424WR</span><b><br />
If Wireless, are you using a white or black external adapter, or an internal (Xbox 360S) adapter?
</b>I believe i'm using the Internal adaptor, because i have an xbox 360 slim.<br />
<strong>Things you have tried: &nbsp;</strong>I have tried resetting my router, Clearing the cache on my console multiple times, resetting my network to factory defaults, deleting my profile (which i now cannot re-download due to being unable to connect to Xbox
 live), and preformed a extended power cycle.<br />
<strong>Is UPnP Enabled? Yes/no/Unknown </strong>Currently unknown.&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Do you have a NAT error? If so, what is your NAT type? </strong>I don't believe this is a NAT error<br />
<strong>Any Error Codes you encounter: &nbsp;</strong>Error code 80151909<br />
<strong>Who is your ISP(Internet Service Provider)? </strong>Verizon FioS<br />
<strong>After you run "Test Xbox LIVE connection" press “Y” for "More Info”. In the pop-up that appears, what are the following values, if shown? (If a value below does not appear for you, just leave it blank.)</strong><br />
W: 0000-0021<br />
X: 0000-F001<br />
Y:&nbsp;0C88-1C40<br />
Z:&nbsp;0000-0000</p>
<p>ID: 0006-0000</p>
<p>L: 8015-1909</p>
<p>Q: 8007-0435<br />
T: Wireless<br />
D: 192.168.1.1, 0.0.0.0<br />
S: WEP<br />
C: &nbsp;6</p>
<p>I do not own a wireless headset, and have no wireless interference. I would really appreciate any type of response as to fixing the issue, as i've been trying everything to no avail.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Login options not showing on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>The login options, pin and biometric, are not showing on the Windows 10 login screen.</p>
<p>I have run scf /scannow - no problems found.</p>
<p>I have re-installed Windows 10</p>
<p>I have activated Windows Hello several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manage to set-up a pin and fingerprint but the Windows login screen only shows the option to login with my Microsoft account password.</p>

            Hi Jo.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />PIN RESET:
<br />
<br />If you cannot Add or Remove the PIN in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign in Options even after a restart, then unhide Hidden Files in File Explorer &gt; View tab &gt; Options &gt; Folder and Search Options &gt; View tab &gt;  tick box to Show hidden Files.
<br />
<br />Browse to C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\NGC
<br />
<br />Delete or rename to NGC.old this folder to reset the PIN.
<br />
<br />
<br />You may need to first take ownership of the folder:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-take-ownership-context-menu-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-ta...</a>
<br />
<br />Once you delete or rename the folder it will recreate it so you can add a PIN normally in Sign-In Options.  You may need to restart the PC first.
<br /> 
<br />WINDOWS HELLO:
<br />
<br />Here are steps for fixing Windows Hello:
<br />
<br />1) Turn off Fast Startup:  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />2) Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />  Go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign In Options
<br />    Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />    After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />    Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br />3)  Modify Group Policy Settings  (for Pro version only)
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.
<br />
<br />    Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter.
<br />    Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates.
<br />    Select Windows Components and open Biometrics.
<br />    Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.
<br />    Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature.
<br />    Reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />4) Update drivers
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:
<br />
<br />    Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />    Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.
<br />    Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished.
<br />    Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />    Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />    The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers.
<br />
<br />5) Run Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />6)  If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a> 
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps then run a Fresh Start:  <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-fresh-start-feature-in-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for the quick reply.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even though I tried all on your list and ended up with a Fresh Start, I am still not getting the pin and fingerprint options on the login menu.</p>
<p>This is the second re-installation of Windows 10 I´ve done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was only one thing on your listed suggestions that I wasn't able to do since the options to "...click remove..." was not available?</p>
<p>************************</p>
<p><span>2) Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign In Options&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and<strong> click Remove under them</strong>.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Reboot your PC if needed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>************************</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have spent several hours on this problem, without any luck, even though I consider myself an advanced Windows user. Is this currently a bug in windows 10, do you know?</span></p>

            Yes, Jokull, I believe it is a bug since we see it so often.
<br />
<br /> If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. I will also track the issue for you.

<p>Short update.</p>
<p>I spent 2 hours with MS support and we tried several options, including deleting the cache for the user account. Nothing worked.</p>
<p>The only way to get this fixed was to backup all personal files, to a separate disk, and install a fresh copy of Windows 10. So I have done that and in the process of installing Windows, I setup a new user with the pin/fingerprint login options ...</p>

<h2>            WiFi Keeps Dropping on Toshiba Laptop</h2>
                    <p>I have this issue for MONTHS. "WiFi drops after five minutes or so. Bought a new router . . .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still have the same issue. After researching forever and finding countless people with the same problem it appears to point to the Intel Proset software. The suggestions are to uninstall it and I have tried and tried but the error message says IT IS ALREADY
 INSTALLED! I am paraphrasing of course and can be more detailed but mainly all I want is to get this off of my computer which is running Windows 8. I called Intel and they said its a MicroSoft problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am old . . . would like to get this fixed in my lifetime . . . thanks.</p>

            Here's an unexpected answer, I have been searching google for literally hours for this and no one had it but I accidentally figured it out when a Fixit didn't work and referred to a temp file, My temp path I changed in the environment variables to point
 to a Ram Drive, Seems Trouble Shooter doesn't play nicely with Ram Drives so I put it back to C:TEMP and HAD to reboot (not sure if it would work with temp path set to an external hard drive). Very annoying, I set it to Ram Drive because its faster and it
 doesn't matter if it gets fragmented. <br />
So many people go on about sfc/scannow which can't possibly fix the problem because its not a cause of files being corrupted.
<br />
<br />
So go to control panel and look at the top left search box, Type env (you don't have to type the whole work environment) look down click edit system environment variables click yes if asked, look down the window that opens click on Environment Variables and
 check that the TEMP and TMP Variables are set to your C: drive, I don't remember the default so I set mine to C:TEMP, The default may have been C:WINDOWS\TEMP.&nbsp; Please do not type C:\&nbsp; the \ seems to cause a problem.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps :-), Please let me know.<br />

    <title>Xbox One controller not recognised by windows 10 PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xbondistblues  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One controller not recognised by windows 10 PC</h2>
                    <p>Hi. When I plug in and turn on an xbox controller to the powered USB slot in my PC, it vibrates and the xbox light flashes, but beyond that, nothing happens. It doesn't work, obviously.</p>
<p>Here's what I've done:</p>
<p>Run the device troubleshooter</p>
<p>Use every single USB port</p>
<p>Manually triggered the Xbox Accessory manager to run in services.msc</p>
<p>
</p><p>The controller also doesn't show up in the device manager. My controller is model 1697. Any help appreciated. thanks</p>

<p>I should've mentioned that the device does not show up in device manager, and never has. My mistake. I have never connected this controller to another computer, but works fine on the console itself.</p>
<p>Following the steps in the link you provided doesn't work either, as the Xbox Accessories app just says 'connect an Xbox One controller to start', despite it being connected.</p>

            <p>Edit: on second thought.. a Reset this PC may be in order, if it's that messed up. Wait for more input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Have you tried restoring your system to a time before the updates installed? It doesn't always solve the problem, but I'd try that. Windows always creates a new system restore point before installing updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you're unsure how, type System Restore in the Search box on lower left of screen. Click "Create a Restore &nbsp;Point" to open it, and you'll see this up at top... "You can undo system changes, etc." Click System Restore button, and it'll show most recent
 restore point. You can choose to show more.</p>

<p>One of the Pro's may be able to advise you on this, Douglas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm confused regarding your hard drive was also damaged. Software updates can't damage hard drives, so maybe you should clarify. Do you mean it was already damaged before this problem occurred? Either way, it's not relevant to solving your problem. I'm sorry
 this happened. :( Good luck</p>

            You can't modify the font size but you can scale the font:
<br />
<br />In Windows: Select the Start  menu, then type change display settings in the search box on the taskbar. From the list of results, choose Change display settings and then choose the size under Scale and layout.

            <p>Hi Mohamed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have caused due to any compatibility issues with the Video/Audio card drivers. As a first step, I suggest you to install all the updates listed in Windows Updates and check if the same issue occurs. This is to check if this is caused due to any
 updates related issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If still the issue persists, then I suggest you to try installing the drivers in compatibility mode and check if the issue persists. This is to check if this is caused due to any compatibility issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following Windows 8.1 article to install the drivers in compatibility mode. The steps apply to Windows 10 as well.</p>

    <title>Can other accounts use DLC associated with another account in the same - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> happijuice  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can other accounts use DLC associated with another account in the same console&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have an xbox live account onto which I downloaded a bunch of maps for Halo 3. I created a new account in the same console. Now my question is, is the DLC acquired on the first account available to this newly created account, or do I have to repurchase
 even though the DLC is already in the HDD from the same console? Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>well its on a new console that i acquired after sending my old one in for repair. the old one was the original recipient of the DLC. but ive been informed that microsoft transfers the licenses from the old console onto the new one when they replace an old
 console with a new one. and just to be sure i transferred the licenses using the license transfer tool.</p>

<p>I don't believe MS Repair automatically transfers any license. They may transfer content if you get your HDD replaced, but even then I'm not so sure. You can check out our sticky post relating to License Transfers to see if that helps you out.</p>

<p>well yes. i used the license transfer tool just to make sure i had the licenses on the new console. and when i sign in to the account that the DLC was purchased with, i can use the DLC but i was wondering if i still able to use the DLC mentioned above with
 a different account on the same console without being signed in to the account that purchased the DLC originally.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried these steps to fix the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong></p>
<p>The first stop on the troubleshooting trail is the Services menu. Open your Windows start menu and type “<strong>Services</strong>” in the search box or hit
<strong>WIN+R</strong> and type “<strong>services.msc</strong>” in the run dialog box to launch the Services menu. Sort the columns by name and look for the “<strong>Bluetooth Support Service</strong>” entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switch the type to “Automatic” and hit apply. Close the Services menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to look down through the sections of the Device Manager for any mention of a Bluetooth device and/or mouse and check the properties of each instance. &nbsp;Look under “Bluetooth Radios,” “Mice and other pointing devices,” and “System devices.” What you’re
 looking for is “Power Management</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any instance of “Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power” should be unchecked. You do not want to allow the computer to turn off either the Bluetooth radio or the attached Bluetooth devices to save power as this is the primary cause of the
 un-syncing issue you’re seeing with your mouse.&nbsp;Check through the USB devices listed in the “Universal Serial Bus controllers” section to ensure that the computer isn’t set to turn off USB ports/hubs to save power (which would cause communication problems
 with the USB-powered dongle and the mouse).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. </p>

            all replies so far were about tuning bluetooth connectivity on the PC side. but the original question isn't about that - it's about bluetooth device not working properly. i have the same problem with Designer Mouse. my bluetooth drivers are up-to-date,
 all windows updates are installed, but the device still not working properly. all other bluetooth devices working properly without any glitches. i have Sculpt mouse too, and it's working just fine. Only Designer mouse seems to behave this glitchy way.

<p>This post is a bit old, but for what it's worth, info in step #2 seems to have solved the issue for me. In my case, I had to do the following:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Device Manager</li><li>Under Bluetooth, right click Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R)</li><li>Uncheck "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power"</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Unpair all Bluetooth devices</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Reboot (because Microsoft)</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Pair the devices</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Open Device Manager again</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Under Human Interface Devices, find your bluetooth devices. For me they were listed as: Bluetooth Low Energy GATT compliant HID ...</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Go to properties, and uncheck&nbsp;</span>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power"</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I've been running for over an hour without any disconnects, which is an extreme improvement over disconnects every 1 - 2 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this helps someone.</p>
<p>

            Here is a generic process to Change the SSID. Your router may have a slightly different process. If you can't figure it out go to the website of the router maker and find the user guide for your specific model

<p>Hab mir schon vor 6 Wochen die XBox gekauft, da war das PSN noch nicht gehackt. Hab mir die Box nur wegen der Gears of War 3 Beta geholt und natürlich auch wegen dem Hauptspiel, das in 3 1/2 Monaten rauskommt.</p>
<p>Da die Beta nun seit letzter Woche vorbei ist, hab ich mir gedacht, verbring ich eben die Zeit bei MW2. Ich muss aber sagen, dass in dem letzten halben Jahr MW2 auf der PS3 unmöglich zu spielen war, da dauernd irgendwelche Scheißcheater durch die Luft segeln
 mussten, sich unterhalb und außerhalb der Maps verstecken mussten und einen Controller verwendet haben, der eine Beretta 92FS (amerikanische M9) in eine Maschinenpistole verwandelt hat. Da spielt sich MW2 auf der XBox besser, obwohl ich schon etwas aus der
 Übung bin und nicht wie die anderen quickscopen kann und auf der höchsten Geschwindigkeit spiele. Aber trotzdem bekomm ich meine Kills und ein positives Kills/Deaths-Ergebnis.......jedenfalls meistens! ;)</p>

            Can I mention one obvious thing. The solution to the ORIGINAL request HALO CE... was an update patch.<br />
I would venture to surmise that THIS IS more than likely the solution to ALL the game issues that are the older disc-based games, that it seems Microsoft DOESN'T WANT us to be able to use. In favor of THEIR WEB based games.<br />
I shouldn't have to purchase YOUR game TWICE and then be unhappy.

            <div>I have encountered the same problem. After some struggles, I found a solution.</div>
<div>In my case, a third party MPEG2 decoder (ex. Dscaler5) was the culprit. By uninstalling Dscaler5, Windows DVD Player got working.</div>
<div>If you have installed some kind of MPEG2 decoder other than Microsoft product, uninstalling it may help.</div>
