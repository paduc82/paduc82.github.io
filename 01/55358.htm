<h2>            I have no sound on the computer after re-installing the Windows.</h2>
                    <p>Hello<br />
<br />
I just reinstalled Windows 7 on my PC and I was somewhat proud of myself, having internet, email, video working...but then no sound. :(<br />
<br />
So the most common answer seems to be get the proper driver.<br />
<br />
I have an ASUS P7-P55-M motherboard, I went to the ASUS site, and got the best audio driver for this mobo, which is : VIA_Audio_V6019500_XPVistaWin7.
<br />
<br />
So I installed that, and then one encouraging thing was that DURING the install for this audio driver, my speakers made a sound, which made me think that they are at least being recognized, or this sound driver is at least seeing them there ??<br />
<br />
But then after rebooting, I still have no sound.<br />
<br />
So I tried looking at the specs for this mobo, and saw the audio chip itself is the VIA VT1708S. So I followed links and found a driver for that, but having installed that now, it looks like it's just an even newer version of the same driver (the above one
 being 9500, this one being 10200 or thats what it looks like.)<br />
<br />
Anyways, this newer version, and the one off the ASUS site, as well as any older drivers I find, all install some version or another of this : HD VDeck.<br />
<br />
Common answers at this point include something about Realtek drivers (can't see how tho if those aren't applicable, or using those over the VIA drivers), or Windows troubleshooter, or something within Playback features, or an older or Windows driver conflicting
 with these new ones?), but I tried those things (or I thought I did lol).<br />
<br />
But I still have no sound from my speakers.<br />
<br />
Very frustrating as it feels like I am 98% done my re-install, and it looks like its just some simple setting somewhere in Windows or that HD VDeck that will get things working.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!! :)</p>

            Hello<br />
<br />
Thank you for your responses. :)<br />
<br />
I completely formatted, no Windows.old folder, and also no dxdiag printed, which I am kicking myself for, which I will make sure to have next time lol.<br />
<br />
Device manager is fine, I had gone over that and basically every Windows sound option or menu I could find, which made me think the problem elsewhere.<br />
<br />
So I took Nirmal's suggestion, and used the Automatically diagnose and fix link he provided. The troubleshooter's suggestions didn't really help much as it said everything was up to date, or wasn't a problem, but what I did notice was this one screen in the
 Microsoft Fixit program that runs:<br />
<br />
<br />
Windows Audio Playback Troubleshooter<br />
<br />
Which of these devices do you want to troubleshoot?<br />
<br />
Select the device that<b> </b><span>you are having issues with. If the device is not listed, select Device not listed.<br />
<br />
Speakers - VIA High Definition Audio (The connector for this device is located on the front side of the computer.)<br />
<br />
SPDIF Interface (TX0) VIA High Definition Audio (The connector for this device is located on the slide-open or pull-open panel on the back side of the computer.)<br />
<br />
AMD HDMI Output - AMD High Definition Audio Device (The connector for this device is located in the HDMI connector.)<br />
<br />
Device not listed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now when I continued from here, I didn't get any helpful answers, but this did make me start thinking about the jacks/connectors themselves, rather than the drivers or anything else.<br />
<br />
So I discovered that my audio interface (HD VDeck) that installed with my motherboard audio drivers, does not have the options to either disable the front panel jacks, nor the ability to re-configure jacks how you want them. If you want your speaker sound to
 be coming out of the same jack that it was before, you MUST be able to reconfigure your jacks. Otherwise, the default jack for your speakers, according to your manufacturer's drivers, is in fact not the green jack I was used to, but one of the other ones instead.
 This other jack, or perhaps even just the front panel headphone or microphone jack will work instead.<br />
<br />
So to summarize:<br />
<br />
<b>If you have done a clean install of Windows 7 (or a similar version), and you have installed your sound drivers, and re-configured your Windows Sound settings (speakers as default, etc.), then you have done everything up until this point correctly. At this
 point, you MUST have an audio program such as Realtek, that allows you to re-configure or disable jacks. Otherwise, your speaker sound, by default, is no longer coming from the green audio jack we are used to, but instead another of the rear jacks. You MUST
 use the other rear jack (most likely the FRONT SPEAKER jack), or one of your front panel jacks, to plug your speakers in instead.</b><br />
<br />
It might look funny, but this workaround will work, unless you get an audio program to re-assign the normal green audio jack.<br />
<br />
I have looked at literally hundreds of posts over the last couple days trying to get this resolved. I wish I could go back and share this info with all those people now lol.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info, and please share this with everyone who has problems with Windows re-install and sound.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Brad<br />

<h2>            Blue Screen - Only When Recording Music &#38; Different Every Time</h2>
                    <p>Maybe this has been answered, maybe it hasn't. &nbsp;I have no idea. &nbsp;I'm at the end of my rope and I'm not expecting much help from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using an HP Compaq Elite 8300 Small Form Factor. &nbsp;64 Bit, 12 GB of RAM, Intel Core i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 1 TB of memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since upgrading to Windows 10, almost everything works except my music recording software. &nbsp;Since I'm very active in the local music scene - both as a musician and a recording engineer - this is a huge problem. &nbsp;I can open my recording software (Mixcraft
 Pro Studio 7) for a short period of time (anywhere from 5 minutes to 15 minutes), but it inevitably crashes. &nbsp;The blue screen message is different almost every time. &nbsp;l'm in the process of recording three bands right now. &nbsp;This is really gonna screw up my
 business. &nbsp;Can anyone help? &nbsp;I have checked multiple times with Windows Update, the Drivers, and even Acoustica (Mixcraft's company) and everything seems to be up to date and in perfect working order. &nbsp;Like I said, I only get this problem with my recording
 software.</p>

<h2>            Mouse disconnects and reconnects randomly.</h2>
                    I am running Vista 64bit and am currently using a Razer Krait mouse. The mouse just randomly disconnects and reconnects itself for about two seconds every 10 minutes. It has nothing to do with the mouse, because I tried it on my friends computer and it
 worked fine. The time it mostly happens is when I am in a computer game. I really need help, I have searched other forums and I still have not been able to find the answer. *It is not a wireless mouse*

<p>Just recently my computer's sound randomly stopped working and I saw that in the device manager, under system devices, one of the two High Definition Audio Controllers is not working. It says,

<p>The requested operation was unsuccessful.'</p>
<p>I have tried disabling/enabling, restarting, and even uninstalling and letting it reinstall, nothing works :/.</p>
<p>i have noticed many people are having trouble with the 'Sound, Video and Game Controllers', but this one is a system device. Windows doesn't recognise any devices i plug into my audio jack so the only way i can receive sound is through my monitor. Pls help.</p>

            Hi Caleb.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />1) For sound problems first try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Error 0x80071AC3&#58; Volume is Dirty</h2>
                    <p>hi, i have posed the question to win 7 forum but never got reply</p>
<p>so i am getting Error 0x80071AC3: Volume is Dirty message. i have tried below cmd prompt but the volume is exfat not ntfs</p>
<p>
</p><p>can you please come up with the solution quickly</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Could be the Dirty Bit. <br />
<br />
Sometimes when a drive is disconnected without safely removing a file becomes corrupted and Windows flags the drive as "unreliable" (so to speak) by setting a single hex value for the drive as "dirty". Thus "the dirty bit".<br />
<br />
To check if this is so, open an elevated Command Prompt and then type " </span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">fsutil dirty query m:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> " (with
<strong>m</strong> being the drive letter for the external drive. This will tell you if the drive is marked dirty.<br />
<br />
If it is, then do this: open the Command Prompt and type: " <strong>CHKNTFS /X m:</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> " . This will tell Windows NOT to check the drive on the next restart. Then manually restart the computer (keep the external connected).
<br />
<br />
You should get into Windows without an messages about the drive.<br />
<br />
Once in Windows, now run chkdsk on the drive. At the Command Prompt type: " </span>
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Chkdsk /f /r m:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> "
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">. Chkdsk should go through all 5 stages of it's test.<br />
<br />
When it's done then check the disk by running " </span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">fsutil dirty query m:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> " again. If all went well the Windows will confirm that the dirty bit is not set on that drive.<br />
<br />
Sometimes chkdsk can not reset the bit. In than case you can go nuclear and copy all the files off the drive and then format it (that will definitely reset the bit).
<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7</strong>.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;a serious error and "may" not be repairable without professional tech support from<br />
a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox Stores) or your<br />
System maker's Support.</p>
<p>Go into Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch screen as you startup. Set the<br />
boot order to CD/DVD to use Windows 7 disks. Remember to set back when done.<br />
<br />
With a Windows 7 or Repair disk try Startup Repair - (the possible fixes are same as these though<br />
the titles are named differently.)<br />
<br />
Here are the troubleshooting methods to try to fix the issue :<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>

=========================================<br />
<br />
If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.<br />
<br />
If you need to make repair disks - these help repair Windows not re-install.<br />
<br />
Download Windows 7 System Recovery Discs - now charging $9.75 for the ISO<br />
images to make the disks.<br />

<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
These "may" help :<br />
<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Windows 7 disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you can retry System Restore from the Recovery or Windows 7&nbsp;disk.<br />

</p><p>Are you aware of making any changes to the computer prior to the issue? </p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue normally occurs when the drive has not proper permission to access the files and folders.

            Hi there have you tried charging the controller with the cable plugged into the xbox or tested the batteries are actually working, another thing you could try is see if the cable is the problem causing the controller not to charge correctly.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I hope this issue resolves for you.<br />
<br />
All the best&nbsp;<br />

            Just love these new gadgets!!!! The onscreen keyboard accepted my password &amp; Windows 10 is doing it's opening chores. Thank you Vinodh.V for your suggestion. I have never used a touch screen &amp; probably did not have that set up or turned on. Using the touch
 pad the normal way with the onscreen keyboard got me in. Later on, I'll figure out how to scan the computer &amp; perhaps it will find the error. Thanks Again Vinogh.V

            <p>I woke up, went to use my laptop, which is all I have other then my android phone...And suddenly Windows 10 decided to refuse my administrative password, to acknowledge the network and get out of safe mode.</p>
<p>Calling Microsoft only made me more angry, as the lady &nbsp;trying to help didn't speak English well enough for such an important job. All she did was refuse to listen to the fact that I had already changed my pw 50 times...it isn't helping. I've done run and
 config, run with ms config, done other things I've read about, and it brings me to fill in my ms password...sooo,</p>
<p>After an hour I couldn't take not getting anywhere any longer, we said our version of goodbyes and here I am...really upset because my phone barely works now too. I need to dump my phone into my pc and CANNOT. I've been on my phone for 3 days now trying
 to understand wtH tech terms mean while reading about all the Windows 10 issues, meanwhile I'm getting NO WHERE. I do not know how to fix what first and I do not have the funds to just call geek squad....can anyone please help me? I do not want to stay with
 10...After this, the geek squad can HAVE IT. I will go to cnet and find out how to get 7 back which is what I had before this disastrous issue.</p>

<p>It doesn't take 9 complaints or 100 complaints to get someone banned. &nbsp;All it takes is for 1 VALID complaint for someone to get banned. &nbsp;It's easy to say that the complaint system sucks when it doesn't work the way you think it should. &nbsp;From my experiences,
 MS takes every complaint and investigates fully. &nbsp;If they find that person breaking the rules, they get a ban, if they don't, they won't. &nbsp;I would much rather the guilty go ban free, than the innocent get banned.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>No one gets their account hacked from XBL, its from giving out your Live ID. &nbsp;Even people who get DoS'ed don't get their Live ID's hacked. &nbsp;If someone says that they'll hack them, they are full of it. &nbsp;If you gave them your Live ID email and password, guess
 what they don't need to hack you. &nbsp;They got everything they need to log in!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also you will not get a ban for quick fire controllers as there are licensed controllers out there that has that built into it.</p>

<p>"All it takes is one valid complaint"</p>
<p>Looks like your faith in the PET far outweighs their ability.</p>
<p>I would recommend not even filing complaints. Just 30 seconds of your life you will never get back.

<p>I think there are certain extreme cases where it is very much my concern if the person is banned or not. &nbsp;Extreme cases of harassment and slander, for example (note the "and slander" part before anyone says to simply block communications, etc..., since that
 can include a sort of second hand harassment through others).</p>

<p>Harassment and slander can cover a LOT more than just "someone called me bad names". &nbsp;They can, in fact, involve the police at times. &nbsp;This does not change that they also violated rules over XBL, and perhaps people subjected to that would feel more secure
 knowing it had been handled.</p>

            Hi Fahd,<br />
<br />
1. What is the make and model of your computer?<br />
2. What is the resolution that is set on the display? <br />
<br />
<br />
If you have a 1080p display, then you can divide your screen between three apps. I would suggest you to increase the resolution to maximum that is supported by the monitor then check if you can snap between multiple apps.<br />
<br />
Hope the information provided was useful.<br />

    <title>How to play a .WAV sound from a script, and close the player - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> antandcharmi  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to play a .WAV sound from a script, and close the player &#40;plus, force the sound to play over a game&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I need to limit my children's time on the PC playing games, and have done this with a scheduled task. I would also like to warn them when their time is nearly up. If I task schedule a "C:\...WAV" file as the action, Windows Media Player starts up to play
 it but does not close down again.</p>
<p>(Also,&nbsp;the sound&nbsp;doesn't actually seem to play while the Codemasters game is in progress! This game appears to hog the screen as unwindowed and with its own resolution, so perhaps it's hogging the speakers too. Even bat command cmd /c @echo&nbsp;^G doesn't beep
 while the game is in progress.)</p>
<p>Is there a simple "Play a sound" command somewhere in Windows Vista?</p>
<p>I tried creating a vbs script&nbsp;monkey-see, monkey-do but it doesn't work.</p>
<p>set wmp = CreateObject("WMPlayer.OCX.7")<br />
wmp.URL = "C:\Windows\Media\ding.wav"<br />
wmp.controls.play()<br />
set wmp = nothing&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Antandcharmi,</span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to use parental control option available in windows vista. You can use Parental Controls to help manage how your children
 use the computer. For example, you can set limits on your children's access to the web, the hours that they can log on to the computer, and which games they can play and programs they can run.</span></p>
<p><span>But, parental control does not have the option to alert the user before the time ends. For this you may include the TASKKILL command in your batch
 file and execute it. For more details run TASKKILL /?</span></p>
<p><span>Visit the below link for more details on it<br />

<p>Thanks for the kind reply, Bindu, but I'm just trying to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
play a sound</span>.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to limit web access, nor logon hours, nor what programs can be run, nor am I having any trouble limiting the session duration.</p>
<p>Just trying to warn the child that their time is nearly up, with a sound that will play over the game, some time before terminating.</p>
<p>If I had XP, I could have run sndrec32.</p>
<p>I just want to launch an application from a script that will play a sound and the close again, and make sure that the sound plays over any game running.</p>
<p>This really should be a simple task?</p>

    <title>repeated &#34;External storage ready for use&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> megaabite  say:</h3>
<h2>            repeated &#34;External storage ready for use&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Have had external SSD connected to Xbox One s without any problem for about a month. Copied some games to external drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, whenever the Xbox restarts (i.e. cold boot) I repeatedly get&nbsp;"External storage ready for use. Hold &lt;home&gt; to use".&nbsp; Holding the &lt;home&gt; button does nothing (aside from going to the Home screen...).&nbsp; This continues until "Welcome Megaabite" is displayed
 at the bottom of the screen - about 5 minutes. Games are essentially unusable during this time as the "notification" is more or less continuous. Warm restarts do not show this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searched to find existing troubleshooting guides, but could only find guides if the external drive never works. My Xbox and drive work fine -can run games from the drive - after the initial da-DEEP, da-DEEP, da-DEEP, da-DEEP, da-DEEP, da-DEEP, da-DEEP, da-DEEP,
 da-DEEP, da-DEEP, ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>any ideas how to get this to work without waiting for "Welcome Megaabite"? TIA!!!</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I&nbsp;suggest you try and preform a "Soft Factory Reset" on the console itself:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to reset your console to factory defaults on Xbox One.</a> I recommend you try the "Keep My Games &amp; Apps" option first before doing the "Remove everything" option. If the situation continues you may have to also Reformat the external drive itself and then
 redownload your content. Perhaps you can also set up your Gamertag to automatically sign you in when the console is first turned on so you sign in before it starts detecting the external hard drive.&nbsp; To do that : Go to your "Settings" and under the "Account"
 option go to where it says "Sign-in, Security, &amp; Passkey". Once in there go to where it says Instant Sign-in and select your main profile. Let us know with a reply if this worked for you!</p>

<p>Hi there MegaaBite, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I'm sorry to hear about the issue with the external drive and Xbox One console.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend to try:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove and then reconnect the storage device.</li><li>Connect the device to a different USB port on the console.</li><li>Power cycle your console:
<ol>
<li>Press the power button on the front of the console for about 10 seconds.</li><li>Turn on the console again, and then see if it detects the external drive.</li></ol>
</li><li>Soft Factory reset to help refresh the operating system.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Try this out and let us know the results. </p>

            I'm having a similar issue as the original poster, only with a 2 TB My Passport X.&nbsp; I've tried everything you've suggested in this thread, along with everything on the official troubleshooting page.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; The console has just stopped recognizing that
 I even have it plugged in.&nbsp; I know the drive is getting power, as it is lighting up perfectly fine and spinning, and it hasn't had an issue until today.&nbsp; Is there anything else you can recommend?

            I have experienced this issue many times before with my computers and found dust build up can cause faulty communication with electronics. I decided to open my external hard drive hub disconnect all three (3) hard drive's one by one and blew the dust out
 of it, then reconnected my hard drive hub to my Xbox and my read loop stopped, problem solved.

            <p>Greetings Guggu74,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be able to tether your internet connection, or do a File transfer via Bluetooth, you'll need to pair your iPhone with your Surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your Surface Pro, swipe from the right, click on Settings, then on Change PC Settings. Click on PC and devices, click on Bluetooth and pair your iPhone to your Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the pairing has finished, it will go into a Disconnected state (offline or not connected) as it is not currently being used. Close the PC and Devices screen, and return to the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Swipe from the right, click on Settings, then click Control Panel. Once Control Panel is open, click on Devices and Printers. Inside Devices and Printers, your iPhone should be shown. Click on it, and then a new option on the ribbon will appear&nbsp;<strong>Connect
 using</strong> and select Access Point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should enable the Bluetooth Internet tethering.</p>
<p />

            I'm not sure if this is resolved, but as a suggestion is to go to device manager, look for the bluetooth driver&nbsp;then uncheck Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power. That could be the culprit here.

            Yes, I have had this problem since I got my computer with windows 8 on it six months ago. I have tried asking for help on numerous websites including Microsoft but they tell me its big fish's problem. Actually, I can download my game manager and play any
 of my games on any computer that has windows 7 but not on any windows 8, so I think that windows 8 is not compatible with my old games. I have tried making them compatible step by step and this has not worked either. I think that the money I have invested
 in big fish games is now lost unless the new windows that comes out lets me play my old games that I miss so much. I have been in touch with big fish and I have done everything they have told me to do too. I have done a clean boot. I have refreshed. I have
 done a system restore. I have done a million things. I can't play any downloaded games, even on gamehouse or even if I put in a cd of a game. I play it for a minute or two and it flashes back to the main screen and hangs on the tool bar. I h

<h2>            Question &#58; Tiger Woods Masters ..&#38;amp&#59; Ms. Splosion Man</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>
<p>I rented this Tiger Woods Masters, to be honest - its not great</p>
<p>Question I have for it, is there any online game modes? I have to use this trial for EA Pass for this game and still yet can't find any freakin game mode for online play/multiplayer :S LOL</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Ms.Splosion Man</p>
<p>GET THE FREAKIN XBOX LIVE ARCADE!! lol</p>
<p>I am looking for some Canucks to play this arcade with in multiplayer, to not only enjoy the game ~ but to get the online achievos</p>
<p>Fell into few games on it and enjoyed it, just when I go in Multiplayer..them freakin gamers die on purpose so you don't get achievo lol and that just ticks my sleepin buttons right off!! haha</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways enough with the Freakin Rants and lets put a game on</p>

<p>I am up for some multiplayer, for Ms. Splosion Man. I am pretty serious when it comes to achievements so I won't be *** around. Just add my gamertag and we shall start the Sploding!</p>
