            <p>I know , it is really annoying that it won't let you know. You may find out if you open the Device Manager or the Device Center (Control Panel &gt; Hardware and Sound). If there is no information displayed there, I can't imagine of any other way to find out.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, you can just hit install. There is nothing to worry about. Probably a hardware installation was left in the middle. I got the same message and I just installed without caring... Everything is still ok!

You install all Windows 8 drivers provided by your hardware manufacturer's straight from their support web sites manually.&nbsp; Once you have done this - if they fully support your hardware under Windows 8 - you should not have that message.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
What is the make &amp; model of the system in question?<br />

            Same issue here.<br />
<br />
Driver Status is listed as OK<br />
<br />
Device Software only says "One or more devices connected to your PC needs additional software to work properly."<br />
<br />
I wish it would say which device and what software.<br />

<h3> funiculi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backup Error 0x8078014B&#59; Time to create image varies from 1.5 to 10.5 hours</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title:&nbsp;<strong>"Error: &nbsp;0x8078014B.__Backup of data and image (with new Notebook) from initial run to over a four-week period was 7.5 hours, 1.5 hours, 4.5 hours and 10.5 hours, respectively."</strong></p>
<p>Windows 7, 62-bit.&nbsp; Data around 273MB, backing up to 500GB external hard drive.&nbsp; Backup &amp; Restore utility issues.</p>
<p>I run daily backups and weekly images.&nbsp; After a couple of weeks of owning my new computer, I started getting error 0x8078014B several times a week.&nbsp; After running backup a second time, it didn't fail.</p>
<p>In addition, when creating images weekly, the time varied from 1.5 hours to 10.5 hours.&nbsp; This&nbsp; was in the image phase, not the data phase.&nbsp; Instead of getting faster, it was taking longer.&nbsp; This is a new computer, only around six weeks old.&nbsp; My last laptop
 had Win 7, 32-bit installed and I never had this issue.&nbsp; Had I not had 2 computers (+ a new hard drive to replace a defective) since October, 2009, where Backup &amp; Restore worked fine,&nbsp; I might think that 10.5 hour backups are the "normal".&nbsp; I started w/Vista,&nbsp;
 upgraded to Win 7 (32-bit) and have had Win 7 on 2 Dell laptops, prior to replacing all with this new Asus Notebook (64-bit).&nbsp; Backup and Restore worked without a problem before I got new Notebook.&nbsp; I see people complain about backups running 16 - 24 hours,
 or several days.&nbsp; No errors, just a ridiculous and prohibitive amount of time.</p>
<p>I finally temporarily disabled MSE one week ago and have not gotten any error messages, nor have my backups w/image taken more than ten minutes or so,&nbsp; shorter or longer, for the most part.&nbsp; Surely I should be able to run my AV (MSE) without conflicts.&nbsp;
 What are you doing to fix this and how soon should I anticipate a resolution?&nbsp; I don't' like leaving my computer unsecured, nor should I have to manually run backups in order to turn MSE on and off. There don't seem to be a lot of people with this issue considering
 all the Windows users, but this is pretty bad.&nbsp; Disabling AV is not a solution.&nbsp; This is totally unacceptable. From what I've read, Norton, Symantec, AVG, Avast, MSE, etc. all cause conflicts.&nbsp; What AV<strong>will</strong> work with BU &amp; Restore, do you you
 know?</p>
<p>I joined the forum so I could post about this specifically and never received an answer.&nbsp; I spent a long time composing and confirmed my e-mail address after posting.&nbsp; I don't think it ever got on to the forum.&nbsp; What happened?&nbsp; I shouldn't have to do this
 twice.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Well, the issue may not be because of MSE(Microsoft Security Essentials) as you have pointed out after all. As a test, you could put your computer in a&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean Boot</a> state and try to do
 backup. This workaround is to determine if any third party software is causing the issue to occur other than MSE. This way you will leave MSE on and disable other third party software.
<br />
<br />
You could also run <strong>check disk</strong> to fix any errors.</p>
<p>You can solve some computer problems by checking a drive or drives for errors. For example, you can check your computer's primary hard disk to fix some performance issues, or you can check an external hard drive if it's not working properly.</p>
<p><strong>Check a drive for errors</strong></p>

<p><br />
If the issue persists, in clean boot, since you believed it worked fine after you removed MSE, you could post your issue in MSE forums<br />

<p>Hi <strong>Amr436</strong>,</p>
<p>1. How did you came to know there is issue with the audio drivers?<br />
2. Is the sound woriking correctly on your computer?<br />
3. Do you get any error message or error code?</p>
<p><strong>I recommend you to update the drivers and see if it makes any difference. You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</strong></p>
<p>a. Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance,and then clicking Device Manager. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
b. In Device Manager, locate the Device, and then double-click the device name.<br />
c. Click the Driver tab, and then click Update Driver and follow the instructions.</p>

<p><span>-&gt; Some upgraded machines are known to do poorly. Same for new installations when things go wrong. A clean installation would make your machine rock solid.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>I have already lost a whole ton of files on my computer!</em></span></p>
<p><span>-&gt; You must have ignored the iron rule of data storage. It says that all important files must be stored on at least two independent media. An external backup disk costs less than $50.00. What keeps you from implenting

<p>Ok well I appreciate your feedback, but the thing is I am a single dad with no job and cannot work due to a severe thoracic spine injury. I am barely surviving as it is. My "machine" laptop worked just great before the windows 10 pro was released to us "insiders"
 testers. And I don't have less than or even close to $50 to spend on storage media to backup my laptop. I did have quite a few until they were stolen by my ex-fiance. And again IF I had the money I would take my laptop in to have it checked out, but I dont
 have money just laying around to pay for computer repairs.&nbsp;</p>

-&gt; As I mentioned before, reloading Windows from scratch would give you a rock solid operating system, provided that your hardware is intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>And I don't have less than or even close to $50 to spend on storage media to backup my laptop.</em></span></p>
<p><span>-&gt; I'm afraid this is similar to not&nbsp; taking out car insurance. You save on premiums but you need to wear the cost of repairs in case of an accident.</span></p>

<p><span>Follow these methods.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> Try to boot using the option "Disable automatic restart on system
 failure" so that you can note down the blue screen error.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Method 2:

<p>A number of people have reported a failure to refresh the display immediately&nbsp;when files are manipulated under Libraries...&nbsp; I'm thinking this could be the issue you're seeing.&nbsp; Does pressing the
<strong>F5</strong> key (manual refresh) cause the downloaded file to show up?&nbsp; I realize that this is not a particularly good workaround because it really should update by itself, but if it does show the file then you at least have a workaround so that you
 can continue.</p>
<p>Or is the file more permanently "hidden" somehow?&nbsp; In other words, if you download a file are you saying you never can see it in the folder into which you've downloaded it?&nbsp; If this is true, I have something for you to try...&nbsp; For the folder in which you
 cannot see the file:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Right-click</strong> the folder in the left (Navigation) pane, and choose
<strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp; Click the <strong>Customize</strong> tab.<br />
3.&nbsp; Under <strong>Optimize this folder for:</strong> click the selector and change the type to
<strong>General Items</strong>.</p>
<p>Does the downloaded file show up now?</p>

<p>I just watched The Thing and it made me want to play through the game again (original Xbox). &nbsp;It's a fantastic survival horror game which is still really fun. &nbsp;Just like the movie, trust between everyone in game is a big factor. &nbsp;If you don't give your teammates
 ammo or submit to blood tests you lose them one way or another. &nbsp;It was pretty innovative at the time. &nbsp; You had to make sure they were happy so they didn't go crazy. &nbsp;It's on the BC list so everyone give it a try!

<p>Ninja Gaiden, both NGB and NG2 have some seriously smart AI which will change on the fly to adapt to how you approach each fight forcing you to mix up your attacks, spam the same old move and it'll nail you, hard!<br />
<br />
I only play survival nowadays and while their movesets are the same the way they counter and flank constantly changes, damn AI still manages to surprise me and kill me in new ways.

<p>I have had this issue before. To be honest the quickest way to get around this is grab a wireless or wired keyboard and mouse, plug it in. Windows will find the usb keyboard and mouse, like a logitech and you can continue with Andre's comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to run bootcamp on the mac side and make a windows drivers usb. I find it odd you have no keyboard, its usually the trackpad that is the PITA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Even if you're not signing in using your e-mail ID, we will need to undergo Microsoft's account recovery process.

<p><span>Please follow the steps below:</span></p>

<li>
<span>Go to this link:&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://go.skype.com/account.diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)"><span>Click

<span>Type&nbsp;the Skype name of the account you are trying to recover and hit
<strong><span>Continue</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Look for <strong><span>Reset password</span></strong> button and click it.
</span></li><li>
<span>You will be routed to Microsoft's website for password reset.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click any radio button and hit <strong><span>Next</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>On the "<strong><span>Recover your account</span></strong>" page, please make sure that the Skype name of the account you are trying to recover is listed on the first box.</span></li><li>

    <title>Nitro PDF Creator Ver 9 does not work with Lenovo windows 8 Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisschomburg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nitro PDF Creator Ver 9 does not work with Lenovo windows 8 Mail Client</h2>
                    <p>1. I can't get my Nitro PDF creator 9 software to create a pdf of a windows 8 mail client email. I get the following error : "<strong><em>Occurrence of user interacted or failed conversion"</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. How Can you limit the number of pages you want to print, in the mail client? I shows a changeable field. "1" of 2. &nbsp;Normally i would think 1 of 2 would result in only the first page of two pages to print but no matter what I do, it prints the whole document.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are unable to use nitro PDF creator in mail app. This will happen when you donât select the default application as nitro pdf creator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps to select PDF nitro as default application.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open search windows (windows key + S).</li><li>Search for <strong>default program</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>set your default program.</strong></li><li>Select the (program) <strong>Nitro PDF creator.</strong> </li><li>Select option <strong>set this program as default </strong>and then click on <strong>
OK</strong></li></ol>
<p>Check the link below to select a default application.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/choose-programs-windows-uses-default
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesnât help I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall Nitro PDF Creator
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>For second issue</strong>: I would like you to inform that in Mail application there is no option to print the selected pages in a multi-page document.</p>

    <title>Win7 yellow exclamation marks&#58; No explanation as to what they - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Win7 yellow exclamation marks&#58; No explanation as to what they mean&#33;</h2>
                    This seems rather useless. &nbsp;Win7 displays this explanation mark, usually after my screen goes black for a few seconds. &nbsp;When you hover the mouse cursor over it it says nothing. &nbsp;That is useful. &nbsp;Not. &nbsp;What is the point of this? &nbsp;Is there any point in displaying
 a warning without saying what triggered the warning?

<p>Huh? &nbsp;What in the world are you trying to say? &nbsp;Proofread before posting! &nbsp;Maybe English isn't your first language. &nbsp;Realize there are spaces after commas, like that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've updated with Windows Update recently. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Windows Ultimate, Version 6, Build 7601 SP1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen goes black, comes back after a few seconds, yellow exclamation mark appears, no info offered. &nbsp;Is there a log somewhere that might tell me something? &nbsp;I wonder who the Einstein was who thought this marvelous feature up. &nbsp;</p>

            I have had this same problem with Cortana. Hasn't worked since day 1. I have tried everything and I mean everything, none of the fixes work. One should not have to reinstall Windows to get something working. Why can't Microsoft come up with a standalone
 install package to simply fix, uninstall&nbsp;or reinstall Cortana. With so many people having problems with Cortana that would be the smartest thing for Microsoft to do.&nbsp;

    <title>Risen through steam on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gogobuffalo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Risen through steam on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded the Risen demo through steam earlier today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I clicked "play" in steam an error popped up saying "Failed to start (unknown error)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Steam website it mentioned how you can download games meant for older operating systems and this may be why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched for answers on how to fix this, and was told about the compatibility mode.</p>
<p>So I went to program files (X86) -&gt; steam -&gt; steamapps -&gt; common -&gt; Risen-demo -&gt; bin -&gt; Risen</p>
<p>
</p><p>This file was simply called Risen, and it's type was application.&nbsp; I right clicked on it, and selected properties.</p>
<p>Then I went to compatibility and selected Windows XP (Service Pack 3). (Also tried Vista Service Pack 2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attempted to then play the game by clicking on this file, an error popped up:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Risen - Demo\bin\Risen.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect.&nbsp; Please see the application event log or use the command-line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I attempted to play the game through Steam after selecting this compatibility setting on this file, it still had the same failed to start error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how to use the sxstrace.exe tool.&nbsp; I searched this error online, and found a potential solution using the command prompt and searching for errors, but it didn't find any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also just downloaded the 2010 version of C++ for Microsoft and that didn't help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if playing this game through Steam has anything to do with this either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 on a Microsoft Surface, by the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How exactly can I get this game to run on my Surface?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please and thank you!!!</p>

 is fine and the windows troubleshooter tool can't find anything wrong with the Windows Update or the Internet Connection but it says the Windows Store is failing , and my wsreset.exe instead of rebooting the Store it just opens a black window and does nothing
 and restoring the Store doesn't work.<br />

            Hi Carin,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Everything is related. First step, Try restarting the router. If that doesn't help, change the DNS:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-update-says-we-couldnt-connect-it-to-the/663867ff-3ceb-4cd9-8494-473a676f7787">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />âThe Windows Update service was impacted by a data corruption issue in an external DNS service provider global outage on January 29, 2019. The issue was resolved on the same day and Windows Update is now operating normally, but a few customers have continued to report issues connecting to the Windows Update service. We expect these issues will go away as downstream DNS servers are updated with the corrected Windows Update DNS entries.â

    <title>disconnect from live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guerrero ultimo  say:</h3>
<h2>            disconnect from live</h2>
                    
<p>I have an issue with the beta: &nbsp;I get disconnected when I exit after a match. &nbsp;I played several matches today and then exited. &nbsp;I was disconnected from live and it said I had to sign in before I could play. &nbsp;I would sign back in and it would disconnect me
 again after about 30 seconds. &nbsp;It also was doing that to my son. &nbsp;We both use wireless. &nbsp;Even if only one of use was playing it did it. &nbsp;My wife, who was on a wired connection, did not have this problem. &nbsp;I went to the dash and would be signed back in but
 even then it would just disconnect. &nbsp;I thought it might be our fairly new 360s models so I tried it with my wives console using wifi (hers is a 360s also). &nbsp;It did it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought it might be the router but my Mac connects fine without disconnecting. &nbsp;And if I turn off the console and then turn it back on it does not have this problem. &nbsp;Not with any other game. &nbsp;I have tried for a few days and it only does this on wifi when
 I have played the Gears 3 beta. &nbsp;And like I said I was able to get our other consoles to do this. &nbsp;My son actually played Bad Company 2 and Reach without any problems the last few days and only when we played the Gears beta did it happen for him also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it appears that for use playing the Gears beta causes our consoles to have disconnect problems from live. &nbsp;I can reproduce it as it only happens after playing matches (whether 1 or more) in the beta. &nbsp;If we turn off the consoles and turn them back on
 we can play other games online or watch movies with no disconnect problems ever happening. &nbsp;And, I have never had a disconnect problem at any other time like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I figured I would post this here and see if any others have had a problem like this. &nbsp;I have tested to see if I could reproduce this separate from playing the beta but could not.</p>

<p>Weird thing is I am never disconnected during gameplay. &nbsp;Just happens when I leave the game after a match. &nbsp;Guess they probably know about it if it happens to others and will fix it before the full game ships if it is an issue.</p>

<h2>            Error code 0x803f800f help please</h2>
                    <p>I got For honor with Xbox live gold a while back and it stopped working a while ago and after re-installing it I still get the error that reads as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The person who acquired this needs an active subscription</p>
<p>This game was acquired using games with gold. Unless the person who got it renews Xbox live gold, you'll need to buy the game to play it. (0X803f800f)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This confuses me SOO much and I'm honestly annoyed, I can play ALL my other games with gold, just not for honor, as mentioned above Re-installing it did not work at all and my Xbox live gold doesn't expire until the 16th of November, next month, I am also
 the one who acquired the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really getting annoying please help</p>

            I have a similar problem and I think this is just how it works. I downloaded a game on a friend's profile to my xbox while it was free on gold, now it is not longer featured, but I only played it on his profile. When I switch profiles to mine I get this
 error because I did not get the game on this profile while it was free, although it is not my console it was installed for the other profile. When I switch to the profile I downloaded it from I can play the game, but on my profile, which has ultimate active,
 it gives the error that game pass needs to be active.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            How to save Movie as mp4 or avi&#63;</h2>
                    I have made up a movie in Windows Movie Maker 2.6. It's about 1h15 long. Now When I go to File; Save movie File etc, the move says it will take about 6000minutes to save, so I left it overnight and in the morning (10hrs later), it was still on 0%. Why
 is this. Is there a faster way to save a movie to a mp4 or avi file or something similar? PLEASE HELP?&nbsp; T

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When was the last time you were able to save movie using Windows movie maker?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have any security software installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 1</span></u></b></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>There
 is a possibility that some third party programs installed on the computer is causing the issue.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I
 would suggest that you place the computer in clean boot state and check.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>To
 help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Refer
 the below link to know more about clean boot procedure.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

</span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 2</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then you can

            This is usually caused by incompatible source files or <br />
the project is too complex for your system's resources.<br />

            Thanks for the help.<br />
My notebook runs on Windows 7 and I installed W Movie maker 2.6 because my Live movie maker can't seem to write ''pass scenes''. I would set up multiple clips so it would make one long movie, but it would start&nbsp;saving&nbsp;a movie and then as soon as the next clip
 starts it would give an error. So I downloaded Windows Movie Maker 2.6 because everyone says it's easier and better. But now I have&nbsp;this problem that it&nbsp;wants to take so long or not do it at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I will do the troubleshooting as suggested and see if I can figure out my problem.

Check the formats of your source files for compatibility and<br />
also it may be worth a try to create smaller projects.</p>

<h2>            Deleting a corrupted music file, please help&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I'm having trouble with a corrupted music file that I just can't delete, I can find the file in the iTunes music folder on my hard drive but whenever I try to do anything with it (delete/rename/move etc) even just right clicking it causes my computer to crash.
 The file in question was downloaded from Soundcloud &amp; has previously been OK and I have no idea what caused it to glitch.<br />
<br />
Due to this corrupt file I can no longer scan my computer with Norton because it crashes as soon as it gets to that file and today I tried to backup my iTunes onto my external hard drive and once it got to transfering that file, it crashed. This is incredibly
 frustrating as there is a lot of money's worth of music on my laptop and I really don't want to lose it. I've tried downloading a few bits of software off the web (unlocker etc) and they just crash as well.<br />
<br />
Can someone please help me remove this file so I can backup my music, any help would be much appreciated.
<br />
<br />
I'm running windows 8<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Hi There,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice<br />
<br />
I've tried deleting the file in safe mode, it comes up saying preparing to recycle but does nothing, then crashes. I've also been advised by someone on another forum to delete the file using command prompt, I can get to the directory the file is in but when
 I type del followed by the filename it says it cannot find the file, maybe I'm doing something wrong as I've not used command prompt before.<br />
<br />
The problem is specific to the itunes music folder and it's specific to one particular file in there, I've not come across this issue anywhere else.<br />
<br />
Has anyone got any other ideas or could someone advise me what I'm doing wrong with command prompt?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
        </p>
