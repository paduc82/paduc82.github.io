<p>It's back. but why? i hate going .5 k/d and thinking i suck then all of a sudden next match i get a 2.5 k/d. also when i got my wargasm title i actually went negative&nbsp;that game. was the only kills i got. when i got my Mario emblem i actually lost the match
 before hand on purpose then went around dieing the first half of the next match. when i decided it was time i got it pretty easily. If this isn't sniper frog then someone please tell me what going on. its like I'm two different people and i either really suck
 or I'm very good, depending how well i do it "adjusts" the game play.</p>

<p>Sniperfrog. I called shenanigans in mw2 and im still calling it now. I don't believe that they have ever put it into an online game.
</p>
<p>What about the pro-tourneys? It just wouldnt be right. </p>
<p>Sniperfrog = lag...Welcome to the internet. </p>
<p>Sniperfrog is a supposed to be a program built into mw3 that kinds of evens out player without them knowing. So you could be doing really well and the ai will kick in and start to hinder you. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I personally dont believe that its a real thing. </p>

 at you and you're able to take them all out there is something wrong with the game. i actually thought i had found some sort of glitch until i got shot from behind.</p>

<p>You can call it what you want but I noticed that when I do bad with a weapon, I switch to another weapon and then the auto aim is ridiculous. I will be shooting next to a guy and the game moves the red dot on top of the guy. &nbsp;Then after feeling like a pro
 I start playing and after few matches I do not do great again. &nbsp;So I think they might be adjusting auto aim "sensitivity" depending on how "well" you are doing.</p>
<p>Man, I love to speculate :)</p>

<h2>            Realtek Audio Manager Missing Settings&#63; Messed Up Audio</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
Ok, so I recently got a new Cyberpower PC. I edit a lot, and prefer to do so through headphones, so I plug them into the headphone jack in the front panel. However, I recently got new speakers as well for when I want to listen through those or watch a show
 with friends. That's plugged into the rear panel. The problem is that the computer reads both of these as "speakers". This wouldn't normally be an issue for me, but I noticed the headphones start becoming greatly distorted and overly sensitive when the speakers
 are plugged in (even if they're not on). As soon as I unplug the speakers, the sound goes back to normal on the headphones, so I'm assuming that it has to do with both of them being read as the same device? I tried the other rear panels for the speakers, but
 no luck. They don't provide any sound.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
I looked up ways to separate them, but they require me to go into the Realtek HD Audio Manager and click on "Device Advanced Settings". Problem there is, I'm missing that option. It's literally not where it's supposed to be. So I have no way of doing that either.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
Does anyone know how to fix the headphone problem when my speakers are plugged in? Or at the very least, know how to get "Device Advanced Settings" to appear in Realtek HD Audio Manager? Thanks!</p>

            This is where mine is.&nbsp; It's a cog wheel that's unlabeled. Click that guy and you should see the option to separate all jacks etc. Hope that helps.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b37e814-f5e8-453e-9b07-da9d12164c69?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b37e814-f5e8-453e-9b07-da9d12164c69?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/77ed064e-9ebc-4f91-a7ad-bf66e1a7cf21?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/77ed064e-9ebc-4f91-a7ad-bf66e1a7cf21?upload=true" /></a>

<p>With your 'standard' Realtek Audio Manager, you click on the folder at the top right corner to open the

<p>settings you need to select to use either headphones or speakers, or both at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have it setup to switch to headphones only there will be another button at the top for the headphone setting when you have the</p>
<p>headphones plugged into the <em>front panel</em>, so you can set up different EQ and effects for the headphones than what you use with the speakers.</p>

<p>and I have to sort&nbsp; out the settings for the headphones&nbsp; every time I switch from speakers.</p>
<p>Don't like the EQ pre-sets as much either.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro keeps going to sleep every 1-2 minutes of being idle</h2>
                    Love the idea behind the Surface Pro, but been having software and hardware issues lately. One of the software issues I've been experiencing is that when my Surface Pro first goes to sleep after a restart and I wake it up, it then begins going into sleep
 mode every like 1-2 minutes of being idle. I noticed this when reading some news on the internet.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I double checked my power options I have my current power plan (based off Balanced) set to put my Surface Pro&nbsp;to sleep&nbsp;(while plugged in) after
<b>30 minutes</b> of being idle!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone know what's causing this problem? Is this another OS bug in Windows Ei8ht? I've avoided contacting the Surface support team cause&nbsp;every time&nbsp;I've contacted them about technical problems like this, their only solution is to perform a system refresh.</div>

<h2>            Redeemed code, didn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t download and can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t re-enter code</h2>
                    
<p>I bought the expansion pass for Destiny a couple of days ago on Gamestop's website, and it gave me the code to redeem. When I redeemed the download code it said it was accepted but it did not do anything after that. It didn't download the files or anything
 and when I go to re-enter the code it says it has already been redeemed and can't use it. I've reset cache, everything. Somebody have any ideas (I'm on 360 in case that info is needed)?</p>

<p>My brother said that when he got the Destiny Expansion Pass from GameStop, the code they gave him and that he entered on his 360 simply put 34.99 plus tax into his Microsoft account. Then he went into the marketplace on his 360 and just bought the Expansion
 Pass there, using the balance on his Microsoft account. Maybe your code did the same thing? Did it just put money in your Microsoft account?</p>

            hello,.. please give me the solution to my problem..<br />
I am using VAIO E15127CN and it came with windows 8 PRO<br />
<br />
The problem is everytime taskmanager shows 100% disk usage without running any programs!!<br />
It happens everytime and persists for 2-3 minutes...!!<br />
Unable to play games smoothly, cant play HD videos continuously and multitasking is just nightmare...<br />
The configuration is very high for windows 8 64bit.<br />
<br />
Tried almost everything like resetting pc and used it for 2 days without installing any other programs to make sure that any other app is responsible for this.<br />
Windows is Up to date, BIOS and drivers are up to date also.<br />
<br />

            <p>I had this problem. I noticed that it was Zune causing the slow down. I'm not sure exactly what it is about zune that was making it&nbsp;use up all the disk IO, because it never used to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like you mention, it was the same for me; showing only three processes that were doing any IO and all the rest were pretty much 0.0 MB/s, including Zune.</p>

            No, Zune is not creating any problem..... As a part of windows 8 Zune(music and video app) has low disk and processor usage.<br />
If you install Zune apart from this then system having higher configuration like 3rd gen i5, 2GB RAdeon graphics... it wont effect the system..!! Zune consumes high graphics memory when switched to detail mode containing equalizer, transition effects etc.

            Install all the updates and optimize your system regularly... <br />
I am having the same issue, but its been 15 days reinstalling windows 8... and the disk usage problem occurs very rare... which I think my problem is solved at all!!

            <p>My machine has specs greater than what you mention, and anytime I start zune (not the music or video app, but the actual zune desktop application), my disk IO shoots to 100%. Even when watching task manager, zune is only showing 0.1MB/s in disk usage, and
 runs at most 4% cpu usage, so task manager makes it seem as though zune is not a problem at all, but in reality, it is the one app hosing my machine. I have to kill the zune process&nbsp;in order for my machine to become responsive at all again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may not be zune causing your issue, but my point is I&nbsp;think that you have some application installed that when you run it, it is not playing nicely with windows 8 and is making your disk IO go to 100%, even though task manager is leading you to believe
 nothing is using all of the disk IO.</p>

            May be... because I used to install Zune foe windows 7 but Now I need not install it as it comes as a part of windows 8 app.<br />
<br />
Actually the process named as System and Services (background services) consumes 100% disk but the worst part is it cant be killed as its an essential process.<br />
<br />
After Installing all updates, it happens still but very rare.... not frequently as it used to happen earlier!!

<p>By "<em><strong>I didn't get it when I put in the code</strong></em>" do you mean that your redeem code did not work?</p>
<p>Or it worked but its not in the game? Just to let you know the "Royal Raiment" is a piece of costume outfit&nbsp;that is found in the <strong><u>Character Menu &gt; Gear</u></strong>. And this is where you can change Noctis's outfit/costume. Hope this helps!&nbsp;:)</p>

            What do you mean "does not work"? Are you using the correct syntax? Cmd runs OK? Please clarify.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>As I understand the issue, Windows 8 Pro is taking long time to boot. Please let me know if this is not correct.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps I may need a few more information to understand the issue better.<br />
</strong>1. Do you get any error messages?<br />
2. Did you make any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Let's first try to boot the computer to Safe Mode and check if you face the issue.<br />
<br />
a. <strong>Boot </strong>from the <strong>Windows 8 DVD.<br />
</strong>b. Click on <strong>Repair your computer.<br />
</strong>c. Click on <strong>Troubleshoot </strong>and then select <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.<br />
d. Select the option <strong>Safe mode </strong>and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> I would suggest you to disconnect all external devices except mouse and keyboard and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If the first method didn't fix the issue set the computer in ‘Clean boot’ state to check software conflicts. Refer the following steps:<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
a) Press the ‘<strong>Windows + R’ </strong>key on the <strong>keyboard</strong>.<br />
b) In the ‘<strong>Run’ </strong>windows type <strong>’MSCONFIG’ </strong>and click ‘<strong>Ok’</strong>.<br />
c) Click the ‘<strong>Boot’ </strong>tab and <strong>uncheck </strong>‘<strong>Safe Boot’
</strong>option.<br />
d) On the ‘<strong>General’ </strong>tab, click to select the option ‘Selective <strong>
startup’, </strong>and then <strong>click to clear </strong>the option<strong> Load startup items
</strong>check box.<br />
e) On the ‘<strong>Services’ </strong>tab, click to select the <strong>‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box</strong>, and then click ‘<strong>Disable all’.<br />
</strong>f) On the ‘<strong>StartUp’ tab</strong>, click ‘<strong>Open Task Manager’</strong>. In the Task Manager window under
<strong>startup tab</strong>, <strong>right click </strong>on each <strong>startup item
</strong>which are enabled and select ‘<strong>Disable’</strong>.<br />
f) Click ‘<strong>OK’</strong>, and then click <strong>Restart</strong>.<br />
<div><strong>Step 2: Enable half of the services:</strong><br />
a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <strong>Services tab</strong>, and then click to select the <strong>
Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
</strong>c. Click to <strong>select half of the check boxes </strong>in the <strong>
Service list</strong>.<br />
d. Click <strong>OK</strong>, and then click <strong>Restart</strong>.<br />
<div><strong>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns:</strong><br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
<br />
<strong>If the problem does not occur,</strong> repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<br />
<strong>If only one service is selected in the Service list,</strong> and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.<br />
<div><strong>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items:<br />
If no startup item causes this problem,</strong> a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.<br />
<div><strong>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns:</strong><br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
<br />
<strong>If the problem does not occur, </strong>repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, </strong>and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
<br />
<strong>If no startup item causes this problem,</strong> a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box
 in either step.<br />
<div><strong>Step 6: Resolve the problem:<br />
After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem,</strong> contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the
 problem item.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 7:<br />
Note: </strong>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
<br />
a) Press the ‘<strong>Windows + R’ </strong>key on the <strong>keyboard</strong>.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type <strong>’MSCONFIG’ </strong>and click ‘<strong>Ok’</strong>.<br />
c) On the ‘<strong>General’ </strong>tab, click the ‘<strong>Normal Startup’ </strong>
option, and then click ‘<strong>OK’</strong>.<br />
d) <strong>Restart </strong>the computer and check with the issue.</div>

            I had the same problem and found that it had to do with the Microsoft Services, everything that starts with the prefix 'app'. Open msconfig, stop all services starting with app, restart, and it's normal.<br />

    <title>Random family passcode&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blobagoony  say:</h3>
<h2>            Random family passcode&#63;</h2>
                    Today when i signed in and tried to watch netflix, my xbox asked me to enter a 4 button passcode. I did not have a passcode before this, and theres no one in my house that could set one. When i signed in it did not say that i was previously signed in on
 another console, but i dont know what else it could be besides some form of hacking. It was after the october update so maybe its just a glitch? I have already changed all my passwords so now i just need to know how to get this family passcode off without
 deleting all of my xbox data. Any help would be greatly appreciated :)

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just bought a Trekstor Surftab twin 10.1 with Windows 10.</p>
<p>I have done literally nothing. I tried to connect to the wifi from the router of my house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then it showed a blue screen saying that there is a problem&nbsp;</p>
<p>""DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (rtwlans.sys)""&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I tried to switched on my wifi spot from my phone. </p>
<p>And this time the tab was well connected to the wifi hotspot shared by my phone without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help solve this problem? </p>
<p>Is it something to do with my router rather than the tab?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know nothing about computers. </p>

</p><p>I sincerely thank you for your help.</p>

            Hi Frazil M
<div>&nbsp;In answer to your question, I first bought my computer from brand new and it had XL&nbsp;installed&nbsp;and when windows seven first came ou,t I&nbsp;bought&nbsp;a licence. To cut a long story short, on the odd&nbsp;occasion&nbsp;there is a slight glitt which I only&nbsp;could&nbsp;presume
 was due to the newness. anyway&nbsp;just&nbsp;recently I have been&nbsp;discovering&nbsp;more than the normal problems until on one fateful day the crash!!!</div>
<div>So I put windows 7 disc in and after going through a couple of days of back up and loading&nbsp;service&nbsp;pack 1.&nbsp;yippee&nbsp;back to normal....NOOOO. the first thing that happened was for i Tunes not to work. and my mail Program not working properly.</div>
<div>so I went to&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;and it was&nbsp;recommended&nbsp;this bug finder device so I loaded it and nothing&nbsp;so&nbsp;back to&nbsp;square&nbsp;one then when I went to turn my machine back on it came up with how I described In my&nbsp;question&nbsp;, after the second or third try,, as the machine
 started ,&nbsp;I started&nbsp;pressing&nbsp;dell button to get into boot and because I was&nbsp;thinking&nbsp;My finger was still hitting the button after the logo had stopped,,, and hey presto.</div>

            <p>I am having the&nbsp;same issue with my laptop - TOSHIBA Satellite M100 (Motherboard Chipset:&nbsp;Intel 945GM (Calistoga-GM) + ICH7-M/U).</p>
<p>I am currently running&nbsp;Microsoft Windows 10 Professional Build 10586.753 on it and trying to upgrade to v. 1607.</p>
<p>I am stuck at "choose keyboard layout" when the&nbsp;computer restarts after installing updates.</p>
<p>There is the&nbsp;tonne of people on the internet experiencing the same issue since 2015 using Windows 10 with no solution. It seems to affect the&nbsp;couple of brand name computers from Dell, HP, Toshiba, etc.</p>
<p>I am having the&nbsp;issue with the latest builds only, starting with anniversary update.</p>
<p>I've tried to perform the&nbsp;clean install with latest ISO with the&nbsp;same result.</p>
<p>Keyboard and touchpad don't react at "choose keyboard layout" screen. The external USB mouse if plugged in is powered, but not recognised.</p>
<p>Since machine&nbsp;does not respond to any user input, the only option is to power reset machine. Luckily, OS is able to boot to the&nbsp;previous build (10586.753).</p>
<p>What makes me really upset, however, is the fact that I wouldn't care about upgrading to newer build if it was not forced on to me. Even when I select "defer updates" my computer will restart every night and I find it stuck at "choose keyboard layout" screen
 the next morning and the&nbsp;only way to get my computer running is to disconnect the&nbsp;power source and pull out the battery.</p>

            yes; Exactly that happens to me; I've tried to block updates; And it continues to be repeated; There is no solution and microsoft says nothing; Or companies take a patch for that; About 1 year ago update the bios; To give better compatibility with some
 programs; But with windows anniversary I could not.

<p>It is convenient for Microsoft to just say "contact your device manufacturer for OS compatibility". But the thing is it was working before 1607 and apparently&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;made some change(s) in 1607 to break it. I wish Microsoft would have done a serious investigate
 to let us know what happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like the sensible thing for me to do now is going back to Windows 7 and go with Google Chrome&nbsp;as my internet browser since IE is long in tooth and Edge doesn't work in Windows 7. So much for Microsoft Windows 10's campaign.</p>

<p>Just a little update:</p>
<p>I've upgraded my laptop a month ago and replaced CPU with maximum frequency supported by my laptop's motherboard. Specifically, I've installed
<a href="http://www.ebay.ca/itm/262309001950?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Intel Core 2 Duo T7600</a> which is x64 type of CPU and I could install 64 bit version of Windows 10. From that point on, my laptop could work with most up-to-date Win 10 version.</p>
<p>Therefore, partial success, except that the true age of my laptop manifested and Win 10 was fairly sluggish compared to my expectations&nbsp;for faster CPU.</p>
<p>I've downgraded to Win 7 and gave it to my family.</p>
<p>Now I rock with new HP Envy...</p>

                    I screwed up the installation of Windows when I was reseting my computer. It now just continuously reboots and won't load Windows. I tried to make a bootable USB. I followed all directions, but my computer wouldn't recognize it. I'm not looking to just
 find a Windows installation disk. My computer came preloaded 6 years ago with Windows 8. I did the free upgrade to Windows 10 and had that ever since. What installation disk would I need? Windows 8 or Windows 10? Thank you!&nbsp;

            If I were in your shoes, I'd install Windows 8 and attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 again. There should be a digital license connected to your Microsoft account that should allow Windows 10 to activate again. If I'm wrong with this, though, there are plenty of other people here who can supply a better response.

            Hi  Mill3r811
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />I would not buy a new disk, because this is not gonna resolve the issue you are experience. 
<br />
<br />Here is what I recommend you do.
<br />
<br />Try resetting your BIOS defaults:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in again, power up
<br />
<br />Go through the steps again to make a bootable copy and perform a clean install. if you already have bootable media, you can skip that step:
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi Miller.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />THere's no reason to buy anything or install WIndows 8 to then do the inferior Upgrade install to WIndows 10. You're entitled to reinstall WIndows as often as you want and it will reactivate with the Digital License assigned when you first Upgraded.  
<br />
<br /> Just follow the  illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create the latest Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />If other problems booting the media just post back what they are and I'll walk you through them.  The media can ALWAYS be booted if the steps are followed correctly, if not then the media is bad or another approach needs to be taken like booting it from 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            OK, so this must be an IMAP account, since the other types have folders called
<em>Inbox</em>, <em>Drafts</em>, <em>Sent items</em>, <em>Junk email</em> and <em>
Deleted items</em>. Here are some suggestions for how to configure an IMAP account. You may find on experimentation that different settings work better for you:<span><em>&nbsp;</em></span><span>
</span>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reset the list of IMAP folders:<br />
</strong>Click on the account name in the folder pane and then press Alt-S F to open the
<em>Show/hide IMAP folders</em> dialogue. Click <em>Reset List</em> to refresh the folder list, then use the buttons to show only the folders you want to see. Note the exact names of the 'special' folders.</li><li><strong>Map the local special folders to the IMAP folders on the server: </strong>
<br />
Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select <em>Properties</em>.
<br />
On the IMAP tab, select <em>Store special folders on IMAP server,&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;then enter the server's names for the special folders in the boxes. If the folder for&nbsp;junk email&nbsp;at the server is called
<em>Spam</em>, then enter&nbsp;<em>Spam (</em>not <em>spam </em>or <em>SPAM)&nbsp;</em>into the box alongside
<em>Junk email path </em>and so on. You may have to provide a <em>Root folder path
</em>if the proper folders don't show up in the folder pane.</li><li><strong>Make </strong><em><strong>Deleted items </strong></em><strong>folders work the same way for all accounts:<br />
</strong>When viewing your message list, press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options. <br />
On the <em>Advanced</em> tab, select <em>Use the 'Deleted Items' folder for IMAP accounts</em>.</li></ol>

<h2>            Shortcuts Not Working in Windows 10 - Looking on Wrong Drive</h2>
                    <p>I "upgraded" to Windows 10 this morning from Windows 8.1. &nbsp;Since then, several of my shortcuts for programs I have installed have stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my computer, I have a fairly small SSD that I use as my C drive. &nbsp;I have a larger drive that I use as D drive. &nbsp;While using Windows 8.1, I installed almost all of my software to the D drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example of a shortcut that is having this problem is one I have for Civilization 4 BTS. &nbsp;When I look in the properties of this shortcut, the target is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"D:\Program Files (x86)\2K Games\Firaxis Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 4 Complete\Beyond the Sword\Civ4BeyondSword.exe"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where the game is installed, and the path is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I double click on this shortcut to run the game, I get an error message:</p>
<p>"C:\Program Files (x86)\2K Games\Firaxis Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 4 Complete\Beyond the Sword\Civ4BeyondSword.exe</p>
<p>The specified path does not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the path, and then try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, the shortcut is attempting to run the program from the C drive, but it is not there. &nbsp;When I check the properties of the shortcut again, it still has the D:\ path that it had before. &nbsp;Something is clearly wrong with how Windows 10 is trying
 to run my shortcut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to change the Windows 10 setting of where applications were stored to see if that might help, but that option was grayed out and unchangeable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other interesting information... I can right click on the start button, click run, and paste my D:\ target string above into the run window, hit enter, and the program will run correctly. &nbsp;The target string is not the problem here, it's how Windows 10 is
 trying to do things when I double click on the shortcut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several shortcuts that are broken like this, and it's very frustrating.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>There are several other shortcuts that also behave in the same broken way, as I said in my original post. &nbsp;They seem to be all shortcuts I have for things inside of my D:\Program Files or D:\Program Files (x86) directories.</p>

            <p>Wow great start with Win 10, right clicking on the shortcut will give me an option to open the program. but it does not like it and the blue circle spins for awhile before opening. also if I left click rapidly about seven times it will open. When I put the
 icons in the tool var at the bottom they work.</p>

            <p>I have a similar problem with 250 shortcuts that I created in Win 8.1, and after upgrading to Win 10, none of these particular shortcuts work. The error message I get is
<br />
"Problem with Shortcut -- The drive or network connection that the shortcut refers to is unavailable. Make sure that the disk is properly inserted or the network resource is available, and then try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click "Open File Location" in the Properties window, I get the same message. The path to the file is correct. If I recreate the shortcut, the path looks the same, however now the shortcut works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, any shortcut to an internet address works ok. And, any shortcuts related to the Start Menu work ok. It's only shortcuts I created in 8.1 to personal files that do not work.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Not just an upgrade to Windows 10 from some prior version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But same issue with from Windows 10 1511 update to </p>
KB3198586 to 10586.679
<p>that has now caused that issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the same method for installing programs for the default install folders.</p>
<p>To get the update to actually have success though, I had to change those registry settings back to default C:\ locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also noticed that despite the shortcut properties, either in Start menu or on desktop, appearing correctly and saying the D:\ target, when you hover over the shortcut, that still says the C:\ location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So despite the visual setting being correct - Win10 is still using a setting from somewhere that is wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched through the registry for one such example using the confused incorrect location - not found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it's somewhere else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And my case the same as mentioned above - these apps never installed on C:\ drive, still in folder that says will be used - it's just not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can't be that difficult for Microsoft to figure out.</p>

            I found out that by opening the Properties of the shortcut, then changing a character in the path and changing it back (so the Apply option is not greyed out), then saving the shortcut makes it work! There must be some non-displayed setting that gets reset
 when the shortcut is "modified". I have no idea where that setting would be.

<br />Click start, type “cmd” - right click and run as admin
<br />
<br />Type: diskpart
<br />And hit enter
<br />
<br />then, 
<br />
<br />Type: list volume
<br />And hit enter
<br />
<br />make note of the volume number that is assigned to F
<br />
<br />Then Type: select volume #(that number)
<br />And hit enter
<br />
<br />Then Type: remove letter=F
<br />And hit enter 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
