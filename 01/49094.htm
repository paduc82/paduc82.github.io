<h2>            Anything I do to my Windows Firewall automatically resets.</h2>
                    <p>When trying to set up the outbound/inbound rules, it appears for awhile till I refresh it and it just disappears. Whenever I startup programs such as Skype, I have to "Allow" the program to start the program up. However, whenever I restart my computer, I
 will have to do the same thing again. Programs such as Skype, Steam and Reflector are the programs that need me to be prompted. Even turning off my Firewall doesn't work as it will just automatically turn itself on. Doesn't seem to be a virus because all it
 is doing is annoying me but not actually endangering me. I have checked my inbound and outbound rules but it seems that all it does is just set all the rules to default as if some reset button is being spammed. I know a BSOD happened. I can't really remember
 if it happened after or before but the BSOD happened when I was watching YouTube but it was a strange BSOD. After dumping all the physical memory, an error came up saying that the dump file was too small and it was creating a substitute? I was waiting for
 the BSOD to end by itself as usual but this time it didn't so I just forced a restart and it seemed okay afterwards. If any of you need a log, tell me where to get it but this seems more like a registry problem to me. I am not that good with computers but
 I am also not that bad. Oh and if after all this if you didn't know... I need help please. Thanks :D</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes:</p>
<p>- I can't remember what I have done before this problem occured</p>
<p>- I have already run an SFC scan (No results)</p>
<p>- Run Malwarebytes (No results)</p>

<p>- Tried Googling around</p>

<h2>            WPA2 Enterprise EAP-TLS machine&#47;device certificate authentication problem with Windows 10 client</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am trying to use pfSense to support EAP-TLS with WPA2-Enterprise (machine/device authentication, not user authentication) for wireless clients using FreeRADIUS and pfsense CA on my existing working pfSense server. I believe I have implemented the configuration
 correctly using a range of documentation and guides, but my initial testing with a standalone Windows 10 client is not going well. I'd really appreciate any advice on where I am going wrong which I think is most likely certificate related. I have summarised
 below the steps I have followed, important bits of configuration and importantly windows event log error entry:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Main components:<br />
pfSense (2.4.3)<br />
Freeradius 3 package<br />
pfSense Certificate Authority<br />
Cisco enterprise access point<br />
Windows 10 Professional client (standalone not domain)<br />
<br />
Configuration Process:<br />
<br />
1. Existing pfSense router - Added FreeRadius3 package<br />
<br />
2. Created a new pfSense CA&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; - 2048bit<br />
&nbsp; - sha256<br />
&nbsp; - common name: internalRootCA<br />
<br />
3. Created a new certificate for freeradius&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; - 2048bit<br />
&nbsp; - sha256e<br />
&nbsp; - common name: radius.domain.local&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; (I went with this naming convention to support a future move to an internal domain - was this an incorrect decision ? I've replaced the real domain name with domain.local for the purpose of this internet post)<br />
<br />
4. Created a new certificate for the Windows 10 Professional Client<br />
&nbsp; - 2048bit<br />
&nbsp; - sha256<br />
&nbsp; - common name: client001<br />
<br />
5. Freeradius configuration:<br />
- NAS/Clients<br />
&nbsp; - Added a entry for the Cisco Enterprise Wireless Access point&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; - Shared secret etc<br />
&nbsp; - Most settings left default<br />
<br />
- Interface<br />
&nbsp; - Created a new interface for the Cisco Enterprise Wireless Access point to use<br />
&nbsp; - Most settings left default (Type - Authentication, Port 1812 etc)<br />
<br />
- Settings<br />
&nbsp; - Left default<br />
<br />
- EAP<br />
&nbsp; - Disable weak EAP types - Yes<br />
&nbsp; - Default EAP type - TLS<br />
&nbsp; - Ignore Unknown EAP Types - Yes<br />
&nbsp; - Certificates for TPS:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; - SSL CA Cert - internalRootCA selected<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; - SSL Revocation List - internalRootCA Revocation List selected<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; - SSL Server Certificate - radius.domain.local certificate selected<br />
&nbsp; - EAP-TLS<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Left default<br />
&nbsp; - All other settings default<br />
<br />
- Users<br />
&nbsp; - None/Blank<br />
<br />
6. Configured Cisco Enterprise wireless access point to use the freeradius server with shared secret and created a SSID with WPA2 Enterprise.<br />
<br />
<br />
7. Exported the CA root certificate and imported into 'Trusted Root CA store' on the Windows 10 Client.<br />
&nbsp;- I also created a certificate from this CA for the pfSense web interface using this root CA and tested that the Windows 10 client is successfully trusting the root CA certificate i.e. no certificate trust errors in the web browser when accessing the web interface.<br />
<br />
<br />
8. Exported the Windows 10 Desktop Client and imported into the 'Certificates - Local Computer - Personal Store'<br />
<br />
I have checked the Microsoft 'Certificate requirements when you use EAP-TLS or PEAP with EAP-TLS' document and believe the configuration and details in the certificates meet these requirements. The only requirement I was unsure of was:&nbsp;<br />
- 'The Subject Alternative Name (SubjectAltName) extension in the certificate contains the user principal name (UPN) of the user'.<br />
- I want to do device/machine based EAP-TLS authentication therefore with no 'user' involvement. I believe Apple IOS devices may do this slightly differently and supply certificates in a user context which may require further configuration, but for now I'm
 focussing on Windows 10 device/machine authentication.&nbsp;<br />
(https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/814394/certificate-requirements-when-you-use-eap-tls-or-peap-with-eap-tls)<br />
<br />
9. Windows 10 Wireless network configuration<br />
- Created a manual wireless network profile<br />
- New SSID&nbsp;<br />
- WPA2 Enterprise<br />
- Authentication Type - Smart Card or other certificate<br />
- Use a certificate on this computer - Use simple certificate selection<br />
- Validate the server's identity by validating the certificate with the 'pfSense internalRootCA' certificate selected<br />
- Advanced Settings - 802.1x settings<br />
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Specify authentication mode - Computer Authentication Only<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Testing results:<br />
<br />
- When the Windows 10 client attempts to connect there are no errors/entries in the pfSense Freeradius logs - there are no entries to show any attempted authentication request. The Cisco Wireless Access point shows the initial wireless client association but
 shortly afterwards a disassociation. Finally the Windows 10 event log has the error below - my current assumption is that Windows is either expecting a different client certificate to use to authenticate, not happy with the client certificate I have created
 or for some reason it is ignoring the client configuration to do 'Computer Authentication only' and not finding a certificate in the 'user' store.<br />
<br />
<br />
Windows 10 Professional Event Log - WLAN-Autoconfig Failure entry when attempting to connect to the wireless network.<br />
<br />
&lt;Log START&gt;<br />
Wireless 802.1x authentication failed.<br />
<br />
Network Adapter: Network Controller<br />
Interface GUID: {xxxxxx}<br />
Local MAC Address: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx<br />
Network SSID: [NEW WPA2 Entperise SSID]<br />
BSS Type: Infrastructure<br />
Peer MAC Address: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx<br />
Identity: host/client001<br />
User:&nbsp;<br />
Domain:&nbsp;<br />
Reason: Explicit Eap failure received<br />
Error: 0x40420110<br />
EAP Reason: 0x40420110<br />
EAP Root cause String: Network authentication failed due to a problem with the user account<br />
<br />
EAP Error: 0x40420110<br />
&lt;Log END&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope all the above information is useful and really appreciate any advice on what is going wrong.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Stuart.

<h2>            Wireless USB adapters compatible with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Would someone please share which wireless adapter they are using that works with Windows 10.</p>
<p>I have been on the net for two days now searching for answers. I bought&nbsp;a WNDA3100v2 that shows to be compatible with 10 after the latest factory download. Trust me it does not work with 10.</p>
<p>Also I had a WN111 that I was using on 7 and it worked for a while after upgrade but then started not waking up after sleep or restart and after a few days does not work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Surely their is some adapter that you can install and it work right off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Post them up. I don't care if it's a ten buck one off of ebay if it would just work.</p>

            <p>Anil, </p>
<p>I did use those suggestions and I could see networks and showed to be connected to mine.</p>
<p>But I could not get through my router to my cable modem. Network map showed me with an X from router to modem.</p>
<p>I finally brought&nbsp;PC into house from garage and plugged into Ethernet&nbsp; and tried same things and my old WN111 came alive. I disabled wire connection and&nbsp; pulled 35meg on speed test wireless.</p>
<p>I did not receive any updates or have a clue what went on but it works now.</p>
<p>Only thing I have to manual connect when I first turn it on, but it will work fine all day long after that.</p>
<p>Really that's fine with me right now. I returned my new Netgear adapter.</p>
<p>FYI I have two Lenovo PCs in garage.&nbsp;The older one I went form XP to 8 to&nbsp;8.1 to 10 with older DLink PCI wireless card that pulls 30 to 35 meg with no Windows 10 problems.</p>
<p>The other one&nbsp;I went from 7 to 10 with really no problems other than the wireless issue.</p>
<p>I usw them for ebay sales and testing.</p>
<p>I have a new Dell I bought with 10 on it with no problems and a Toshiba I upgraded to 10 from 7 in dining room with no problems.</p>
<p>Really I'm rolling with 10 just fine.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I did not get an opportunity to see the compatibility mode tab because it turns out I already have the most advanced driver and this is reported to me without any options. The latest driver download (supporting win 8.1) also&nbsp;does not contain any .exe file
 only, a .dll and .inf file and couple of smaller support files. The properties&nbsp;tabs provide no compatibility option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would have to agree with the original poster that there do not currently appear to be ANY wireless adapters advertising themselves as working with Windows 10 and Linksys reported to me today (Oct 13, 2015) through their chat support that NONE of their
 wireless adapters are compatible with Windows 10. <br />
</p>
<p>Also, Windows 10 did not report this issue when surveying my machine, instead telling me everything was compatible with the Win10. I hope whatever MS changed in Windows 10 that is making this such a PITA is going to make wireless performance much better
 down the road.</p>

<p>Are you from Microsodt tecnical expertise? If yes, This is not an answer to appreciate from Microsoft technical expertise, Edge browser use to work &amp; play videos earlier.&amp; not working now might be due to software issue after the upgrade. Please guide with

<p>Hey there Venkata!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're experiencing issues trying to stream movies off of the browser on the console.</p>
<p>However depending on the sites that you are using to view these films on, the browser might not work. What ChiefJoboo had explained earlier is correct. Though Microsoft Edge may be a good browser, it is important to&nbsp;note that&nbsp;the console was not designed
 to stream movies like that on third party or pirate sites unless the page and video player are supported.</p>
<p>If you are using a reputable site that perhaps has an app, such as Netflix or Hulu, I would suggest downloading said app and attempting to watch the media there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it did work at one point though, it could be a networking issue. I would suggest checking your network and making sure that it's up to Xbox Live criteria outlined in<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/network-settings?cm_mmc=%25channelcode%25TWITTER%7C7001_B1-_-3%20-%20Education&amp;linkId=11652884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 Network settings on Xbox One</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>

                    <p>I'm using the full screen mode for the start menu. When I click the windows key or windows icon in the bottom left corner of my screen, it opens the start menu in full screen mode. However, it opens the "Pinned Tiles" section by default, and I want it to

<p>I&nbsp; strongly support this request - for Microsoft to allow the 'All Apps' to show by default when you hit the Windows Button in Windows 10 (Instead of the current default where Windows Button shows LARGE Pinned Tiles. Reason - our company run laptops with
 smallish screens - and the large Pinned tiles only shows a small portion of all Apps. The benefit of having 'All Apps' show by default is the larger number of apps immediately visible/accessible.&nbsp; So I waste time having to move the ALL APPS view everytime...
</p>
<p>* Note - a possible alternative would be to show only Small Pinned Tiles rather than Large Pinned Tiles. How do I log this request for Microsoft to develop??</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center bug</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I own a Microsoft Explorer Touch Mouse and using Windows 8 x64 RTM and Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center 2.0.162.0 (last version available) I found a bug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use the "Reverse Scroll Direction" feature of the Touch Strip. But whenever I restart Windows, that feature is back to "normal". The indicator says it's activated but it's not. You have to open the Center, disable the feat, and then activate it again for
 it to work as intended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know any additional information you require to fix this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            I have this issue too. How annoying! Microsoft should be embarrassed this hasn't been fixed for several months.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if it's possible to enact the setting using an API call or command-line script, such that one could work around the issue by having that script run on startup, rather than having to click through all of the settings to find it?<br />

            I tried contacting Microsoft about this today. I called their hardware support line. The preliminary response from Tier 1 support is this behavior is normal, but that I should confer with Tier 2 support. After two attempts, they were unable to transfer
 me to Tier 2 support (a known, temporary problem). They suggested I call back another time.<br />

            I contacted Microsoft support about this again today.<br />
<br />
I didn't realize, but a new version of the Mouse and Keyboard Center has been released (2.2.173). It still has the bug, but the setting is now called "Flip scrolling direction".<br />
<br />
They still were not able to get me through to Tier 2 support, but the did schedule a call back so I hope to hear from MS in under 24 hours. We'll see.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Cursor goes above screen dual monitors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hellojream  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Cursor goes above screen dual monitors</h2>
                    <p>This started happening yesterday, and it is very perplexing. I disable all software I know of and tried aligning my screens in different ways, yet --
<strong>the mouse disappears at the top of the screen.&nbsp;</strong>It goes beyond the start menu, it doesn't matter what monitor I use, one of them goes weird. This is NOT a right/left problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can move my mouse to the top of the screen, then to left or right, and bring it down on the other screen. I haven't changed any settings until today and tried to fix it today.<strong> Is anyone else having this issue?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an issue because I use a Virtual Machine in full screen on one monitor and I need a toolbar at the top, but the mouse just to nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using dual DVI-D for my monitors.</p>

<p>Two options remain. 1)obtain Windows 10 .iso file and put on a flash drive or cd so you can boot to it and do a fresh install. 2) call Microsoft or chat online with one of there techs.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Chris, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>By creating a family on your Xbox console, this can help you manage your children's privacy and online safety settings. To gain a better grasp of your case, let's gather the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you referring to the Xbox console or <a href="http://xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox.com</a> where can't to see your son's gamertag?</li><li>If you're accessing your son's gamertag on an Xbox console, are you using the Xbox One or the Xbox 360?</li><li>Were you able to add your son's Xbox profile on the Xbox console?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Ensure that you are signed in with the correct Microsoft account associated with your son's gamertag. Your son's account should not be a part of another family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you need to add your son's Xbox profile on the Xbox console for it to sync and reflect over the web. It may take up to 24 hours for the changes to take effect.</p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Have you tried using System File Checker to see if that will replace your missing .DLL file/files? You can try this by:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Run</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Type
<strong>cmd</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>OK</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Enter the command
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> (You will need to have your XP disk handy)</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>System File Checker scans all of the system .DLL files to check to see if any are missing or changed. Any file that has an inconstancy will be
 replaced.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope that helps, look forward to hearing back from you.</span></span></p>

            Hi Stefanesco,<br />
<br />
Are you able to run other programs without any issues?<br />
<br />
This problem occurs if the .exe file association in the registry is corrupt. This behavior is generally caused by viruses; one of which is SirCam virus, which modifies the .exe file association in registry.<br />
<br />
If you suspect or confirm that your computer is infected with a virus, run a complete scan using your anti-virus software to remove the virus.<br />
<br />
Refer: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/311446" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/311446</a><br />
<br />
If that does not work, I'd have you contact the software manufacturer for best help.<br />

<h2>            &#34;Installation stopped&#34; problem happening on both of my xboxes</h2>
                    <p>Just got the xbox one x, been having major issues installing games, trying to install shadow of war at the moment, says installation stopped around the&nbsp;2 GB mark on both the X and my older xbox one. Have factory reset my X multiple times, tons of hard resets, offline download gives me the same result, also having the same problem with halo 5, trying to install&nbsp;it on&nbsp;the X using local network transfer, it downloaded the entire 105 gb and wouldnt start, eventually uninstalled it, tried the disc, would only install for a few seconds before being cut off. Blows my mind how im unable to download games on either xbox, any help&nbsp;would be appreciated been having this problem for a couple days.</p>

<h2>            Error 1327 when installing Avery DesignPro 5.4 after refreshing Windows</h2>
                    <p>Well here I am again with another question/problem. I had to refresh my computer, and while most everything important came back, a few programs did not. I am in the process of re-installing them. The one that's a problem right now is Avery's DesignPro 5.4.
 I had it on and working perfectly before the refresh but now when I try to re-install it the Windows Installer Configuration&nbsp;runs OK, but when it tries to install it fails. It keeps&nbsp;advising an invalid Drive F: I've never had a Drive F:&nbsp;It also gives me an
 error code 1327. Can you advise me on what to do. I used this program often and would like to get it back. Avery has apparently discontinued this program, but I was still able to use it for many different kinds of labels. Thanks.

<p><span><span>Hi Gautam Shah ROCKS</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Try booting the computer in clean boot and check if you receive this error message. To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows
 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Steps to
<strong>perform clean boot</strong> and check if you have the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click Start, type
<strong>msconfig</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>On the
<strong>General</strong> tab, click <strong>Selective Startup</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iv.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the
<strong>Load Startup Items</strong> check box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>v.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Services tab</strong>, click to select the <strong>Hide All Microsoft Services</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>Disable All</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>vi.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>vii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>When you are prompted, click

<p><span><span><span>viii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>After the computer starts, and try installing the driver.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>If the issue is resolved check which third party is causing the problem</span></strong><span>,

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span></span><span><span>On the
<strong>General tab</strong>, click the <strong>Normal Startup</strong> option, and then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iv.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><span><span>You may even check for Intel Graphics Accelerator if it is listed in program and feature. If it is listed you may uninstall it from there
 and reinstall it back.<span>&nbsp; </span>Make sure you install the latest version of driver which is compatible with Windows 7</span></span></p>

<p><span>First of all<br />
thank you for your reply.<br />
But these things I did, I also&nbsp;install a clean copy of window 7, on my system and I use latest version of graphics<br />
driver for my system, but this problem not resolved.<br />
As a fresh copy of window I use so, in services tab only windows program are running, so there are no conflict by<br />
third party program.<br />
I also read on net, some people have same type of problem.<br />
So I think that there may be compatibility problem between my system and latest driver, so I really thankful to you if you can provide a link for previous version of graphics driver or may provide some other solution&nbsp;for this.<br />
<br />

<p>Additional information.&nbsp; I installed Windows 7 in March.&nbsp; Did not have any display problems until Labor Day weekend.&nbsp; A week later it worked fine, no problems until today.&nbsp; It doesn't just hang and display become black, after the message:<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Display
 driver Intel Graphics Accelerator Drivers for Windows Vista(R) stopped responding and has successfully recovered.</span></strong>It also changes focus from whatever I'm doing to other apps.&nbsp; For example, when I'm in a web browser, it will change to an Excel
 spreadsheet or Word document that is open in the background.&nbsp; It has even tried to open an app that isn't open.&nbsp; Mouse and keyboard activity seem to trigger it, but I'm not certain that's the only trigger.</p>
<p>I verified I have the latest Intel Graphics Accelerator Driver.&nbsp; BTW, rebooting doesn't always fix it.&nbsp; I was curious if Windows installed a fix over the first weekend in September that is causing this, but apparently this has been going on for a while based
 on Gautam's posting.</p>

<p>Intel Corporation - Display - Intel(R)<span>&nbsp; </span>946GZ Express Chipset Family</p>

<p>&nbsp;Installation status: Successful</p>
<p>&nbsp;Update type: Important</p>

<p>So, how do I revert to the previous version? Because the freezes, window focus changes etc. are beyond tolerance.</p>

<p>Hi Corn,</p>
<p>I suggest you visit the website of your computer manufacturer and download the latest driver from there to install.</p>

            I am having a very&nbsp;similar&nbsp;problem as well: i have a&nbsp;<span>Toshiba Satellite P205-S6267 laptop. &nbsp;I'm running Windows 7 32 bit, and i have the&nbsp;</span><span>Mobile
 Intel(R) 945 Express Chipset Family&nbsp;and i have tried everything above but my problem is still persisting. &nbsp;Whenever i open a certain video game on my computer and it loads up and i&nbsp;select&nbsp;a character right before i am in the game playing the display hangs
 then comes back up and has the error message: Display Driver Intel Graphics Accelerator Drivers for Windows Vista(R) stopped responding and has&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;recovered. &nbsp;Except unless i can close the game&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;the screen either freezes or goes to black.
 &nbsp;I have updated every driver on my laptop. &nbsp;I have un-installed and re-installed the accelerator driver and display driver atleats 10 times and it still doesnt work. &nbsp;Ive gone to both Toshiba and Intel and searched through all their drivers and nothing has
 worked. &nbsp;I find it weird that i have Windows 7 but its saying my driver is for windows vista &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

            I'm having the exact same problem Redman. In addition to getting that particular error message my screen is dimmed and looks like there are dead pixels everywhere, but as soon as I uninstall the Intel Graphics Driver everything is fixed so it clearly is
 an error with the display driver.&nbsp; I have the newest version of this driver, but I experienced the same problem with the previous version so as Gautam mentioned it might just be a compatibility issue between the newest Intel display drivers in general and
 my system.&nbsp; I'd recommend searching online for other compatible display drivers for your system, but I've yet to find one for my Toshiba Portege M700 laptop.<br />

            <p>Are you using on board graphics?? I was and I updated my bios which fixed the problem for me. go to your motherboards manufacturer web site and look in support for downloads and compare your bios version to thier latest one and update if need be?? I also
 heard of lowering the graphics voltage by one notch (I think it goes in .02 Volt clicks) but thats all. But try updating bios first it is pretty easy they should have instructions on thier site.</p>

<h2>            Unable to uninstall certain programs</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently having issues with uninstalling certain programs when i go to Control Panel&gt;Programs &amp; Features. The programs that are giving me issues are Microsoft Flight Simulator and Aerosoft's My Traffic 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Computer details are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP Pavilion 15 Notebook, x64 based PC.Intel core i5-3230M CPU @ 2.60GHz 6.00GB RAM</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows 8.1 Single language. Version 6.3.9600</p>
<p>Product ID: 00179-40351-11161-AAOEM</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of My Traffic 2010, when i try to uninstall the package, I get the following error as shown below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Error Code:</strong><span>
</span><strong>-5009 : 0x80040707</strong><br />

<p>
</p><p>And if i try to uninstall the Microsoft Flight Simulator X the Installshield Wizard simply runs for a few seconds the disappears. Nothing else happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am curently confused and have searched desperately for the past 2 months on the internet for some kind of solution but ive been frustrated by the results i'm getting. Please can anybody at Microsoft assist me. My system came with Windows 8 installed in
 it, and do not know how to perform a clean install especially as i do not have the CD with me.

            <p>Hi Mitchel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if you can provide more information regarding this issue. Please answer these questions for a better understanding:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) What are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>2) Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</p>
<p>3) Did you try running the uninstallation file from the game installation folder as an administrator?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Method 1: Run the Uninstallation file as an Administrator from the folder where you have installed this Game.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Please navigate to the game folder in “<strong><em>C:/Program Files</em></strong>” where this game is installed (C is the drive where you have the operating system installed).</p>
<p>b) Search for the “<strong><em>Uninstall</em></strong>” file from that folder.</p>
<p>c) Right click on it and select “<strong><em>Run as Administrator</em></strong>”</p>
<p>d) Follow the on screen instructions and restart the computer if prompted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps for both the games that you are trying to uninstall from the computer. If that doesn’t help, then try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Method 2: Check if this is caused by any third party conflicts on the computer</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To check this, let’s perform a clean boot and then try uninstalling the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. To perform a clean boot, please refer to the section “<strong><em>How to perform a clean boot</em></strong>” and follow the instructions for “<strong><em>Windows
 8.1 and Windows 8</em></strong>” from this link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>After performing a clean boot, you may try uninstalling both the games and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Important: After you have finished troubleshooting, refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” for “Windows 8 and Windows 8.1”, to reset the computer to start as usual from the above
 link.</span></em></strong></p>

<h2>            Connecting to external monitor</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10, but am unable to connect my Lenovo X1 Carbon to an external monitor (tried two separate monitors). Before it would automatically detect the monitor, now it only has 1 listed when I go into Settings / Display. I found the "Windows
 button + P" option online, but when I highlight Duplicate or Extend I am unable to "select" or "enter" them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I make Windows detect my external monitor? (I am using the same cord that has always worked to connect my monitor before.) Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Move or Rename a Folder in Windows 8.1 &#91;SOLVED&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm using Windows 8.1, and I've run into a problem regarding folders. Last night and today, I was trying to rename one of my folders, but it came up with &nbsp;this message - "Folder in Use - This action can't be completed because the folder or file is open
 in another program." This is quite untrue, as I have not opened it recently. I was also trying to move it to the recycle bin, but the same message popped up. I did try using Unlocker, but it did not work. Any help is welcome. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>-Dave</p>
<p>Edit: I restarted my computer and I could rename it again. Thanks for the suggestion, Shawn!</p>

<br />
<br />Usually, that is due to a keyboard failure. As you said, you use USB keyboard which doesn't have issues makes the assumption more strong.
<br />
<br />Right-click Start&gt;Device Manager
<br />Expand Keyboards.
<br />Right-click the keyboard and select Uninstall.
<br />Reboot your computer and check if that helps.

            Hello, I see that you are having some issues with your keyboard input. I would assume that your keyboard drivers have been outdated or have gone corrupt. Can you try unplugging the current USB keyboard, then go to device manager, and uninstall the keyboard drivers? You will also need to download the drivers for the keyboard beforehand. You can do a Google search and type in your laptop model name, and drivers and it should bring up a manufacturer website which should include all of the drivers available for download. Make sure to download the correct one. Now install it, then restart your computer. See if this fixes the issue.
<br />Hope this helps, and let me know if you have further questions! :-)

            Thanks for replying so fast. Unfortunately, I've tried that. I've tried running the troubleshooter as well. Short of resetting my pc, I have no idea what to do. The odd thing is, sometimes when I spam 'h' often enough, it starts working again, but that
 doesn't work for some of the other keys.

            I see, can you try going into the language option in settings and see if you can reset the keyboard options? You can simply just remove the keyboard input and reinstall the English QWERTY keyboard input. If this does not work, you may want to consider doing a reinstall of Windows as this may look for the best drivers compatible for your keyboard, and also change the keyboard input to factory defaults.
<br />Hope this helps, and let me know if you have further questions! :-)
