    <title>HP Elitebook 840 G3 external monitors on displayport connection blacks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doubledfd5450  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Elitebook 840 G3 external monitors on displayport connection blacks out every few minutes</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 HP Elitebook 840 G3 notebooks running Windows 10 Pro that black out the external screens connected via displayport back to the Ultra Slimline dock.&nbsp; I have every driver in HP's Softpaq database installed.&nbsp; I have connected one of the monitors via
 VGA and that monitor no longer blacks out only the one displayport&nbsp;monitor now.&nbsp; I have called HP's Elite Support over many days and they are stumped too.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have replaced the notebook computer with 3 new ones only to have the issue start right up again.&nbsp; The only thing I haven't replaced is the SSD drive, the cables and the monitors.&nbsp; I have moved the employee's SSD drive to each new computer to preserve his
 data.&nbsp; Also when the displayport is on, there is noticeable interference in the form of what looks like sparks shooting across the screen from lower left to upper right.&nbsp; I have also replaced the Slimline dock&nbsp;with no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing many different settings on the displays and in the bios of the notebooks again with no change.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it might be a deep sleep setting and I turned that off in Bios again with no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have upgraded the graphics driver, bios,&nbsp;HP Z23i&nbsp;monitor drivers and slimline dock driver, and chipset drivers all with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many others are having the same issue and as I have scoured HP's forums for an answer and so far nothing has helped.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has an answer I would appreciate&nbsp;a reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help,</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I spoke to HP Tech Support this afternoon and he told me that when running the Ultra Slimline version 2.30 firmware update, the driver must be run when the notebook is docked otherwise it won't work.&nbsp; I tried it again&nbsp;and reset all of the monitors back
 to factory settings and so far for the last several hours, the displayport connected monitor is not blacking out and the interference appears to be gone too.&nbsp; I have a second computer with the same issue that I'm waiting to hear back from the employee on whether
 this fix will work for him too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick response.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>HP Tech support told me that in order to fix the problem above, I needed to run the firmware for the dock while the PC was docked.&nbsp; Once I did that, the problems went away for good.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue could be related to any recent changes on the computer that might have changes any security settings.</span></p>
<p><span>Let‚Äôs try the following steps and check.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>

            <p>yeah mate tried option 1 = no effect </p>
<p>
</p><p>option 3 Cad was already disabled and value set to one </p>
<p>
</p><p>it appears as though my machine is being "piggy backed "</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you read my last email there are about 20 winlogon/g*extensions&nbsp; , and they are all to do with redirecting everything from folders , usb traffic&nbsp; , etc&nbsp; etc
</p>
<p>
</p><p>and there is a notify set up </p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked into all of this and it seems to be some kind of 'overseeing''from what time log on , log off etc .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a hacker and am not breaking the law on my computer , nor trying too in any way either.I do not wish to modify registry if its going to bring me more drama though , for if its big brother i have nothing im doing wrong so who cares really , but if
 its not , and ive been hacked by 'non-authority' thats what worries me .What do you think / i mean i can simply delete every sub key other than 'winlogon' because thats the ONLY key that should be there with what you say ;</p>
<p>
</p><p>my username /password/ ctrl alt delete =activated etc , with no other sub keys present , am i right ??</p>
<p>&nbsp;But most importantly if i do a clean install which im tempted to do , whats stopping them / they // from 'piggy backing ' again anyway ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>i hope im not coming across as paranoid , but another thing is straight after logon 'command prompt' box flashes on very quickly</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do appreciate feedback here please </p>

            <p>Hi There </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;i appreciate your help very much but </p>
<p>DisableCAD is set to (0) and still- no secure logon option is 'checkable'</p>
<br />
<p>Also,you seemed to of ignored majority of last 'update' (bit about 'impersonator' / extensions/notify etc ) so ill assume you are not permitted to discuss such 'settings' or surely you would of said
 restore' will never be allowed past the 'impersonator' being implemented&nbsp; which is the case , as i checked up restore points already and ones i had going back 12 months and longer have all been deleted , only back two weeks available now</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forgive me again if im completely of the mark here but putting 2 plus 2 together based on the registry = strewth ,&nbsp; !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think clean install only option , bumma , but at least i know , it was the flash of 'command prompt' after logon that set off alarm bells , then cant 'check' secure logon box led me to you
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time , if you do have any other suggestions that does take into account all of what i have provided you with and is not a clean install pls let me know , otherwise thanks again , you guys do a great job and have always been helpfull</p>

            A free gamertag change is only available if you were given a randomly generated tag when you created your account and are changing that tag for the first time. I'm not sure how you were given that tag, but it is not one of the randomly generated ones Microsoft
 gives so you would need to pay to change it.&nbsp;

<p>For the past few months, Microsoft has initiated a download about every 1 - 2 weeks.&nbsp; Usually it is labeled "download 1 of 8".&nbsp; These downloads last for about 12 hrs or more.&nbsp; I don't understand what the downloads are about, why it takes so long, or why
 they cannot be done in the background or cancelled.&nbsp; This starts frequently when I am in the middle of something, and it stops whatever I am doing.&nbsp; Help??&nbsp; Do I need to have the computer serviced or is thiis a normal, but annoying feature of microsoft?</p>

<h2>            Saints Row IV Re Elected&#58; Installation stuck in queue</h2>
                    
<p><span>I just bought the bundle (Re elected and Gat Outta Hell) for Xbox One, and I cannot play the Re Elected portion of the game (GOH works and installs fine). I can install the game completely offline, as soon as I go to play Re-Elected
 connected to the internet, it says a "2.0 kb" download is required. Then, after I clicked yes, it goes to the dashboard and begins downloading a 2.6 Gb file. But, then it gets stuck at 99% and keeps flipping between queued and instlalling. I've done this about
 four times, tried the power off on trick, everything in the book. Help, please?</span></p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a driver update that had failed repeatedly to upload and i canot connect to the internet. The error message i get when i check the update history on my computer is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel - net - 3/12/2018 12:00:00AM - 19.51.12.3</p>
<p>Failed to install on 8/9/2018 - 0x80246013</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe i am running the most up to date version of Windows 10. Will i need to plug in with an ethernet cord to complete this update? Is the failed update the reason i cant connect to the internet?</p>
<p>

            I advise that you do no install driver updates from Windows Update, especially if the device is working already. If you must update the driver, try downloading it manually from Intels website then manually install it.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.

<h3> hambre22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable Cortana or web search does not work</h2>
                    <p>I have disabled Cortana and web search in the past through group policy on Windows Pro (Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Search) or the registry on Windows Home (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; SOFTWARE &gt; Policies &gt; Microsoft
 &gt; Windows &gt; Windows Search &gt; AllowCortana = 0). These worked to disable web search from the start menu. Since April/May, these methods have not worked. To reiterate, the options that Microsoft provide that say web search will be disabled, DO NOT WORK to stop
 Windows web search capability. Also, when I make a child account, Microsoft says that web search will not be enabled for them, but it is still! Any help ASAP would be appreciated.</p>

</strong></span></span></p>
<span>

<p><span>Start your PC with the XP Setup CD in the drive. When you see the "Press any key to boot from CD..." prompt, do so and let the CD-based boot process
 begin.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When the Recovery Console option is offered ("Press R to start the Recovery Console"), do so. You may be asked which Windows installation to enter,
 in which case type the number of the Windows installation you wish to work on (usually "1").</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When prompted, enter the Administrator's password for that Windows installation. If you did not set a password just press ENTER</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Install&#58; Cannot Determine Space</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'Get Windows 10' says I need to wait &nbsp;so I decided to download the Windows Media Creation Tool to install Windows 10.</p>
<p>At first I couldn't keep all my files and apps because I needed to change the Default UI Language of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing that I can't even choose any more what I want to keep during the installation, this step is skipped completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The big problem I get, though, is:</p>
<p>After searching for automatic updates and checking if my PC can install Windows 10, the installation stops and I get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Something Happened</strong></p>
<p><strong>We can't tell if your PC has enough space to continue installing Windows 10. Try restarting setup.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what to do now.</p>
<p>I appreciate any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: I forgot to tell you that I definitely have enough Disk space, over 100 GB free. I've installed Windows on a Mac with Bootcamp, no virtual machine or so.</p>

<p>I have the exact same problem. &nbsp;Macbook Pro running Windows 8.1 through Boot Camp with 80GB free. &nbsp;I also have an iMac running Windows via Boot Camp and it upgraded to Windows 10 with no problems. &nbsp;The issue may be because the Macbook Pro is running on an
 SSD and the drives are partitioned with an HFS and the EFI recovery. &nbsp;My iMac does not have the EFI recovery partition so maybe that is why it upgraded with no issues. &nbsp;The Windows C: partition shows up healthy in the Windows Disk Management.&nbsp;It is frustrating
 that there is not an obvious fix to this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read where others have had this same issue and they end up doing a clean install. &nbsp;I can't easily do that. &nbsp;It would be nice if Microsoft would allow us to kick off the upgrade and bypass the Disk Space check.</p>

            <p>Andre, my partition already had 500 MBs. It seems that the Windows 10 upgrade does not play well with the grub bootloader in a dual boot scenario with Linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What really worked was booting with a recovery usb made on Windows 8.1, going to the command prompt and running:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bootrec /fixboot </strong></p>
<p><strong>ren BCD BCD.bak</strong></p>
<p><strong>bcdboot c:\Windows /l pt-br /s b: /f ALL</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>For more details on why these commands are applied, follow this link:</p>

<h3> robag  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 PRO and Windows Server Essentials 2012 Client Connector</h2>
                    <p>Even though the blog on TechNet says that you should have no issues with the connector working, I have tried on 2 machines, one with a clean install and one as an upgrade to windows 10 pro, and on both machines the //server/connect works to get to the server,
 but to add the connector software it fails and offers no resolution. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to get this to work? Also, it demonstrates that the techblog is inaccurate as posted, as there is obviously some problem to get this to work.</p>

            <p>I have sort of figured this out myself since <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
no one</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> at Microsoft bothered to address the issue.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems when you start Windows 10 PRO or HOME, the failure in my case relates to the fact the that
<strong>SERVICES</strong> for Windows Server 2012 do not start up automatically like they are supposed to!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you click on <strong>My Computer</strong> and select <strong>Manage, </strong>
and then select <strong>SERVICES, </strong>and scroll down to "<strong>Windows Server"&nbsp;</strong>entries, and then
<strong>start them MANUALLY</strong>, they all start up and then the connector works as intended. Once you do this everything works like before - no problem in my case. However, I notice that in some instances when you restart the computer, you have to do this
 all again, and at other times, it works by starting Automatically, like it is supposed to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be some quirkiness to something, but at least now I know how to resolve the issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps others with the same issues!</p>

            <p>In my case I upgraded with the <strong>Windows Essentials 2012 Connector</strong> installed. Since it was previously installed, all the entries were there and the ones I have all start with
<strong>Windows Server ...</strong>, so if you haven't installed the connector yet, then you need to do that and then hopefully it all works. (There about 8 entries that start with
<strong>Windows Server</strong> listed under the services on my computers.) I am also NOT using Windows Server Essentials 2012 R2, so there may be something different going on.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Hello RICKGILSTRAP,
<br />
<br />First back up your data
<br />
<br />Step 1: Access the settings menu by clicking the notifications icon on the taskbar or pressing the Windows button + A. Then click ‚ÄúAll settings.
<br />
<br />Step 2: Click ‚ÄúUpdate &amp; Security,‚Äù then choose ‚ÄúRecovery‚Äù from the left-hand menu.
<br />
<br />The next page contains two options. The first, ‚ÄúReset this PC‚Äù is the method we‚Äôre going to go with, but the second is worth considering if you have a little more technical skill.
<br />
<br />‚ÄúAdvanced startup,‚Äù is used for modifying your computer on a deeper level or installing a completely different operating system. This comes in handy if your manufacturer provides a factory restore image or external drive containing the image to return your machine to its factory state. Unless you‚Äôre completely sure you understand what each of the options in this setting does, it‚Äôs probably best to leave it alone.
<br />
<br />Step 3: When you‚Äôre ready, click the ‚ÄúGet started‚Äù button under the ‚ÄúReset this PC‚Äù heading. A new window will appear with two options, ‚ÄúKeep my files‚Äù and ‚ÄúRemove everything.‚Äù
<br />
<br />Step 4: Decide whether you want to keep all of your files and folders, or truly start from scratch and then bring your personal data back from your backup solution. Whichever one you pick, all of your applications will need to be reinstalled, and your settings, such as your Start menu, will go back to the defaults.
<br />
<br />Step 5: Click whichever option you have chosen. If you chose ‚ÄúKeep my files,‚Äù skip to Step 7.
<br />
<br />Step 6: If you chose ‚ÄúRemove everything,‚Äù you now have the option to ‚ÄúJust remove my files‚Äù or ‚ÄúRemove files and clean the drive.‚Äù The second option formats the drive itself, and it‚Äôs better if you‚Äôre planning on selling or giving away your computer. It takes much longer, so if you‚Äôre just resetting the PC for yourself, choose the first option and skip forward to Step 8.
<br />
<br />If your computer has multiple internal drives, you‚Äôll also have the option to wipe only the primary drive (the one with Windows) or all the connected drives. Click on ‚ÄúShow me the list of drives that will be affected‚Äù to know exactly what will be included in the reset process.
<br />
<br />Step 7: If you chose ‚ÄúKeep my files,‚Äù on the next screen the system will display a list of conventional programs installed on your computer (ones not installed from the Windows Store). This list will be saved to your desktop when you finish the recovery process. Click ‚ÄúNext.‚Äù
<br />
<br />Step 8: Once you‚Äôve gone through the steps in preparing for the reset, you‚Äôll be presented with the final choice. Click ‚ÄúReset‚Äù to proceed.
<br />
<br />Hope it helps, haver a good day       
        </p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is a settings file that basically contains the configuration of your Windows Sidebar, and if that has been modified or become corrupt
 you can see this type of behavior. However, given that one or two of your custom gadgets appear as they are having issues as well you may need to remove, and then reinstall them from the
<b>Gadget Gallery</b> ‚Äì <i>after you‚Äôve performed this troubleshooting</i>.</span></p>

<p>Hallo meine Lieben,</p>

</p>
<p>Bitte meldet Euch hier in dem Thread an wenn ihr mitspielen wollt.<b> Ich weise ausdr√ºcklich daraufhin, dass ich nur Leute ab 18 Jahren in dem Spiel sehen will!</b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ich freue mich! <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-2.gif" /></p>

<p>Ja da melde ich mich doch gleich mal an und freue mich das ich f√ºr andere mal Zielscheibe spielen darf

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ist ziemlich willkommen grad bei mir da ich seit dem EXP-Event gar nimmer Gears gespielt hab ^^</p>
<p>Und ich glaube einen "Queeeeenade-Launcher" habe ich auch schon in Bad Company 1 gesehen

<p>Allerdings wundert mich doch dein Zusatz mit den "nicht unter 18 Jahren" etwas (was ich nat√ºrlich richtig finde) aber bei Call of Duty z.B. da war dies nicht n√∂tig?</p>
<p>Komisch <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-5.gif" /></p>

<p>Ich habe bei Call of Duty im Vorfeld nicht daran gedacht und Black Ops ist ja auch von der USK gepr√ºft worden bzw. hier erscheinen. Letztendlich kann ich es auch nicht √ºberpr√ºfen. Aber da es sich bei Gears auch noch um ein Spiel handelt was hier √ºberhaupt
 nich erschienen ist und soweit ich wei√ü auch noch indiziet wurde, dachte ich, ich weise einfach im Vorfeld darauf hin.

<p>Hello,<br />
Thank you for your reply,<br />
1. I tried this issue on multiple computers getting different responses from them. First of all, this device works with its given Windows XP driver on Windows XP (32 bit) installed Intel Pentium CPU computer(Intel 82801EB LPC interface controller). The same
 specs. computer with windows 7 enterprise (32 bit) installation works too with given windows 7 driver. These are rather old computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried to install the driver on a new computer (Intel i5 processor, Intel 6Seies/C200 Series chipset Family SMSBus controller) with Windows 7 enterprise 32 bit installed, I get the eeror 10 that I mentioned in the previous post.</p>
<p>So, above is my answer of the make and model of the computers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. AVG security software is installed on all computers.<br />
</p>
<p>3. Yes, I face this problem only with this device (photodedector)<br />
</p>
<p>4. No, changes made to the computer and it works fine otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The manufacturer says, they are aware of the issue but no solution as yet.</p>
<p>As far as a search I did on the internet, my guess is that the problem is virtual com port driver issue which is not supported by windows on new chipset family drivers (usbser.sys)</p>
<p>Any comments?<br />

<p>Here are some instructions to make a bootable XD Recovery Console CD.</p>
<p>When you have that going and have run the chkdsk /r from the Recovery Console Prompt enter the following command to replace the missing or afflicted file (assuming XP is installed on your C drive):</p>
<p><strong>copy c:\windows\system32\dllcache\ntfs.sys &nbsp;c:\windows\system32\drivers</strong></p>
<p>Respond in the affirmative if asked to overwrite the existing file and then you should see a&nbsp;message that 1 file(s) was copied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure.</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come a store bought system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt.</p>
<p>First verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage
 amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<hr />
<p>Do, or do not. There is no try.</p>
<p>I decided to save up points for a new puppy instead of a pony!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 start menu items are frozen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grumpfo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 start menu items are frozen</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>yesterday I catched a PUA (MPcleaner).</p>
<p>The removal process was really hard, that tool is tamperproof like ****, however the tool lost and I removed it.</p>
<p>As a sidenote I am really experienced with Windows since NT4, I was also a MCT for 8 years.<br />
But <strong>now</strong> I reached the end of my troubleshooting knowledge and need definetely help from others to</p>
<p>fix my start menu issues. I found some guides but it seems they have not the exact issue I have here,<br />
at least I couldn`t find it.</p>
<p>During the removal of Mpcleaner I noticed at some point that most of my start menu tiles went grey.</p>
<p>At that time, I didn`t realized that it is some impact.</p>
<p>Even the tiles which are colored behave the same like the greyed out tiles...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like this now:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/331c6a6b-44eb-4d35-8a8d-e1ba457ebce1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/331c6a6b-44eb-4d35-8a8d-e1ba457ebce1" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f90cda6b-c4cd-4175-a229-b4a2d2b2a441" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f90cda6b-c4cd-4175-a229-b4a2d2b2a441" /></a></p>
<p>I can`t change any tile, remove it, reposition it and also I can`t add apps anymore because the option</p>
<p>in the context menu is gone.</p>
<p>The tile reszing option is gone.</p>
<p>When I right click one menu items, I get only the option "more" with submenus, nothing else...</p>
<p>When I click a tile, the programn starts normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Unfortanetly I can`t go to the previous Windows build and I also don`t want to build the pc from</p>
<p>scratch, there are simply to much tools, programs which are installed and it would need much time to</p>
<p>get there again. So investing time to get this repaired is a valid option for me.</p>
<p>So currently reinstall is not an option for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried:</p>
<p>sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it has something to do with the links, I lost permissions to change them, whatever...<br />
But I have no idea what I can do to repair it....</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:<br />
I found that the items are not greyed out, however something changed my default blue tile color to grey.</p>
<p>So at least I can correct the color, I edited the subject of this post.</p>
<p>Unfortanetly and expected, the tile behaviour is still weird/broken, as described above.</p>
<p />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>We appreciate for the efforts you have tried to resolve this issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>Using the software like MPCleaner might delete some important registry keys and it will affect the smooth functioning of the machine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I request you to use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open an elevated command prompt.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Run the "DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth" command.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
 However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running Windows installation as the repair source, or use a Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD, as the source of the files. To
 do this, run the following command instead: </span></p>
<p><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:C:\RepairSource\Windows /LimitAccess</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Replace the C:\RepairSource\Windows placeholder with the location of your repair source.
 For more information about using the DISM tool to repair Windows, reference <span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">

            <p>Hello Rishad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, here is my feedback:</p>
<p>Steps 1 and 2 with Dism, reported everything okay.</p>
<p>So I skipped the steps in "important", because there was no issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the link with the Start menu troubleshooter.</p>
<p>Didn`t work:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Updates, no pending updates, Win10 is up to date</p>
<p>2. Restarted several times, no effect. Also there a no pending file operations.</p>
<p>3. Tried the troubleshooter:&nbsp;http://aka.ms/diag_StartMenu &nbsp; no effect, but this issue in general exists on any user account on my system, no other user and not NEW user can change the tiles, move them or add new.</p>
<p>4. Tried also the unlinking the MS account to local, new user, make them admin ... same issue as in 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate your quick and fast response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Grumpfo =&gt; ex MS-FTE ;-)</p>

<h2>            How do you get Cortana to print a shopping list&#63;</h2>
                    I have no problem creating, adding items to, and viewing a shopping list in Cortana.&nbsp; However, I can't print it.&nbsp; It seems rather silly to be able to make a list but not be able to do anything with it (print, email, etc.).

</p><p>The default installation location of Windows Store apps is in drive C. However currently there is no option to change the default installation location of Windows Store apps to any other drive. Moreover it's not a good idea to change the location.

            &nbsp;low memory on tablets is a known issue for almost every tablet manufactured so it seems to me it would be beneficial for Microsoft as well as consumers to solve this issue by programing &nbsp;a way for us to install apps on SD cards.

            Hi, thanks for the answer. I deleted a lot of apps and cleaned up twice and it is not enough for the "Upgrade to Windows 10 Home, version 1511, 10586". I still keeping my Office 2013 because this is the reason why a bought my device with win 10. There
 is any proposal date when somebody fix this issue.&nbsp;It is pretty frustrating. Thanks again.

    <title>Guest Account won&#39;t Recognize Wireless Networks - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Guest Account won&#39;t Recognize Wireless Networks</h2>
                    I'm trying to get the Guest account on my Surface RT to connect to a wireless network. So far, other accounts, like my personal account, work just fine and I can browse the internet, however when I switch to the built-in Windows 8.1 guest account, it shows
 that there is no network connectivity at all. From the Charms bar I select Settings and the network icon shows unavailable. If I select that icon to view wireless networks, it shows that I'm connected&nbsp;to my wireless network and it says "Connected". I disabled
 wireless through that menu and reconnected, but when I use other apps, they tell me that I'm not connected to the internet. Any thoughts?

Guest accounts haven't been allowed to initiate an Internet connection</a>. It's a security measure, and I don't think that's changed in Windows 8.<br />
<br />
However, if an Internet connection is already present, the Guest account can use it.<br />
<br />
So, if you want to give the Guest account access to the Internet, do this:<br />
<ol>
<li>Log onto the Internet using a traditional account.</li><li>Without signing out, let the Guest account sign in.</li></ol>
Since the Internet connection will already be in place, the Guest account will be able to use it.<br />
