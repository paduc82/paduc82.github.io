    <title>Surface RT - simple password features disabled after mail activesync - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface RT - simple password features disabled after mail activesync to office 365 &#47; exchange with strong policy, unable to use simple password on device after removal</h2>
                    <p>I synced to office365 using mail app and clicked next without releasing that I would disable the simple password feature to login to surface RT.</p>
<p>Now I get prompted for my windows live password to login to my surface device. (before I used a simple PIN password feature)</p>
<p>I have removed the office365 account from the device and restarted.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However under Accounts - sign in options;&nbsp;both the&nbsp;simple password features:</p>
<ul>
<li>PIN&nbsp;password</li><li>Picture password</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>are both&nbsp;greyed out</strong></p>
<p>And I can't seem to re enable them, even though the ActiveSync account is no longer connected.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have also modified the office365 mobile device policy to allow simple passwords. and tried to connect and reconnect the mail account in the hope that the less strict policy would somehow find its way back to the surface RT device.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However the surface RT device does not seem to restore the original settings.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How can I reset the surface RT to have a simple PIN password again?</p>

    <title>Virgin Media Superhub and random &#40;but regular&#41; XBL disconnects - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> killeroo87  say:</h3>
<h2>            Virgin Media Superhub and random &#40;but regular&#41; XBL disconnects</h2>
                    
<p>I recently upgraded to 30MB cable broadband from Virgin Media (VM) and was therefore sent a replacement "upgrade" router; the Super Hub. At first everything was working fine and I didn't have any issues at all. However, the past couple of weeks my Xbox decides
 to randomly drop connection to the Super Hub and disconnects from Xbox Live.</p>
<p>Initially I thought it only happened when idling, which would not have been a massive issue, annoying but bearable.Unfortunately it seems to be happening more and more now even when in the middle of playing an online game, be it FIFA, Gears or the Battlefield
 3 Beta.</p>
<p>Has anybody else suffered issues with the Super Hub and Xbox Live disconnections? Any advice on how to correct this increasingly frustrating problem?</p>
<p>I am connected (when it wants to work) wirelessly.</p>
<p>I must stress that I had no issues whatsoever with the previous router I had with my 10MB broadband. The Super Hub is also located in exactly the same position as it's predecessor.</p>
<p>Any replies would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi Mate.</p>
<p>I too am with virginmedia and have the superhub on a 50mb connection. I was constantly being kicked off xbox live and the internet altogether only way to fix it was to switch it off for 30 seconds then back on.. It was doing my head in. Recently they upgraded
 the firmware on the superhub to enable you to use your own router by putting the superhub into modem mode only and your connected router to take full control of the wireless devices. It has worked perfectly since.</p>
<p>I recommend if you have a spare router lying around then hook it up. If you need any help doing this just let me know and I'll explain it all to you.</p>

<p>There is a way to solve this. &nbsp;You can log into your hub and adjust your settings. &nbsp;The best advice I can give is to visit the Virgin Media Forum, where you will be able to get a step by step guide.</p>

<p>There is a way to solve the wireless disconnects every 40 minutes. Change your "802.11 mode" wireless speed from 300mbs, to 145mbs, under wireless settings in the advanced tab.</p>
<p>I did this under advised instruction 4 months ago after suffering the same issues and not once lost connection since.</p>

<p>I've never had problem with the hub since disabling IP Flood Detection and Port Scan in the hubs services. &nbsp;I only run it at 145 anyway since no adapter I have uses 300 there's no need to broadcast it. &nbsp;You could also look at software such as inSSIDer to
 see what channel is the least used locally and switch to that?</p>

            recently had the super hub 3 and started getting the same problem,I tried port forwarding and rebooting my hub then my xbox,still nothing would stop it,eventually the only thing I had not tried was changing my ethernet cable,I was using the xbox supplied
 one so decided to swap it for a cat 6,this sorted my problem out,I can play all my multiplayer games without a problem,hopefully you have a cat 6 with your virgin tv box so you can take it of and give it a try on your xbox,hope this works .

<h2>            Gifted a game overseas, no game, money stolen</h2>
                    Wow, man. So, I bought a game for my brother-in-law in the UK. He received a code, but it wouldn't work due to his region. I called Xbox, put in for a refund, and was denied. At no point during the purchase was I warned that gifting must take place strictly
 within my region. Now I have a useless code, no game, and Microsoft has my money. Pretty dishonest if you ask me. How is it possible for the gifting system to have such a glaring flaw? Why is it so unreasonable to give me my money back?

</p><p>I feel your frustration, unfortunately it clearly states that games can only be gifted in the same region you're in. Since refunds on digital downloads have to meet specific requirements you are in a tough spot. You can always give the code to someone in
 your region as a gift.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clearly states where?? In the fine&nbsp;print? I certainly didn't see it. And if it's not supported, then why did Microsoft take my money? It was a UK&nbsp;email address, and my account is US based. These are things that should be made MUCH clearer during the purchase

This response makes my skin crawl. It was not clearly stated during the purchase or I wouldn't have done it. The code is useless to me since I already own the game. These restrictions should be MUCH clearer during the purchase process, and it is not at all
 unreasonable to get my&nbsp;money back on a virtual item that hasn't been used. I'd say there's plenty to discuss there.

<p>Fine, but why is it so unreasonable to get a refund, especially when "accidental purchase - purchased wrong version" are selectable reasons in the refund request? Apparently,&nbsp;I bought the "US" version when it should have been the "UK" version (though it
 was my understanding that Xbox One games are region free). Would have no issue at all if they had given me my money back. I'm not the only person who's made this mistake, a cursory Google search is proof of that. It's pretty lousy customer service to tell
 myself and others who have made this mistake tough crap, kick rocks.</p>

<h2>            Is there any way to upload album art for music albums in Windows 10</h2>
                    I was trying out Groove after upgrading to Windows 10 and I'm a bit frustrated.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;library of MP3 albums on my PC and when I fired up Groove it will not show the album art.&nbsp; I tried to use the search function to search for the album info and sometimes
 it can't find the album while other times it finds the album but the found result doesn't display the album art either.&nbsp; I'm kind of surprised that Groove didn't pick up the art from the album itself as Google Music Manager and Sony's MediaGo apps both correctly
 show the art that stowed with the MP3.&nbsp; I've looked and I don't find any way to upload the album art and was wondering if I missed something or whether Groove is limited in what it can and cannot do.&nbsp; I really can't believe that in this day and age, a music
 app cannot find&nbsp;album art for "Abby Road" by the Beatles.&nbsp; Can anyone enlighten me?

<p>
</p><p>I understand that your Groove Music App on your Windows 10&nbsp;PC, does not show your Locally Stored Music Content's Cover Arts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the issue you're experiencing occurs for you on the Windows 10 PC version of the Groove Music App, I will move this thread now to a more relevant forum location for a better exposure.

Thank you,</p>

    <title>Language Preferences Using Windows 10 Not Working Correctly&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Language Preferences Using Windows 10 Not Working Correctly&#58;</h2>
                    <p><span>My computer is a Windows 10 computer and I have the Korean language to be available along with the English language using the language preferences. I have found that when using the Korean language, if I use my computer's keyboard
 what results on the screen is a hodgepodge of Korean. For instance, if I press </span>
<span><span>"O" key it might show a "ㅐ</span></span><span><span><span>" the first time and a "ㅎ" the second time. However, if I use the on screen keyboard,
<span><span>"O" key it might show a "ㅐ</span></span><span><span><span>" the first time and a "ㅎ" the second time. However, if I use the on screen keyboard,
 the Korean characters that appear on the screen equate to the Korean characters on the on-screen keyboard. Is there any way that I can be able to type Korean characters using my computer's keyboard rather than the on-screen keyboard? By using my computer's
 keyboard, I'm able to get use to typing using a keyboard rather than using a cursor. Thank you, and I look forward to and appreciate any and all replies.</span></span></span></p>

            John, thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I discovered that the problem lies with the program, i.e., ZKorean.com.&nbsp; When I open Word and try to use the computer's keyboard to write something in Korean, it does so with no problems.&nbsp; I have sent an e-mail to the staff
 at ZKorean.com advising them of this issue and asking them for suggestions re: how to correct it.&nbsp; Thanks again and if you would like, I will let you know what the staff at ZKorean's reply is.

</p><p>존, (John in Hangul) it seems that the ZKorean program is not the only program that will not allow me to type in Hangul using the computer's keyboard.&nbsp; I tried typing in Hangul using Google Translate and typing using the keyboard did not work, but using the
 on-screen keyboard did.&nbsp; (I am still able to type in Hangul using the keyboard in Word and, interesting enough, I was able to type your name here in my reply.)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking that the problem might have something to do with the Internet, but typing in Hangul here works fine.&nbsp;I did notice a small circle with an "X" in the center in the taskbar at the bottom of she screen recently when I was trying to type in&nbsp;Hangul&nbsp;using
 the computer's keyboard and when I&nbsp;hovered the cursor over the "X," it indicated that&nbsp;IME was disabled.&nbsp; I then went to "Languages" in the Control Panel and everything looked good to my novice eye. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows the answer to this riddle, I would sincerely appreciate it.&nbsp; Not being able to type in Hangul on websites is seriously hampering my learning Korean.&nbsp; Thanks again for your reply and I look forward to your next reply.</p>

<p>John, I discovered a possible fix in the Microsoft Community when I Googled the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"For a few minutes after I boot up, I can use Simplified Pinyin IME and change the settings of the IME keyboard. After these few minutes, IME becomes disabled and I can only write in English.
</p>
<p>I've tried removing the Chinese language pack and reinstalling it.</p>
<p>Every time the IME eventually becomes disabled, regardless of which programs I run (Chrome, word, none).</p>
<p>Please help! Microsoft support is currently unavailable.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>This was resolved by leaving the Windows Insider Programme (sic), and running Windows Update. There must have been a bug in the preview build I was running.</p>
<p>IME switching seems to be working very well in Windows 10 now, and has been doing for several months."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a part of the Windows Insider Programme and am running Windows Update now.&nbsp; "• Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709" is showing as the only update available for my computer.&nbsp; I will let you know how this goes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did notice that the "X" inside the circle disappears when I switch from "가" to "A"&nbsp; in the taskbar.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, typing in Hangul using my computer's keyboard here&nbsp;does not seem to be working now.&nbsp; It seemed to be working when I typed your name in Hangul above, but now it's not working.&nbsp; I may have been wrong before when I thought that it worked before.</p>

 typing in Word or Outlook, but not when I am on the Internet.&nbsp; Is there a setting in IE that I need to change, or change a setting somewhere else?&nbsp; Thanks again for the help with this.

<p>John, thanks again for your reply.&nbsp; As far as I can tell, the problem happens when I am using the Internet in general. (I can type in Hangul&nbsp;with no problems when I type in Outlook or Word.)&nbsp; I have tried typing in Hangul on the ZKorean site and the Google
 Translate site and even in the Google Search box and each time when I use my computer keyboard, even if I press the same key over-and-over, the letters appear change with each keystroke and there is even a mingling of English in with the Hangul characters.
 (ㅌ랕&nbsp;&nbsp; ㅁㅁ&nbsp; ㅡㅕㅜ ㅑㅡㅑ&nbsp; ㅡ나ㅗ낻툐ㅑㅣㄹ잊 규코 &lt;- Is what happened when I pressed the spacebar over-and-over when Hangul was chosen in the taskbar.&nbsp;)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also wondering why IME becomes disengaged when Hangul is chosen? </p>
<p>

<p>John, thanks again for your reply.&nbsp; I believe that this began happening when I bought a computer with Windows 10 installed.&nbsp; (I previously used a computer with Windows 7 installed, and there were no problems typing in Korean using my computer's keyboard
 instead of the on-screen keyboard using a mouse.&nbsp; I didn't try creating a new Microsoft account because I didn't want to corrupt the account that I already have.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>John, why does the Korean IME sometimes stop working?&nbsp; </p>
<p>

                    <p>My issue is not (well, not only) with my computer, but with the microsoft virtual assistant system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My situation cannot be resolved with any of the steps I have found online or any advice that the virtual assistant is giving me. When the bot tells me that I can talk to someone, I am given the option to get a call back/chat/ask the community. When I click
 'chat' or 'call back' nothing happens except the chat window reloading. I see the address change briefly before going back to the same, like it cannot load the page where I would be directed and sends me back where I was. I've tried on two different days already
 but the same thing happens over and over again, and I cannot find a direct phone number or email address I can use.&nbsp;</p>

            My problem is more that the virtual assistant does not seem to work for me (never transferring) and I cannot contact Microsoft through their support page because the only option now is the virtual assistant. I was wondering if there is something I was
 doing wrong or in the way my computer is set up that makes it impossible for the virtual assistant to work, or if there is a way around it because there is no longer any information as to how to contact them unless it is first through their virtual assistant.&nbsp;

<p>Me too.&nbsp; See the extract from a chat support session with a Microsoft support agent below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>well if you really want to assist please go back to the very beginning of this chat, and read what I said to the first person that helped me about your virtual assistant.<br />
3:00 pm<br />
Me<br />
Three times I say talk to a person after I say no the suggested urls don't answer my question.<br />
3:01 pm<br />
Alliya S<br />
That is the virtual agent that will only give suggested steps related to the problem described.<br />
3:01 pm<br />
Me<br />
the assistant on the third request for a person says you may talk to a person below, only there is NOTHING printed below.<br />
3:01 pm<br />
Me<br />
I had to go through the above explained cycle SEVEN times to get the links for a phone call back or an online chat to appear in the virtual assistant window.,<br />
3:02 pm<br />
Me<br />
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix this!!!!!<br />
3:02 pm<br />
Alliya S<br />
I will pass on this suggestion to the design team so that they can take care.<br />
3:03 pm<br />
Me<br />
UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
3:03 pm<br />
Me<br />
I sure hope so. I can't just say let me chat with a MS support agent, I have to go through the #$%$#%#$% virtual agent every time, and IT'S NOT WORKING PROPERLY!!!!!!!!!<br />
3:04 pm<br />
Alliya S<br />
The virtual agent has limited actions where in it only gives up limited suggestions. Hence we will pass your suggestions as informed to the design team they will take care of it.<br />
3:05 pm<br />
Me<br />
THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM<br />
3:05 pm<br />
Me<br />
The problem is I have to ask three times to have the request for a person acknowledged.<br />
3:05 pm<br />
Alliya S<br />
The virtual agent will try to filter out the problem and help you to get connected to the right department for precise help.<br />
3:06 pm<br />
Me<br />
The problem is I have to repeat the three ask request process SEVEN times before the agent lists the links for either a call back or a chat session in it's window.<br />
3:06 pm<br />
Alliya S<br />
I do understand that it was troublesome for you but that is how it is designed and the procedure every customer follows to get help on chat.<br />
3:06 pm<br />
Me<br />
It's intentional to ask three times, have the agent say you may contact below, and NOT HAVE LINKS TO CLICK ON FOR A CALL BACK OR A CHAT SESSION????<br />
3:07 pm<br />
Me<br />
This is what happened to me.<br />
3:07 pm<br />
Alliya S<br />
Hence that problem can only be rectified by the design team, we are only here to answer your queries and help you with the technical&nbsp; issues.<br />
3:08 pm<br />
Me<br />
I had to ask three times, have no links to click on, and then REPEAT THAT ENTIRE PROCESS SEVEN MORE TIMES TO GET A CLICKABLE LINK FOR EITHER A CALL BACK OR A CHAT SESSION<br />
3:08 pm<br />
Me<br />
THAT'S INTENTIONAL??????<br />
3:08 pm<br />
Alliya S<br />
If you want to provide a feedback on the same you can use the feedback app on the start menu so that the design team can work on it.<br />
3:08 pm<br />
Me<br />
I will thank you.<br />
3:09 pm<br />
Me<br />
That HAS to be a design error somewhere. On the THIRD REQUEST, EVERY TIME, it offers to let you speak to a person below.<br />
3:09 pm<br />
Me<br />
I believe THAT is designed.<br />
3:10 pm<br />
Me<br />
No clickable links are being displayed "below" though<br />
3:10 pm<br />
Me<br />
THAT has to be someone's screw-up<br />
3:10 pm<br />
Alliya S<br />
I do understand that but I'm not from the design team, hence I will not be able to do anything on it.<br />
3:10 pm<br />
Me<br />
i will pass it on through feedback. thanks for your help<br />
3:11 pm<br />
Alliya S<br />
You are welcome.<br />
3:11 pm<br />
Me<br />
bye<br />
3:11 pm<br />
Alliya S<br />
Have a good day ahead. <br />

    <title>Restoring Default User Folder Locations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garrettm98  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restoring Default User Folder Locations</h2>
                    <p>Hello. A couple weeks ago I did a fresh install of Windows and all my folders are in particular locations across multiple drives. Now, while I was configuring the location of my Downloads folder while formatting my backup/downloads HDD (Seagate BarraCuda),
 I had temporarily re-routed it to the Desktop. Now, the problem is that I set the location to the Desktop folder itself, so Downloads and Desktop become the same things. And as you can see, they're both named the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried going into the location settings and restoring them to default values, but regardless of whether I do that to the Desktop or Downloads shortcut (which have become the same names, just different icons), it only allows me to restore them to C:/users/USERNAME/Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have my Downloads folder located on the Seagate BarraCuda, and the link under Quick Access works just fine but lower down under This PC (in the left pane) it's identical to the folders on the left of my screenshot; they both lead to Desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm looking for is a method to restore the original folders and their locations; essentially like a factory reset to these folders. I know I screwed something up when I relocated the Downloads into Desktop originally, and would like to know of a method
 to restore those to where they were before I did that. My PC is configured very specifically and re-installing and re-configuring Windows would take me an entire day, so I'd like to avoid that at all costs!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Garrett, <br />
<br />
Open the Registry Editor again, if it is closed, that will still be on the same page
<br />
<br />
Double click this entry in the right hand pane: <br />
<br />
{7D83EE9B-2244-4E70-B1F5-5393042AF1E4 <br />
<br />
Then set its value data to(note backslash, not forward slash): <br />
<br />
L:\Downloads <br />
<br />
Click OK <br />
<br />
Close the Registry Editor and restart your PC </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26014221-029a-466d-9c5b-bb8b64b7497b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26014221-029a-466d-9c5b-bb8b64b7497b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That will have moved that to the correct location . . . <br />
<br />
Please Note, it may still look like that folder has not changed in File Explorer, it can take File Explorer some days to catch up on a registry edit, but if you right click those library folders, you will see that their folder location is now correct . .

            Hi Garret
<br />
<br />What is the exact location you want your Downloads folder to be and what is the exact location you want your Desktop folder to be?
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Click View and make sure 'Address Bar' is turned on
<br />
<br />Paste this into the Address Bar at the top and hit Enter
<br />
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
<br />
<br />Please provide a screenshot of the resulting Registry Editor window . . .

    <title>Probl&#232;me Succ&#232;s G.R Wildlands - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pxl blastz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Probl&#232;me Succ&#232;s G.R Wildlands</h2>
                    <p>Bonjour,</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>





<p>Je viens vers vous suite à de multiples requêtes faites via le support XBOX&nbsp;FR&nbsp;et Ubisoft.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>J'ai joué et terminé tout les objectifs de plusieurs succès sur Ghost Recon Wildlands mais ces succès ont arrêté leurs progression en cours d'acquisition (83-93%) sans explications logique et n'ont pas pop lorsque tout les pré-requis étaient remplis.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>



<p>Les succès en questions sont :&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maitre des missions 93%</p>

<p>Heavy Médailles 93%</p>

<p>Fan des pistolets mitrailleurs 92%</p>

<p>Le fond de l’affaire 92%</p>

<p>Chasseur de légendaire 89%</p>

<p>Fan des fusils d’assaut 88%</p>

<p>Fan des fusils à pompe 83%</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>



<p>J'ai contacté le support Ubisoft en premier qui m'ont indiqué qu'ils ne pouvaient rien faire à ce niveau là et que seul le support XBOX&nbsp;pouvait régler mon problème et déverrouiller mes succès accompli. Le support Ubisoft m'a donné quelques manipulations à faire pour essayer de régler le soucis mais en vain.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>"Toutefois d’autre solutions peuvent éventuellement fonctionner afin de forcer la synchronisation sans certitude comme :
- Lancez un autre jeu physique,
- Changer la lange et région de votre console dans les options de cette dernière,
- Re-télécharger votre gamertag peut aider à débloquer le succès en question,
- Faire un cycle d’alimentation de votre console disponible ici :&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/fr-FR/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/fr-FR/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console</a>"</p><p><br /></p>



<p>"Nous aimerions débloquer le succès en question pour vous manuellement malheureusement cela nous est impossible car n’avons aucun contrôle sur le Xbox Live de notre côté tout est gérer uniquement par Microsoft de ce côté-là. Seuls les points Uplay sont à notre porté car ceci est notre service."</p><p><br /></p>





<p>J'ai ensuite contacté le support Français XBOX en ouvrant un dossier N°1382133227 ou j'ai procédé à une dernière manipulation, à la suite de celle-ci une attente de 72&nbsp;heures était nécessaire pour vérifier si les succès finiraient par se déverrouiller ou non.</p>



<p>Je viens vers vous pour obtenir un soutien et régler ce soucis rapidement sans avoir à rejouer 40 heures à Ghost Recon pour revalider mes succès...</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>





<p>Je vous remercie d'avance pour votre aide et votre réponse,</p><p><br /></p>





<p>Cordialement, &nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>PxL&nbsp;BlastZ</p>

<p>1. If you're installing a game disc...NO!</p>
<p>2. If you're downloading a digital game installation Yes, &nbsp;BUT....You have to have the BlueRay app to play a movie disc. &nbsp;This is something you have to download independently as the default Xbox One will not play movies.</p>

<p>As for Sunset Overdrive being ready, you should be able to play a small part of it while it continues to download in the background.</p>

    <title>Connect to MWDA &#40;Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter&#41; using USB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> e-musty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connect to MWDA &#40;Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter&#41; using USB wireless adapter&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have two MWDAs, experiencing the same problem: connections from my W10 notebook to MWDA disconnects frequently, in 5-10 minutes on bad days. Since it is very unlikely that both MWDA adapters are defective, and the connections from my Android tablet seem
 to be more stable, I'm more and more confident my notebook's built-in wireless adapter causes the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To test this, I managed to get an USB-stick D-Link DWA-140 RangeBooster N wireless adapter, purchased a couple of years ago, but supporting 802.11n. It seems the D-Link adapter works well with Windows 10, it can connect to WiFi networks. Yet I am unable
 to connect to MWDA using this adapter, even if I disable my built-in adapter and set the D-Link to use 2.4 GHz band.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During connection attempts, I can see in my network adapter list that Windows creates the temporary hotspot adapter named DIRECT-whateva, and I can see my MWDA displaying connection is in progress, but then connection is never established. I wonder if some
 limitation in the Windows 10 driver may want to use my disabled built-in adapter (though in that case, I'm sure, I should not see my MWDA recognizing connection attempts).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help me how to try to connect to MWDA using the USB-stick WiFi adapter, or can anyone confirm the above mentioned D-Link adapter is for some reason not compatible with W10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or can you tell me where can I find detailed logs on what happens during the connection attempts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask MVPs and MS staff responding to this issue to ignore the lengthy "to troubleshoot your" boilerplate text, I have tried all the default suggestions such as network troubleshooter and the such, with no luck.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and will certainly assist you to solve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some cases, just uninstalling the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter driver, and letting Windows 10 install it again automatically will solve the problem. In case you’re not sure how to do that, follow these steps:</p>
<div style="text-align: left">
<p>
</p><p>1. Press Windows key + X key and select the device manager.</p>
<p>2. In there, select the MWDA driver and there right click the driver and select uninstall.</p>
<p>3. Restart the computer and your drivers will be automatically installed.</p>
<p>Please let us know if the issue is resolved or you need any further assistance.</p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for your suggestion, I tried it, but did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I learned on Intel's website that Intel WiDi, which is required for wireless display sharing, is only supported on selected Intel WiFi adapters, and therefore there's no chance I can test it with a WiFi USB-stick. Yet I think my WiFi adapter or driver may
 be the cause of the problem, since it's very unlikely I have two malfunctioning MWDAs. Best of all, while Intel's WiDi compatibility checker correctly states my computer supports WiDi (I'm writing this post on the wirelessly shared screen, for example), the
 latest Intel WiDi driver blocks itself during installation saying my notebook does not support WiFi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you imagine physical damages can cause such disconnection problems? My notebook felt off a cabinet a year ago and some parts were replaced (I had insurance coverage, thanks, God!), but only external casing seemed to have suffered damages, nothing inside.
 Any chances that the WiFi antenna has contact errors tolerated by normal WiFi network connections, but not tolerated by MWDA?</p>

            Thanks for the suggestion. Anyway, this is a Dell Inspiron 7750 manufactured in 2012. I also think this is some problem with my wireless card or whatever. Maybe my WiFi is disconnecting frequently, too, only I don't recognize it since it reconnects soon
 automatically.<br />

            Hi ALL,<br />
<br />
After a couple of further research, I was able to fix my friend's laptop simply by using Startup Repair as suggested by this link:<br />
<br />

<br />
Hope this helps others who might've encountered the same problem. :)<br />

    <title>Can SDHC cards be formatted into NTFS&#63; Patriot LX Series Class - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian v01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can SDHC cards be formatted into NTFS&#63; Patriot LX Series Class 10&#58; 32Gb SDHC appears then won&#39;t be recognized.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I bought a <span>Patriot LX Series Class 10: 32Gb SDHC on Boxing Day for cheaper...I formatted it into NTFS. It gets recognized when I put it in the first time. Then it is not.</span></p>
<p><span>The card-reader: Bytecc 3.5" All in 1 Internal card-reader (usb2 connection), "This 6 slots internal 3.5" Card Reader from Bytecc, Supports SDHC/T-Flash/M2 High Capacity + 1/USB Port".<span><strong>Part #:
</strong>U2CR-368.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>How I changed the format to NTFS: <a href="http://arunjohnny.wordpress.com/2009/04/09/how-to-format-usb-pen-drive-to-ntfs-file-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://arunjohnny.wordpress.com/2009/04/09/how-to-format-usb-pen-drive-to-ntfs-file-system/</a>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I inserted a 1 GB Fat32 SD card, and pulled it out. And put-it in and it was recognized. I put in the Patriot 32Gb one and it's recognized. I pull it out and a little message pops up at the bottom of the screen with
 an exclamation mark saying it cannot write something to the card with some letters and characters, saying I may have a hardware failure/problem (it's like a yellow stop sign/Windows message).</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Maybe I havn't went into My-Computer, right-click the card, hardware tab, properties, and checked off quick removal. But when I look at my drive letter for that SD/SDHC card reader port: it is checked.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Why will no other cards be recognized after this card is removed? It is like the drive/port/card is dead. I have to re-start windows so that port is recognized (and the SDHC card).</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Did&nbsp;I format it wrong? Some Search links say to format in Fat32 or Fat16.&nbsp;The cards</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;don't seem corrputed since they are recognized at least once.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>And on another note: I should NEVER defragment flash cards, usb flash drives or SSD's right? That is what corrupts them, since they are Flash and not Hard-disks. Then they are un-useable?</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to Format Flash cards to NTFS? Some are high-capacity (4Gb+) and I want some large files to be stored/transfered with them...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update: I formatted in Fat32, it is recognized when I pull the card in and out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any reason that flash cards are not recognized as NTFS, but flash sticks are? What about SSD's? Pretty sure there is RAM and flash based SSD's right? Does either make a difference?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does SD cards not being able to be NTFs relate to firmware, hardware/materials, the way electronic devices that use SD cards are made&nbsp;or a windows issue?</p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>It sounds liek the card may be failing.</p>
<p>It could be causing the reader to fail upon insertion.</p>
<p>It's not a general issue, as I am able to format a microSD card to NTFS without problems.</p>
<p>Are you using drive encryption software?</p>

<p>The card is brand new.</p>
<p>Not using frive encription software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;can call the store and ask them what is going on.</p>
