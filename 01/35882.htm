<h2>            Windows 8 Error Code&#58; 0xc0000185 - SAMSUNG RECOVERY</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a samsung laptop with windows 8. It fails to boot with the samsung recovery message : your pc needs to be repaired, [...] 0xc0000185, you'll need to use recovery tools, .....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried to contact samsung, they really f*** me because they don't want to give me my oem key to dl windows 8 and try to boot my laptop. I don't have recovery cd so I want to get windows 8 &nbsp;(and I don't know my version) but I can't get it because I need
 the oem key (samsung told me to contact microsoft, is it such a joke ?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I solve that ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for help,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS : Sorry for my bad english.</p>

    <title>selecting &#34;side-by-side&#34; from taskbar is not working properly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            selecting &#34;side-by-side&#34; from taskbar is not working properly</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have two windows open on the desktop. &nbsp;I right-click the taskbar and get an option to "show windows side by side".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I select that option it's supposed to automatically resize and reposition the two open windows so that they are side-by-side on the desktop -- with one taking up the left half of the screen, the other taking up the right half of the screen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that's not happening. &nbsp;It is resizing and reposition them, but it makes them each a quarter size of the screen (rather than 50%) and stacks them one on top of the other on the left side of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note: right clicking on the taskbar does give you an option to "show windows stacked". &nbsp;I am *not* selecting that option. &nbsp;I am selecting "side by side". &nbsp;And even if I did select "stacked" the two windows should be resized to cover half the desktop, not
 a quarter of it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have three windows open on the desktop, right click the taskbar, and then select "show windows side by side" it should resize each so they are a third of the size of the screen and position them with one on the left, one in the middle, and one on
 the right. &nbsp;But it's not. &nbsp;Again, it resized them to quarter-screen. &nbsp;It stacks two on the left, and puts one in the top right corner. &nbsp;This is a bug.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Selecting "side by side" from the taskbar should only reduced windows to quarter-screen size if you have four windows open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am positive that this is a bug and not user ignorance or error. &nbsp;I used this feature a million times with Windows 8.1, so I am extremely familiar with it's proper function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I understand that I can drag windows to the side and "snap" them to get a similar side-by-side effect, but that's requires more steps and more work. &nbsp;The beauty of right-clicking the taskbar is that it's fewer steps and faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first installed Windows 10 I noted other people reporting the same problem, but none of the updates have fixed it.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Okay, here is a series of three screen shots which hopefully illustrate my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Photo 1: &nbsp;This shows that I have two folders open on my desktop. &nbsp;They are randomly sized and positioned. &nbsp;If you look at the lower right hand side you'll see that I've right clicked on the taskbar to bring up the context menu. &nbsp;My cursor is positioned to
 choose "Show windows side by side".</p>

            <p>Photo 2: &nbsp;This is the result of selecting "Show windows side by side" from the taskbar. &nbsp;This is incorrect. &nbsp;As you can see, the folders are resized to be about a quarter of the screen and stacked. &nbsp;("Stacking" folders in an option in the context menu, but
 I did not select that.) &nbsp;It should not look like this. &nbsp;This is wrong.</p>

            <p>Photo 3: &nbsp;This photo illustrates what is supposed to happen (but is not happening). &nbsp;The folders should be sized to each take up half the screen and be placed side-by-side. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am positive this is the proper formation because a.) I routinely used this feature in Windows 8.1 and this was always the result, and b.) by definition side-by-side means next to each other, not on top.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(FYI, I was able to get this configuration using the "snap" feature in Windows 10. &nbsp;But I shouldn't have to use snap. &nbsp;That's several extra steps. &nbsp;I should be able to achieve the below result by selecting "side by side" from the taskbar, but it's not working.)</p>

<h3> roberev  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I try to connect to VPN my WiFi says &#34;Limited&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a Toshiba Satellite laptop with Windows 8. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no WiFi connectivity problems&nbsp; . . . that is, until I set up a network connection to my office.&nbsp; I set up the network connection just fine, using the IP address; however, as soon as it connects, I lose the&nbsp; WiFi connection.&nbsp; The WiFi says "limited."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solution?</p>

            Probably is a dns issue..&nbsp; I solved it by omitting the dns from the vpn network.. Try

this..</a><br />
<br />
This option can solve your problem however it can make others. If you have an application that points to remote servers probably a local dns will not know how to resolve those names..

    <title>Skype for Business Mac 16.12.77 double click on contact opens wrong - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> srobadelic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Business Mac 16.12.77 double click on contact opens wrong chat window</h2>
                    This has been an issue for several revisions, but was not prior, I forget which version is began to occur. SFB Mac when you double click on a Contact to bring up a chat window with them it initially does not respond, then double click again and it reverts
 to chat history and opens a chat window with someone else in my chat history, not the person who's name I double clicked on. Ridiculously annoying. I must do it several times in order to get a chat window open.

<p>Hi Srobadelic,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my test with Skype for Business on Mac 16.12.0.77, I cannot reproduce the issue when I chat with someone, but it won’t open a chat window if you double-click the avatar of a person, you should double-click their name.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So please confirm whether this problem happens on every contact when you are going to chat with and whether this is a temporarily network issue. You may test reopen the client to check whether the problem persists. And we’d like to know if any others in
 your organization have the same issue. Also, please make the OS of your Mac is up-to-date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jason</p>

<p><span>Hi Tanja PPI,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Welcome to Windows Vista Answers Forums!</span></p>
<p><span><br />
I would like to ask you few questions in order to get a better understanding of this issue so we can better assist you.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What version of vista are you using?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are you getting this error message at the time of printing?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is this happening only pdf files or with other applications also?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
This issue may occur if Splwow64.exe process does not load when printing. If this is the cause, You can run this process manually by following the steps:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
1. Open “C:\Windows” folder, double click Splwow64.exe. If this process is loaded successfully, it will be listed in task manager.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
2. Press Ctrl + Shift + ESC to run task manager, click Processes tab.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
3. If the Splwow64.exe process is running, trying to print once again.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You may also try a Clean boot to check if any of the services or startup items is causing this issue. To perform a clean boot we will have to run System Configuration Utility.
</span></p>
<p><span>To
<strong>perform Clean boot </strong>and check if it works, follow the steps below and refer the following link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/939671" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/939671</span></a>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To perform a clean boot on a computer that is running Windows Vista:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click
<strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. On the
<strong>General tab</strong>, click <strong>Selective Startup</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Under
<strong>Selective Startup</strong>, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click the
<strong>Services tab</strong>, click to select the <strong>Hide All Microsoft Services</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>Disable All</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click
<strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>6. When you are prompted, click
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>7. After the computer starts verify if you are getting the same issue.</span></p>
<p><span>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the following
 KB article to narrow down the exact source:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><span>Also, see the section on how return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under
 “Reset the computer to start as usual”.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

            Hi <strong>JohnRamey</strong>,
<div><br />
<br />
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community forums.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
From the issue description, I see that Cribbage Classic game crashes randomly on Windows RT.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I appreciate your efforts put in to try troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue. We are here to help and guide you in the right direction.<br />
<div><br />
<strong>To provide the appropriate resolution I would need more information from your end.</strong></div>
<div>1. Do you get any error messages?</div>
<div>2. Were you able to play this game before?</div>
<div>3. Is the issue specific to Cribbage Classic game?</div>
<div>4. Did you make any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div><br />
<div>This issue may occur if the game is not compatible with Windows RT.<br />
<div><br />
<div>I would suggest you to check if the Cribbage Classic version that you are using is compatible with Windows RT or not using the link.</div>

    <title>Bluetooth Slider Missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tavi_dog_walker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Slider Missing</h2>
                    <p>I have two laptops (one HP and one Sony)&nbsp;and one tower (home built). All have been upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. One laptop has integral Atheros Bluetooth and others have usb Bluetooth dongles. all have working Bluetooth and can find each other
 and any phones.</p>
<p><strong>None of them have the slider</strong> to be able to turn off Bluetooth and require disabling the driver to turn it off. The two laptops have been rebuilt from clean ISO install. They did not have (before rebuild)&nbsp;and still do not&nbsp;(post clean rebuild)&nbsp;show
 the slider and continue to require driver disable to stop bluetooth. I have seen notes/comments from Win 10 users suggesting that this is because the install is identifying the computers as Desktop stations rather than mobile laptops. This may be supported
 by the drives for each of the laptop clean builds being re-names Desktop-xxxxxxxxx, Clearly there is a fault in how Windows 10 is set up. Does anyone know how to resolve this or understand whether Microsoft even recognise it as an issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not respond with the replies that are generic across the answers forum. I have been investigating this and looking at all responses trying out suggestions with no luck for almost 2 months now.
</p>
<p>A simple question that may help is whether anyone with a laptop actually has the slider and if so did it happen automatically or did they have to undertake special action to get it?</p>

</p><p>How do I do this?</p>

            You can share games by setting one of the console as your Home console. You can only set 1 console as your Home at a time. So in order to play the game on the non-Home console, your account would have to be signed in.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox</a>

<p>Hey AZ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the forums today! I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can share your digital games to only ONE console, and not two unfortunately. To set up the game sharing, you need to set up the console you want to share with as the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Home Console </a>for the account that purchased the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once that has been set up, other accounts on that same Xbox have the benefit of playing your games and using your gold subscription to play online, without having to be signed in as you. But as mentioned previously this can only be done on one console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They only way I believe to make it work on the second console would be that you need to have your account always signed in, while your second son signs in to his account. Both accounts are signed in, but then you just switch the account that's playing and
 he should be able to play the game on his console as long as your account is still signed in at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any further questions.</p>

<p>Does it matter who installs the game?&nbsp; Me, my oldest son, and my youngest son all have different accounts but we belong to the same family account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My oldest son uses the Home console and signs into that console with his own account. My youngest son has his own console and signs into that console with a different account. If my oldest son installs the game on the Home console will my youngest son be
 able to see the game on his own console while signed in with his account?&nbsp; Or does my oldest son have to sign on to both consoles?</p>

</p><p>Is this the same answer if I had a disc instead of a digital download?&nbsp; My oldest son has his own account and he uses the Home console, and my youngest son has his own account and he uses his own console.&nbsp; I have my own account and in the head of the family,

            It's not really who installs the game, it's who actually owns the game. So if it was purchased on your oldest son's account, he would need to set your younger son's console as his Home so the younger son would be able to see the game and install it.&nbsp;

</p><p>To answer your question, the installation does not have to pertain to a specific account, it only pertains to the console. For instance, if a console is set as the home Xbox and is actively sharing with other accounts, the installation of any game on that
 console means that any account can go in and play that game without having to reinstall said content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to utilize <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/xbox-live/xbox-live-gold-sharing-features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Gold Sharing</a></strong> on 3 console is explained as so:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There would need to be two accounts with the Xbox Live membership if all want to play online multiplayer. One account can share its Gold with one console, therefore giving that one console access to share Gold with multiple accounts. So right there are two
 consoles, and the third would need to have its own subscription. Remember that this all goes for games and DLC as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do hope this clears this up, and let us know if there is anything else that we can assist with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!<br />

            With discs, the disc has to be in the console in order to play the game. So they would just have to swap the disc back and forth. They would need 2 separate discs in order to play at the same time.

</p><p>My youngest son has his own console, his own login, and his own xbox live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game should belong to my oldest son.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how does this work?&nbsp; Do I want my youngest son's console to be the home console?&nbsp; Then when logged in as my oldest son on the home (youngest son's)console, download the game to the youngest son's console?&nbsp; Then let my oldest son go back to his console
 and have him download the game to that console too?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then would my oldest be able to play his game on his own console (not the home console) with my youngest son also playing it on a different (home)console, with each kid logged in as themself?</p>

Hello AZWldctFan.<br />
In order to share your account with someone else between two consoles, use the tutorial in this link https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox

            Yes. Once your oldest son signs into the younger son's console and sets it as his Home, the younger son can access any games on the older son's account as well a gold subscription if he has one. Then he can sign out and sign back in on his own console
 and still access the games while the younger son signs in and plays on his own console.&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, you are facing some issues using your Windows 10 computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to some corruptions in Windows updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Check the System Date and Time on your computer.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Let’s first check if the system date and time are correct. If they are showing incorrect values, then follow the steps below and correct the time and date according to your time zone.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Press Windows key + R key on your keyboard.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Type “control" and click on "Date and Time".</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click Change date and time button (To change the time zone click on time zone tab).</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click Apply and Ok to save the date and time.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to
<strong>reset Windows updates components</strong> and check if that helps.</span></p>

</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tells you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify

<p><strong><span>Note: Holds good for Windows 10.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>NOTE:
</strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When
 you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent
 you from following these steps. </span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start</strong></span></span><strong><span>normally
</span></strong><span><span><strong>after clean boot troubleshooting”
</strong>to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note: Holds Good For Windows 10.</span></strong></p>
<p>

<p><span>Hope this helps. Please let us know if you need any further assistance. We will be glad to help you.</span></p>

            <p>The problem is worse than that it hangs at 69, or 76%, it is that the blasted thing keeps trying to install, time after time after time after time, all day long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH BANDWIDTH THIS IS EATING UP???<br />
<br />
Worse, there is NO WAY to stop or cancel this endless loop. At some point, it does stop on its own, but then it starts again after a reboot, and by then, it has already tried to installed near countless times.<br />
<br />
Blast it, fix this.<br />

            I had much the same problem and solved it by using the troubleshooter program as administrator. That fixed my issue. Further, I downloaded Glary Utilities and ran that against my windows 10 machine and found over 180 registry errors. That has been since
 I loaded windows 10 last week. Wow. I truly hope the folks at Microsoft get their acts together as this whole thing has been anything but easy or the next best thing!

<br />
<br />This is a scam. Microsoft never calls on its own unless you have logged a call back. These are old methods to exploit the unsuspecting customers and sensitive information might be leaked including your computer and mail ID and other information being used for wrong purposes. 
<br />
<br />No need to attend to these calls.
<br />
<br />You should report this Scam to Microsoft @

<br />It's a scam that has been going on for years. Microsoft never makes unsolicited phone calls. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Is that call from Microsoft a scam?

<h2>            Seagate Backup Plus Slim 2TB USB 3.0 shows up in Connected Devices but not as an accessible drive.</h2>
                    <div>
<p>So I recently bought a Nextbook Netflex 11.&nbsp; It's a Bay Trail Atom processor 2 in 1 tablet with 2 gigs of RAM.&nbsp; It only has 64 gigs, less with OS, of storage so I purchased a 2TB Seagate Backup Plus Slim USB 3.0 to beef up on the storage.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>The tablet itself has one micro usb port.&nbsp; I tried using an OTG cable to connect the drive to the tablet that way.&nbsp; The drive blinks and isn't detected.&nbsp; I'm sure that's due to it not having enough power to the drive.&nbsp; That is fine.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>The keyboard dock has two USB ports.&nbsp; They both are USB 2.0.&nbsp; When I plug the drive into those ports I get the notification sound that something was connected.&nbsp; It shows up in connected devices. However its not accessible from devices and drives.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>I went to Devices &amp; Printers and ran a troubleshoot on the device and I got no errors.&nbsp; It says that the device is working properly. I tried to go to Disk Management to see if I need to assign it a letter manually, however it doesn't show up there either.
</p>
<p>
</p><div>Thumb drives work fine in the ports.&nbsp; I have a 64GB micro sd in the card slot and it reads fine.&nbsp; I plugged the Backup Slim into my Windows 10 desktop and my Xbox One and its detected and read just fine.
</div>

<div>I've posted screenshots so you can have a visual aid.&nbsp; Please assist. <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4fe133b3-2c35-4b4f-ac03-3262bf5d90e9" /></div>

<p>Using Skype for Linux 8.10.0.4 with openSUSE Linux 42.3 with latest patches up to date 11/14/17
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The person I Skype can hear me, I can't hear them</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am using a Logitech USB webcam for both Video and Audio</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try the Echo/Sound Test Service call, everything works fine – I can hear my recorded voice played back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I call someone using Skype, they can hear me and see my video. I can see their video but can’t hear their voice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The speaker setting in Skype always seems to be muted. I can move the speaker volume setting bar all the way to the right but that doesn’t have any effect on whether I can hear the person I’m calling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Pulseaudio and think all the settings are set correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can hear YouTube videos or music that I play on the computer just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The previous versions of Skype for Linux worked fine on openSUSE Linux with this PC. This new version is the first time that I’ve had trouble using Skype in Linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype sound troubleshooting suggestions say that the problem may be with the device of the person I’m calling (in this case an Android smartphone running Skype 7.4.6 for Android). However, he can make Skype
 calls to another Android tablet user using Skype so there doesn’t seem to be any problem with his phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you give me any suggestions as to how to fix this problem? Thanks for your help</p>

<p>Almost the identical problem here: one machine behaves exactly as yours, the other machine I even have trouble getting it to recognise camera and mic at all, but when it does the muted speakers problem is the same. What version can we roll back to, I wonder?</p>

<p>Hi Jannine_P.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two laptops, both running the latest available Skype on Fedora 26 Linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop 1: HP Pavilion; Camera and mic both recognised; speakers showing as muted. A colleague using Skype on Windows made a test call to that machine yesterday and everything worked, even though there was still a message "Speakers muted" showing on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop 2: Acer Aspire; usually, neither camera, nor mic, nor speakers are recognised, even though the various call sounds are played when trying to make a connection. If I am lucky, I can log out and in and then the camera and mic are recognised, but the
 speakers still show they are muted. An attempt to call the other laptop made the connection, but the speakers were muted and I could not hear the other user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither laptop had any problems with the previous version of Skype. Both are able to run Wire without any problem. From these facts, I deduce the problem
<em>may</em> lie with the latest Skype, especially as others seem to have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Doug Hutcheson</p>

<h2>            Windows 7  reverted back to factory settings</h2>
                    I've had my laptop for several months. I used it this afternoon, shut it down for travel and when I turned it back on it was set back to the factory default. &nbsp;How do I recover my system to the way it was this afternoon? &nbsp;None of my applications are there
 and my Outlook (came loaded on the system) came up as though it was a first time use. &nbsp;Since the hard drive is intact it seems as though my information must still be there. &nbsp;Or is this just wishful thinking?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear that Windows 7 reverted back to factory settings. I will do my best to help you get the issue sorted out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you have any security program installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you aware of any changes made to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try and use the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">system restore</a> feature to revert the computer to a full working
 state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists you may contact the computer manufacturer and check for any known issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps and do let us know if you need any assistance in the future. We will be glad to help.</p>

    <title>Win 10 latest update causing display driver stopped working error in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikemccaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 latest update causing display driver stopped working error in Surface Pro 2</h2>
                    <p>The latest update to Windows 10, installed on my Surface Pro 2 a few days ago.</p>
<p>Since then, whenever I play Microsoft Solitaire, partway through the game the screen will freeze, and I get the following error message:</p>
<p>"Display Driver for windows 8(R) has stopped working and has been recovered".</p>
<p>However, the game will not resume.</p>
<p>This behavior was NEVER seen before this update.&nbsp; I've checked for my display drivers, and am told that they are up to date, and am not allowed to see a list to try and re-install.</p>
<p>How can this be fixed, or how can I roll back the latest update?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.&nbsp;I understand your concern and I'll be glad to assist you.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to update your display drivers and check if the issue persist.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows logo + X</strong> key on the keyboard.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
device manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Right-click your display device.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>
Update Driver</strong> Software and then follow the steps in the wizard that appears.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>You can also try this.
</span></p>
<p><span>Go to the control panel from settings.</span></p>
<p>Then<strong> Power Options</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>on your left : <strong>Choose when to turn off the display</strong></p>
<p>Change advanced power settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>PCI EXPRESS : set it to OFF (previously on Maximum power saving probably)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope this post is helpful. Get back to us for further queries. We are happy to help!</span></p>

            <p>Unfortunately, neither suggestion helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to update the driver, Windows replied that it was fully up to date and operating properly.</p>
<p>When I checked PCI express, it was set to moderate on batteries and nothing on AC.&nbsp; I run on AC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I triggered the problem a dozen times in order to get the wording precisely correct of the transient message that appears when the fault happens.&nbsp; Here it is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"Display driver stopped responding and has recovered.&nbsp; Display driver Intel HD Graphics driver for Windows 8(R) stopped responding and has successfully recovered."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It has recovered in that the display works, but MS Solitaire is frozen; I have to terminate and restart the program, and all progress is lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another update installed today, but that did not fix the problem.&nbsp; I don't know if this extends to ALL Microsoft games, but it is absolutely replicable in Solitaire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't understand is that after upgrading to Win 10, and getting several updates, the system is using a Win8 driver, and thinks that it is all good?</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes older versions of Windows will also run smoothly&nbsp;in the new version of Windows provided you run them in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please&nbsp;follow the steps and check. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on ‘<strong>properties</strong>’.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on the ‘<strong>compatibility</strong>’ tab and check the box ‘<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>’ and select Windows 7/8 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For </span>MS Solitaire issue, please post your query on Xbox Forums: <span>

            <p>The fix can be found on page ten of the forum I mentioned in the last message.</p>
<p>You have to download the ZIP form of the Intel Beta driver and manually install.</p>
<p>You CANNOT install through the official process; Windows 10 will insist that you have the latest and greatest.</p>
<p>This version still loses it from time to time, but MUCH less frequently.&nbsp; It only stopped working once yesterday, and that was not at a point where an app crashed.</p>

<p>I've tried:</p>
<p>- rolling back, </p>
<p>- upgrading to the 2015-08-04 version of the Intel driver,</p>
<p>- complete driver un-install, download&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">win64_154010.4300, re-install from disk..</span></p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In all the above cases I can still replicate the error in multiple 'high-touch' applications, including the MS Solitaire - Daily Pyramid game.</span></p>
<p>The problem, in my case began immediately after the last Windows 10 update.</p>

<p>Hello josecibran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. Is this issue occurring on a different television? We recommend plugging the console into a different HDMI port on that television, and plugging the console into a different television. Be sure to let us
 know the results!</p>
