<h2>            sort Start menu items alphabetically &#40;or manually arrange&#41;&#33;</h2>
                    i am having to re-install windows 7 64 bit due to a bad hard drive and would like to sort APPLICATIONS and the Application FOLDERS all alphabetically so i can see this in some organized fashion. right now they are sorted alphabetically with /each/ type
 listed alphabetically separately which is unhelpful for obvious reasons.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>is there a way to organize these manually or otherwise fix this?!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>THANKS</div>
                </div>

            Hi
<div>Thanks for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The items will be arranged, by default, in alphabetical order, with application shortcuts first and then the folders. This arrangement can't be changed. You can use the search feature to search any of the items by typing the name immediately after press
 the start button.</div>

            hi balaji.
<div><br />
<div>thank you very much for your help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>i was hoping this was not the answer.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>i have to say i think this is D-U-M-B. dumb, dumb, dumb.</div>
<div><br />
<div>is there some way to MOVE or COPY the applications that are in folders so they will show up alphabetically with the other applications that are listed here? is there a way to CREATE a folder for each application so that everything shows up in a folder
 list? is there some way to manually MOVE the folders or the applications so that everything shows up in alphabetical order?</div>
<div><br />
<div>i mean, searching is not going to be helpful since if i knew what i was looking for i could just look it up alphabetically in the software list - and then inconveniently have to ALSO check the "software folder list" - but also i just want to be able to
 search alphabetically in a LIST.</div>
<div><br />
<div>i have created a shortcut for my APPLICATIONS folder and my APPLICATIONS (x86) folders on my desktop. but this is somewhat inconvenient to have to go in here and find an application (even though they are in fact ALL listed in these two folders alphabetically
 within folders...).</div>
<div><br />
<div>i mean, is there /some/ way to make this easier...?</div>
<div><br />
<div>THANK YOU&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Why is Windows 8 File explorer so slow&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> knee0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Windows 8 File explorer so slow&#63;</h2>
                    Hi
<div>I have just upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 8,. My hardware requirements far exceed the minimum expectations.</div>
<div>Dual Xeon processors 2.6GHZ, 12GB RAM, 1GB ASUS hardware accelerated GTZ550 Ti graphics card. Dual hard drive running 7200RPM. I am running Windows 8 Pro 64 bit. I performed an upgrade from windows 7</div>
<div>I have been using Windows 8 and I am enjoying using it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Issue</b></div>
<div>My big issue that I am having is the slowness of file explorer, or whenever there is an "open file" dialog window presented.</div>
<div>The windows latency while it builds/shows a file list is extremely slow. I didnt have this issue on windows 7. I am presuming this has something to do with the new File explorer?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Example, if I do windows key + E - file explorer appears&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>If its on say the desktop, no problem. If I go to my picture library where I have a lot of sub folders with images the list slowly builds and green progress bar slowly increments.</div>
<div>To compound the problem, if I close the window and do the exact same thing again, the problem returns. It appears going through the pain of building the list is not cached. As you can imagine this is frustrating.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Things Ive tried:</b></div>
<div>Reducing the file list columns = no better, stil slow</div>
<div>Disabling Windows Defender = no better, still slow</div>
<div>Closing all open apps = no better, still slow</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help or assistance on this matter would be greatly appreciated</div>
                </div>

            I think I may have fixed this, but Im not sure which of the following helped. Certainly one of them has!
<div><br />
<div>I disabled indexing on the second drive</div>
<div>(I dont think this fixed it as I done a search afterwards and it was still slow)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then changed the view in file explorer:</div>
<div><br />
<div>I went to the Ribbon and set:</div>
<div>Preview pane on</div>
<div>Set the icon view to details</div>
<div>Set the Group by (I feel this may have been the key) name</div>
<div>I set the columns to only: Name, Date, Size</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once I had set a group by the files display as they did on windows 7 the response is vastly different. I can open the windows file explorer each time and the response is as I would expect.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I havent rebooted to check this is a firm fix. But so far so good.</div>
<div><br />

            May be first fix is ruled out as I have only one C drive, pending purchase of 3TB HDD, as for indexing I have to keep indexed&nbsp;something&nbsp;at least&nbsp;on this only drive in order to work faster (!)

            This is absolutely a windows defender problem or windows security essentials. When I disable it from services, icons appear very fast. When enabled icons take "years" to appear. They must solve this problem and it has nothing to do with indexing

<p><br />
I have this exact same problem, but it only happens on shares, and stopping the Windows Defender service makes no difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm accessing them over gigabit Ethernet, so it's not a speed issue either, nor did it happen on any prior version of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I view the shares in details view, then it loads really quick as you'd expect. If I change it to
<em>Tiles</em> view (Which is what I like to see them in), then every folder you open takes forever to load the files within. Scrolling is also extremely slow and cumbersome. It's as though File Explorer waits until all the larger icons are cached or something,
 because after you've allowed it to load all the icons for that view size, it's a bit quicker, but still not as snappy as earlier versions of Windows (And might I add, totally unacceptable).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I can have my view set to Tiles on local folders (system32 for example) and it's as fast as it should be, it's only networked folders that appear to have the problem, and unfortunately for me, that's where most of my files reside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grouping makes no difference in either location (Local or remote).</p>

            Try disabling windows defender or security essentials from services, then do a search with *.* at your network sharing folders or disks, wait to finish, do an indexing by type or something else and re-enable windows defender. This helped for me and did
 that for every disk on my system. Not network though.

            It comes down to what kind of email server Cox is using.&nbsp; If it's a POP email system, it won't stay synchronized and your folders don't sync either.&nbsp; There's ways to get everything synced, I actually wrote a longer post on the subject here:

            <p>We have reviewed the System File Checker logs which you have provided and it shows that there is a corruption on both
<strong>bootres.dll</strong> and <strong>slui.exe </strong>files. However, we do not see any relation with the said corrupted files to your reported concern which is with the internet connectivity.<br />
<br />
The 2 corrupted system files detected by the System File Checker can only be resolved by a reinstall of Windows. It would be highly suggested to do a backup of your files before proceeding to do so. Reinstalling your operating system may also resolve your internet
 connectivity issue if the issue is caused by misconfiguration on the Group Policy and Registry.<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>Fact is that Windows 7 is really SP3 of Vista.&nbsp; The differences are few.&nbsp; Mainly 7 is a bit faster and has less annoying prompts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All in all, Win7 is clearly the superior product.&nbsp; I have not yet seen anything that did not work as well or better in 7 that worked in Vista.</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/8dfed619-ba37-465a-be1e-42e247cb658b" title="Fizzykid07">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We certainly understand how important it is for you to have this issue resolved. For us to better isolate your concern, we'd like to ask you&nbsp;few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>When did you start having this issue?</li><li>What was the last thing you were doing on the Surface?</li><li>Are you using a power supply unit that comes from the device?</li><li>Have you tried any troubleshooting steps on your own in resolving the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, h<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ere are the few things we suggest you do:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Check connections, and clean the connector on the power supply.
</span></span></span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Unplug the power supply from the wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Clean the pins on the connector with a pencil eraser. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Clean the pins on the connector with a cotton swab wet with rubbing alcohol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - After you are done cleaning the pins, make sure all the pins on the connector are dry, plug the power supply into the wall, and then plug the connector back into your Surface.</p>

    <title>Bluetooth keeps getting disabled from the device manager after Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth keeps getting disabled from the device manager after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having an issue with my Bluetooth after I upgraded to windows 10. I'm using an Asus laptop. I tried updating the driver but no go. My Bluetooth manufacturer is Qualcomm Atheros. My first issue was that the Bluetooth's on and off is missing so I tried
 to update the driver and still it wasn't fixed so I went online and tried to follow the steps in windows 8 and at first I<em> was able to see</em> the on and off button of my Bluetooth but then when I tried turning it off, it was suddenly gone (no icon). So
 I checked on the device manager and saw that is was disabled so I enabled it again. Each time I turn it off , same thing happens. I have to re-enable it on the device manager because it was disabled. Any ideas guys? Thanks ! I would really appreciate it. It's
 really a hassle to enable it on the device manager every time I use it.&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.
</span><span>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.
</span><span>Try the following methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>NOTE: </strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in
 Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when
 you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network
 policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section <strong>“How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”
</strong>to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a SFC Scan and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note: Links for Windows 8.1 Holds Good For Windows 10.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything you have said but no go. Know what the weird thing now is? I can't turn off my bluetooth. Maaannnn!!! It's always on now. When I try to switch it off, it turns itself back on. Seems like&nbsp;it's got its own life. Any other TS steps?
 I appreciate the help buddy.</p>

            <p>I have to uninstall my Bluetooth module and driver every time I start my PC. That's assuming the power was also turned off, because this problem doesn't occur if I leave it on (i.e. the module remains energised).... I then do a hardware scan and low and
 behold, the very thing that has a problem with my Bluetooth module, installs it without a hitch!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft just try to blame the hardware all the time. Come on guys... This is clearly a software issue!!</p>

            Yeah! Looks like that. I have clean installed the Win 10 OS instead mate. Now, the problem is, some of my stuffs (DVD Drive and other hardware and software) are malfunctioning. Like my DVD drive keeps on opening without me opening it and some weird stuff.
 Im thinking , Win 10 isn't really good for Win7 PCs. tsk tsk

            Good thinking. haha I mean, Win10 really looks awesome but not when its not doing what its supposed to do. It kinda gets into my nerve. Now, my PC cant even open nor recognize my phone which was working before. &nbsp;We have reverted back our 2 PCs to Windows
 8 and uninstall Windows 10 upgrade. I'm thinking now of going back to Win7 now that these things are happening. I mean, come on!&nbsp;Arrrggghhh!!! Frustrating..

<h2>            does copying a file to a USB create a link file&#63;</h2>
                    I am a Digital Evidence Examiner working on a case where I can see 20 or 30 link files with the same time stamp (hh:mm:ss identical) . Would a group copy of files to a USB drive create .lnk files like this?

Thank you Julia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't understand that this answers my though. I can find all the .lnk files.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what I am seeing:</p>
<p>20 to 30 .lnk files</p>
<p>Last&nbsp;Accessed, Created, and Last Written all identical (down to the second - like 12:34:15)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How would all theses files have been created with identical data? Can this be the result of a group file copy of the target files to a new media, like a USB?</p>

<p>se você que que funcione jogos originais e o sistema do seu Xbox 360 tem que estar com o sistema antes de sistema que veio depois da atualização para mídia de DVD com o gears of war 3 &nbsp;e battlefield 3 mais se tentar atualizar com o update da Microsoft se
 tiver o Drive &nbsp;de DVD adulterado mais a atualização mais nova pode ser se Xbox seja banido se foi adulterado o drive de DVD com dois tipos de adulteração ou desbloqueio &nbsp;mais será mais facil &nbsp;vender ele e adquirir &nbsp;um já com garantia de não ser banido , pois
 se fizer update de firmware do drive para aceitar o DVD original do jogo vai ver se tiver um código modificado do drive do Xbox 360 pode ser banido , como sabe se o drive nunca foi trocado por outro ou se o drive não vai aceitar se tiver ADUTERAÇÂO do drive
 é difícil saber mais como vai achar o update de firmware se vem junto com uma dash mais nova ou equivoco se der upgrade da dash e o driver já esta com um driver lança depois do lançamento do halo reach ele não vai aceitar atualizar e se não atualizar vai dar
 erro um monte de numero e letra e seu Xbox 360 foi pro belelu.....</p>

 turn on my PC case LEDs turn on and all fans turn on and stay on. Just stays on no input to monitor.<br />
<br />
It is NOT the monitor or cable. Tried on my monitor with Xbox and even swapped hdmi cables 3 times on my PC to my monitor. Same result. Plugged it into my TV and another different monitor. Same result<br />
<br />
I tried GPU slot change. RAM reinstall and slot change. Same result. No input.Rebuilt the entire computer. Unplugged everything from the PSU and replugged and again same result. Tried different PSU aswell and same thing<br />
<br />
This is a prebuilt iBuyPower machine! It worked flawlessly before the update. So part compatibility is not a thing.<br />
<br />
My specs are:<br />
ASRock 970M Pro3 motherboard&nbsp;<br />
Amd FX6300 CPU<br />
Nvidia GTX 1050ti 4GB<br />
8GB DDR3 RAM<br />
SolyTech ATX 400W PSU<br />

<p>Start your system, as the Dell logo appears, repeatedly press the F2 key to enter BIOS</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason your system is trying to boot from PXE (basically boot from an intranet) - I presume this is wrong and you want your system to boot from your hard drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>In BIOS, find the list of Boot Devices, move your hard drive to the top of the boot list</p>
<p>Save changes to your BIOS setting and exit BIOS</p>
<p>Your system should now boot from your hard drive . . .</p>

    <title>Remote Shutdown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tchampzg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Shutdown</h2>
                    Trying to remotely shutdown a windows 10 machine version 1703 from another windows 10 machine version 1703 on a home network, both local machines are in a workgroup and both machines have the hidden elevated administrators accounts activated on them, have
 made sure that remote registry services are activated and running plus set to automatic on both, have been reading pages and pages of info trying soo many peoples advice and suggestions as well as watching the same amount on youtube but nothing anyone suggests
 works, there must be a certain number of things to check and enable or disable for it to be able to work but nobody on the net seems to know exactly?? If anybody is skilled up enough to exactly know how to enable this and get it to work it would be much appreciated,
 Thanks in advance.&nbsp;

                    My husband is trying to use a program on Windows 8. It keeps saying it can't find an OCX file in C:\Program Files (86)... .OCX. But, when you navigate to the path given, the OCX file is right there! Why can't the program see it? And what do we need to
 do to make it see it? <br />

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>When you say "trying to use a program on Windows 8" what is the program you are referring to?</li><li>Can you provide us the exact and complete error message? You can also provide us a screen shot of the error window.</li></ol>

    <title>shift &#38; ctrl not persistent when held down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmainer  say:</h3>
<h2>            shift &#38; ctrl not persistent when held down</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello, I am having a very strange behavior. When I press and hold the SHIFT key, it will not persist. For example, if I wanted to type a row of "*", I press the shift key and hold it, and it will type "*****888888". This happens on the laptop keyboard,
 a USB keyboard I attached, and the on screen keyboard, so it does not appear to be a hardware problem.
<br />
<br />
It seems as though the shift is activated for only about a second when I press and hold the shift key, and then it reverts back.
<br />
<br />
The same thing happens to the CTRL key. Very annoying when trying to do cut/paste (ctrl-c/ctrl-v).<br />
<br />
Can anyone help?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!!</span></p>

<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were there any recent changes or updates made on your computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Try to restart your computer in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Safe mode</a>&nbsp;and check if the problem persists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If it works fine in safe mode try performing a clean boot to find the root cause</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>To perform clean boot, follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open
<b>Run</b> (Winkey + R) type <b>msconfig</b> and the press <b>Enter</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>b. On the
<b>General tab</b>, click <b>Selective Startup</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Under
<b>Selective Startup</b>, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click the
<b>Services tab</b>, click to select the <b>Hide All Microsoft Services</b> check box, and then click
<b>Disable All</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click
<b>Apply</b> and <b>OK</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f. When you are prompted, click
<b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>g. After the computer starts verify whether you are able to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the following KB article to narrow down
 the exact source:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: You need to follow step 7 in
 the article to restart your computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer and install the latest Keyboard drivers and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To uninstall drivers from the device manager follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
<b>Start.</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “<b>Device Manager</b>” in the search bar.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
<b>Device Manager</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the device you wish to uninstall in the Device Manager window and uninstall it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You can also uninstall by right clicking on the device and selecting
<b><span>Uninstall</span></b> from the context menu. A dialog box will open asking you if you really wish to uninstall the driver. Click
<b>Yes</b>, then <b>OK</b> in the next window.</span></p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the issues you've had recently.</p>
<p>It sounds to me like you have had a power surge within your home which has caused an a lot of electricity to go into the console at one time.</p>
<p>The official Xbox One power supply does come with a built in surge protector, but it must be reset before you can use it. To do this, please follow these instructions:</p>
<p>1. Unplug the cables from the console, wall outlet and power supply itself.</p>
<p>2. Wait 10 seconds. It is important that you wait 10 seconds. as this step lets the power supply reset. Make sure that you unplug the power supply unit from both the wall and your Xbox One console.</p>
<p>3. Firmly plug the power cable back into the console, and then plug the power cable back into the power outlet and the power supply. Connect the power supply directly into a wall outlet. Do not use any surge protectors or extension cords, because they can
 affect the performance of your power supply.</p>
<p>4. Turn on the console and check the light on the power supply.</p>
<p>If you need any more information, please visit this page: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/system/console-wont-power-on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I hope this helps!</p>

<p>Hey there. I would first try those steps again, but leave it unplugged a little longer. I would wait at least 5 minutes.
</p>
<p>If you have a friend that also has an Xbox One, see if you can borrow their power supply, so that you know that it is a working power supply. If not, try to take it back to Gamestop and exchange it, in case the one you got is bad.</p>
<p>If it still doesn't work after that, and you went through all of the troubleshooting listed on that page, it sounds like you will need to get your console repaired. If you need to do that, you can start an order at

<p>I don't mind the way the instructions are worded, EXCEPT the one that says:</p>
<p>"Connect the power supply directly into a wall outlet. Do not use any surge protectors or extension cords, because they can affect the performance of your power supply."</p>
<p>This would be a LOT easier to do, and I would DO It if the darn power supply cord was long enough so that 2 things were possible:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;You should be able to leave the power brick on a STABE surface, and not have to worry the thing falls off the surface: &nbsp;The Cord is TOO SHORT to allow me to plug the cord directly into the wall, and the brick can hit the floor unexpectedly (as has happened
 to me TWICE.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;The Power cord is not as LONG as the 360's cord: &nbsp;I understand the fact that the new brick has some special surge protection, but in addition to the fact that the cord is too short, the cord connected to the brick can come loose, and fall out of the
 brick - I HAVE to use surge supressors in here, because I live in an older building with a generator, and would much rather have it plugged to a suppressor, and have the spike knock out the surge protector, rather then an XBOX One Power Supply.</p>
<p>How does one TELL/ASK XBOX to make a better power Brick/Longer Cord: &nbsp;at least 6 foot would be good, that way the thing stays on the FLOOR???</p>

<p>Adjacent protector can make Xbox easier. &nbsp;It is not designed for constant spikes (ie from a generator). Its near zero design is for a single spike. &nbsp;Repeated spikes can, in rare cases, cause it to become the source of a fire. &nbsp;Meanwhile, protection routinely
 designed in all electronics makes spikes from a generator irrelevant.</p>
<p>Best power strip is one without protector parts AND with the always required circuit breaker.</p>
<p>Receptacles must be located so that one is always within 6 feet of anything along the wall. &nbsp;If not, a new wall receptacle is required (per code).</p>

<p>Hello Fry33,</p>
<p>Have you tried to install the Adidas Micoach Pacer in Compatibility Mode?</p>
<p><span>If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.
</span></p>
<p><span>Use the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on the Program</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Properties</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Compatibility tab
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Run this program in compatibility mode and select Windows Vista or whatever operating system the program was running successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link here: Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the compatibility is not successful, then try and run
</span><span>the</span><span> Program Compatibility troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the
<span>Start</span> button.</span></p>
<p><span>Then click <span>
Control Panel</span>. In the search box, type <span>troubleshooter</span>, and then click
<span>Troubleshooting</span>. Under <span>Programs</span>, click
<span>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</span>. </span>
</p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the troubleshooter, browse to the program's setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something
 similar. The troubleshooter is not designed to work on programs that have an .msi file name extension.</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
If that doesn't help you might need to look into virtualization&nbsp;software.<br />
If you run Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate versions , install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP mode (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx</a>) and execute your software
 in Windows XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you run Windows 7 Home Premium, try VirtualBox (<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.virtualbox.org</a>) or VMware Player (<a href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.vmware.com</a>) and install a separate copy of Windows XP (either
 Home Edition or Professional) for that purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply back with an update and let us know if this helped to resolve your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting. I understand that you are having issues uploading your video to YouTube. I would like to ask for the exact steps you did when uploading the video and the where the error occurs exactly. Also, I would like to clarify if you are receiving
 other error because our system detected an error c9450023 has occurred. Furthermore, I would like to ask also if the version installed in your computer was 15.4.3508.1109 (To check, press
<strong>ALT + F</strong> in Movie Maker, click <strong>About Movie Maker</strong>.). If so,&nbsp;I suggest that you update&nbsp;your&nbsp;Movie Maker by visiting this
