<h2>            &#34;Display driver stopped responding and recovered&#34;- Assassin&#39;s Creed 2</h2>
                    I've been playing Assassin's Creed 2 on my computer for a while. One day it blacked out once or twice while I was playing; it went back to normal pretty soon after and I didn't worry too much about it. Next time I played, though, it blacked out repeatedly
 until the whole computer crashed, and the game's basically unplayable now. I minimised it after a couple of the blackouts to find the error message "Device Driver stopped responding and recovered" I've tried all the steps listed here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2665946
 with no success, and while I know there are a lot of other threads around with similar issues I thought it might be better to get some specific advice. I've got Windows 7, 64-bit on a Toshiba laptop. As far as I know there weren't any changes to the computer
 which might have caused it, though the problem began a while ago so it's possible that I've just forgotten. Thanks!<br />

            Clean out any dust you can from the computer. Make sure it's properly ventilated while playing. Find out what model graphics card is on the laptop and check for driver updates.

            I looked on my computer and found it's an Intel HD graphics card. Went to the Intel website and found a thing which checks for updates, so I ran it and it came up with this:<br />
http://i1209.photobucket.com/albums/cc393/Artemis200/intelscanthing_zps7eb54df0.png<br />
I'm not sure if it's actually necessary to contact Toshiba about a driver or if it's just something the website's saying? I've never had the problem with anything except Assassin's Creed but equally I probably don't do anything as taxing on the graphics card.<br />

            <p>Hi Artemis200,</p>
<p>yes, I would advise to do exactly what that comment says. Remember the manufacturer will have the best drivers for your system.
</p>
<p>But I would also check your ventilation...that issue sounds more like a heat issue to me.</p>

            Okay, I will make sure to do that once we're a bit past Christmas!<br />
But maybe I will try to fix ventilation first... not sure why it would have suddenly become a problem, but the laptop does get pretty hot in parts whenever I use it and especially when playing AC.<br />

<div>I know this issue, the answer is actually on microsofts site. Happens in Fable 3 a lot.<br />
<br />
Problem: a thing called TDR checker monitors the computers hardware, particularly the GPU, is say the GPU stops responding with the computer for 2 seconds TDR checker restarts the driver. The TDR checker was good on paper but did not work in the real world.
 as a gpu can stop responding when it is working hard.<br />
<br />
Issue since the time of vista, thats why this problem virually never happened on XP<br />
<br />
Here is the solution<br />
Exit all Windows based programs.<br />
Click Start, type regedit in the Search box, and then double-click regedit.exe from the results above. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
Browse to and then click the following registry subkey:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet002 (sometimes called ControlSet001) \Control\GraphicsDrivers<br />
<br />
On the Edit menu, click New, and then select the following registry value from the drop-down menu specific to your version of Windows (32 bit, or 64 bit):<br />
<br />
For 32 bit Windows<br />
Select DWORD (32-bit) value.<br />
Type TdrDelay as the Name and click Enter.<br />
Double-click TdrDelay and add 8 for the Value data and click OK.<br />
<br />
For 64 bit Windows&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Select QWORD (64-bit) value.<br />
Type TdrDelay as the Name and click Enter.<br />
Double-click TdrDelay and add 8 for the Value data and clickOK.<br />
<br />
Close the registry editor and then restart your computer for the changes to take affect.<br />
<br />
This puts a delay on the tdr checker of 8 seconds thus the gpu can stop responding for 10 seconds, usually this fixes the problem, if you are still suffering from this issue (after updates or a reinstall of drivers, you know all that annoying driver stuff)<br />
Then do this, do the same thing but instead of "TdrDelay" type "TdrLevel" enter the data value as 0 (it is set to that natively, but double check) then delete the TdrDelay,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Restart&nbsp;<br />
<br />
That completely turns off Tdr checker, so now windows 7/vista/8 now works more like windows XP<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 I can&#39;t remove a tile from the start menu.</h2>
                    I added a folder to the documents folder and then made a tile for it in the start menu. However I ended up deleting the folder but now I can't remove the tile in the start menu. How do I get rid of the tile?

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family. I would be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you want to remove a tile from the start screen of a deleted folder.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to remove tiles from your Start Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below steps to remove the tile.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows (<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fpanam.acer.com%2facerpanam%2fimages%2ficon_Windows8_key.png" />) key</strong> to open the Start screen.</li><li>Right-click on the tile you want to remove.</li><li>Select <strong>Unpin from Start</strong> to remove the tile.
</li></ol>
<p>Ideally, the above steps should remove the tile which you want to. However, if it fails to, I would suggest you to Restore Default Start Screen Tiles. Please follow the below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the Windows key + R from the keyboard to open the Run Command Dialog Box.</li><li>Enter the following command: <strong><span>%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows</span></strong>, which will open the&nbsp; Microsoft Windows App-data folder.</li><li>Scroll down&nbsp;to find these two files, namely,&nbsp;item-data file and the&nbsp;item-data.bak.</li><li>Select both files to delet, right-click on it and select Delete option to send it to the Recycle bin. Don’t press Shift to delete it permanently, let it go to recycle bin. On the safe side you can make a backup copy of these two files on another disk location.</li><li>Restart your PC or log out and log in again. Now you will see Windows 8.x Start Screen reset to default tiles.</li><li>Now re-arrange the tile as you want and new tiles will also be created automatily when you install any apps from Store.</li></ol>
<p>Note: If anything went wrong and you want to revert start screen tiles to your tiles. restore item data files from recycle bin or from the location where you backed up to the Windows app data folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information was helpful. If you need further information, feel free to write to us and we would be glad to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

            <p>Windows 10. I added a Tile for Gmail. The tile installed with the appropriate Icon on the tile. Withing seconds, the icon disappeared. I then decided that something was wrong and clicked to Remove it from the start menu............Nothing happened. The tile
 remained and is now totally non functional and non removeable. Also syncing to my gmail (calendar in particular) no longer works. I tried the solution inclusive of the Run command. when I entered the Run command as instructed, the folders indicated did not
 appear. Any other options I can take to remove this tile and get the syncing process to work again?</p>

            <p>There needs to be a better solution to this. I had to spend an hour to get the tiles the way I wanted, now you're telling me that in order to get rid of one tile, I need to spend an hour to re-do the whole thing? That's asinine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, I hadn't deleted the program yet, I just hadn't used it in some time. I relaunched the program, and deleted the tile while the program was running. Then closed the program again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I had deleted it, I'd have had no options. #Win10Fail</p>

<p>Yep that'll do. I would be a little wary on buying a cheap VGA cable though as they used to have much poorer shielding. Maybe not so these days, but for an extra few quid/dollars the official one is the mutts.</p>

<p>Cheapest solution is trade in your current 360 or sell it and buy a newer model if you want HDMI. VGA will do just fine though I used an official VGA cable for a long time before I got a new console that had an HDMI port.</p>
<p>Also could you clarify on computer monitor plugins. Are they DVI or plain old &nbsp;D-sub VGA?</p>

<p>You're better off just using the Xbox 360 VGA cable and a VGA switch box.&nbsp; Yes most switch boxes luck ugly, but they work.&nbsp; The switch box will allow you to connect your PC and 360 to the same screen, to swap, simply flick the switch.</p>

<h2>            Turn off after period of inactivity</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have set my XboxOne to turn off after a period of inactivity. My TiVo turns itself off after 4 hours of inactivity, for my TV and Surround Sound I set these to sleep when I'm off to sleep. I expect in the morning to see the XboxOne and Kinect lights
 to be off, but they aren't. Should they? Or do they stay on and in 'listening' mode for the "Xbox On" command? Thanks</p>

<p>Glad to hear it's not just me! :)</p>
<p>And yes will do. The only thing I can think of at the moment is that Kinect is recognising movement/sounds and it's keeping the console awake? The only time the console has been off since last Friday is when I've physically turned it off... be good for the
 inactivity shut off to start working </p>

<p>The Ambassador I chatted with had me do this: </p>
<p>1. Hold the Xbox logo on the console for 10 sec</p>
<p>2. Press the xbox logo once to turn the xbox back on. This cleared the cache &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Go back to setting and change it to 1 hour if not already and see if that works.
</p>
<p>If that doesn't work try changing the power mode to energy savings and see. I don't know if this will actually work but thats what they told me to try. Worth a shot to see if that fixes the problem. I have shut down my xbox several times since friday but
 I would like to wake up in the morning and see my xbox turned off. The ambassador also said if this didn't work to came back and tell support that we already cleared cache and tried both power modes. Hope this works for both of us and anyone else who has this
 problem.</p>

<p>I have been in contact with Xbox Support and they are suggesting that running the TV app in full screen is making the XboxOne consider that activity and therefore it'll never turn off... despite whether it's actually receiving a signal or not (my TiVo shuts
 itself off after 4 hours). Doesn't seem much use for an entertainment centre to never turn itself off when you're using the TV app even if no TV signal is being received. It should really look for button presses or if the controller hasn't been connected for
 a period of time then it's likely the XboxOne could shut itself down. I might try tonight putting the XboxOne to Home and switching to another source to see whether it's off by morning. If it is then it's unlikely I'll be using the Xbox to watch TV anymore.</p>

<p>If you are running TV via Xbox, or any activity, it will not turn off. Activity is anything that makes the console "work". If it just based timeout decisions on button presses etc, your console would turn off in the middle of a movie or something - since
 you wouldn't normally be pressing buttons during that period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>It is much the same as setting a PC to do certain things or shut-down during inactivity - in many cases it never will trigger the action for inactivity because a computer is almost always doing "something" even if its just you AV scanning things etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>It needs to have zero activity against the drive or processor pretty much to be considered idle ... if anything happens during that time, the idle counter resets and starts over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>It's a nice addition, but unless you are not using the console for TV and have the kinect disconnected, it will most likely only shut off in rare cases.</p>

<p>I'm usually watching Netflix or Xbox video before I go to sleep. I used the same setting for the 360 and it worked fine. I can understand watching the tv app and it not shutting down unless you set your tv to shut off and then the xbox should be able to
 detect no signal coming in but when your watching netflix or xbox video once the movie or tv show your watching ends and the xbox sits idle on that screen for an hour that to me is considered inactive. If you have a game paused or at the main menu and it stays
 on that screen without any change for 1 hour that to me is considered inactive. </p>

<p>Well Xbox support have asked questions about which options I have selected, whether Kinect may still be recognising activity from the camera/hearing sounds etc, and have asked that I change from 1 hour of inactivity to 6 hours... not that I'm expecting for
 it to do anything, but I'm making the change tonight; although I still expect that in the morning the Xbox will still be on.</p>

                    <p>I've had my laptop for over a year now, it's Windows 7 and has been absolutely faultless until a day ago. The 'busy' cursor (cursor with the rotating blue circle) appears every few seconds, even when nothing is visibly loading or waiting. I can still select
 things and for all intents and purposes, it's still fulfilling functions, you just wouldn't believe how annoying and frustrating it is! I'm not very good with computers but are there any ideas, please?

    <title>Windows Explorer freezing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> micahmcelroy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer freezing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Book 2 running Windows 10 Pro and for the past few days my Windows Explorer routinely freezes. Whenever I touch a file icon or try to drag anything from the Windows Explorer pane, Explorer becomes unresponsive and ultimately crashes and
 restarts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have:</p>
<p>Updated all my drivers with DriverEasy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updated Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ran a full virus scan with Norton. (No results)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ran system maintenance.&nbsp; (No results)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ran a Windows Memory Diagnostic. (No results)</p>
<p>Ran&nbsp;SFC and Chkdsk scans. (No results)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changed Windows Explorer settings to "disable thumbnails" and "launch folder windows in a separate process."</p>
<p>Cleared Window Explorer history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a moment changing Windows Explorer to launch folder windows in a separate process fixed my problem, but it soon returned. A few minutes ago I tried dragging a .doc file into an email composed in Gmail, which caused Windows Explorer to freeze. I also
 created a new account, which seemed to relieve the problem, but I don't have access to my files or administrative privileges.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to follow these Methods: 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 1: Run the DISM Tool.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, I would have you run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.
<br />
<br />	1. Click on 'Start'.
<br />	2. Enter 'Command prompt' in the Search box.  
<br />	3. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command prompt, and then tap or click 'Run as administrator'. 
<br />	4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.
<br />
<br />Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it.
<br />
<br />Method 2:
<br />
<br />Type the following in a Windows PowerShell as Administrator:
<br />
<br />1.Launch PowerShell 
<br />2.Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3.Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />
<br />Restart your device.
<br />
<br />Hope the information provided is useful. If the issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you.
<br />
<br />Angel.

            Yes, here are some ways in which you can restart Windows Explorer.
<br />
<br />Restart the Explorer from the Task Manager:
<br />
<br />	The task manager offers a very simple way to restart Windows Explorer in Windows 8 and 10. In Windows 7 you will have to follow other steps, which we have indicated for you later.
<br />
<br />Restart Windows Explorer from Task Manager in Windows 8 or 10
<br />
<br />	In Windows 8 or 10, open the Task Manager by right-clicking on an empty area of the taskbar and then clicking on "Task Manager". You can also press Start and search for "Task Manager", which could be more useful for you if you are looking at the home screen instead of the desktop in Windows 8. And if you are from people who are supported with keyboard shortcuts, just press Ctrl + Shift + Esc.
<br />	If the Task Manager window looks like the following image, click on "More Details" at the bottom to see the detailed interface.
<br />
<br />	The "Processes" tab of the Task Manager window shows the applications and background processes that are currently running on your PC. Scroll through the list of what is working and find "Windows Explorer". If you currently have a File Explorer window open, you will see it near the top in the "Applications" section. Otherwise, you will find it at the bottom of the "Background Processes" section. To restart, select "Windows Explorer" and then click on the "Restart" button.
<br />
<br />	That is all you have to do. It may take a few seconds and things like the taskbar and the Start menu may momentarily disappear, but when it restarts, things should behave better, then you can close the Task Manager.

<p>Hi Miles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already restarted File Explorer, but thank you for your advice. This did not resolve my problem. I must've misunderstood your advice: I thought you asked me to uninstall File Explorer and then I asked you how I'd go about re-installing it, not whether
 I could relaunch or restart it. Thanks though.&nbsp;</p>

                    Since I reverted from Windows 10 back to 8.1 I cannot access any of my PDFs. &nbsp;I get the message "The specified path does not exist". &nbsp;All other existing files types are accessible. &nbsp;Only PDF paths seem to be corrupted. &nbsp;I downloaded a new PDF since back
 on 8.1. &nbsp;After saving the file, I get the same message on the new PDF when trying to open it. &nbsp;Hmmm! &nbsp;Makes me wonder if it is a Microsoft or Adobe problem.

<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You do not have permissions to the file or the file location.</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The file is on a location that is not currently accessible like a network location or an external drive that is not currently connected to the PC.</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The file has been moved or deleted.</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The file or shortcut is corrupt.</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The file may be blocked by Windows.</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Your antivirus software may be blocking the file.</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span></li></ul>
<p>To resolve this issue, follow the steps in the methods below starting with method 1, if that method does not resolve the issue continue to the next method.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Check to see if you have permission to open the file</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Permissions are rules associated with files that determine if you can access the file and what you can do with it. To check the permission of the file or folder, follow these steps: &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the file or folder, and then click <span><strong>Properties</strong></span>.
</li><li>Click the <span><strong>Security</strong></span> tab. </li><li>Under <strong><span>Group or User names</span></strong>, click your name to see the permissions you have. (The screen shot for this step is listed below).<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2fLibrary%2fImages%2f2738108.png" /></li><li>Click <span><strong>Edit</strong></span>, and then click to check the check boxes for the permissions that you need, and then click
<span><strong>OK</strong></span>. (The screen shot for this step is listed below).</li></ol>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2fLibrary%2fImages%2f2738109.png" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Check to make sure the file location is available </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You might get this error if the shortcut or installation is attempting to access a location that is not currently available such as a networked or a removable drive. Check the path of the file that Windows cannot access and make sure that the location is
 accessible. (The screen shot for this step is listed below).</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2fLibrary%2fImages%2f2738110.png" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Make sure that the file has not been moved or deleted</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also receive this error if the file has been moved or deleted. Browse to the location of the file and make sure the file is in that location.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4: Recreate the shortcut to&nbsp;check for corruption </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also receive this error if the&nbsp;shortcut or other file type has become corrupt. You can check for corruption in shortcuts by recreating the shortcut.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 5: Check&nbsp; </strong><span><strong>to see if the file has been blocked by Windows</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In some cases the file may be blocked by Windows. Check the properties of the file, there may be a note saying
<span>This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer</span> To check for and unblock the file, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the blocked file and then click <span><strong>Properties</strong></span>.</li><li>In the <span><strong>General</strong></span> tab, click <span><strong>Unblock</strong>
</span>if the option is available. </li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 6: Check to see if your antivirus software is blocking the file
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check to see if your antivirus software is blocking a file by temporarily disabling it, and then trying to open the file. If you have to temporarily disable your antivirus software, you should re-enable it as soon as you are done. If you’re connected
 to the Internet while your antivirus software is disabled, your PC is vulnerable to attacks.
<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Important: </strong></span><em>Disabling your antivirus software or changing the settings may make your PC vulnerable to viral, fraudulent, or malicious attacks. Microsoft does not recommend that you disable your antivirus software or change the
 settings.&nbsp; If you have to temporarily disable your antivirus software, you should re-enable it as soon as you are done. Use this workaround at your own risk.</em></p>

<h2>            Onn wireless keyboard and mouse issues</h2>
                    <p>Model # ONA11HO087</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally bought this and then ended up breaking the keyboard. I bought another one&nbsp; but never used the mouse with the keyboard. well I lost the one that came with it but I still have the mouse from the original set. the mouse has like a connect/pair
 button on it. is there any way to pair the old mouse with the new keyboard? it didn't come with a disc or anything and the usb does not have a pair button. I'm not sure what to do but I am hoping I can get them paired. I don't want to have to go buy another
 set... Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Remote Desktop Immediate sign out</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I remote into my laptop almost daily using the built in RDP client for windows, to use applications from work. All of the sudden whenever I try to remote into my laptop now, I am able to connect and then as soon as I sign in, the client computer says signing
 out and closes the connection.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried this with my laptop on two different networks both configured correctly by me. I also tried&nbsp;remoting&nbsp;in from 3 different computers. I have the most updated video drivers and have made sure that no windows files were corrupted. I also have
 tried restoring my computer to a time when I was able to connect and use RDP but the same behavior is happening.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I included the remote desktop event log from my laptop below:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The server accepted a new TCP connection from client XX.XXX.XX.XX:XXXX.</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>IMHO as a 3rd year computer science student I feel I am fairly tech savy. There is no need to go into heavy detail or explaination. I have tried every troubleshooting step I can think of, so any help is much appreciated. :)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note: my computer is running windows 8 pro</div>

<div>Thank You!</div>

</p><p>Also, when I'm on the same subnet as the RDS farm RemoteApps and Connect to remote PC (RDP) and RDP through Gateway using MSTSC ver 6.3 all WORK.</p>

<p>Hi Clay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has made multiple improvements and continue to put a lot of hard work with Windows 10 to support high DPI (dots per inch) screens. However, you may encounter issues like this that occur when using Office apps on devices such as your Surface Pro
 4 with screen resolutions above 1080p, and then connected to an external monitor with a lower screen resolution. Microsoft is aware about this and is actively working on improving Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said that, this only means that this is not a Surface or a Windows Operating System related issue. We'll need a bit more information to help you better:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What's the current version of your Office?</li><li>Which build and version of Windows do you have?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>There have been updates released that fixes this issue, and you need to have certain versions (or newer) of Office and Windows 10 on your Surface in order for you to see the fixes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although Windows and Office are kept up-to-date automatically, updates are rolled out gradually. End users will not receive the updates all at the same time. For more information on how to make sure you have all the latest updates, follow these Microsoft
 support articles:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Install Office updates.</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/performance-and-maintenance/install-software-updates-for-surface?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Install Surface and Windows updates.</a></strong></li></ul>

<p>Bom dia pessoal,</p>
<p>Comprei recente o headset Turtle Beach modelo Kilo, ao conecta-lo no controle do xbox fica um chiado chato, só diminuindo o volume do chat fica&nbsp;imperceptível&nbsp;e da para outros os outros usuários, mas isso é normal? Alguém já passou por isso? No note também
 ocorre um chiado, mas notei que isso pode variar de aparelho para aparelho. Desde já valeu! Abraço</p>

<p>valeu Jose! Mas tenho controle com fio também e chiava, troquei o fone e não chia mais, mas em alguns dispositivos sim, tipo no note chia e depende do pc chia, acho que existe outras questões mais delicadas sobre isso, mas é um chiado que controlando pelo
 volume nem da para ouvir, pois é só quando liga o chat.</p>
<p>Tenho o Kilo, gostei muito, é meu primeiro fone assim, você ouve sons no jogo que antes passava despercebido, mas o x-ray é bem melhor, os fios do kilo podem incomodar um pouco, rs.</p>

<p>rapaziada, O LANCE É O SEGUINTE:</p>
<p>eu tenho esse fone e to ligado do chiado que vcs estão falando. Se você estiver com o Joystick com cabo USB plugado, vai rolar esse chiado mesmo(é ESTÁTICA). Usem o Joystick no modo Wireless(com pilhas ou bateria e SEM O CABO USB) e esse chiado vai sumir.

<h2>            Windows not loading at all</h2>
                    <p>I have a Toshiba Satellite laptop that I bought in late 2012 it runs windows 8 that has been upgraded to 8.1. &nbsp;Last night I tried to restore my computer to a listed restore point on my computer of June 20, 2014. At some point during the process we lost electrical
 power and internet service for a few hours. Now when I turn my computer on its shows &nbsp;the toshiba star up screen and then goes to nothing, if I push the windows key it gives me a menu for recovery options. The recovery options require a password, which &nbsp;I
 am positive I am using the right one, but it says incorrect password and tells me restart computer and I do and it does the same thing all over again......HELP!!! How do I get past the password to see if I can use my recovery options.</p>

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As there was a power failure during the process of system restore, there are chances that some system boot files are broken and are not working properly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>You will need the Windows 8 installation disc to perform an Automatic repair. If you don’t have a Windows 8 disc, I would suggest you to download the Windows 8 installation files from another computer through this link and choose to “<strong>create an installation
 media</strong>” when the upgrade assistant prompts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only</a>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have a Windows 8 installation disc, follow these steps: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When your computer starts, wait for the manufacturer logo to check the option for boot menu, it will usually be F12.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The boot menu key might differ with each manufacturer. If you are unable to find the boot menu key, you may refer the user manual.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer, when the manufacturer's logo is displayed, keep pressing the Boot menu option key to enter the boot menu and change the boot option to CD\DVD ROM.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD". Press any key.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the “correct time and Keyboard type”.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click “Repair your computer” in the lower left corner
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on “Troubleshooting”, “Advanced” option and then click “Startup Repair”. Follow the on screen directions to complete the startup repair. Once this is done restart
 the computer and check if you are able to get to the desktop screen.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reply with the status of the issue and we will be glad to offer our assistance.</span></p>

            <p>Hi pararash,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your issue in Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you face issues with Wifi, mobile 3G and Display drivers after installing Windows 8 pro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the exact model number of the HP Slate 2?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue might have caused due to the driver incompatible with Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to download the latest drivers from the Manufactures Website and install them in Windows 7 compatibility mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Install the drivers in Compatibility mode.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Install the drivers from the manufacturer’s website. If Windows 8 drivers are not available, you can install Windows 7 drivers in compatibility mode. Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Download the latest drivers from the Manufacturer’s website and save it on to the Desktop.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>my Tablet HP Slate 2 the CNU151292F Serie (Atom, 2Gb MEM, 32Gb SSD, Wifi + 3G BroadBand).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uninstall the Wifi atheros AR6003 driver from my tablet.</p>
<p>I redownload the driver (in case HP had updated them since last week).</p>
<p>I installed the driver thru the Compatibilty mode (windows 7).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But sadly, after 30 minutes, the driver goes on&nbsp;Limited (yellow exclamation mark).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>
<p>All regards</p>

            <p>Hello pararash,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since you have already updated to the latest drivers, I suggest you upgrade the firmware on the router to see if that will help with your connectivity to the internet. If that doesn't make a difference, then contact ISP to run tests on your on your wire.
<br />
</p>
<p>Let us know if this helps. <br />

            <p>Thank you for your input, Marilyn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>put I don't have Wireless or Broadband&nbsp;problem only at my place, I have the problem at work, in public places like Starbuck or bars, airports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that the Atheros AR6003 device which seems be same for Wireless and Broadband,&nbsp;is not adapted yet to HP slate2 and Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've contacted HP, and for now they don't see the urge to provide drivers for their Slate2.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a pitty because it is Professional taplet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concerning the Atheros, I followed a lead on this page :</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w8itprohardware/thread/21feaaf6-3f6b-4264-938c-cf22a06a19a7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w8itprohardware/thread/21feaaf6-3f6b-4264-938c-cf22a06a19a7</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I downloaded these drivers that are actually for another Tablet Motion&nbsp;CL 900 :</p>
<p><a href="http://www.motioncomputing.com/drivers/CL900/AtherosBT_v740140_WLAN_v31285_CL_RN.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.motioncomputing.com/drivers/CL900/AtherosBT_v740140_WLAN_v31285_CL_RN.htm</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems more stable, but it still crash after several hours, when I'm not plugged on a AC, it seems then that the problem could come from the managing the hibernation/wakeup or reduction of energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But concerning the Display, no idea yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
