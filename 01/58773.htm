<h2>            Unable to install &#39;Recording Studio Pro&#39;</h2>
                    I'm trying to Download an app that I paid for. But when I try to download it, I get a message that says: "Something happened and this app couldn't be installed. Please try again. Error code: 0x2020002e" What does this mean? I won't be happy if I can't
 get an app that I paid for.

            <p>Possibly a corrupt download, try downloading the app again and reattempt the installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should also contact the developer to find out if it is supported on Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also try installing in compatibility mode, if its supported in an older version of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right click the application installer.</p>
<p>Click Troublshoot compatibility</p>
<p>Follow the on screen instructions.</p>

<p>1. Count Down starts and the Kinect or Mic hears me and right after it hits 1.... It freezes and crashes the app</p>
<p>2. Count Down starts 3...2...1... But Kinect or Mic cant hear me and then I get a message saying "Sorry, We weren't able to record that time." (0x80040201) after I press stop recording.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>I think I figured something out...</p>
<p><strong>REGARDING ISSUE #1:</strong></p>
<p>After receiving the standard power cycle troubleshooting instructions from XBOX, I decided to stare at the problem until it made sense or threw me a bone. After countless different methods and attempts at recording ( changing just one setting with each attempt
 and ruling things out one by one )... I came to a possible cause/solution for the your first issue--&nbsp;<em>voiceover feature crashing the entire program upon countdown reaching 1, and/or getting nothing but static recorded</em>.</p>
<p>First off I have SURROUND SOUND TRITON HEADPHONES plugged into the&nbsp;<strong>OPTICAL AUDIO</strong>&nbsp;jack on my console. Audio settings require BITSTREAM OUT for said headphones to provide me with anything resembling a Dolby Digital Surround Sound bitstream
 format.</p>
<p><strong>The crash was only triggered&nbsp;</strong>for me when I was attempting to record voiceover audio&nbsp;<strong>while my headphones were powered ON via the power button located on the connected 'decoder box'.</strong>&nbsp;I received the crash whether attempting
 to record voiceover via my Kinect OR the XboxOne Chat Mic connected to my controller.</p>
<p>Without changing any audio settings from their original &nbsp;Optical, Bitstream Out, Surround setup originally noted upon first experiencing the crash --<strong>&nbsp;Simply turning OFFthe decoder box/headphones&nbsp;<em>BEFORE PRESSING RECORD</em>&nbsp;(without having to
 unplug the headphones completely)&nbsp;<em>ALLOWED THE COUNTDOWN TO FINISH AND ALL VOICEOVER AUDIO TO SUCCESSFULLY RECORD (CONFIRMED RECORDING WITH CHAT HEADSET AS WELL AS KINECT</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;MICS)</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The headset plugged into my optical device &nbsp;is a Triton 720+ surround sound headset. Not specifically listed as compatible with the XBoxOne (just 360 and ps3), regardless of still providing me with surround sound audio (no chat). It seems that merely having
 some type of decoder box or digital audio device plugged into your optical outlet and in the ON position,&nbsp;<strong>regardless of your digital audio settings,</strong>&nbsp;interferes with the voiceover recording feature of Upload Studio.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>NOTE:</em>&nbsp;In my hours of trials,&nbsp;<em>NOT ONCE did hard-booting, power cycling, uninstalling/reinstalling programs, nor changing any one particular display &amp; sound audio setting EVER CORRECT THE ISSUE</em>. Please remember, this is the first time I'm
 posting, so as of right now this has only worked for me (until someone else tries it)... I'm no programmer, nor do I claim to be some troubleshooting expert. I'm technogically self-taught having grown up in the days that saw the start of Apple and the birth
 of Atari, and having to sink or swim in DOS hell, but it looks to me like the problem lies somewhere in whatever audio device/s are attached via your OPTICAL AUDIO jack. I'd say there's some miscommunication going on there once you hit that record button and
 that countdown begins.</p>
<p>HOPE THIS WORKS for you or anyone else as a temporary fix regarding this ongoing unresolved issue (and helps to steer XBOX tech guru powers that be in a direction that leads to a more complete/informed solution or some sort of eventual patch! :)</p>
<p>GOOD LUCK!</p>

    <title>Cannot do a complete PC backup on reformat external hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tatankha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot do a complete PC backup on reformat external hard drive &#40;error 0x80780029&#41;</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
I recently had to reformat (disk error problem) my external hard drive(USB) on which I did a complete PC back up. After reformatting the disk, I tried to do a new complete PC back up on it&nbsp;wihtout success because the older shadow copy could not be read ("the
 read from volume shadow copy on source failed" error code 0x80780029) It seems the Backup and restore center kept in memory the old backup I did on my reformat hard drive and is looking for it to proceed further. How can I go around this&nbsp;to&nbsp; erase the old
 shadow copy trace and/or do the complete PC back up?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance for your help<br />
<br />

            Hello Matt,<br />
<br />
Today I tryed to run the command: Wbadmin start backup -allcritical -backupTarget:H: and the error message was the same ( "the read from volume shadow copy on source failed") BUT the detailed error says: "The request could not be performed because of an I/O
 device error."<br />
Is there something wrong with the connection between my PC and my external drive or with the external drive itself? &nbsp;I ran chkdsk /F on this external drive and nothing wrong was found.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help!<br />

<p>I should have included:</p>

    <title>windows 10 crash report - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 1_lolon_2  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 crash report</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I would like to report a crash my computer has experienced recently. I have experienced random system crashes frequently and unpredictably after I installed windows 10 but none have been picked up by the reliability monitor. Recently, however, my system automatically
 rebooted after one of these crashes and has produced this result:</p>
<p>
The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck. &nbsp;The bugcheck was: 0x0000001e (0xffffffffc0000005, 0xfffff9612dddb9c0, 0x0000000000000001, 0x0000000000000002). A dump was saved in: C:\WINDOWS\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: 110515-31562-01.<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>It would be very helpful if a solution can be found for this issue. If you need any more information, please contact me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;<br />
Lolon</p>

Thanks for the reply. I uninstalled the driver. Hopefully this was solely the issue I was having, I'll reply back if the crashing continues.<br />

<br />
No DMP files are produced when it occurs. In the reliability history, it states that windows was not properly shut down.<br />
Also I uninstalled the driver that was reported to have been causing the issue before, so I'm guessing the cause is from somewhere else.<br />
<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t create restore point even in safe mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kreynolds8864  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t create restore point even in safe mode </h2>
                    I am running Vista Home Premium and when I attempt to run a system restore point, it gives me an error message "The restore wizard is already running".<br />
When I go to create a new restore point the system restore and create buttons are grayed out and under available disks and most recent restore points it says searching, but no drives are ever listed.&nbsp;
<br />
I've checked in Task manager and driver is not present.<br />
Also many of the automatic updates will not complete.&nbsp; I get no error messages it just keeps saying do not turn off computer, installing 1 of 1 etc.&nbsp; Stays that way until the computer turns itself off.<br />
I have both Vista Home Premium and files from windows XP that I moved over with pc mover.&nbsp;
<br />
All systems worked fine for about a year.&nbsp; Have been searching for answers for about 3-4 months now.

            <span>You may be infected with malware - an attack on System Restore is a classic symptom (to protect itself).&nbsp; While in
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.pandasoft.com</span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(with
 the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You may also want to try the free OneCare at </span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a></span><span>
 and let it run all the options because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span>Do&nbsp;a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow
 from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If you can identify the corrupt files if any that would be good (and yes, I know it's a long listing).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning
 system restore (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Before you do this, try creating a few restore points so it will generate errors.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with the upgrade from an earlier version of Windows section of the following: </span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system cane with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Daryl,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We are sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. We will help you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Close all the programs that are running on the desktop and try installing the program again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Safe Mode and Clean Boot</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>If the issue persist, boot your PC in <strong>Safe mode</strong> by following the steps from the link below and check if you are facing similar issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Safe mode</strong> is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear at the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expand the options to boot into <strong>Safe Mode</strong>:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/troubleshoot-black-screen-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/troubleshoot-black-screen-problems</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To exit from <strong>Safe mode</strong> follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Open <strong>Run command</strong> by pressing <strong>Windows key + R
</strong>on the keyboard and type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the command box.</span></li><li><span>Under <strong>Boot </strong>tab uncheck the <strong>Safe boot </strong>
option.</span></li><li><strong><span>Reboot </span></strong><span>the system and check if the changes are effective.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To know more about <strong>Safe mode, </strong>following is an article on <strong>
Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode) </strong>(Applies to Windows 10 also)<strong>:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>If the issue does not persist in <strong>Safe mode</strong>, perform
<strong>Clean boot </strong>by following the steps from the link below and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Putting your system in <strong>Clean Boot</strong> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
</p>
<p><span><br />
Following is a link to perform a <strong>Clean Boot</strong>:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: </span>Start the computer in normal mode refer the section,
<strong><span>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting
</span></strong>from the link above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are happy to assist you with any issues pertaining to Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Page Fault in NonPaged Area &#40;50&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scott2260  say:</h3>
<h2>            Page Fault in NonPaged Area &#40;50&#41;</h2>
                    <p>In my classroom we're running dual boot iMacs. On the Windows OS (windows 7) side we're getting BSOD crashes with a Page Fault in NonPaged Area error. The odd thing about this is that it only happens on Tuesdays each week. Nearly every computer in my room
 will randomly BSOD crash at some point on Tuesday morning. The rest of the week we do not experience any problems. We do not have any problems on the IOS side if the computer is booted up to the Mac OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done the memory test usually associated with this type of an error and it checks out ok.</p>
<p>I've done the disk check test that is also recommended for this error and the drive checks out ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is the contents of the most recent dump file from one of the offending computers. Does anyone have a suggestion as to what's causing this issue? I'm guessing it may be a driver problem but the fact that the crashes only happen on Tuesday mornings seems
 odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>
<p>

            <p>Unfortunately, the problem is not resolved. Today we had the same BSOD crashes in my lab. So far 8 out of 30 computers crashed within an hour of being booted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the recommendations in this forum I upgraded the AppleHFS.sys file to the most recent driver I could find (5.0.0.1). It was recommended that I updated the AppleMNT.sys file as well so I did (version 5.0.0.0). I also added the updated drivers to the

</p><p>I don't know if there's a connection, but these crashes only happen on Tuesday. The rest of the week we have no problems what so ever.</p>

</p><p>I've uploaded the system info and memory dumps from one of the computers that crashed today. It is located at:</p>

            <p>In the current DMP AppleHFS,sys was still involved BUT&nbsp; Symantec drove it to fail.&nbsp; I wonder if SYmantec is set to run a scan on Tues mornings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would remove Symantec from a couple of the problematic machines to see if that fixes the issue</p>

            <p>I think we're closing in on the problem. Like you said, in the recent dump file it shows 3 files causing issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>AppleHFS.sys</p>
<p>ntoskrnl.exe</p>
<p>SRTSP64.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>SRTSP64.sys is related to the Symantec Virus protection. I did a little digging and it looks like our system techs have it loading updates on Tuesday morning. That has to be where the problem is happening. I'll take a look at the dmp file from a few other
 crashed computers and see if I'm getting the same dump info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming SRTSP64.sys is the problem, any suggestions for how to fix it?</p>

            go to ur system restore point, some bad installation had been done on ur pc , try registry cleaner that would work for u (removed) or try this
<br />
1. Turn on your computer into Safe Mode by pressing the F8 button of your keyboard before the Operating System Boot process starts.<br />
<br />
2. After desktop appears, click the Start button on the Taskbar.<br />
<br />
3. If you are using Windows XP, then click the Run option, and type: "msconfig" (without quotes), and press Enter. Or, if you are using Windows Vista/ 7, then directly type "msconfig" (without quotes) in the Search Box, and open it.<br />
<br />
4. After the System Configuration Utility opens, go to Startup tab, and uncheck all the suspicious items, and click the Apply button. [If you don't know what to uncheck, send a screen shot to me with an email.]<br />
<br />
5. Now, go to Services tab, and check-up the box "Hide All Microsoft Services".<br />
<br />
6. Uncheck all the suspicious items in this list also, and then click on Apply, after on OK. [If you don't know what to uncheck, send a screen shot to me with an email.]<br />
<br />
7. Restart your computer, and boot it into Normal Mode.

<div><br />
<div>Do you have any USB devices connected to the computer when you try and boot into the Windows 7 installation?</div>

            Hi Memery.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See if the fixes here help:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows/3-quick-fixes-for-your-windows-store-problems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that fails then Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />If that fails then reinstall Store.  Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</code>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />If these all fail then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Store app. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Store app, it should work fine now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            Please try the below steps:
<br />First of all:
<br />Try re-registering Store and clearing cache:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-register-store-app-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-reg...</a>

<br />If that doesn't help, make sure:
<br />You are not using a proxy server/3rd Party Firewall or a VPN.
<br />The next step would be to disable metered connection if you have set so.
<br />If all of these doesn't help, try doing a repair install that keeps everything.

</blockquote>
<p><br />
Depends on the "apps" in question.&nbsp; Their compatibility and ability to run on any given operating system is determined not by the manufacturer of the operating system, but by the manufacturer of the "app".</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
If you are asking if there are still compatibility modes for Windows XP... Yes.</p>
<p>If you are asking if there is still a free Windows XP Mode virtual machine... No.</p>
<p>If you are asking if all your Windows XP compatible applications/versions of applications that you got to run in some manner on Windows 7 will run under Windows 8 - the answer is the first paragraph in my response.</p>

    <title>After updating to Windows 10, computer gets stuck on loading screen. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nehefer  say:</h3>
<h2>            After updating to Windows 10, computer gets stuck on loading screen.</h2>
                    <p>After installing the Windows 10 upgrade and making sure everything was ready, I restarted my computer and it's now stuck on a grey loading screen with an animation of dots forming a circle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not make any system changes or mess with drivers, I simply personalized my Start Menu and installed updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can do while in this loading screen is press Control + Alt + Delete to show the Sign In screen, but it doesn't show any sign in options. It only shows connectivity options, ease of access and power options on the bottom right of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting multiple times does nothing. Attempting to repair Windows does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can force the repair menu and from there I can boot into safe mode, but I don't see what I could do to fix this from there.<br />
<br />
Doing a clean reset of the PC does nothing, because as soon as I'm done installing updates and personalizing everything again and I turn off the device/restart it, it goes back to the grey loading screen and the computer becomes useless.<br />
</p>
<p>Is there a fix for this?<br />

<p>That makes sense because the problem appeared after I changed the ownership of C:\</p>

Thank you for that suggestion. Will try reverting ownership and post a reply here if successful. I'm able to boot into safe mode by powering off twice during boot up.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I keep getting the same error message every time I try to play a video game (ONLY when I try to play video games, no other times). Even though I allow reports to be sent to Microsoft, I never get any solution. It's extremely frustrating to have a gaming
 computer (Alienware) that won't play games. I haven't been able to find any solutions online and no one seems to know how to make this stop happening. And PLEASE do not suggest driver updates. I use this computer to run digital animation software so EVERY
 SINGLE DRIVER in this computer is kept up to date. If I can't find a solution for this I'm selling the stupid thing and buying cheap laptop. I never had this problem, not even once, when I used my little Toshiba laptop. Unfortunately, it died, so I'm stuck
 with this expensive, useless pile of computer chips. There MUST be a way to make this stop happening. Some one PLEASE tell me you know the answer because Alienware has no idea and neither does anyone else it seems. I'm desperate!!! p.s. I have no idea what
 all this stuff means ↓<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d7d72c84-8a8a-4d5e-9c5d-102847bbe71d" /></p>

            <p>hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gotten this error with a few game before and every time it happened to me it was due to the process already running. For whatever reason when i launched some of them they wouldn't come up the first time but would still be open in task manager and taking
 system resources. After ending them it would then let me open the game without any issues. Out of curiosity what are all the games doing this to you? Is it every game?</p>

            <p>All my games are doing it. Even if I end them in the task manager, they still won't run if I try opening them again. I reboot the computer and they still won't run. Nothing I do will make my games run because no one can tell me&nbsp;WHY the application hang is
 happening in the first place. &nbsp;I can't resolve this problem if I don't know what's causing it. I don't even know why they&nbsp;would hang, I never have anything else running when I want to play a game and they still won't play. I'm beginning to think there is no
 soloution. The IT guy at my school couldn't even figure out why this is happening but he's mostly a Mac technician. When I click the Event Log Online&nbsp;link at the bottom of the error message screen all it tells me is there is no information available for that
 error code. Why does Microsoft even bother putting that link there if they can't offer us any information on how to stop this from happening???</p>

            Yeah that sounds like it really sucks. The only other thing i could think of trying would be to completely try re installing the whole operating system. (only if there is absolutely no other possible thing you can try) Please come back to reply to this
 post if you ever figure out what the problem is though, this is very odd and i'm a bit curious.

            A friend of mine suggested restoring it back to factory settings but it's not practical to do so. I would need to download and reinstall over 100GB of software and I don't have the time or internet usage available to do that. (I would also have to buy
 a really big external hard drive to back up my files) It would take months to get the computer back to the way I need it to be in order to do my animation. I might as well just sell this one and buy one that works. Nobody seems to know how to fix this one
 and I've run out of patience with it. :(

Almost everyone should be backing up regularly. It is always possible<br />
that a hard drive crash, user error, nearby lightning strike, virus<br />
attack, even theft of the computer, can cause the loss of everything<br />
on your drive. As has often been said, it's not a matter of whether<br />
you will have such a problem, but when.</p>
<p>Essentially you should back up what you can't afford to lose--what you<br />
can't readily recreate. What that is depends on how you use your<br />
computer and what you use it for.</p>
<p>It takes time and effort to backup, but it also takes time and effort<br />
to recreate lost data. If you back up daily, you should never have to<br />
recreate more than one day's worth of lost data. If weekly, there's<br />
potentially a lot more to recreate. You should assess how much pain<br />
and trouble you would have if you lost x days of data, and then choose<br />
a backup frequency that doesn't involve more pain and trouble than<br />
that you would have if you had to recreate what was lost.</p>
<p>Some things (photographs, for instance) can never be recreated, and<br />
more frequent backup may be wanted for them.</p>
<p>At one extreme is the professional user who would likely go out of<br />
business if his data was lost. He probably needs to back up at least<br />
daily. At the other extreme is the kid who doesn't use his computer<br />
except to play games. He probably needs no backup at all, since worst<br />
case he can easily reinstall his games.</p>
<p>Most of us fall somewhere between those extremes, but nobody can tell<br />
you where you fall; you need to determine that for yourself.</p>

                    <p>A mystery drive labelled SYSTEM DRV (F:) has appeared in the file explorer on my Windows 10 Lenovo Laptop. &nbsp;There appears to be many others querying this and suggesting that it has appeared after a Windows update. &nbsp;It appears to have slowed down the whole
 machine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone what it is, where it came from and how or to delete it? &nbsp;I am posting this from my old faithful XP machine.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the new drive on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The F: drive on your computer refers to a secondary storage device that holds data such as photos, videos and downloaded files -- anything that can usually be stored on your local drive. Generally, your main storage drive is the C: drive. Every other storage
 drive you connect to your computer, whether internal or external, will be named in order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To understand the issue better I suggest you to send the screen shot of your File Explorer and disk management. Please follow the below link to know how to attach a screenshot for your post:</p>

            <p>I have the same issue, and there are many reports that this happened after the latest MS update. I also have a Lenovo laptop running Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Hi dkas22</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to solve this one last &nbsp;night with nothing more complicated than a system restore from the offending Windows Update point and please to report that all is still good to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See no reason why it should not work for you but would be very interested to hear the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.&nbsp;</p>

            Regrettably the Mystery F Drive has reappeared. &nbsp;Can only deduce that Windows has updated again!&nbsp;

            Dear All - My laptop has done yet another update &amp; guess what the mystery F Drive has dissipated. &nbsp;Hopefully that is the end of it and trust that you all have similar experiences.

            <p>This virtual drive "SYSTEM_DRV (F:)" appeared on my system yesterday after an update. The screen dumps shown were similar to those shown here although I am running 8.1 &nbsp;(on a Lenovo desktop).</p>
<p>After reading the comments I went to "Windows update" to check the update history and found the page subject to a amber warning that updates were not completed. &nbsp;Clicked "complete" or similar and windows went into "restart", but instead of the message "installing
 update nn of nn" the message was "working on updates"</p>
<p>
</p><p>After restarting "Windows update" was normal and the virtual drive "SYSTEM_DRV (F:)" was no longer shown. &nbsp;Have just turned on again today and it is sill gone.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I left the pc downloading gears of war 4 via the windows 10 store.... However, I don't have a very fast connection, so after about ten hours and 30 GB downloaded, I had to pause it.&nbsp;</p><p>When I resume the download a little while later, it starts again from zero.&nbsp;</p><p>I have more than enough hard drive space free, over 200GB on the drive its downloading too. Just wasted ten hours for nothing I guess.&nbsp;</p><p>I know there's not much anyone can do to help, but really microsoft, you've been around enough to be able to start getting this stuff right sometime surely.<br /></p>
