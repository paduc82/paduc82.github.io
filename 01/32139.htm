<h2>            Headphones not recognised on Dell XPS 13 2016 Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Headphones that work with other windows 10 laptops ( Apple Headphones) will not work with my Dell XPS 13 2016 model. They plug in fine however sound comes out of speakers and the headphones do not come up in the&nbsp;playback devices. I have turned the display
 on for disabled and disconected devices but they still dont recognise headphones. I have tried other headphones and had the same problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This more likely is an issue with your audio driver. I strongly suggest you try updating it y following the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong> and choose <strong>Device Manager</strong> from the list.</li><li>Locate your audio device.</li><li>Right click the audio device and choose <strong>Uninstall</strong>.<br />
</li><li>After your audio device has been uninstalled, <strong>restart</strong> your computer and Windows 10 should install it automatically.</li><li>Make a test call.</li></ol>
<p>If you're still having problems, Microsoft has a tool to <a href="http://support2.microsoft.com/mats/audiorecording/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Problems with Hauppauge TV tuner &#40;US&#41;&#58; No Channels - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with Hauppauge TV tuner &#40;US&#41;&#58; No Channels &#38;amp&#59; TV not detecting HDMI connection, after powering on XB1</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Day One XB1 and have been using the TV pass though feature (DirecTV via HDMI) pretty much trouble free since release. I recently kicked DirecTV to the curb and purchased the Hauppauge TV tuner for OTA broadcasts. It worked fine&nbsp;after the initial
 setup, and found all my local channels. Now however, every time I restart the XB1&nbsp; I have problems&nbsp;getting the tuner/One Guide app working properly. Often the error is that&nbsp;it can't find the channel, with the guide saying something about HDMI. I no longer
 have a TV provider setup for HDMI. It also seems you must have a working internet connection for the guide, at least after a restart. This was not the case when I was using passthrough, the listings were blank, but I could see the channel list and change channels.
 The OTA guide doesn't seem to show the channel list after a restart when no internet is available. Unfortunately, I'm stuck with data capped internet access.</p>

<p>Second, possibly related issue. I've &nbsp;never had any problems with my TV not detecting the connection when my XB1 starts, but since I've moved to the TV tuner this occurs about 75% of the time. I do have a HDMI sound bar in between the TV and XB1, and when
 the TV doesn't connect I can still hear audio from the sound bar. However, this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Never once</span> occurred before the switch from pass trough TV&nbsp;to the USB tuner. My XB1 is set to launch TV on start.</p>

<p>I did have to update the xbox to install the new TV tuner. I'm&nbsp;on 10.0.10586.1187.</p>

<p>I should also add for clarity, that if I connect to the internet and force close One Guide, and then reopen, OTA TV works fine. Just force closing One Guide without internet access&nbsp;has no effect.</p>
<p>Also, on the second issue with the TV seeing the XB1 over HDMI, if I restart the TV it will start working fine. It seems like a HDCP handshake issue to me. Again, this never occurred when I was using the pass through TV.</p>

<p>I have almost the exact same problem, minus the TV not detecting the connection issue. The only issue I have with the TV is that the media remote no longer changes the TV volume or mute. I think this happened after the big UI update.</p>
<p>Here's my situation: I also have a Day One XB1 and have been using the TV pass though with the Hauppauge TV tuner for OTA broadcasts. It's also set to launch TV on start. It was absolutely trouble free when I had an always on internet connection. Now I have
 a limited internet connection and experiencing the same problem.</p>
<p>I'm very much looking forward to the OTA DVR update. I'm hoping it might fix this issue too. Fingers crossed.</p>

<h2>            Blue screens with different repeated errors iolorgdf32 program not found - skipping AUTOCHECK</h2>
                    <p>OT: Blue screens with different repeated errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(31, 31, 31, 1)">Sony Vaio SVE1713M1E and at some point I started getting this message on windows during start up:</span></p>
<p>iolorgdf32 program not found - skipping AUTOCHECK</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure if that message has to do anything with the following, but soon after that, Blue Screens started to appear and restart the laptop with the following messages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM<br />
NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM (Ntfs.sys)<br />
MEMORY_MANAGEMENT<br />
KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR</p>
<p>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION</p>
<p>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (tcpip.sys)</p>
<p>
</p><p>These Blue Screens always cause an autorestart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens at least once per day, to 3 or 4 times per day! It drives me crazy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;MEMORY_MANAGEMENT message is the most common one so I did a memory test but no errors were found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I tried to do a disk check &nbsp;but it always gets stuck at 15% for hours, so I leave it to it and the next morning I find it on the start sreen (probably after a restart caused by a blue screen, not sure). I have tried to do that at least 20 times, but
 never succesfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am no pc expert but I have search in the forums and I saw that noone else has this problem with the multiple different errors causing the blue screens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

</p><p>Although verifier was enabled it did not "catch" the mis behaving driver.&nbsp; That can happen when the driver is an OS driver (whcih is not being verified) or if it is the physical ram itself.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 kills nvidia driven display - GT745M</h2>
                    <p>I was invited to upgrade to windows 10 last week. &nbsp;this week today when I came home my PC was asleep. when I woke up it went into a lot of disk I/O. &nbsp;after one hour I shut it down. &nbsp;I believe it was installing the upgrade for me early as an advanced user.
 &nbsp;when I restarted I could see that it was booting but the display was blank. &nbsp;I can put it to sleep or wake it up but the display is blank. &nbsp; when awake thunderbird downloads email from the servers as I can tell from my iPad. &nbsp;it seems to be running with a
 dead screen. &nbsp;so then I called Microsoft. &nbsp;your lame callback feature was disabled. I had to wait for one hour for someone to answer. they put me on hold for 7 to 10 minutes and then they cut me off. I called back only to find that your system goes down at
 9 PM Pacific. &nbsp;I wasted hours on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You call that a painless upgrade? do you call that customer support? do you want me to continue as a Microsoft user since 1988?</p>
<p>
</p><p>what do I have to do to get my display back on a win 8.1 Lenovo A730 27" desktop, i7, 8 gig SDRAM, 1 tb hd, WHICH USES THE
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NVIDIA</span></strong> <strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">GT745M</span></em></strong> ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>now after typing all this in twice, it refuses to submit. &nbsp;Aaaarrrrrggggghhhhhh!!!!</p>

            I forgot to say that my Internet connection is about 24 million bits per second. &nbsp;so one hour was way long enough to download your windows 10. &nbsp;I believe it was stuck in a war with nvidia as to who controls the video. &nbsp;I was the casualty.

            Today as soon as I got home from work at 7 pm I called Microsoft for support. &nbsp;I requested tech support for windows (other). &nbsp;I was transferred to a line with no response, no music, no recording, nothing. &nbsp;I was not offered a callback. &nbsp;This is a horrendous
 upgrade and support experience. &nbsp;Sell your MSFT stock. &nbsp;Idiots are in charge with zero regard for customers.

            <p>Tonight I waited 25 minutes for an acknowledgement that I was on the phone waiting for support. &nbsp;It never came. &nbsp;I hung up and called again. &nbsp;This time I got acknowledged that I was being put on hold and the Muzak started. &nbsp;I ditched 1 and 1/2 hours later
 at 9 pm. &nbsp;My pic screen was so wrecked by this upgrade that I cannot even get a display when I start the UEFI.</p>

<h2>            onboard camera not listed in device manager</h2>
                    I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;using an Asus EeePC (1015PE) with an onboard camera which is not listed in the device manager. Asus tech support suggested enabling the camera in BIOS, but it is not listed in BIOS either. An Asus chatroom suggested updating BIOS, but according to
 Asus you would need a remote hard disc or an internal&nbsp; DVD which I do not have. I'm very happy with my notebook which runs on Windows7/32. The camera is a curiosity.

TempestSwift.</a> Were you able to successfully upgrade your device to Windows 10? Note that some PCs may need up to 24 hours to download #Windows10, depending on the quality of the internet connection. Fingers crossed for a speedy one! If your Windows10 download

<h2>            surface 3 internet connection issues</h2>
                    &lt;p&gt;My Surface 3 says it's connected to my wireless network. &amp;nbsp;Yet when I open my browser, it will often say there is no internet connection. &amp;nbsp;The only fix I have found to this is restarting the Surface in order to get it to work properly again.
 &amp;nbsp;This problem particularly occurs when the Surface is not charging, but occurs occasionally while it's plugged in, as well. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It used to be that once it was charging, there would not be any issues. &amp;nbsp;But now, the connection 'drops
 out' even while it's charging. &amp;nbsp;I say 'drops out' in quotes because the internet does not seem to have completely dropped out. &amp;nbsp;It's still connected (according to the wireless status), and other applications that require the internet seem to work
 fine; only the browser seems to fail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have tried some other solutions that were posted, such as disabling the Internet Protocol Versio

<p>Hi Johann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried both methods, but neither worked. &nbsp;Running the commands in the command window also gave me some interesting replies, the most notable being that when i ran the first few commands (the reset commands), it gave me a bunch of failed messages and when
 i tried to run the reset winsock command, it wanted me to run as administrator, which was weird because i *am* the administrator of the device.</p>

<p>I am currently running windows xp pro 32 bit OS. Also in my possession is a windows 7 ultimate 64 bit operating system's ISO file. My goal is to start the installation of WINDOWS ULTIMATE 64 BIT through a USB pen drive. I finally found a promising link via
 google search. ( <a href="http://www.bwana.org/2009/01/11/how-to-install-windows-7-beta-from-a-usb-drive-to-an-hp-mini-1000-without-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.bwana.org/2009/01/11/how-to-install-windows-7-beta-from-a-usb-drive-to-an-hp-mini-1000-without-vista/</a> ) I managed to get through till the 12th step. In the 13th step, I am stuck. I get the error -<strong>k:\boot\bootsect.exe is not a valid win32
 application </strong>as I am running a 32 bit OS.Is there anyway to get through this?</p>
<p>Few sites offer a free download of a 32 bit version of Windows 7's bootsect.exe. Should I replace my 64 bit bootsect.exe(present in my original Win7x64Ultimate ISO file) with a 32 bit one and create an ISO file with the rest of the files intact, will I be
 able to get through the 13th step?</p>
<p>Also, I have 5 drives in "My Computer". All of them partitioned using the NTFS file system. My XP Pro 32 bit is in C: drive. I do not mind losing the data in C: as that is where I've planned to install win7 ultimate 64-bit. However, I do want the files in
 the other drives. My question is-"Will I be able to access those files in the other drives after installing win7 x64 in C: drive??"</p>
<p>A million thanks to any help.</p>

<p>If you bought Widnows 7 from the MS Store:</p>
<p><strong>When creating a bootable USB device, I am getting an error about bootsect</strong><br />
To make the USB device bootable, you need to run a tool named bootsect.exe. In some cases, this tool needs to be downloaded from your Microsoft Store account. This may happen if you're trying to create a 64-bit bootable USB device from a 32-bit version of Windows.
 To download bootsect:</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to your <a href="https://store.microsoft.com/account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Store account</a> to view your purchase history</li><li>Look for your Windows 7 purchase. </li><li>Next to Windows 7, there is an "Additional download options" drop-down menu.</li><li>In the drop-down menu, select "32-bit ISO." </li><li>Right-click the link, and then save the bootsect.exe file to the location where you installed the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool (e.g. C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Apps\Windows 7 USB DVD Download Tool).</li><li>Once the file has been saved, go back to the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download tool to create your bootable USB device.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you didn't - Instructions I was able to find:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Follow these instructions for getting around the bootsect error:</strong><br />
<br />
a. Download and install the <em>Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool</em> program as indicated on the<em>Microsoft Store</em> web site.
<br />
<br />
b. Download a working 32-bit version of <strong>bootsect.exe</strong> . Below is a link to 32 bit bootsect.exe:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/attachments/installation-setup/47060d1263222191-32-bit-bootsect-bootsect7600x86.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">bootsect7600x86.zip</a><span><br />
From: <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/installation-setup/54443-32-bit-bootsect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/installation-setup/54443-32-bit-bootsect.html</a> </span>
</p>
<p><span>c. Once downloaded, copy the <strong>BootSect.exe</strong> file to the same folder that includes the installed<strong>Windows7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool.exe</strong> file. The default install directory of that file in Windows Vista is<em>C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Apps\Windows
 7 USB DVD Download Tool\</em> (you'll need to look for it in XP)<br />
<br />
d. Run the <em>Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool</em> application as indicated on the<em>Microsoft Store</em> web site. The end result will give you a bootable USB flash drive that contains everything you need to install the 64-bit version of Windows 7.</span></p>

            Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

            Hi Jason
<br />
<br />BSOD's are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<p>
</p><p>Can you re-generate the file exactly as following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Key + R&nbsp;&gt; type <em>eventvwr </em>in the "Open" box&nbsp;&gt; OK&nbsp;&gt; expand "Custom Views" and then right-click "Administrative Events" &gt; select "Save all events in Custom View As" and save as an .evtx file</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then make the resulting .evtx file available via OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there appears to be CCleaner installed so can you check the configuration of CCleaner and make sure CCleaner is not set up to delete dump files.</p>

<h2>            Can i change an OS drive letter from D&#58; to C&#58;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a desktop with a Dual boot setup. Vista Ultimate 64bit on C: and Windows 7 Pro 32bit on D:<br />
<br />
These are two seperate hard drives.<br />
<br />
I want to run with only the Windows 7 OS and do away with the Vista OS.<br />
<br />
I can simply disconnect the unwanted drive and run a repair from 'Boot with CD' to write a new bottmgr, but i am uncertain if this will work? Also will this process effectiveley reassign the driveletter of the Windows 7 OS?<br />
<br />
If it does change the OS drive letter to C: will all the applications etc run properly as they were loaded whilst the OS was in fact a D: drive?<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatfully received<br />
<br />
Vary many thanks<br />
<br />
Nick

            Hi Nick,<br />
<br />
Although there are various tools that <em>claim</em> to do this successfully I really don't recommend it.&nbsp; As you hinted at, when you installed your operating system it was configured to use drive D: for various things and simply changing the drive letter would
 potentially cause you issues at this point.<br />
<br />
What I recommend is that you do a fresh install and remove all of the partitions during the installation allowing them to be recreated (with correct drive letters).<br />
<br />
Make sure you do back everything up before hand but this would be a safer approach if it's really important to do.<br />
<br />
Good luck &amp; Enjoy Windows 7<br />
Jon<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I narrowed it down to a program called "Power Media Player MR"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found it by looking in the App History of the Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was always the 3rd app from the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled it and that annoying problem is now gone.</p>

            <p>You can't. The 128MB is hard wired frame buffer RAM built into the design and cannot be used for any other purpose (hence "dedicated"). The onboard Intel Graphics can call on the system memory as required depending on the video mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The limitations arise from the use of onboard graphics, to get more flexibility you ned a separate graphic interface.</p>

<h2>            Receiving error 80070057 when trying to install Apps from Store</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I try to download and install an app from the Windows Store it errors out after trying to download. I am receiving error code 0x80070057. I am running Windows 10 Pro x64, version 1703 Build 15063.18.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this would have any bearing but I recently had to replace my CPU. I went from an AMD FX6300 to a AMD FX8370. I am not having this problem on my laptop which is running Windows 10 Home x64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried running th Apps Trubleshooter, I have unplugged all external devices, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I am not a novice to mucking about with computers, so if we have to hacking and slashing in the Registry, I am up for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

</p><p>If that does not resolve issues with the Store, try the following:</p>

            <p>I first became aware of it about two weeks ago, before version 1703 was installed. It first came to light when I attempted to install the Hulu and CBS All Access apps from the store. I decided that I would get 1703 installed and see if that would resolve
 the issue, which it did not, and now I have a list of 19 applications that are failing to download. (Status shows "Downloading" and about a minute later it comes back with an error.) Some of the apps that are failing were new to Build 1703</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the Apps Troubleshooter. I had also read that toggle the default save location to another target disk and back to the original location sometimes worked, it did not for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently changed the CPU from an AMD FX6300 to and AMD FX8370.</p>

I ran wsreset.exe as an Admin, but that did not resolve the problem.

            <p>Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your solution resolved <em>most</em> but not all of my problem. The 19 updates that were part of the Creator Update have now installed. However, I am still not able install either the Hulu or CBS apps. It starts to download and then, shortly thereafter,
 it errors out with error 80070057.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest, I was more concerned with getting the apps related to the Creator Update installed. If need be, I could live without the Hulu and CBS apps. Thye were more a matter of convienence than anything else. I liked having them on my notebook and thought
 it would nice to have tem on my desktop unit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, it is not critical that I have them, but if you are willing to pursue this with me, I am willing to do just about anything short hitting with a hammer (having to do a clean install of Windows.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help thus far.</p>

            <p>It looks like I spoke too soon. Today, I went into store and found that it was showing 22 applications pending download. The applications are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>CBS<br />
Hulu<br />
Mail and Calendar<br />
Paint 3D<br />
OneNote<br />
Store<br />
Windows Voice Recorder<br />
MSN News<br />
3D Builder<br />
Xbox<br />
Microsoft Photos<br />
Paid Wi-Fi &amp; Cellular<br />
Sway<br />
Xbox Game Bar<br />
Windows 3D View<br />
Get Office<br />
Feedback Hub<br />
Windows Calculator<br />
MSN Money<br />
MSN Weather<br />
MSN Sports<br />
Windows Camera</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I attempt to have any of these applications re-try, they go to Downloading and then error out with error 80070057, same as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Smacking the computer with a large hammer is becoming a tempting idea. (I know it won't make matters any better but it will make me, momentarily, feel better.)</p>

            Hi Amirraja,
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community and we are glad to assist you on this issue.</div>
<div><br />
As per the query, you are unable to access Windows 8 app store on the computer.</div>
<div>I would request you to answer some questions which are related to this issue:</div>
<div><br />
1) What exactly happens when you try to access app store on the computer?<br />
2) Do you get any error message when you try to access app store? If yes, what is the exact error message that you get?<br />
3) Is there any proxy Internet connection enabled?
<div>&nbsp;<br />
4) Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>Since, you are unable to access the app store, I would suggest you to run app troubleshooter and check if it helps.</div>
<div>You can follow the methods:</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><br />
Please follow the steps to troubleshoot issues with app store:</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>Please refer to the link to perform App troubleshooter on the computer and check if that helps.</div>
<div>Note: Before I provide the steps for app troubleshooter, I would like to let you know about basic information before running an app:</div>
<div>&gt; UAC must be enabled.</div>
<div>You can refer to the link for reference:</div>
<div><strong>What are User Account Control settings?</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-are-uac-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-are-uac-settings</a>
<div>&gt; To snap apps, you need a screen resolution of at least 1366 x 768.<br />
&gt; Requires Microsoft Account.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: The troubleshooter automatically fixes some issues that might prevent your apps from running, including suboptimal screen resolution and incorrect security or account settings.<br />
<br />

<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>If any proxy connection is enabled on the computer, I would suggest you to disable any proxy Internet connection .</div>
<div>You may follow the steps to do so:</div>
<div>a) Open <strong>Internet Explorer </strong>on the desktop.<br />
b) Click on<strong> Tools </strong>icon option on the top right corner.<br />

<div>Please check for the system date and time and make sure that it is up-to-date.</div>
<div>If it is not set correctly, please follow the link to change the date and time:</div>

<div><strong>Method 4:</strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to temporarily disable security software and check it helps to resolve this issue.</div>
<div><strong>Important Note:</strong> Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div><br />
Hope it helps.</div>

<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to get my web cam to work in Skype.&nbsp; (it says on the cam that it is a HD 720p but the skype/pc detects it as a C510, I think.)&nbsp; It worked when I used to for facebook only about 5 days ago.&nbsp; How do I get it to 'come on'?</p>

            I did not resolve the issue as in I did not figure out what the problem was, however, I got on one day shortly after and it came on...just like that. &nbsp;Have no idea if I did something and it didn't work until after I shut down (I do that every nite) or
 what, but it's working now.
