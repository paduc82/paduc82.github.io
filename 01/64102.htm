<h3> blaze0510  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Screen on Taskbar Info Windows&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I had reinstalled Windows 8.1 with the intent of doing a fresh upgrade into Windows 10. Windows 10 failed 4 times at the end of the sequence, so I gave up. Now I've noticed when I click on my items on the task bar, the information area is all black. When
 I reinstalled Windows 8.1, I selected the option for it to sync all my previous settings... Well, I can guarantee this isn't a setting I previously had set up!! The thumbnail view works fine... it's just when you right click on something in the taskbar, that
 window appears black for everything on my taskbar. Is there an option somewhere in Windows that I can change this setting? I've been looking around and am not seeing anything.<br />
<br />
The image below is what it looks like when I right click on File Explorer.<br />

    <title>The latest Xbox Update bricked my console and now it will not turn on. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matt montalvo  say:</h3>
<h2>            The latest Xbox Update bricked my console and now it will not turn on.</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft is requesting that I pay them $179.99 to repair my Xbox after it worked perfectly fine, and functioned perfectly, and then after an update happened, and my console rebooted, it proceeded to not display on my monitor, and the console had a low pitched
 low frequency beep that occurred sequentially every other second, which persisted for about 30 seconds before the console turned off. Any attempts to turn the console back on will have the same thing happen. This is a white, 500GB Xbox One S console, of which
 when it is plugged into power and an HDMI cable is plugged into HDMI Out into a compatible monitor or HDTV, turning the power of the Xbox One S console will make the Xbox Logo glow, the Startup sound will occur, but there will be no incoming signal to the
 display, and the low pitched beeping will occur until the Xbox turns itself off after about 30 seconds. This only occured IMMEDIATELY after rebooting after an Xbox update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to Microsoft's support articles, if anybody is to have an issue with an Xbox not turning on or functioning after an Xbox Update, it is standard procedure for it to be sent in and have a repair scheduled. This apparently costs me $179.99, which
 seeing as it is a discontinued 500GB of an older model of Xbox, is probably the exact value if not more than the console is worth. Furthermore, I am being charged money for a SOFTWARE UPDATE from the manufacturer of the device, which disabled my property.
 As a computer hardware expert and computer and network security specialist, handling electronics and software is nothing new for me, and I handle everything like this extremely professionally, and as a Microsoft Insider and Xbox Insider, I am extremely disappointed
 of how Microsoft is handling this situation. My loyalty to Microsoft is being stabbed in the back by an update that seems to only affect my console, and I'd like to know why. Was this a targeted attack on my own console by Microsoft? Was it hacked? Was there
 no real update and somebody forced a false update that bricked my console?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference, my console did NOT have the latest Insider update, and had whatever current stable normal update is out, to my knowledge. I use my Xbox on the same monitor as my computer, and after turning off my computer, my display changed to my Xbox, which
 was on, and the screen said that my Xbox was ready for an update. The update was installed, my console turned off, and never was able to turn back on, and cannot turn back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My Xbox One S console had an update, rebooted, and now cannot turn on again; how do I fix this?</strong> Any options that do not require me paying money would be excellent, as I just lost my job recently and do not have the money to afford repairing
 a console that should be functioning perfectly. It is a machine, programmed to work a specific way, and do a specific function, which it is not. It is not my job to fix it, and is not my job to be the hardware specialist that should be determining the cause
 of the problem, so this is extremely aggravating for me. I do not have the money, time, or resources to do my own repair, or investigate the issue myself, but am willing to do whatever anybody else that is more knowledgeable than me is telling me I should
 do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not the expert here for this job. Cybersecurity and Network Security are my specialty, not video game hardware. Please, if anybody can tell me what I can do to fix this that would be excellent. I would love to play some Halo in my spare time, as it
 is one of my only portals to a long lost childhood of happiness that I can escape to whenever I feel like it, and as it stands, Xbox is currently the only way to enjoy Halo, due to PC's long delay for it to come out on PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anybody needs any more information that may help with the solution for this problem, I am more than happy to provide it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for reading this and thank you everybody for your cooperation, understanding, and time.</p>
<p>-Matt</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I lock my computer I like to have the lock screen stay on my monitor so it shows the background and time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I lock my PC, it will show the lock screen, then about one or two minutes later my monitor will show a message saying that there is no signal from my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my power settings I have my monitor set to turn off after 30 minutes so I'm not sure why this is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated! =)</p>

<p>1. Custom built computer. Motherboard is Gigabyte GA-B85M-D3H, graphics card is XFX Radeon R7 265 2GB</p>
<p>2. Yes, pressing a key shows the lock screen again.</p>
<p>3. Yes, I recently updated my display driver.</p>
<p>4. No, I haven't tested any other monitors to see if the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using an HDMI cable that is working fine, graphics card driver should be up to date, as well as display driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think the display driver is the issue but if nothing else works I'll try re-installing the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more thing: My power saving options are working correctly in the sense that my display turns off after 30 minutes, EXCEPT on the lock screen where it seems to turn off after 1 minute.</p>

            Sharief it is Movie Maker by Microsoft.&nbsp; I thought it was part of Windows 7 or is it part of Office Pro?&nbsp;I am making a music video with Movie Maker.&nbsp; When it gets to the end and the credits scroll, they fly by way too fast, and it is jerky.&nbsp; What I want
 to do is slow the scroll down and smooth it out.

<p>Thanks for the answer but the duration of the text does not change the speed of the scrolling. However I found that changing the speed of the frame makes the difference.</p>
<p>Instructions: Double click on the frame of the credits. Under Video Tools, Duration, change the duration to 30.00 or less according to your needs.</p>

            Hi Myzrenee 
<br />
<br />Click start - and type "control panel" from there - open devices and printers. Double click your printer. You should now have a white box with print jobs in it. Highlight them and right click and cancel. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps!
<br />- C

            Open the Services window (Windows key + R, type services.msc, press enter).
<br />        Select Print Spooler and click the Stop icon, if it is not stopped already.
<br />        Navigate to C:\Windows\system32\spool\PRINTERS and open this file. You may need to show hidden files or enter an administrator's password.
<br />        Delete all contents inside the folder. Do not delete the PRINTERS folder itself. Note that this will remove all current print jobs, so make sure no one on your network is using the printer.
<br />        Return to the Services window, select Print Spooler, and click Start.

<h2>            Free Beta T-Shirt</h2>
                    
<p>HI Guys,</p>

<p>I am part of the Beta for Xbox Live. I was sent a message to claim a free beta T-Shirt for my avatar.</p>
<p><br />
When I clicked to claim the T-Shirt through XCL and Loot it stated my avatar was the wrong gender and would I like to share it with someone with the right gender. I closed the boxed and tried to claim again.... this time I was told the code had been redeemed
 but I do not have the T-Shirt in my avatar customisation.</p>
<p>I have a male avatar...... Can someone please assist with me this so I can claim and wear my free T-Shirt?</p>
<p>Greg</p>

<p>Slt à tous les gamers,</p>
<p>J'ai mon casque filaire (fourni à l'achat avec le pack console xbox 360 250 GO) qui est tombé "en panne". Le micro fonctionne mais le son via les écouteurs du casque non. J'ai branché un nouveau casque xbox et là tout est ok.</p>
<p>J'ai appelé le S.A.V. qui m'a dit que je devais leur envoyer l'accessoire (à mes frais !!!!) et dès réception du colis, ils enverraient un nouveau casque. La personne à l'autre bout du fil m'envoie par mail l'adresse du destinataire et ohhhhhhhhh !!!!! surprise
 je dois envoyer le tout...... en REPUBLIQUE TCHEQUE.</p>
<p>Ma question est la suivante : quelqu'un a-t il déjà eu recours a un renvoie d'un accessoire chez xbox ? Si oui, était-ce aussi dans ce pays ?</p>
<p>VIVE LA FRANCE ;-)))))</p>

<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>???? c'est quoi ce délire ???</p>
<p>Merci de me communiquer l'adresse mail de la personne qui vas t'envoyer ce mail ...</p>
<p>Pour information mais cela à peut être changer depuis mon départ ...</p>
<p>La procédure du SAV est toute autre concernant les périphériques !!!</p>
<p>déjà pour un casque cassé on en envois un neuf à nos frais, au début nous ne demandions même pas le renvois de l'ancien pour vérifier les informations on faisait confiance !!!</p>
<p>certains ayant abusé de ce service, nous avons effectivement demandé de nous renvoyer le casque mais pas à tes frais !!!</p>
<p>de la même façon que le renvoi de la console est pris en charge par UPS, les périphériques défectueux le sont aussi ... enfin manifestement l'été !!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Une fois que tu m'aura envoyé le mail de cette personne, je remonterai l'information dans les services car je trouve cela totalement anormal de te faire envoyer un clois en Tchéquie alors que tu es dans un autre pay ...</p>
<p>en revanche je confirme bien que le SAV est traité par la Tchéquie concernant certaines réparations.</p>

<p>Si tu pouvais te renseigner sur mon sujet et me faire part de tes réponses se serait vraiment super cooooooool. D'envoyer mon casque en Tchéquie ne me dérange pas, ce qui me chagrine ceux sont les frais d'envois qui, apparemment, sont à ma charge. Je trouve

<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>Ce mail est un mail type mais qui à été modifié ... pour quelle raison je ne comprend pas mais je vais remonté l'info sufisament haut pour avoir des réponses.</p>
<p>La procédure est en fait tout autre ...</p>
<p>par contre ce n'est pas du contenu du mail dont j'ai besoin mais de l'adresse mail d'envois ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>met moi juste par MP le mail du correspondant xbox qui à traité ton dossier ... fait le par MP pour ne pas déranger les autres forumeurs et en plus ton post ferai certainement l'objet d'un "EDIT BY MOD" car il n'est pas autorisé de citer ou donner certaines
 adresse</p>

<p>Salut,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MP veut dire Message Privé (Private Message en anglais). Il te suffit de cliquer sur la petite enveloppe qui se trouve en bas du dernier message de o Master o Drk. Tu pourra alors commencer une conversation privée qui ne sera visible et lu que par toi et
 Mister Master.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quant à la mention "edit by mod" ou "editer par un modérateur" en français, elle est utilisé par l'équipe de modération pour supprimer une adresse mail ou l'url d'un site frauduleux par exemple. L'élément supprimé sera alors remplacé par la mention "edit
 par un modérateur".</p>

<p>C'est normal ! Le service de réparation de Microsoft est en république-tchèque , il faut que tu les contacte --&gt; 0800 91 52 74</p>
<p>il te diront la démarche mais ATTENTION n'envoie rien par la poste , ton colis sera perdu , J'ai perdu une console et je n'ai jamais été remboursé par la poste &nbsp;, Microsoft recommande et je conseille que tu envoie tout tes colis via UPS , c'est mieux</p>

<p>This is the message I get every time I try to download this game. The download gets to 99% and then says&nbsp;"Can't Download Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas." &nbsp;The game also shows as corrupt on my hard drive. I've been through all of the troubleshooting steps
 several times with Xbox support. I'm not sure if it is a region problem because I recently moved to the USA from Canada and purchased a new console here.</p>
<p>Here are the conversation logs if it helps any.</p>

How are you?<br /><br />Kim M: I'm doing great, thanks for asking!<br /><br />Kim M: I see you are having some issues with a pre paid code, is that correct?<br /><br />you: Yes. But I got that resolved.<br /><br />Kim M: I'm glad to hear you got that issue resolved! Do you have another issue I can help you with today?<br /><br />you: Yes. I thought I put it in the issue box before I started the chat.<br /><br />you: I typed quite a bit.<br /><br />Kim M: I'm sorry, but it looks like the issue didn't come into the chat properly, would you mind telling me a little about what's happening?<br /><br />you: Sure<br /

You are now chatting with 'Jodi'.</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Hi</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Thank you for contacting Xbox Customer Support, my name is Jodi, how are you doing today?</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>great and you?</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Good thank you</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>So you are getting to 99% of your download?</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Yes and then it says</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>"Can't download"</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>in a notification at the bottom of the screen</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Ok thank you, one moment please</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Are you logged in at xbox.com</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Not anymore</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>the last agent was having problems with verifying it was my account</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>He gave me a login link several times but it wouldnt show up for him</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>I am as well, thats why I was wondering</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Anyhow, lets see what we can do without your information</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Ok</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Are you downloading from the Marketplace or a disk?</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Market place</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>it is in the games on demand section</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Ok thank you</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>its an xbox original title</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>On the Xbox dashboard, go to: Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage&gt;hard drive, then you will go into each folder and look for a yellow circle with a exclamation mark in it. If you see any delete it.
 If you have deleted any, back out to the dashboard again and restart the console.</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Ok do you have the large hard drive?</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Well</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>it is the original hard drive</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>I believe it is 20gb</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>I have 9.9 gb free though</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>I deleted the corrupted game already</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Ok great</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Let’s clear the system cache and the Marketplace System Data file. &nbsp;On the Xbox dashboard, go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage &gt; highlight the Hard Drive, *do not go into the Hard Drive, and
 press the "Y" button. &nbsp;Select, "Clear System Cache." When the next window pops up, select "YES." &nbsp;Let’s do this step two times.</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Once you have done that we are going to select the Hard Drive and go to the “System Items folder.” &nbsp;Select the file that reads “Marketplace System Data” and delete that from the Hard Drive.
 Then restart the console. &nbsp;Please let me know once you have restarted the console.</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Ok done</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Console is restarted.</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>OK good</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Sign in to Xbox LIVE by using the gamer profile that originally downloaded the content.</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>In the Xbox 360 Dashboard, go to the Settings hub, and select Account.</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Select Download History.</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Select the content item, and then select Download Again to download the item.</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Repeat step 5 for each item in your download history that you want to recover.</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>The download might take a bit since it is about 3gb.</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>downloading now</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Ok thank you</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>It looks like it's going to take around 30 mins at this rate.</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>I have a theory to why this might not be working</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>My account is Canadian and I recently moved to the USA and purchased a new console here.</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Could that have anything to do with it?</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Oh that certainly can have something to do with it, it may be pulling from a different region</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>However we can not migrate the account, you would have to create a new one</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>I would go ahead and let this go through and see if it will download, if it doesnt then contact us back however if it is a migration issue we can not change it over</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>ok</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>This is like the 5th time I've downloaded though.</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>It's only at 5%</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>If it is a region issue, is there anything that can be done about it?</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>No the region can not be changed unfortunately</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Is there anyway I can be reimbursed on another account I make then? All of my Downloadable content is pretty much a waste...</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>You can still play the content, you just won't be able to download anything else</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>I know this is frustrating as well</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>What do you mean?</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>It won't let me play this.</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>You can play things you have already purchased, you just won't be able to download anything new.</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Yes but I can't play this Grand Theft Auto game that I have purchased so that must not be true.</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>The one you just purchased now? That would be correct because it is not the correct region but anything prior you should have no problem with</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>I didn't purchase it right now</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>I purchased it months ago.</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Before I moved.</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Was it ever downloaded completely?</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Yes</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>If it was prior then it may be another issue</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>On an old console</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Ok thank hyou</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>but</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>I license transferred to this console</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Right but if you sign into the profile that purchased it, it will show in your download history</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Yes.</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>So it should be ok</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>What do you mean?</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>It should download then if it was a prior purchase</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>the region issue would be for new purchases</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>But this is an old purchase.</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>and it isn't working.</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>If it isn't downloading all of the way it may be another issue, please let me see what else it may be, one moment please</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Sure.</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Thank you</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>You had a corrupt file before correct?</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Yes</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>everytime I download it</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>That is what I am finding causing it to stop at 99%</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>eys</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Ok</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>yes*</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>it shows it as a 40kb file on my harddrive</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>even though it is aprox. 3gb</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>OK so it must be something corrupted in the download file itself</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>This is not a region so that is good however it may be a corrupt file in the download itself</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>ok</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>What percent is the download at?</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>let me check</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>ok</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>only 19</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>I doubt it will be any different this time</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>I've done these steps 3 times</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Ok go ahead and let this finish, crossing fingers for it to work, and then if it doesn't we need to have you log into the forums and report this download not working and get help from our support
 there as to what the next step could be.</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>Have you deleted the corrupt file every time?</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>yes</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>I check every single time</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>and it was always a 40kb file</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>with the corrupt symbol next to it.</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Is there anyway I can get reimbursed to be able to purchase it on a new account?</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>because I'd rather get this resolved sooner than later</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>I know that would be the easiest way however we would need this looked into to see what is going on with the download</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>Well how long could it take to get resolved?</p>
<p><span>Jodi:&nbsp;</span>The forums respond within 24 hours so you could post now while you are waiting for the download to finish</p>
<p><span>count:&nbsp;</span>how do I get there?</p>

<p>some stuff is region locked meaning you have to have your account location, console location, and physical region to all match or you cannot downloaded it. &nbsp;so it sounds like even though you are in the USA and have a USA console your account is still a Canada
 one, and sadly you cannot change the region of the account once it is set. &nbsp;your only option is to create a USA account and try again.</p>

<p>The following was provided from URC:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This most likely means you downloaded the 64-bit version but are running a 32-bit operating system or vice versa. Check to see if your OS is 32 or 64 bit. There is a WMDC 32 and 64 bit version so you must download the appropriate version.</span></p>

            <p>I have had no problems with 4 PCs so far but the one with a bluetooth keyboard and mouse kept failing. After disconnecting the bluetooth receiver and retrying it went through on the second attempt. Reconnecting the bluetooth receiver afterwards has reconnected
 the keyboard and mouse with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be worth disconnecting any bluetooth devices and seeing how you get on. Good luck.</p>

            One Drive has been reported in the past as the reason KB installs fail. Of course, that may be wrong, however; some reported that it solved the problem, especially when connecting to Microsoft servers.

<p>
</p><p>You have to retain a healthy degree of scepticism when you read such reports. Many problems probably arise out of multi-tasking. Microsoft say you can run Windows Update in the background but if you are using resources at critical times, the processing of
 a large update can stop and then go wrong. Using OneDrive when updating is in progress will take resources. When an update goes wrong is it OneDrive or multi-tasking the cause?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will see advice about turning off anti-virus software when large updates are in progress. The same point do not multi-task in these situations.</p>

            Why should he?? I don't use One Drive either! Gerry,..I've seen a lot of your comments and all you do is copy and past the typical text book Microsoft answers. You are of no help whatsoever. You never come up with any solutions of your own to help people.
 Just saying.

<h3> edsncardenas  say:</h3>
<h2>            My notebook&#40;emachines D732 Core i3 2.5Ghz&#41; is quite slow in booting compared to my other laptop&#40;Lenovo G460 Intel P6000&#41;. How do I fasten the boot of my emachines&#63;</h2>
                    I have an emachines notebook with windows 7 ultimate installed. My laptop's screen dims when it's background windows/application is dark and then automatically brightens back to normal when the applications/backgrounds are light. And there are times when
 I shut down my laptop, it flickers a bit. It's also quite slow when booting especially when on the welcome screen(my notebook has a core i3 2.53Ghz CPU) compared to my other laptop(lenovo G460 Intel P6000). What do you think is the problem? - my laptop has
 only been bought this week. Should I reformat it?
