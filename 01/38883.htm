<h2>            Skype Home Button</h2>
                    <p>Greetings, Skype community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Older versions of Skype had a home button. This is discreetly useful because it prevents accidentally sending messages. I can't find the Home button on Skype 8.34.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. Thanks so much.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/6d317928-3e15-43ce-b3ee-b9c93dff4a54" title="Christian__R">
<p>
</p><p>This Skype Home Button was not yet on the latest Skype. You have a point and that is something that we need to consider. In this case, I suggest you to post your concern to our UserVoice where you can directly connect with the developers. This is where the
 Skype users can post suggestions and comments about the Skype app that can surely help or improve performance and its functionality. To proceed, just open this link:

<p>I would say, report people for verbal abuse and system tampering, BUT I never report people that have strange file share names, now for Clan Tags I would report that because its clearly visible and offensive...</p>
<p>If you feel generally offended then report, but if you don't, then there is no point reporting...</p>
<p>All reports do get looked at, it may take a while due to the amount of people on XBL but it does get checked.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work as no one likes racism or cheaters... </p>

<p>Hey there gamerXpress,</p>
<p>Like brandiesel1 said, you can file a complaint for offensive messages. To do so, you will have to view the other gamer's profile and scroll all the way down and select "File Complaint". From there select the correct offensive and complete the steps required.
 The correct section for "boosting lobbies" is cheating or encouraging other to cheat. As for clan tags and maps, you should file a complaint on the author of said map. Not 100% sure about the re-uploader.</p>
<p>If it is in violation of the Xbox LIVE TOU then you should file a complaint against the user and if the user is constantly sending you messages you can opt to block communications.

 is against their Terms of Use. </span></p>

<p>[/quote]&nbsp;When playing Modern warfare 3 in the game lobby I notice if you hover over someone's name and press the A button you can report them in game which is the best option because the company who made the game can give out &nbsp;suitable punishments and deal
 with the problem</p>
<p>I haven't played halo 3 but if you can hover over someone's name and report them in-game do it and if not file complaint them to the nearest option then an xbox live enforcement will investigate within 24 hours. If you would like any other information regarding
 this feel free to send me a message or reply to the post! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Error 1606 Could not access Network Location ... Tried all posted fixes I can find</h2>
                    <p>Java/Adobe/etc installs end up with a 1606. I have xp home, sp3 most updates are applied. I had a 'real time' trying to get rid of the JAVA that was installed, but with IOBIT,DOS commands, CCleaner, JavaRa, and Revo it seems that I have gotten rid of most
 of it.&nbsp; I still have the entry if I pull up "Add/Remove' Pgms off the Control Panel but there is NOTHING to the right of it. Just an empty space, no 'Size" or 'Remove" or anything. Just white space.</p>
<p>I have run all of the kb's, checked every registry key I've seen mentioned, run the auto fix items and done the manual ones.</p>
<p>I still cannot load JAVA either online or offline.&nbsp; I also tried disconnecting from the web with the downloaded offline version and got nowhere.</p>
<p>I have rebooted at least 25 times by now and even tried a different destination folder - all no NO avail.</p>
<p>I have deleted an extra "Office" key ( had a 9 and 14) and looked at the default user reg key.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nope".</p>
<p>I am slowly becoming&nbsp;&nbsp;"D<span>isillusioned" and have run out of ideas - say one.</span></p>
<p><span>I've spent about 16 hours on this and could use some ones, anyones, help.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks in advance to anyone with an idea.</span></p>

<p>advice for these two not installing</p>
<p>I am not familiar with all the checkers you listed.</p>
<p>Do you only have ONE antivirus?</p>
<p>Only one running in real time?</p>
<p>MBAM and SAS you can run on demand.</p>
<p>If your security system is not starting automatically, then you have a problem,</p>
<p>either conflicting with another program or you are still infected.</p>

For any Other People that Might read this novel, I also tried adding a new Admin User Account and ‘sneaking’ in under that guise............&nbsp; Did Not work either.&nbsp; I deleted the new user after that.<br />
<br />
CENTURYLINK SOFTWARE&nbsp;&nbsp; is my DSL provider security software, plus their ANTI-Everything software that runs on the server for email and such even before it gets to me.<br />
It all starts automaticly at startup/restart time. <br />
F-Secure is what’s underneath the covers ( F-Secure pgms at startup: FSM32.EXE, FSAV32E.EXE, FSDFWD.EXE, FSORSP.EXE, FSSM32.EXE, FSHDLL32.EXE, FSGK32.EXE, FSMA32.EXE, FSG32ST.EXE )
<br />
I run a virus &amp; spyware realtime scanner on web traffic &amp; emails, I block tracking cookies, I use something called Deepguard for added protection, the firewall is set to ‘Normal’ (pre-canned choices), I have Application control for inbound and outbound set
 up, Intrusion protection is on, real time Browsing protection is on,&nbsp; and Email Filtering is on. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have run registry cleaners and IOBIT Defrag and backed up everything that is System Oriented.<br />
<br />
I also went to my D Drive and deleted all the Java bkups ( I occasionally store Key pgms for comparisons when I get a virus or such and for possible restore point times)<br />
<br />
<br />
I followed your lead for the manual download of the KB’s ( http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=13631 &amp; http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=14623&amp;ppud=4) and was promptly met with another
 1606 error;<br />
So,,,,,&nbsp; I went straight on to the Microsoft Safety Scanner site you provided a link to;&nbsp; downloaded and ran it.<br />
Security Essentials found 10 errors and removed 8 1/2 of them, along with sending in a report to MS about the Java errors that were the main offenders. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I ran Malwarebytes again and also the Msert.exe program again.<br />
Malwarebytes found Nothing and Msert.exe found the one and a “Partial” again but did not remove them.<br />
<br />
They are:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Program:Win32/PowerRegScheduler&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partially Removed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Exploit:Java/CVE-2012-0507.D!ldr &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Detected,&nbsp; Not Removed<br />
<br />
I Went to the Latest Updates Page and downloaded the 32bit XP ones.<br />
I then Downloaded the Malicious Software Removal Tool<br />
<br />
** I am confused with something at this point; Is the “Scanner” that I downloaded earlier and that will Self Destruct in 10 days and it’s accompanying companion program the same as the Malicious Software Removal Tool pgm?????? &nbsp;<br />
One seemed to be Msert and the other Mrt with a 'stub’ when I looked at Task Manager.
<br />
AND (if they ARE different pgms)&nbsp; “Who uses the newly downloaded updates?”. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Malicious Software Removal Tool came back with “No Malicious Software Was Detected”.<br />
Reran Msert same thing, found them and did not remove them<br />
<br />
Over the next 24 hours I have run<br />
Removeitpro,&nbsp; CCleaner, Superantispy, JavRa, Uninstaller, MalwareBytes,&nbsp; Ole Reg Cleaner, Tweaknow Reg Ccleaner, F-Secure, IOBit Malware fighter, Tdsskiller, Revo Uninstaller, MS Malicious Sftwr pgm,&nbsp; and Windows Installer Cleanup (This got rid of the Entry
 JAVA7 TM&nbsp; that had no size or anything in the “Add/Remove” section in the Control Table, I was wondering what I was going to do about that).<br />
<br />
I have Deleted anything with ‘Java’ in it from Windows, my backups, and anywhere I could find the word or any Hint of it stand alone. I did not pull it out from under Adobe or things like that.<br />
<br />
I have taken an Innumerable amount of backups and system checkpoints along the way.<br />
<br />
All Right, I’ve done a lot of work, but am not gaining much of a head of steam to drive this thing.<br />
Back to basics.&nbsp; Start it all over again.<br />
(The instructions i am using can be found at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/886549)<br />
<br />
<br />
Reran the “Let Us Fix It’ routine.&nbsp;&nbsp; No Help.<br />
Open Registry and reexamine the ‘Value data’.<br />
It all looked good but I deleted and readded one that I only had the ... to see and not the rest of the real word.<br />
Did a ‘Head Count’ and ‘Whad-a-ya-kno’.&nbsp; I am missing an entire Key.&nbsp; “Recent’.<br />
The ‘Let me fix it routine’&nbsp; must be as bad a counter as I am.<br />
Added the key and removed the ‘New’ under the Value Name, rebooted and tried to offline load Java.<br />
<br />
It worked!!!<br />
<br />
I noticed that many of the same style errors (1606) were Office related in some ways. I went to work on that also and found many old keys and junk from several Office sets, OpenSource&nbsp; and Libre.<br />
Deleted all of it.&nbsp; Cleaned it up and ran a dozen registry iterations with 3 different pgms and ran multiple virus pgm runs alternating back and forth between them.<br />
Downloaded a fresh copy.<br />
I have a lot better set of Office tools (and faster) now but didn’t improve anything towards my 1606.<br />
<br />
The15 virus/malware/registry pgms would all find somethnig to get rid of and after a while I would do a registry run and delete most of those (no more than 100 at a time - I am paranoid) and then more virus/malware items would trun up and so on and so on -
 as many as 400 at one time. I was getting a little worried about the situation but it calmed down.<br />
All in All, I probably deleted over 1,000 registry entries during my cleanup massacre of Java and various Office Systems.<br />
<br />
I tried to Install KB 973688 and KB 954430 again - this along with Java is where I started.
<br />
They failed all 6 times (looking for consistency)&nbsp;&nbsp; ( I even turned off my Firewall and protection programs ).<br />
<br />
Oh, Did I mention that It was the Main Installer with a 1606 error....<br />
Event Log turned up an 0x80070643 code for them also will look at that after pursuing my current path..
<br />
<br />
Back to the Registry.&nbsp; The next step was to look under the Local Machine key.<br />
I noticed that the last entry is Common templates --- with a small 't’ and a capital 'T’ in the value data area.<br />
Mine has a capital 'T’ in both. <br />
Backed up&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; modified the registry and reran.<br />
Same error.<br />
<br />
Next -&nbsp; Modified the Local Machine key ( \software\microsoft\office) by removing a value with a ‘9‘ init (offioce 2000).&nbsp; (The instructions i am using can be found at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/886549)<br />
Rebooted and tried the install again -&nbsp; It Failed.<br />
<br />
I am looking at Article ID: 976982 Microsoft Fix it 50123 and will try and run the Auto Fixes provided there.<br />
Ran the Fix, but have quit at this point for the day. Further updates as I try things.<br />
I have tried most of the 'Fix' style and updates with and without security measures on.<br />
I appreiciate your help, please let me know what I can try next, I'm running out of ideas.<br />

            <p>One of the tips I recieved:</p>
<p>F-Secure has its own firewall, which might be conflicting with Windows firewall.</p>
<p>you can only have one firewall at a time, and only one realtime antivirus at one time. I run MSE in real time, MBAM and SAS on demand. MRT in installed every month and runs in background through automatic updates. I believe that MSERT is for problems that
 would not be detected by MRT. </p>
<p>Please boot your computer into clean mode:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a></p>
<p>see if you can install while in this state. Also while in this state run this scan from ESET, they advise to turn off any realtime scanners while their scan is running.</p>

Looking at Article ID: 976982 Microsoft Fix it 50123 and will try and run the Auto Fixes provided there.<br />
<br />
Ran the Fix, And Ran the E-Set Virus Checker you suggested (turned up nothing - 0) and rebooted.<br />
Got my usual 1606 when trying to install the manual Updates (KB954430 &amp; KB973688) .<br />
<br />
“Yes” F-Secure does have its own Firewall, I can’t copy anything to show you off of the Windows Firewall Icon in Control panel, but it has all kinds of ‘Nasty Red Stuff’ telling me that I’m not protected and shouldn’t be so foolish.<br />
In a nice way of course.<br />
I Use F-Secure Soley. No other Anti-Anything is running or Firewall.<br />
When I try many of the runs after performing or executing a fix, I turn off browsing and then ‘Unload’ F-Secure and try again. I hit each fix several times with different variations of security on or not at all.<br />
<br />
Found and ran something called MS Update component ‘Fix It’ routine floating around out there.<br />
&nbsp;It came back with ‘No Problems in need of repair’.&nbsp; Oh well.<br />
<br />
I will look at the other sites, get your error message and read about a ‘Clean’ boot and try that.<br />
It might be Friday before I can get you some good news or just answers.<br />
Thanks again,<br />

I saw the link http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315352 you suggested, I found that one a few days ago and looked into it, even though I knew I hadn’t taken that path of upgrades. Didn’t help.<br />
<br />
I have used up all the suggestions on the link&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/886549 as well. &nbsp;<br />
This got Java loaded for me by adding the “Recent” key that didn’t exist before.<br />
The other changes in it that I made had NO affect (little “t” for big “T” on Templates key).<br />

That’s as far as I could get time to go Elizabeth; not because I don’t want to or have a downgraded opinion of the importance to my PC life and security, I just have a few medical issues around here of late and my attention has to be to my ‘Better Half’ regardless
 of my other plans. Please bear with me and don’t quit checking back.<br />
I will get more done and posted.<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
In transferring your license you should determine if your Windows 10 license can be transferred or not. To find out what type of license you have installed, check the following:<br />
<br />
• If you upgraded from a retail copy of Windows 7, Windows 8 or 8.1, the Windows 10 license carries the retail rights from which it was derived – can be transferred. But under Microsoft’s rules, you are only entitled to a one time transfer.<br />
<br />
• If you upgraded from an OEM Windows 7, Windows 8 or 8.1 license, these are licenses that come preinstalled on a new computer from a manufacturer, and then your Windows 10 license maintains the OEM rights – cannot be transferred.<br />
<br />
• If you have a full retail copy of Windows 10, you can transfer it as many times as you want.<br />
<br />
• If you performed an Easy Upgrade to the Windows 10 Pro Pack from Windows 10 Home, you can transfer it using Digital Licensing. This is possible because of the Pro Pack, while an upgrade, is a retail license attached to the Microsoft Account used to purchase
 it.<br />
<br />
To move a full Windows 10 license, or the free upgrade from a retail version of Windows 7 or 8.1, the license can no longer be in active use on a PC. Windows 10 does not have a deactivation option. Instead, you have two choices:<br />
<br />
• Uninstall the product key – this is the closest to deactivating the Windows License. This method does not inform Microsoft Activation Servers the license is no longer in use on the machine; instead, it will avoid conflicts down the road if Microsoft Activation
 Servers were to detect the license in use on more than one system.<br />
<br />
• Format the computer – this method ensures the license is no longer in use on the computer. You can use the convenient Reset option in Windows 10 do this.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further help.

<p>It depends on the license you purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Full version (Retail):</span></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>OEM :</span></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What happens if I change my motherboard?</span></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<span>OEM license&nbsp;</span>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase
 a full retail Windows 10 license.&nbsp;<span>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.</span></p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if you want to be able to transfer to another computer or motherboard, the full retail license is recommended.</p>

    <title>My blu-ray burner isn&#39;t working anymore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aeromonk  say:</h3>
<h2>            My blu-ray burner isn&#39;t working anymore</h2>
                    <p>This is going to be a long post, forgive me.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For some unknown reason, I can no longer burn onto blu-ray discs. I've never had trouble before in the last two years, in which I've burned dozens of discs all without a single problem. Now as soon as the burn progress meter gets
 to 20 percent (within 5 mins), the disc ejects and I receive the following error message:
<br />
<strong>"could not format disc (EB191784)"</strong> <br />
<br />
My burning software is "CyberLink Media Suite 11 Ultra", for which I'm well versed in its use. The program I use to burn the disc is "PowerProducer v6". The type of disc I use is the 25GB Verbatim BD-R, which is what I've always used.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Here are the following steps I've taken to troubleshoot this problem:</strong>
<br />
<br />
1) I downloaded and installed new firmware for my blu-ray drive. It was version "BWU-500S 2.63" from the Sony website.
<br />
<br />
2) Completely uninstalled all of the Cyberlink software, then reinstalled everything. Then I went through each of its programs and made sure they were up-to-date and that they didn't need a patch update.
<br />
<br />
3) After reading various help forums I discovered that my C:/ drive requires plenty of space on it in order to burn a blu-ray disc, so I made sure that there's at least 130GB. They also said the same thing for the drive in which the input file is coming from,
 which happens to be my E:/ drive - and it has 320GB. <br />
<br />
4) I've tried 4 different discs to no avail and I've never had a bad disc before, so I doubt I'd have 4 in a row.
<br />
<br />
5) I also updated the driver on my graphics card, which is EVGA GeForce GTX 560 Ti
<br />
<br />
6) I have done a clean boot <br />
<br />
7) I have Defraged my computer <br />
<br />
8) I also tried burning 3 different blu-ray movies, just to make sure that this wasn't all caused by 1 corrupted blu-ray movie.
<br />
<br />
Note: <br />
The weird thing is that my blu-ray drive does burn DVD's without a single problem - it just won't let me burn blu-ray discs anymore.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>So, after doing all of the above, I was told that I should try a different burning program - just to make sure it wasn't "PowerProducer". So I tried to use ImgBurn. But I received this error message:<br />
"</span>Device Not Ready (No Reference Position Found)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I looked at the logfile and here's what it said: <span>
<br />
</span>I 01:48:24 ImgBurn Version 2.5.8.0 started!<br />
I 01:48:24 Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium x64 Edition (6.1, Build 7601 : Service Pack 1)<br />
I 01:48:24 Total Physical Memory: 12,573,880 KiB&nbsp; -&nbsp; Available: 6,415,580 KiB<br />
<strong>W 01:48:24 Duplex Secure's SPTD driver can have a detrimental effect on drive performance.</strong><br />
I 01:48:24 Initialising SPTI...<br />
I 01:48:24 Searching for SCSI / ATAPI devices...<br />
I 01:48:24 -&gt; Drive 1 - Info: SONY BD RW BWU-500S 2.63 (D:) (ATA)<br />
I 01:48:24 Found 1 BD-RE!<span><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The "</span>Duplex Secure's SPTD driver..." <span>
line is what stood out to me. So I checked on it further and discovered that I had an older version (v1.74), so I installed its newest version (v1.86). Well none of that fixed my burning problem.
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>It just seems like my blu-ray discs won't Initialize , but I don't know why!!!</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On a side note, I noticed one very strange thing - but I know for a fact that this happened AFTER my burning problem began. So I know it didn't cause the problem, but I think it's another symptom.
</span></p>
<p><span>In my Device Manager -&gt; under "DVD/CD-ROM drives -&gt; it lists one thing "CD-ROM Drive"</span></p>
<p><span>But that's wrong, it has ALWAYS been listed as "</span>SONY BD RW BWU-500S 2.63"</p>
<p><span>I think it changed when I was uninstalling/reinstalling all of that "Cyberlink Media Suite 11 Programs", but I can't get my blu-ray player name to reappear - it just keeps displaying that generic
</span><span>"CD-ROM Drive" name. Here's a screencap of what I'm talking about:</span></p>

            when saying&nbsp;<span>“</span><span>how to make the screen keyboard to have only letters, not letters, signs and other marks, on the same button”, then i want to ask if there are options to have different themes for the keyboard. I am asking
 because the new key board is not good at all compared to the one i had at windows 8.1; i have to press the button twice to write, like if i want to type the letter R from the windows keyboard, i have to hit the letter twice. Thus i thought the presence of
 other marks, e.g. the brackets, dots, star...etc, combined with the letters is the cause. The problem is much more bad when i invert the keyboard to use another language letters. In btw thanks for the first reply it helped to a great extent!!</span>

            <p>I'm not sure about Windows 7, but Windows 8 has an alert if the task is missed 3 consecutive times.&nbsp; This is a notification directly from the disk defragmenter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I'm sure you could look at the System Event Viewer, filtered to defrag events, and see when they all ran.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I will say that this is largely a design philosophy.&nbsp; The user is only alerted when there is a problem. When you start your car, you don't get a list of all the pumps that successfully engaged. You only get warned when there is a problem, and the rest of
 the time you can just use the machine (the car or your PC) without interruption.</p>

<h2>            Skype to go conversation</h2>
                    I've now had Skype to go for many years. Lately, when I call overseas, Skype to go cuts off the receiver, and on my end the conversation keeps repeating itself as if it's &nbsp;a tape recorder. It's impossible to get hold of Skype support. I'm hoping through
 this conversation someone will be able to help me out. I am truly disgusted with Skype.&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi Austin,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue could because of incompatible touchpad drivers on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us troubleshoot on this issue by reinstalling the drivers for touchpad and check the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>Un-install and re-install touch pad drivers from the manufacturer’s website and see if that helps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<br />
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Type
<strong>device manager </strong>search box and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. Right click on the touchpad drivers and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c.&nbsp;Restart the computer once it is uninstalled.</span></p>
<p><span>Download and install the latest touchpad drivers for from manufacturer’s website in compatibility mode. Since drivers are not available for
 Windows 10 you can install the available drivers on manufacturer website in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps below on how to install driver in compatibility mode:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Download
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">the&nbsp;driver from the manufacturer’s website and save it on your local disk.</span></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">on&nbsp;the setup file of the driver and select “<strong>Properties</strong>”.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select “<strong>Compatibility</strong>” Tab.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Place a
<strong>check mark </strong>next to “<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>” and
<strong>select operating system</strong> from the&nbsp;drop down list.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let the driver install and then check the&nbsp;functionality.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Let us know the result. If you have further queries, we will be happy to help.</span><span>&nbsp;

    <title>Links to a remote desktop not working when posted on website - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Links to a remote desktop not working when posted on website</h2>
                    <p>So for the past couple days I have been working on this issue. I have created an excel document that contains links to files on a remote desktop. These links work perfectly when you have the excel file and you click on the links. When the file is saved as
 an .htm file and you open it up, again it works perfectly. Now, when you upload this .htm file to the actual webpage and click on the links, the links no longer work. Any links such as "www.google.com" will work, but links such as =HYPERLINK("Y:\Common\","Link")
 does not work. &nbsp;When you place your cursor over the link, however, it will show the correct directory, but it will open a blank tab if you say open in a new tab. It obviously knows the link is there, but it just won't open it. I did a lot of research and the
 only promising think I came across was using batch files to do this. I know absolutely nothing about batch files, so I am uncertain how to do this. If any one could help me make a batch file to do this or knows of any other way to make these links work that
 would be wonderful. Also, I have no idea which category to post this in, so if anyone could help me with that as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skye</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail opens minimized but will not Maximize</h2>
                    My wife's computer is displaying issues with Windows Live Mail.<br />
<br />
When you start the program, it displays the Windows Live Mail splash screen and immediately minimizes to the task bar next to the time as shown below:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02b3f369-129d-4676-a961-7879744ae2a5" /><br />
<br />
Double-clicking the icon makes the icon flash the color behind it but nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Right-clicking the icon and selecting <b>Open Windows Live Mail</b> results in nothing happening.<br />
<br />
Right-clicking the icon and selecting "Contacts" results in nothing happening.<br />
<br />
Right-clicking the icon and selecting "Compose an email" or "Create an event" results in the following popup window being displayed:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15a24823-e2f9-4b92-a5cd-6e43c78e66d8" /><br />
<br />
Right-clicking the icon and selecting "Exit" results in a popup window appearing and immediately closing so fast you cannot read it.<br />
<br />
I have tried unsuccessfully to read the popup as it is opening and closing and think I see something about "out of memory" and an error code but cannot make out the number.&nbsp; Odd, the only app running other than Firefox where I am composing this is Windows Live
 Mail (I know there are other apps running in the background as well as services...) and the system is maxed out on memory (4 GB) running Windows 7 Home Premium.<br />
<br />
I need to correct this as I can get to my wife's email from a Web portal but it appears the setting inside Windows Live Mail is set for the program to pull all email locally and then delete the email from the server...as when I check it from the Web portal
 and WLM is running, there is no mail to be found.<br />
<br />
Anyone?<br />
Anyone?<br />
Bueller?<br />

Thanks in advance.<br />

            <p>WLMail might be opening off screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Vista and earlier Windows versions:</p>
<p><br />
Right click on the minimized window button on the Taskbar and select Move. Now use the arrow keys to get it in the screen. Close all other windows except this one and use the cursor to drag the message to the size you want. Close this window last and Windows
 will remember the size and location when you open it again.</p>

<br />
Thanks for the reply...<br />
<br />
It does not appear to be offscreen...when I hold down Shift and right click on the icon that is in the task bar to the far right (not like a window is open but the entire app is minimized) next to the time and volume, etc...it still pops up the same pop up
 menu as if I only right click the icon...in other words there is no "Move"...<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

That is the issue...<br />
<br />
Please look at the original post again (I added an additional image).<br />
<br />
There is no "open window button" in the task bar...<b>only</b> the letter icon next to the time on the far right...<br />
<br />
Hence my confusion...<br />
<br />

I wish your "canned solution" procedure worked...<br />
<br />
I have searched for numerous errors for Windows Live Mail and the above procedure is immediately given as the Answer / Solution to most of the problems at hand.&nbsp; Below you will find the issues with the suggested procedure<br />
<br />
<b>Issue 1: </b><br />
<br />
&lt;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> But before that, please back up first all your files saved in your Windows Live Mail. Please visit the help article below for more information on how to do this:</span>

<p><br />
</p>
<b>This instance of Live Mail only appears upon startup as an icon in the far lower right of the task bar near the time\date.&nbsp;
</b><b>There is no minimized tabbed window on the far left of the task bar to be maximized.&nbsp; There is no method which allows this instance to be maximized to full screen or allows you any access to any menus of the running program, so backing up or exporting

<br />
<b>Issue 2:</b><br />
<br />
&lt; <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To repair your Windows Live Mail, here are the steps:

&nbsp;<br />
Therefore, due to the above error, I am unable to move to number 6:<br />
as the "Microsoft Unspecified Error 0x80004005" tells me nothing about how to proceed further.<br />
<br />
<b>Also, the above error notates that I am unable to uninstall Windows Live Mail which is a part of Windows Live Essentials</b>, so as it appears that this instance is very much corrupted somehow and I now need a method by which to uninstall Windows Live Essentials
 that does not rely on a Windows automated process to remove it from the OS.<br />
<br />
The remainder of the suggested solution procedure is moot.<br />
<br />
I would entertain other suggestions.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the assistance.<br />

            <p>Error 0x80004005 is a generic 'access denied' error, i.e. not so much an error as a notification that you're trying to do something you're not allowed to do. It may be thrown if the user doesn't have the requisite permissions for the action, or (commonly)
 a third-party security program is denying access to something you need to have access to to carry out the action. What third-party programs are running on the affected computer?<br />
<br />
There's no need to go through a complicated backup procedure before repairing the program. Data files won't normally be touched by this process, only program files and settings. However, to be on the safe side, you can always copy your store folder to, say,
 the <em>Documents</em> folder for safekeeping. This will ensure that you have copies of all messages. By default, the store folder is
<br />
C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Try conducting the repair as administrator (who has higher privileges than a standard user). To do this, type
<strong>wlarp </strong>into the start search box, then right-click on <em>wlarp.exe</em> in the results pane and select
<em>Run as administrator</em>.&nbsp;In the window that opens, select <em>Repair ...&nbsp; </em>
When it's finished, reboot the computer and try launching Windows Live Mail again.<br />
<br />
If wlarp.exe isn't available, you're looking at a complete re-install of the program.<br />
<br />

<br />
Wlarp.exe does not appear when searched for in that manner on this system for some reason.<br />
<br />
It does exist under the following directory structure:<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files(x86)\Windows Live\Installer<br />
<br />
However, when Run as Administrator (even when the user logged in as IS an Administrator on the system), I get this result:<br />

Can't repair when wlarp.exe does not work.<br />
<br />
Other suggestions?<br />

Thanks for the attempt.<br />

            <p>Sorry, I can't think of any particular reason why this isn't working for you. Can you identify the 'Hig' that's throwing this error? Could it be that there's some sort of display enhancement software running?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>That said, the version of the program you have installed has been outdated for four years, so I'm not really surprised that it's not working properly, and I'm frankly even more surprised that it has ever worked. I wonder where&nbsp;you got it&nbsp;from. There have
 been many updates since then and, for users with Windows 7, two upgrades. You should consider installing the latest version, but this will involve a complete removal of the existing one and will most probably destroy the default contacts list. Messages will
 be safe, though, if you keep a copy of the store folder. The latest version for W7 can be downloaded here:

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            I get blank error message when clicking on &#34;Send &#38; Receive in Windows Mail.</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: <span>I get a blank error message when clicking on 'Send &amp; Recieve' in Windows Mail.</span></p>
<p>I recently&nbsp;asked a question in&nbsp;the Microsoft Answer Internet Forum as I could no longer access my favorites from Internet Explorer 8 (although they were still showing in My Favorites folder in my user account folder.)&nbsp; Several fixes to this problem were
 suggested, but the one that&nbsp;worked was when it was suggested that I might have a&nbsp;corrupted user account.&nbsp; I was directed to the&nbsp;Microsoft link 'How to fix a corrupted user profile.' I followed the instructions and created a new user account and copied the
 files over to the new account. This did fix the problem, and I can now access all my favorites again in IE8 in the new user account.<br />
<br />
However. I am now no longer able to send or receive messages in Windows Mail. When I click on 'Send &amp; Receive' I get the box which says 'Some errors occured while processing the requested tasks. Please review the list of errors below for more details.' However,
 the box below which is supposed to list the errors is completely blank. I have contacted my internet service provider (Virgin Media), who have carried out various diagnostic tests. They have told me that it is not a problem with their security, and they have
 checked my account settings to ensure everything is correct. They seem to think it might be a problem with my Registry. They have sent me several test messages (which arrive in my Virgin Media web mail box) but for some reasons are not getting downloaded to
 my Windows Mail. On a couple of occasions the test messages did get through (but only after I closed down Windows mail and then opened it again.) However, the Windows Mail stopped working again.<br />
<br />
On just one occasion, I DID get details of an error, which was 'ERR Protocol error. Port 110 Secure (SSL): 0X800CC90. error number 0x800ccc18.' However, that was the only time. At all other times the error box is completely blank.<br />
<br />
I would be very grateful if someone could help me fix this problem.&nbsp; I have very limited IT knowledge.</p>

<p>I have looked into the links provided by Mouneshwar &amp; Bruce, but they have not provide a fix to my particular&nbsp;problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I should explain that&nbsp;I have noticed some improvement to Windows Mail but the "Send &amp; Receive button" is still not working properly.&nbsp;I
 can&nbsp;now send and receive messages.&nbsp; If there are any messages on my Virgin Mail server, they are accessed automatically when I open Windows Mail. However, if Windows Mail is already open on my computer and a new message is sent to me and I click "Send &amp; Receive,"
 I still get the blank error message. The only way I can access the message is to close Windows Mail and re-open it again, when the new message is downloaded automatically. I found a link which said this error could be caused by a duplicate news account.&nbsp; I
 found I had two ms.news accounts in my Windows Mail account and deleted one of them.&nbsp; However, this has not resolved the problem, and I am still only able to receive new messages by opening and closing Windows Mail.</p>
<p>Does anybody have any other suggestions?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had this problem too, mine is a Lenovo all in one.&nbsp; It used to be no problem, I checked your two solutions above and they don't make any difference. Is it possible to uninstall Windows Media Player and reinstall it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Photos viewer&#47;editor missing Color Boost.</h2>
                    Before the "upgrade" that appeared without my knowledge or consent sometime in November, I used the win10 Photos app extensively to restore pictures scanned from old photos. Color Boost and several other useful features disappeared in the "upgrade" making
 the app next to useless for me. Is there any way to get the pre-upgrade version of the app back?

<h2>            Network drive is not visible in &#34;Browse for Folder&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a WD My Cloud network drive attached to my router. It appears properly under Network in Windows Explorer and is accessible via that or linking to it's location \\111.222.333.444\.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the drive does not appear when forced to use the "Browse for Folder" selection window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, let's say I wanted to map my WD network drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Select "Map Network Drive" from Windows Explorer</p>
<p>- In the resulting window, click Browse next to the Folder field.</p>
<p>- This opens a "Browse for Folder" window.</p>
<p>- This window shows my network where I would expect to see my WD network drive... but it is not visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in another program that I really want to use, I need to select my WD network drive but the program forces me to use a "Browse for Folder" window with no option to manually input the path/location. Because my WD network drive is not showing up in any "Browse
 for Folder" windows, I cannot select it and therefore can not use the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried mapping the drive and adding it as a network location, neither made the drive show up in "Browse for Folder".</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get my WD network drive to show up in Browse for Folder windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 8.1 and logged-in as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Guitar Hero 3 Legends of Rock Demo Broken&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have been going through the old Guitar Hero demo's, deciding on which to buy (I missed out on the whole Guitar Hero thing when it was big). So anyways...I have been playing the demos, and I came to GH3: Legends of Rock, and attempted to play it. It
 loads fine, but when I get into a song, the screen says I'm holding down the green fret button constantly, without letting up (but I'm not). Also when I press the red fret button, the game thinks I'm pressing the orange fret button, and the opposite for the
 orange fret button (thinks I'm pressing the red one). Also, nothing happens when I use the strum button (however I can here the guitar scrape/strum sounds if I try and press the yellow or blue fret buttons. What the heck is going on with this demo? Its not
 my guitar controller...cause I can use it on all the other guitar hero demos, as well as the Rock Band demo's and games, and it works just fine. Anyone have an answer?</p>

    <title>Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport Adapter, How to disable - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport Adapter, How to disable DHCP&#38;DNS&#63;</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
I'm using Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport Adapter for ICS across my laptop and phone. But I don't find a way to disable the default DHCP&amp;DNS available with ICS.<br />
I'll runn Dual Server DHCP&amp;DNS () on my own. Which will get me better control over the DHCP leases and all DNS forwarings along with the full log.
<br />
For this I need to shutdown the default one. It is possible, because Connectify does the same. Just need to figure out how to do that on my own.<br />
Any help??<br />
