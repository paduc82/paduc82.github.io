<h2>            Windows Hello &#38; Finngerprint</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several days ago my laptop was updated to the Spring edition. Since then, I no longer have Windows Hello nor the sign-in option for Fingerprint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background:</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC is an HP Envy 17</p>
<p>Processor is an Intel Core i7-6700HQ</p>
<p>Memory 16gb</p>
<p>OS is Windows 10 Pro (64-bit)</p>
<p>Version 1803 installed 05/23/2018</p>
<p>OS build 17134.81</p>
<p>
</p><p>Through Device Manager, I tried updating my biometric device driver, unsuccessfully, even though I get a message saying it is current. The message says "Windows found drivers for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install them. Validity
 Sensors (WBF) (PID=0050). Access is denied". I searched for a remedy, but none work to fix the PID=0050.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went so far as to STOP the Windows Biometric service and uninstall the device, rebooting the system and re-installing to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All was well until the update to version 1803 from Fall Creators 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a viable solution besides a OS rollback to the prior version 1709?</p>
<p>
</p><p>M</p>

<p>Hi Butt_101,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There might be some settings that needs correction or some services that needs to checked that could possibly cause this to happen on your computer. In order for me to better understand the issue, I would like to know the following for me to provide you
 with troubleshooting that might resolve your concern or refer you to the correct channel:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your computer connected to a company network?</li><li>Have you tried if the issue is happening with other user profiles?</li><li>Have you tested if the issue is happening when booting to safe mode?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can run this <strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">troubleshooter for devices and hardware</a></strong> to automatically troubleshoot issues that Windows might locate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please don't hesitate to keep me posted for further assistance.</p>

<p>Hi ErwinJames,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>I am on a Home network and the only User on my PC;</p>
<p>Safe Mode results in the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Troubleshooter above with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I outlined the error message in my original request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some additional information:</p>
<p>I ran sfc /scannow with no issues found;</p>
<p>I booted into the BIOS F10 and found no Biometric Device option;</p>
<p>As outlined initially, I disabled Widows Biometetric service while attempting to fix this issue. It didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While awaiting a response, I searched the Internet and found quite a number of Users with issues resulting from the version 1803 upgrade. Just an observation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you recommend anything else?</p>

<p>I appreciate the detailed information. Just to clarify, have you tried uninstall and reinstall the drivers manually on a different user profile? To do this, I suggest that you
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a new user profile</a></strong> and name it as
<strong>test</strong>. Afterwards, try performing a <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware-winpc/how-to-install-and-update-hardware-drivers-in/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">manual
 install and update on your drivers</a></strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope that this would be able to resolve your concern.</p>

<p>Hello ErwinJames,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry. Yes, I set up a test user and the results are &nbsp;the same. Windows Hello is not available on this machine, and the fingerprint reader is missing from the sign-in options. It is also listed as an unknown device in Device Manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All worked before updating to version 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Thank you for keeping me posted. I just would like to clarify a few things before we perform further troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the exact model of your <strong>HP Envy 17</strong>?</li><li>Is this still happening even after performing the manual installation using the steps that was advised on the link I posted previously?</li><li>Based on your manufacturer's website, what is the version of the driver you're installing?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I suggest that you perform a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong>, and then reinstall your drivers. Just to eliminate
 the possibility of having any 3rd party program that might be in conflict with installation of the drivers for your fingerprint scanner. After reinstalling it, try running the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15078/windows-make-older-programs-compatible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">compatibility troubleshooter</a></strong> to see if this would make any progress in getting your drivers to work for your
<strong>Windows Hello</strong> and <strong>fingerprint scanner</strong>.</p>

</p><p>Please don't hesitate to keep me posted with the results.</p>

<p>Sorry it has taken me this long to respond. I reset my PC to a clean windows 10. That fixed the problem, but I have been spending time re-installing applications and restoring my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All is well. Windows Hello is working and my fingerprint reader is once again working. I didn't want to do this, but the failures in getting the issue resolved any other way was driving me crazy.</p>

<p>I am an IT coordinator for a school corp and just updated 11 Lenovo X1 Yogas (on a domain) today to the same exact build number (17134.81) and the fingerprint logon is no longer working on any of them.&nbsp; Last summer, I had a similar issue with that the build
 that was current at that time and determined the following....</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Jigsaw</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded Microsoft Jigsaw, but when I try to open a puzzle, it begins to load, then an ad appears and when I click on the 'Close' button on the ad, the app goes back to the puzzle selection page, and does not load the puzzle for me to complete.&nbsp; I have
 tried uninstalling/reinstalling the app, resetting the app, and I have tried the app troubleshooter. None of these have fixed the problem.</p>
<p>

    <title>Call Of Duty&#58; World at War Account Hack - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thebestfriend15  say:</h3>
<h2>            Call Of Duty&#58; World at War Account Hack</h2>
                    
<p>Around 2011, I bought Call Of Duty: World at War for xbox 360. Me and my friends enjoyed zombies and would often play public matches. We joined a game and our teammates were hackers. We left the game when we realized this, but they made it so we need -2,147,476,890
 XP to level up. It will not allow me to join any multiplayer match at all. WaW has recently gone backwards compatible for the Xbox One and I was hoping there would be a solution, but I haven't found any. Activision no longer offers support for WaW so I was
 hoping some people on Xbox had some solutions or at least know some more information about how this happened and if there is a solution.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear it. &nbsp;Unfortunately this is an in game issue that Xbox cannot assist with. &nbsp;Only the developers can help you with the problem.</p>
<p>In the meantime, although you cannot get into a match yourself, your friends can invite you to their matches and you can play that way.</p>
<p>Other than that your only option is to create a new account and start from scratch.</p>

<h2>            Failed to install 2 Intel DMA controller driver in Audit mode after Windows Update on CloverTrail</h2>
                    <p>Hi friend:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found in Clover Trail device, there are 2 Intel DMA controller driver under "Computer"(except "ACPI x86-based PC") in device manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to install Windows 8 and create user account, and it succeeded to install the 2 DMA controller driver under "Computer" after Windows Update is done and system restarted. By following steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step one. Install Win8, select user color and computer name, user name, ......</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step two. Enter into Win8 with the user account created</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step three. Install all the necessary drivers, the 2 DMA controller drivers are unrecognized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step four. Doing Windows update by right click Computer-&gt;Properities-&gt;Windows Update-&gt;Install Updates</p>
<p><u><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Step four above and a restart, finally&nbsp;the 2 Intel DMA controller drivers are recognized, without yellow exclamation mark.</strong></em></u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But for the OOBE shipping image, it is necessary to install drivers and Windows Updates in audit mode. so this time I did as following steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step1&nbsp;&nbsp; Install Win8, when it asked me for color and computer name, just press Ctrl+Shift+F3 to enter Audit mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step2&nbsp;&nbsp; Audit mode entered immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step3&nbsp; Install all necessary drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step4&nbsp; Doing Windows update by right click Computer-&gt;Properties-&gt;Windows Update-&gt;Install Updates</p>
<p><strong><em><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After step4 above and a restart, finally the 2 Intel DMA controller drivers are still keep unrecognized, still with yellow exclamation mark.</u></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>So the conclusion is that, doing Windows Update in Audit mode would not make the 2 Intel DMA controller driver recognized, only doing Windows Update in normal setup mode could get the 2 Intel DMA controller driver recognized.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you please help me to recognize the 2 Intel&nbsp;DMA controller driver in Audit mode, simply by installing Windows Updates?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information on the 2 Intel DMA controller drivers are as below:</strong></u></p>

            <p>Hi <strong>Genesis Liu</strong>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forums and thank you for posting the question. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description,&nbsp;you are unable to install the driver&nbsp;for DMA controller in Audit mode.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you using OEM machine or custom built computer? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the computer is custom built, I would suggest you to contact motherboard manufacturer and install the chipset drivers and check.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If are using an OEM machine, you may have a disk to install the motherboard chipset drivers. You may install the chipset drivers and then go ahead and install the drivers from Windows update.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Do get back to us if you have more queries regarding Windows.
</p>
        </p>

            <p>I am using an OEM machine. I knew for board level drivers,&nbsp; I need to ask the manufacturer(Intel) for the driver.</p>
<p>But this Intel DMA Controller driver is installed by Windows Update(already checked by normal installation, as illustrated), but found unable to install these 2 DMA controller driver in audit mode. So I think there must be differences between normal installation
 and Audit mode installation, which caused this bug.</p>
<p>So would you please help to check it further? Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Hi friend:</p>
<p>I encountered a problem when doing sysprep.</p>
<p>When installing Windows 8, I used to do following steps, it always succeeded:</p>
<p>Step one. press Ctrl+Shift+F3 to enter Audit mode</p>
<p>Step two. Install all necessary drivers</p>
<p>Step three. Install all Windows Updates</p>
<p>Step four. Open sysprep tool by typing sysprep.exe in command line, in the sysprep tool I selected "Enter OOBE" "Generalize" "Quit", wait for it done.
</p>
<p>Store five. Reboot the system and capture OOBE shipping image by DISM command.</p>
<p>For this time,, I added an additional step, as <u><em><strong>step4</strong></em></u> below. I updated 15 Windows Store apps to fix some obvious app store bugs.
</p>
<p>Step1. press Ctrl+Shift+F3 to enter Audit mode</p>
<p>Step2. Install all necessary drivers</p>
<p>Step3. Install all Windows Updates</p>
<p><u><strong><em>Step4. Update Windows Store apps(Sign in an Windows Store account, update, then sign out)</em></strong></u></p>
<p>Step5. Open sysprep tool by typing sysprep.exe in command line, in the sysprep tool I selected "Enter OOBE" "Generalize" "Quit", wait for it done,</p>
<p>Step6. Reboot the system and capture OOBE shipping image by DISM command.</p>
<p>BUT, I got an error in step5, When I do sysprep, showing "A fatal error occurred while trying to sysprep the machine."</p>
<p>So if updated Windows Store apps, it always failed to sysprep /oobe the device. But it seems necessory to update Windows Store.</p>
<p>Would you please help me to solve it, thanks.</p>

            <p>Yes, they are almost the same process, except that in this issue I only mentioned do Windows Update, and the sysprep tool succeeded doing OOBE, but failed to recognize 2 DMA controller driver under "computer" in device mananger;
</p>
<p>BUT&nbsp;in the another issue, additionally, I mentioned updating Windows Store provisioned apps, and the sysprep tool got an error due to Windows Store updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So they are actually for different issue, hope you can understand.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi there Nick</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would be changing the alias associated one It does have it on step 3 of the link provided previously&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/microsoft-account/change-email-sign-in-for-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/microsoft-account/change-email-sign-in-for-microsoft-account</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 3: Remove the email address you no longer want to use to sign in</p>
<p>Note If you choose to remove an alias that uses a Microsoft domain such as @hotmail.com, @outlook.com, or @live.com, that alias will be completely deleted and will not be available to sign in to any Microsoft services.<br />
To remove the email address you no longer use to sign in to your account, select Remove next to that alias on the Manage your account aliases page, and then follow the instructions provided.<br />
Important Do not remove this email address if you still want to use it to send and receive email messages.<br />

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to us and clarifying more on the inquiry. If you wish to change the email associated with your Xbox live account follow the steps provided on our article
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/microsoft-account/change-email-sign-in-for-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
'How to change the email address associated with your Microsoft account.'</a> Now, keep in mind that
<span><span style="color: rgba(176, 100, 0, 1)"><span>t<span>he email address that you enter can't already be in use as a Microsoft account alias.
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong><span> If you choose to remove an alias that uses a Microsoft domain such as @hotmail.com, @outlook.com, or @live.com, that alias will be completely deleted and will not be available to sign in to any Microsoft
 services.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>That is for the entire account i believe, i dont need that. I just want the gamertag affected/effected&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> the computer and phone as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only want to know if I can change the email for my gamertag&nbsp;<strong>only</strong>, because i want to&nbsp;<strong>move
</strong>the gamertag to my new account</p>

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the replies. As previously stated by our Ambassadors and fellow XBF members, you can change and remove your email address associated with the log in information for your Microsoft/Xbox account (also referred to as alias).
<strong>Keep in mind that if the email is a Microsoft domain and <em>not</em> a third-party (like @yahoo, @gmail, etc.) email, then the email would be deleted permanently and all associations lost.</strong> Essentially, you can't separate the Xbox profile from
 the MSA that it's associated with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I recommend is that you do not fully remove your existing Xbox alias, but simply add the email you wish to use for log in, then make it the primary alias. This will leave the old primary alias on the account as a back up email for verification/notification.&nbsp;<span>Honestly,
 the best idea would be to create a new Outlook email for log in to the Xbox account to avoid any sort of deletion.</span>&nbsp; Leaving your old alias on there as a back up email can also help with account recovery, should you need it, down the road. (There's some
 basic, but good info, in this support article about <a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/microsoft-account/choose-email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
choosing an email address for your MSA</a>.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you complete that, you can go over to your other Microsoft account and add the old Xbox alias as an alternate email under your existing primary email alias there, then switch primaries if you'd like as it has been freed up from the other account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that the process can be a bit convoluted and confusing, so if it seems a bit much, then I'd additionally recommend that you
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
request a call back from Xbox Support</a> and they'd be happy to guide you through it to ensure that you retain the account and all it contains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for hanging in there with the explanation and I hope that this helps out a bit more.</p>

            <p>Hi. Thanks for the reply. I have tried all the basic stuff. Cannot be repaired or go to a restore point. My laptop was fine until the update.</p>
<p>My version of windows 7 was preinstalled by dell. I do not have installation discs . I have a backup on an external drive I think. However, &nbsp;as windows does not operate at all the external drive is not found. It is not a system image so maynot be a complete
 backup. I will probably lose all my recent data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is also now out of warranty. This could be expensive. Lol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I daresay contacting dell will be my only option. But as I am in Thailand and travelling to</p>
<p>Europe in three weeks it makes it complicated.</p>
<p>Such is life!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any further suggestions ?</p>
<p>Again. Thanks for the reply. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Installing game from disc Xbox One X - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meatsuzy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing game from disc Xbox One X</h2>
                    <p>I'm a bit of a newbie when it comes to this type of technology, hence this post!&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I've just bought an Xbox One X, and I'm struggling with how long it takes to download/install games. I've tried a few games,&nbsp;both downloading and inserting a disc. And it takes HOURS. Forgive my ignorance but with our cronky old Xbox 360 (and other older consoles)&nbsp;you just put a disc&nbsp;in and it plays. With this one I put the disc in and hours later I still have nothing. It's an Xbox One X Enhanced game, I don't know if that makes any difference. The one I've tried to download straight to the Xbox isn't.</p><p><br /></p><p>Is this what is going to happen every single time I get a new game? I would have expected something a lot faster for the "most powerful console in the world", or does this happen with ALL new games consoles??</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you. Lisa&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Optical disks just can't hole enough data, hence the downloads. You will also run into update patches for games, if you set your console to instant on and keep all games and apps up to date, they should update before you come to game.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Surface Pen</h2>
                    <p>How long does it take for Surface Pro 3 with Windows 10 to learn how I write? If it doesn't learn my handwriting style, how on Earth do I turn off predictive text for the pen input? I have turned off predictive text for the keyboard already but still have
 it far the pen input. It is annoying. It completely changes words no matter now many times I write them or even if I add them to the dictionary. Then other times it capitalizes words that I didn't want capitalized. I even find that I need to write the first
 letter really small then the rest of the word really big. or I spend 60% of my time fixing the text that I had written.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thequickbrownfaejumpedoverthel &nbsp;&lt;- This sentence had each word spaced out and each word was spelled correctly. This is the type of **** that I'm talking about. I write fairly neatly so it is not like Windows has to decipher Chicken scratches. "Chicken" in
 the previous sentence was not capitalized by me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using the pen input regularly for 3 weeks now and there is no improvement. This is pissing me off. What should to do or what are you doing to fix this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and "Getting to know you" is turned on.</p>

            No change. It still changes my words to something different. Even does this for single letters. It is not a pressure sensitivity issue. It is the predictive text that I can't turn off.

                    <p>I'm running Windows 7 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I got a wired 360 controller for my pc a couple days ago, and it worked fine up until now. Everytime I plug the controller into
 my pc, it lights up in the 1st and 4th quadrants for a split second, then the entire circle is lit up and flashes 4 times, there's a long pause in between each flash.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I plugged it into my other pc and my xbox 360 and it worked fine, so the controller isn't the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I think the problem is that my pc is mistaking the controller for something else, it keeps think that it's a ethernet controller,
 which it is clearly not.</span></p>

            <p>Hey, guys! Sorry to see any issues with getting the drivers to install for your new adapter. This thread is turning into something else, so I'd like to get some steps put in here to explain what needs to be done.</p>
<p>All of the troubleshooting steps for being unable to download drivers is listed here in our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-windows/accessories/troubleshoot-xbox-wireless-adapter-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot the Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows</a> page. So that you don't have to dig, I've posted them below.</p>
<p>Please be aware, that if these steps do not work for you,&nbsp;<strong>you need to replace your device</strong>. For information on how to do that, follow the steps on our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-windows/accessories/xbox-wireless-adapter-for-windows-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to get service for your Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows</a> page. This will walk you through getting a replacement device through us. You are always more than welcome to take it back to the retailer that you purchased it from, as well.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:&nbsp;</strong>Additionally, the Xbox Accessories App is not out until 10/27. It is not needed for this adapter, you will want to refer to the above links and below troubleshooting for the wireless adapter</p>
<p>If these steps do not help you out, and a replacement device is also not working, please post up a new thread so that we can help you out further. Thanks for understanding.</p>
<div>
<p>[quote]Because the drivers for the Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows are embedded within the Windows 10 operating system, the adapter should auto-install. If it doesn't, try the following solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your Windows 10 device is connected to the Internet.</li>
<li>Make sure your Windows 10 device is up to date by going to Windows Update on your device and checking for available updates.</li>
<li>Reboot your device and try again.</li>
<li>Ensure your USB ports are not disabled in your Device Manager.</li>
<li>Try another USB 2.0 or 3.0 port.</li>
<li>Try reinstalling the drivers in case they have partially installed. To do so, you need to uninstall the drivers. Follow these steps to complete this process:
<ul>
<li>Go to your&nbsp;<b>Device Manager</b>.</li>
<li>Locate&nbsp;<b>Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows</b>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<b>Network adapters</b>&nbsp;section.</li>
<li>Click&nbsp;<b>Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows</b>&nbsp;to bring up the Properties window.</li>
<li>Click on the&nbsp;Driver&nbsp;tab.</li>
<li>On the&nbsp;<b>Driver</b>&nbsp;tab, click the&nbsp;<b>Uninstall&nbsp;</b>button.</li>
<li>On the confirmation window, check&nbsp;<b>Delete the driver software for this device</b>.</li>
<li>Unplug the Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows and reboot your Windows 10 device. Once the device is back on, plug in the adapter.</li>
<li>If the Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows still does not install, follow all of the above steps thoroughly one more time. If this doesn't work, your adapter needs to be replaced.

    <title>Can no longer reorder Quick Access folders in list - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tpanc13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can no longer reorder Quick Access folders in list</h2>
                    <p>After installing Windows 10 on August 1,2015 I could change the order of the folders PINned in my Quick Access list. Recently, the drag and drop to move a pinned folder up/down no longer works. Any solutions or explanation what is causing this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Supplemental Information: When you go to drag the folder, say between two other folders, the drag operation indicates what is acceptable. It will HIGHLIGHT another folder to indicate that you want to drag it into that folder, OR it will give you a line when
 between folders to indicate that you want to move it there. However, the second option which is what I want also shows a red "not" icon when it shows the new "line" location (between folders). Was this function removed? Or has it just recently been broken?</p>

            <p>Adul,</p>
<p>Thanks for responding. However, after researching more articles, I find that in Windows 10 this feature does NOT exist, i.e., to move a pinned item up or down in the Quick List. Yes, dragging an item INTO another folder works, but dragging to change the
 position of the item IN THE LIST seems NOT to be an option. Can you verify this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see no harm doing what you indicate for I have a few more strange happenings. But, I do not see your response as valid IF the feature does not exist. Please confirm my understanding. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see:&nbsp;http://www.ghacks.net/2015/06/10/how-windows-10s-quick-access-feature-differs-from-favorites/ &nbsp; &nbsp;where you will find the following comments to the discussion:</p>
<p>
</p><p>GrantW August 3, 2015 at 5:20 am #&nbsp;<br />
Actually, the Quick Access functionality is diminished from previous versions. I can no longer rename items in the list to make it more sensible. For example, I have a link to "Documents" on my Desktop and Laptop in there. Previously, I would have them named
 "Documents on Desktop " and "Documents on Laptop" respectively, but now I just have to take a guess with each one. I don't understand the design decisions around removing features!<br />

This is my biggest issue!! I now have folders like "web" and "20150430" because I can't rename them! Big oversight in such a prominent place of Windows.<br />

The biggest difference is that you CAN'T change the order of the items in the Quick Access section. Looks like you could when you click/drag but the item doesn't re-position. LAME.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree 100% that both RENAME &nbsp;and moving to change the order are 2 functions very much missing from Quick Access list in Windows File Explorer. Please accept this as a formal recommendation to include these in future updates.</strong></p>

            I assume my response was correct that Windows 10 does NOT have the function I am looking for and that I answered my own question. Thus, consider this issue CLOSED and my response as the answer.

            <p>Yes, you CAN re-order the Quick Access List. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To do so, open File Explorer, then scroll to the top of the Navigation Pane (the one at the left of the screen). There you will find the Quick access listing. In this listing you can click and drag any of the entries to another position. Once you have arranged
 this list to your liking, just close the File Explorer window. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you go back to the Quick Access list in the Start Menu, you will find that it matches the arrangement you made in File Explorer.</p>

            <p>Sorry. Doesn't work. When you try to position an entry while dragging it between two other entries, you get a red circle with slash thru it indicating invalid option. I can ONLY drag into another folder. I am talking re-positioning FOLDERS in a specific
 order.</p>

            <p>Windows 10 Pro, 64 Bit version. And I guarantee that it DOES work. I've rearranged my Quick Access list several times. I find it works best if you click on the icon rather than the name, and drag slowly to where you want to place it. The black line between
 other entries appears to confirm the move before you drop it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which version are you using? I have a Windows 10 Home 32 Bit box and it works exactly the same way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure you nave all of the latest updates?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Looks like Windows 10 64-bit only has the problem. Thanks, that clarifies things for the Microsoft people to fix. If somebody can confirm the problem with Windows 10 64-bit, I would appreciate it. It is always possible something else on my system is causing
 this. I wish Mr. Jabbar with MSFT would chime in with confirmation.</p>

            Yes, your comments indicated it works with Pro 64-bit and Home 32-bit. Home 64-bit remains the only issue (different animal than 32-bit).

<h3> amy_563  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need Windows 7 to search for multiple strings, like Windows XP did</h2>
                    <div>I want to search for files with one string in it as well as files with another string, and a third, and so on. The reason I dont do this separately is because i want to search for files that contain any one of dozens of strings and copy the resulting file
 list all at once, rather than copying and pasting dozens of times.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For example, in Windows XP I would enter "6145, 6174, 6179" (without quotes) and so on, and I would get a list of files that contain 6145, for example, DSC06145 (the jpg, the raw, and all the other versions i created of the image), DSC06174 (all its versions),
 and DSC06179 (and all its versions) and so on.</div>
<div>It saves an incredible amount of time to do this all together.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I can't do this in Windows 7, how can I make Windows 7 search like XP? I even tried third party searches, such as &nbsp;Everything search, but it doesn't do it either.</div>

            <p>Hi Amy_563</p>
<p>The Search Engine in Windows 7 is more advanced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to use Boolean Operators to perform a search for multiple items in a folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the search you described, use the following syntax.</p>
<p>6145 OR 6174 OR 6179</p>
<p>See the following links.</p>

<p><span>Hi brettbecker,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Windows Vista answers forum.</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes this issue is caused due to improper sound settings or incompatible audio drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps as below and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Resolving most microphone/line-in problems</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Use the following steps, in order, to test, check hardware and connections, update audio drivers, and configure
 Windows sound settings. If you follow these steps in proper order, you will fix the problem or you will find that the audio software being used needs to be configured or updated.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Testing for an audio signal</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then
<strong>Control Panel</strong>. </span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>Hardware and Sounds</strong>, and then click
<strong>Managing audio devices</strong>... </span></li><li>
<span>Click the <strong>
Recording</strong> tab. </span></li><li>
<span>To test the microphone, speak into it. To test line-in, send a signal to the line-in port from the source audio device (press play from the audio player). Look at the gray bars next to the device
 name on the recording tab:</span>
<ul>
<li>
<span>If the gray bars next to the device name change to green, this device is active and an audio signal is being passed through the microphone or line-in port. This step shows that problem is related
 to sound settings in the software that uses the microphone. If you have not already done so, set the selected device to default and adjust the levels. Once the device is set to default and the levels are set, use and adjust the sound recording or voice carrying
 software. </span></li><li>
<span>If the gray bars remain gray and inactive, the device is not recognizing a signal. Leave the recording tab open and go to the next step.</span>
</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Check volume levels and mute</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The speaker volume for the microphone and line-in may be muted or turned down. Use the following steps to check
 the speaker volume levels for line-in and microphone.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click
<strong>Control Panel</strong>. </span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>Sound</strong>.
</span></li><li>
<span>Select <strong>Speakers</strong>, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>. </span></li><li>
<span>Click the <strong>
Levels</strong> tab. </span></li><li>
<span>Click the <strong>
Muted </strong>button next to <strong>Microphone</strong> and any other line-in that is muted.
</span></li><li>
<span>Use the slider bar to raise the level for
<strong>Microphone</strong> and each line-in to at least 75. </span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>OK</strong>.
</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Step 4: Update the audio drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may find that a front microphone port does not work, a recording device is missing from the recording tab,
 a microphone is not recognized when it is plugged in, or other problem. There may be updated audio drivers that can fix these types of issues. Use the following steps to make sure audio drivers are up to date.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Connect to the Internet.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and enter device manager in the Start search field.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click the plus sign, next to Sound, video and game controllers.
</span></li><li>
<span>Right-click the name of the sound hardware and select
<strong>Update Driver Software...</strong>. </span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong> and wait for Windows to update the driver software.
</span></li><li>
<span>Windows checks a remote Web site to see if updated driver software is available.</span>
<ul>
<li>
<span>If an update is available, let Windows install the update.</span>
</li><li>
<span>If an update is not available, skip to the next step.
</span></li></ul>
</li><li>
<span>Once the update is installed successfully, test the microphone or line-in as was done in step 1. If the problem persists, go to the next step.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Step 5: Configuring Windows recording settings</span></strong></p>
<p><span>By default, Windows Vista automatically enables microphones and line-in ports. Use the following steps to set
 the microphone/line-in port to be the default port and to configure the recording levels.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>If the Recording tab in the sound window is not selected, open the Sound window and click the
<strong>Recording </strong><span>Tab</span> and make sure that the status is set as below.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>1 - Microphone port - working and set as default</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>2 - Line In - working</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>3 - Digital In (S/PDIF port) - working</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>4 - Stereo Mix (Software mixer) - Disabled</span></strong><span>
</span></p>

                    <p>The wmiprvse.exe process is occasionally spiking my CPU usage up to 100% I don't get any error messages of any type, but my system drastically reduces almost to the point of it looking like it froze or stopped loading. When the CPU% drops down, functions
 come back. But its doing this all the time. </p>
<p>Iv ran virus/spyware scans both normally and in safe mode. Nothing shows up. I'm running Windows XP: Home edition. Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.8GHz&nbsp; Any ideas or suggestions?</p>

<p>I dl'ed the Malwar tool and ran it in safe mode. 4+ hours into it i fell asleep. Woke up to find it completed. It showed 0 files/problems.</p>

<p>The interesting part is with the background programs. </p>
<p>Running my comp normaly i have the problem, obviosuly. When i started the selective start up and disabled all the non-microsoft background programs, the problem seems to have dissapeared.</p>
<p>So i started re-adding programs little by little, trying to find what it was cause the problem. I eventuly got back to having all the programs enabled again. And the problem still was gone.</p>
<p>So i switched back form selective start up (with everything enabled) to the normal start up. And thats when the problem showed itself again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is their anything that normal start up loads the selective start up does not even have listed?</p>

Ran the same thing trough the startup programs themselves. Seem to have found the culprit. VerizonServicepoint<br />
Without that running I'm not having any of the issues. :/<br />
Tested every other program on their to. Thats the only one.

Dear Brian953,<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for reporting this discovery!&nbsp; I have had problems with slowdowns in an online game for a long time, and it got worse recently.&nbsp; Due to your comment I removed VerizonServicePoint and Verizon DSL software and now wmiprvse.exe is absent in task
 manager.&nbsp; Frontier bought out Verizon last year anyway!&nbsp; Yippee!!!

    <title>webcams for winrt - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wpqs  say:</h3>
<h2>            webcams for winrt</h2>
                    <p>I've just wasted an hour searching various Microsoft websites looking for an external WebCam that can be used with Surface WinRT. Ideally, I want&nbsp; to buy something small like the LifeCam&nbsp;VX-800. Doesn't Microsoft sell webcams? Didn't Microsoft develop WinRT?
 Is it really so hard for the product manager to&nbsp;realise that there may be an opportunity selling an external&nbsp;Microsoft webcam for a Microsoft Surface WinRT? Particularly, given the poor reviews for the internal camera.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows Compatibility Centre says there are VX-800 drivers for Window 8 (but not WinRT), but doesn't tell you where to get them. It also tells me to throw away my VX-3000 as it is not supported - only a year old - what a waste!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice gratefully received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Sorry to hear you were unable to find a webcam. The Surface already has 2 built in cameras, 1 facing forward and one facing backwards. I am unsure why you would want a webcam when the Surface already has one built in.

            Hi Benjamin, more than likely caused by a bad Video Driver
<br />
<br />Try rolling back your Display (video card) Driver
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />If that does not work, go to the support page on the Asus website and download the video card driver they recommend

<br />This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.
<br />
<br />9f is likely a driver issue. Antivirus/antispyware/security programs can also cause these issues.

<br />Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to see if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card or cable and even a weak power supply.
<br />
<br />That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check Right Click Start Button - Device Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power. Maybe only one has an issue.
<br />
<br />(Use RUN instead of Start - Search as used on Vista or Windows 7)
<br />
<br />WINKEY + X - RUN - type in MSCONFIG.exe
<br />
<br />General Tab - check Diagnostic Start  - APPLY / OK  -  REBOOT
<br />
<br />Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, 
<br />Sound, or.....(and it still could be video interacting with something else). 
<br />See troubleshooter link above for my generic driver update methods.

<br />
<br />This is my generic how to for proper driver updates :
<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :  Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names. (also update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers)
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click Start Button- Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click Update Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and 
<br />Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other 
<br />major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT After each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER – Check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />
<br />After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run 
<br />DriverVerifier. (Remember to use the Windows 8/8.1 methods posted at the top of the original reply above.)

<br />The newest driver of Nvidia which your system has installed is somewhat buggy as I can see a lot of users reporting the same BSOD. The way out you have:
<br />First of all, remove everything of Nvidia using DDU and install the older driver available from Nvidia's website,
<br />Nvidia DDU: 
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />Reboot and Install the driver.
<br />The next step would be to block WU to install the buggy driver update. For this, download:
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/2/F22D5FDB-59CD-4275-8C95-1BE17BF70B21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/2/F2...</a>
<br />Click on "Hide updates" option and you'll be able to hide the desired update given in the list.
