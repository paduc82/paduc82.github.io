    <title>Event 11 - The driver detected a controller error on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Event 11 - The driver detected a controller error on &#92;Device&#92;Harddisk2&#92;DR100.</h2>
                    <p>I've been getting this error on external USB drives for years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My usual response was to replace that drive, but I have since found that the error can go away for a while after running chkdsk, or it just carries on. Chkdsk always says there's no problems. Over five years this has happened to all eight drives that I've
 used and then replaced.</p>
<p>The drives are Maxtor, Toshiba &amp; Western Digital 1Tb USB 3.0 on a two drive rotation for daily backup using Windows Server Backup. The drives are always removed correctly via the on-screen icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully I have a another more robust backup destination too or this would be a great worry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver is Microsoft dated: 21/06/2006 version: 6.1.7600.16385.</p>
<p>Windows tells me it's the most current driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Online searches show that this error should be ignored or the disk replaced. No one seems to agree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last thread I saw on this reached no answer and was locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's cost me eight USB drives of various marques in the last few years and still no-one can answer it. Safe Boot (on a production server!!!!) is usually the first deflection. Check the driver or go away and talk to the driver author - It's a Microsoft driver.</p>
<p>I can't believe that every drive of three different manufacturers has a fault so there must be something different going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be interesting to know if the latest Server OS's have this problem.</p>

<h2>            windows defender in windows 10 ver 1803</h2>
                    I keep getting notifications from virus and threat protection "unauthorized changes blocked" and it tells me the folder that is being accessed. This is occurring while nothing is being done on the computer. I click on the notification and I am taken to
 the " Allow an app through Controlled folder access". However, it does not tell me what program is trying to access the folder. Is there some way to see what program is attempting to access these folders?

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/43537bc5-7c3a-49bb-abd1-3228782ccb48" title="RavinderBanwait">
<p>
</p><p>There are multiple reasons why Skype Numbers come as busy when called, that is why it is very important to meet the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Sign in to one device at a time only</strong>. Signing in to one device will ensure that calls will not get misrouted.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Your privacy settings set to <strong>accept calls from anyone</strong>. Limiting your settings to only accept calls form contacts will restrict other users/number to call you. Make sure to double-check this.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>However, as per checking your account I can see that you've already made contact with our support team. Additionally, your Skype Number purchase has been reversed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional questions or clarification, let us know and we will assist you further.

<p>If you are using the new Skype on Desktop, Mac and Linux version 8.12 then I am afraid that this version of the application does not have a privacy setting wherein you can configure this. You have to use a platform to enable this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using the classic Skype for Mac then it is under Privacy. <em>See image below.

            Also as far as you are telling me I cannot change my privacy settings to allow everyone to call me on a Skype number unless I source and find a classic version of Skype or need to buy a windows operating system. If that is correct that is ridiculous and
 this should be rectified by your development team ASAP as many people are wasting their time getting Skype numbers to find they do not serve the purpose they are intended for!

<br />Open a blank document in Word

<br />Click File - Options - Add-ins
<br />
<br />At the bottom of the resulting window, where it says Manage, click the Go button
<br />
<br />Disable all add-ins and apply that setting
<br />
<br />Restart Word and see if that error is gone
<br />
<br />If so, add back those add-ins one at a time, restarting word each time, until you find the add-in causing the problem, and leave that add-in disabled . . .

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Please disconnect all the unnecessary external devices connected to the computer (except the mouse and the keyboard) and then check if you still face the same issue. This is to check if the issue is caused by any external devices connected to the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span>Install all the Windows update and update the Device Drivers on the Computer for all the devices installed on the computer and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check for Windows updates if any Windows updates are available install the same along with optional updates and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Type “<strong>Updates</strong>” in the search bar and click on “<strong>Check for Updates</strong>” from the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span>Now click on “<strong>Check for Updates”</strong> button on the right pane, to receive a fresh list of updates and then install all the updates listed there.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If no driver updates are available via Windows Update, then you may install them for all the devices on the computer from the Computer Manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span>Go to the computer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers available for all the devices on the computer and then install them by following the instructions given in the website. And let us know the statues.</span></p>

<div>I have Acer aspire R14 laptop running Windows 10. I've had this machine for about 8 months now and have loved it.<br />
Over the last while now I've had an issue where I suddenly lose control of the mouse - the cursor starts jumping all over opening random things. I get the grey circles as when one touches the screen except they're popping up all over the place. I'll immediately
 shut everything down. When I reboot it doesn't show itself right off but eventually it returns. help plse???

<h3> puttmann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bitstream output via HDMI&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I have an HP Pavillion DV9700t notebook with a blu-ray player and HDMI output. I am able to connect the laptop to my&nbsp;home theater system and play blu-ray movies (using PowerDVD 8 Ultra). As long as the&nbsp;Blu-ray audio&nbsp;I choose is DD 5.1 or DTS,&nbsp;I am able
 to get&nbsp;that sound through my receiver (Onkyo TX-SR605 capable of 7.1 TrueHD and DTS-HD audio). When the only option on the Blu-ray movie&nbsp;is TrueHD 5.1, it downsamples the track to TrueHD 2.0 and I only get stereo sound out of my home theater system. My receiver
 is capable of decoding TrueHD and DTS-HD, so I don't need the laptop/software to do that for me. Is the downsampling an issue with the software, the sound card (Realtek High Definition Audio), Vista, or what? And is it possible, with my computer, to even output
 a bitstream signal or am I stuck with stereo sound when the only option is a TrueHD track?<br />

            I think i've got it figured out. It turns out it was a setting in PowerDVD 8 Ultra. The output needs to be set at S/PDIF and then under the S/PDIF setting, there are options to output 'primary audio only' (which outputs TrueHD 2.0) or "DTS" which outputs
 DTS 5.1 or "AC3" which outputs DD 5.1. Neither of these are coming across as a TrueHD signal, but i'm just happy to have actual 5.1 audio.

<h2>            UK Skype Number not working when called from UK landlines</h2>
                    <p>I have a UK Skype Number, which only works when called from outside the UK. Calls originating from UK landlines are not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype says number is: +44 208 xxx xxxx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried calling:</p>
<p>44 208 xxx xxxx</p>
<p>00 44 208 xxx xxxx<br />
0 44 208 xxx xxxx<br />
208 xxx xxxx<br />
8 xxx xxxx</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these work from a UK landline, nor from a UK mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>44 208 xxx xxxx works when called from the Skype support landline in the Philippines, or from friends in other countries.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. Yes, that's the first thing I tried. The Skype support chatline called from the Philippines, and that worked, using 44 208 xxx xxxx, and that also works from other countries, but NOT from calls originating from within the UK thus far.</p>

<p>Skype online support tried again, but don't seem to have access to a UK phone to be able to test calling my UK Skype Number from a UK landline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most UK friends who tried calling my UK Skype Number from their UK landlines only got a long pause and repeated beeps, by calling 0208 xxx xxxx. Trying with 44 208 xxx xxxx got a recorded message saying "Not recognised".<br />
<br />
Someone else with a UK VOIP number got straight through calling 0208 xxx xxxx or also calling that from a UK mobile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So something weird going on. But stranger that Skype support appear unable to test their own product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will keep trying, as I know other people with my exact same set up, UK Skype Number, UK clients calling it from a landline, and it works perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Update...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After making more calls to support, I believe they did something on the Skype end, because calls are now starting to come through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UK landlines can now call my Skype Number simply using 0208 xxx xxxx, no need for the country code 44. Which Skype clearly said to use. But anyway I had tried it without the country code before and it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably some problem in the set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also mobiles in the UK can call the Skype Number using 0208 xxx xxxx, exactly as they would a UK 0208 number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And callers from outside of the UK have always been able to call using the full country code: 44 208 xxx xxxx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So looks like all's well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution was repeated calls to Skype support, and eventually they escalated the problem to whoever managed to solve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all</p>

<h2>            New &#40;old&#41; Xbox 360 - No video signal</h2>
                    
<p>I had one of the first Xbox 360s. It started to Red Ring (again), so I got my friend's old 360. He says that it works perfectly. It's the version before the Slims came out. I disconnected my console, plugged his into the exact same cables. Turn it on and
 it works fine, but there's no signal to the TV. Check component cable connection, check cables where they're connected to the TV. Everything is as it was, but still no signal. Try the 360 display setting reset. Nothing.</p>

<p>What could it be?</p>

<p>Hey there, so is this the HDTV cable? If you're only using the standard AV, have you made sure to switch it to the correct setting on the plug that goes into the console?</p>
<p>Also do you have the cable from your old console that you can use for troubleshooting to try and narrow the issue down to the cable, console or TV.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response. I'm using a component cable, and it's the same as the old console. I haven't made any changes to the setup. I plugged in the new console, tried it, no signal, plugged in the old xbox, comes on then red rings after a few minutes.</p>
<p>So the setup work with the old one, and I can't figure out why the new one won't. The new console has an HDMI port, which the old one didn't, but maybe that's worth a shot.</p>

<p>I would always suggest using HDMI if you can, much easier and better picture.</p>
<p>The oldest 360 consoles came with a cable that had two different colour sets (red, white and yellow as well as blue, red and green) on the end (HDTV cable) and the newer 360's got rid of the HDTV (blue, red and green) and went with the standard composite.</p>
<p>I believe those two types of cables do not work across the systems, so if you're plugging the newer Xbox into the older cables then I think this could be causing the issue, you don't have the cables that go with the consoles do you? I would just go with
 HDMI if you can though.</p>

<h2>            I have windows XP SP2, when i try to install SP3, the installation stops part way and the computer cuts off.</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;recently was gave a older laptop.&nbsp;I have windows XP home edition SP2. When i try to update windows,the update web site scans my pc and says i need to install SP3 in order to update all of windows.It downloads,but as it starts to install,part way,the PC
 cuts off. When i power it back up,windows starts to load,but then cuts back off each time. Only way i can get windows to work again is get to the restore program and restore windows back to before the sp3 install atemp.I found out i need to install microsoft
 .net framework 2.0,SP2,but as it tries to install,it stops and gives me an error code 1601. What is the problem and what can i do to reslove it? I&nbsp;know no history of what has been done before i got it. I know it works,but without SP3,and needs updates to work
 correctly. What can I do?</p>

 already been 9 hours since I posted it here. Praying for the tech team to have a look.

<h2>            Sound stops working after the computer goes into sleep mode.</h2>
                    I have Vista and the sound will work until it goes to sleep. Once it wakes back up, the sound doesn't work. I have to restart the computer to get any sound. Will this be fixed if I just upgrade to windows 7?

            <p>If the friends are using the One and not the 360, that could be the issue. Friends don't work the same on the One as they do on the 360 so friends requests won't work for them. They would need to sign into a 360 to accept the requests. They may be able to do so from xbox.com as well, but I can't remember if that still works or not.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the help and the quickly answer! I tried the whole procedure, carefully, but not everything is gone fine,
<span>Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak this command gives me "access denied" but in that folder i can't find this bak file. And when i tried to register the dll files, something wrong happened with these commands like
 for example these<br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>regsvr32.exe mshtml.dll</span></li><li><span>regsvr32.exe shdocvw.dll</span></li><li><span>regsvr32.exe browseui.dll</span></li></ul>
<p><span>and others gives me error, says me that it can't&nbsp; found the file in the specifc path or the entry point was not found,etc.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Anyway i tried at the end of the procedure to install updates, windows update takes much longer to find the update but nothing, impossible to install the updates with the same error. I suppose is something related to the dll
 files ?</span></p>

    <title>I cant update my drivers on my sony vaio after windows 8 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iandowning  say:</h3>
<h2>            I cant update my drivers on my sony vaio after windows 8 upgrade</h2>
                    I upgraded to windows 8 from windows7 and I cannot upgrade any of my drivers and all the driver downloads I get from sony end up having an error message.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The main problem for me is my graphics card driver, it is not updating and i cannot play the games i want, I need to run openGL and i cannot do it as my drivers need to be up to date! Sony have been worse than usless with this problem, I had been told
 that sony would have made changes to the card so I can only use they're drivers, is there any way to get around this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be great.</div>

Steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press the ‘<span>Windows + W</span>’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type
<span>compatibility</span> in the search box and then press <span>
enter</span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click “<span>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</span>” option from the list appeared in the left side.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the game and install.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
