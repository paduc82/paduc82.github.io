            <p>1) Your registry does NOT need 'defragging'</p>
<p>2) Wise Registry cleaner is the nearest thing to malware you can buy.</p>

            <span>Do you know when this problem began (I assume 2-3 days ago when the Google message first appeared though the other problem occurred later - this&nbsp;might fix
 BOTH problems)?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time <strong>BEFORE</strong> the problems began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:

 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points if necessary.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but
 you can use Windows Update for the updates.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>

            I did a system restore to 2 days ago. (I could only go back that far sense I deleted all backups because of Vistas automatic restore points taking so much disk space) Anywho.
<div>I went back 2 days, then the problem went away. I was lagging really badly so I restarted my laptop by click Start&gt;restart. The whilst shutting down, it said installing updates 1 of 11. I left my laptop wile they installed. (I had no clue what the update
 was. I just figured it was a Microsoft update) Then came back, logged into my user and the problem came back. I will try the above tips and reply with my results. Thanks.</div>

            So the system restore worked, but there were 11 pending updates awaiting a reboot when the restore point was created.&nbsp; When you rebooted they finished installing and brougt back the problem,
 know - it's a shame you don't have an earlier restore point or one before these updates installed.&nbsp; It may be possible to stop the process at this point but you need to ask the experts at the Windows Update Forum at:
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistawu/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistawu/threads</a>&nbsp;where people who specialize in Windows Updates and related issues will be more than happy to assist you.&nbsp; You need
 to contact them anyway because one&nbsp;or more of those updates is causing the problem and that needs to be identified and resolved (and they can do that).<br />
<br />
Before you System Restore again, write down the names and KB numbers of all 11 updates and include them in your post&nbsp;to the Windows Updates Forum - they will need that information to help you. Also include what you tried and what happened (a copy of your original
 post and your last post should be included).<br />
<br />
You may be able to resolve the problem by simply uninstalling all 11 updates (I'd probably try to do that if it were a problem on my system - but it may not work and I'd still need their help installing them eventually and somehow avoiding the problem) - but
 I'd rather you talk to the experts and get their opinion on what to do to resolve the problem and get these updates installed (or just resolving the problem now that the updates are installed - they might know about this issue and have a resolution).&nbsp; Whatever
 you do, don't delete that one good restore point - it may come in handy.<br />
<br />
Due to your work with System Restore, I'm pretty sure we&nbsp;now know the cause of the problem (one or more of the updates) - the issue is fixing it and for that I again refer you to the Windows Update Forum
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistawu/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistawu/threads</a>&nbsp;where they can be of more help than we can&nbsp;since it is clearly&nbsp;caused by a Windows update.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

            Hi Jameshubbard3... What application are you in that you want to see a toolbar?
<br />Different apps have different ways to show toolbars.
<br />See link below to show toolbar in word for an example.
<br />

<p>Hello James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you mean toolbars on the taskbar, then the tutorial below can help show you how to add them in Windows 10.</p>

            Hi, James,
<br />
<br />The default web browser that you have is Edge, which doesn't support toolbars or edit options.
<br />Windows Explorer and Internet  Explorer have toolbars.
<br />Launch Windows Explorer (the folder icon you see in taskbar) &gt; Click on the down arrow between Folder Icon and File Explorer
<br />You can customize the File Manager using the items listed.
<br />
<br />Start &gt; Type Internet Explorer &gt; Press Enter
<br />Right click on the right of Smiley Icon
<br />You will see four toolbars listed - Menu, Favorites, Command and Status
<br />Select the one(s) you wish to use       
        </p>

<h2>            itunes not working after 8.1 update</h2>
                    <p>I installed the windows 8.1 update and now iTunes stopped working. iTunes will open and updates but, will not play music&nbsp;and the iTunes store doesn't work properly (very slow and won't play music or videos). I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling many
 times and looked to see if I could go back to windows 8 but saw it uninstalls&nbsp;other stuff.&nbsp;I was wondering if there would be an update coming soon to fix this. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>Windows Soni</strong><strong>c</strong> is Microsoft’s platform-level solution for spatial sound support on Xbox and Windows, enabling both surround and elevation (above or below the listener) audio cues. To enable Windows Sonic on Windows 10, check
 out the article: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/mt807491%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Spatial Sound</a>.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.

            I cant get windows sonic too. My dac provides 24bits, but windows sonic and dolby atmos only works 16bit. This is the reason that i cant use spatial sound. Maybe future update can provides 24bits.

            <p>I just posted, the old one is still there and I can't access it. So there is no way I can check the password. If I could, I wouldn't be asking here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of my computers can access the old one, even the main. It just asks us to join it, but since I forgot the password, and I can't access it to change or view the password, I can't do anything. This happened right after I changed to windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the only thing I see on all the computer in my network. This also shows on the main computer, so I can't do anything. Like I said, the old one is still there and I can't access it.</p>

            You have to work your way to the folder through Windows Explorer and then it works fine.

            <p>Hello Amit it appears Microsoft has a major problem here which needs to be taken more seriously.</p>
<p>I have similar problems to all these posts. I tried your fix and get down as far as
</p>
<p>windows/serviceprofiles/localservice but nothing then for appdata on either box. It isn't there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally I upgraded my win8.1 laptop to win10 and left the win7 box alone just in case.
</p>
<p>I could still print from the laptop to a printer attached by usb to the win7 box.</p>
<p>Since upgrading the win7 box to win10 the printer drivers disappeared on the laptop.</p>
<p>On reinstalling the drivers it says, predictably, that they are already there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This print problem is just a symptom of the main problem.</p>
<p>I have gone around in circles attempting to fix the homegroup.</p>
<p>On both machines I right-click on homegroup in Windows Explorer </p>
<p>but "view homegroup password" is greyed out.</p>
<p>Control panel tells me to get the password from Rick on Office2 - but I'm logged on as Rick on Office2!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there you have it. Maybe it's just a UK problem? who knows.</p>
<p>Grateful for your assistance please, now.</p>

            <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>further to my reply to Amit earlier today (which seems to have disappeared)</p>
<p>his fix actually works fine, I've just done it.</p>
<p>Maybe he is using privileges I do not have, but the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
critical missing bit</span> in his fix was this:</p>
<p>when you get to windows/serviceprofiles/localservice, the folder "appdata" may be missing.</p>
<p>If so, click on View, then on on one machine I just ticked the Hidden Items box,</p>
<p>on the laptop I had to click on Show/Hide first, then tick the Hidden Items box</p>
<p>and there it was. Open it, click Continue when prompted, open Roaming </p>
<p>then delete the PeerNetworking folder on all machines and continue as Amit says.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my original request remains: please fix this. Non-techies will <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not cope.</span></p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>An interruption during the transferring of photos from your iPhone to Windows 10 can be the caused of the duplicate photos. The system might be having confusion on where it left of causing the photos to be downloaded multiple times. We would like to know
 more about the issue regarding transferring of photos from your iPhone to Windows 10. Kindly verify if you are using any photo application to move the photos. Are you getting any error messages?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The duplicate issue just started today after I tried to fix the problem with recognition, following advice given here.&nbsp; It is a problem that I'd like to solve but it's secondary.&nbsp; The real issue is that my hew iphone photos are not being recognized by Windows.</p>

 Windows 10 then reinstall and that corrected the problem. How do I successfully uninstall W10 then reinstall in a clean boot?

            Hi DIane.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Outlook Express is no longer supported in Windows.  Are you referring to Office Outlook?  
<br />
<br />If neither then I'd set up Windows 10 Mail app which is what works best in Windows 10 to sync your various web and Office Mail accounts into one Inbox with a huge ad-free Reading pane.  
<br />
<br />See here to set it up:  <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2488072,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2488072,00...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Outlook Express, formerly known as Microsoft Internet Mail and News is a discontinued email client that is included with Internet Explorer 3.0 through 6.0. Support for the said email app ended.
<br />
<br />I suggest you to try the mail app built in on Windows 10 or go back to a Windows restore point.
<br />
<br />Regards.

            Outlook Express was first replaced by Windows Mail (7.0) in Windows Vista more than 10 years ago. Windows Mail was later succeeded by Windows Live Mail included with Windows Essentials. 
<br />
<br />Windows Live Mail 2012 was eventually discontinued with the release of Windows Mail - which is a next generation email client in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Users will need to consider other options if they want to move from Outlook Express or Windows Live Mail in Windows 10. Migrating to Windows Mail in Windows 10 is only part of the process. I am sure you have email messages in Outlook Express you would still like to access. For that, I recommend you download and install Mozilla Thunderbird.

<p>Outlook Express never worked with Windows 10. It was a component of Windows XP, and hasn't worked with any version since then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are saying that Outlook Express used to work with Windows 10, you are mistaken, and you undoubtedly mean some other program, not Outlook Express. Please clarify what program that is.</p>

    <title>Upgraded Motherboard, Win10 won&#39;t activate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> calebedwards  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgraded Motherboard, Win10 won&#39;t activate</h2>
                    <p>This problem is kind of layered. I upgraded for free from windows 7, and recently changed mobo and cpu to upgrade. After upgrading Windows 10 wasn't activating, and the troubleshooter kept saying the servers were busy, so I hit the internet looking for an
 answer since I have a microsoft account and a digital license. I found a page talking about the problem and somebody said that entering a default windows 10 key and then waiting a few days would resolve the issue. I changed it to the default key&nbsp;</p>
<pre><em>***Sensitive information was removed by the Forum Moderator***</em></pre>
<p>This gave me the error that windows can't connect to my organizations activation server. I waited a few days and nothing was happening, so I decided to just do a fresh install and hope that fixed it. Upon doing the reset option in windows settings, Win10
 was still not activated, and that default key was still there. I thought maybe that was the problem so I removed it from the registry and the settings window, but it generated another key in its place giving me the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried logging out of and back into my win10 account and that has done nothing, and the troubleshoot option simply says I am not connected to the internet. I have my original windows 7 key but trying to enter it now says that it is invalid. What other
 steps can I take, or is waiting for a week or so the best option here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Caleb</p>

            It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.<br />
<br />
If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.<br />
<br />
If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.<br />
<br />
If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.<br />

            I bought the key for this build and then took the free upgrade when it was offered, so it wasn't pre-installed. Is there any way to check which version it is? I was trying to see if my account even has the digital license still but as far as I am aware
 from searching there is no way to tell. I'd rather just know if activation is even possible at this point so I can, if needed, just buy a license somewhere.&nbsp;

<ul>
<li>Reboot the machine with your Windows Repair CD, then use System Restore to set Windows back by a few days (works only if you changed the password recently).</li><li>Log on as Administrator in Safe Mode, then reset the password to your usual account (the password is usually blank).</li><li>Insert your USB flash disk with the password keyfile (works only if you took the time to create such a keyfile).</li><li>Use the password hint (works only if you created a hint and if it is good enough to let you guess the password)</li><li>Check your paper records (works only if you jotted down the password somewhere)</li></ul>
<div>
<div>When finished, plan ahead a little and create, test and document a spare admin account, same as you have a spare house key for emergencies. This will save you an enormous amount of trouble.</div>

<h2>            VERY AGGRAVATING&#33;&#33;&#33; Windows Media Player makes unwanted changes to music file names and details.</h2>
                    <p>I'm using WMP 12 on WIN7 but they all exhibit this behavior as far as I know. I have been ripping music since WIN95.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I make my own CD's from various sources and then I eventually rip them into WMP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, if I rip a CD with, say, various artists on it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manually move them into appropriate artist directories and&nbsp;change the details of each file within either MS Explorer or WMP to store them physically and logically where I want them to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I let the files&nbsp;get ripped with generic 'track xx' information or I edit the disc contents within WMP prior to ripping. Later I may add comments to individual files using MS Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, when I'm looking for a specific song by&nbsp;Artist X I know exactly where to find that single. I don't want WMP to search a&nbsp;terabyte&nbsp;of HD for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say a ripped file gets lost or corrupted. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I&nbsp;take the original CD and try to rip even&nbsp;ONE song from it&nbsp;again,&nbsp;WMP goes out and UNDOES all of my manual changes to ALL of the files that originally&nbsp;came from that CD, even commercial ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a scratch CD with Artist A [whole album] and various other singles from other artists on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ripped it all as Artist A and manually renamed and moved the odds and ends to be with their matching artists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Years later, I needed to re-rip ONE file from one of the various artists, NOT Artist A.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I knew something bad was going to happen when I saw the disc display in WMP&nbsp;as a mish-mash generic track title and artists, some checked as already ripped, some not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked RIP on one song only and proceeded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After it ripped my ONE song the entirety of the [unchecked] album by&nbsp;Artist A was renamed to&nbsp;the generic file names and unknown artist that it had been&nbsp;prior to my first rip of this scratch CD years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On its own, WMP decided to remove all of my custom edits for the entire original contents of that CD, even the ones I was not making any desired changes to in this session.<br />
<br />
Now I have to search my HD to find the odds and ends&nbsp;to rename and re-edit them so they make sense to ME.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY DOES IT DO THAT?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do we&nbsp;make WMP forget that a given CD media has already been ripped so it won't go making unapproved changes to files already on the HD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we make WMP just chill out and NOT do any background file manipulation to manually-edited files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In these cases, would it help to change my target rip directory to something else? I'm just trying to get the files ripped so I can manipulate them further before final storage under WMP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi David...</p>
<p>Yep - I've been caught out by this too - very frustrating! You do have to remember never to reload a CD if you have changed the properties of part of it, otherwise it'll reset everything.</p>
<p>My method for avoiding this is to have a second user account. I use this for both high-quality versions of favourite music (to avoid duplication in my main mp3 library) and for work-in-progress on re-arranging files if I want them to appear in a different
 context such as you have described. Then once sorted they can be cut and pasted to the main account with no risk of conflict. Keep the second account as a standard-user and you can permit yourself access to it without needing to switch user all the time. (But
 do open it to load CDs that may conflict with your existing library.)</p>
<p>As regards getting WMP to leave things unaltered I suspect that's a non-starter unless you keep the files out of the library which rather defeats the object. Not a bad idea to back up the altered versions away from the library location&nbsp;though, then at least
 you can reinstate them if an error occurs.</p>
<p>So - more a work-around than a solution but this method has helped me... Cheers, Ric.</p>

            <p>Ric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your explanations and advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know where WMP keeps its database of music it has already seen and cataloged? It would be nice to keep a copy of it somewhere WMP can't change it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep all of my music files on external hard drives. Sometimes I open WMP and it claims there's nothing in my Media Library, yet the HD is sitting there fat, dumb and happy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually, WMP may wake up and start building the Library again. This is annoying as it should already know what's there and the thing I'm looking for may not have been scanned in yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hold on...<br />
</p>
<p>The weirdest thing just happened. I was looking at my music library and noticed it had only a small portion of the artists I know are there. As I was watching it, it got SMALLER until all the music was gone. Then it &nbsp;started"Updating Media Library" as I
 watched and it is slowly finding all my music again.<br />
</p>
<p>Perhaps whatever deleted the contents in an orderly way just now has been happening randomly all along, Thoughts?<br />
</p>
<p>What do you know about .wav files in WMP? I have a few that it sees but it doesn't automatically pick up such information as artist or my preferred album titles. I can't get int othe fields under Windows Explorere but I CAN add the details under WMP. But
 whenever the inventory needs to be rebuilt the files are sent to the UNKNOWN ALBUM area and my carefully entered information is gone. I have to add it again. I'm thinking it must store those entries in a volatile place like it does with the overall Media Library
 information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave</p>

            <p>Thanks for the update, Dave...</p>
<p>A couple of points - you mention 'I keep all of my music files on external hard
 WMP) - maybe another good reason for having another (or more than one extra) user account... Also have you optimized your relevant external drive music folders to be music folders? (see the 'Tip' right at the foot of this page...) Set the parent folder and
 check the box 'apply to subfolders'</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/Change-folder-options </p>
<p>
</p><p>Wav files - you have rightly spotted that these don't take tagging (or very limited tagging in some instances). This is another reason I keep my wav. files in the separate user a/c because there are invariably some&nbsp;that show as&nbsp;'unknown' but as long as they
 are not in my main library that's not an issue.</p>
<p>All the WMP data files are in hidden system folders and I am not sure the file is in a format Windows will open - I'll have a look at that for you and report back.</p>
<p>Cheers, Ric.</p>

            <p>Dave: which format is WMP set to rip to: MP3, WMA, or WAV? As you have already noticed ripping to WAV can cause tagging issues and isn't recommended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In WMP, please go to <strong>Tools </strong>- <strong>Options</strong> - <strong>
Library</strong> (press Ctrl+M if you don't see the Tools menu). Is <strong>Retrieve additional information from the Internet</strong> ticked? If you untick it, does that stop WMP from making unwanted changes to the files' tags (aka details)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same question for the <strong>Rename music files using rip music settings</strong> setting. That one could be causing the unwanted file renames.</p>

<h2>            How to PERMANENTLY keep wallpaper&#63; Every time I restart the computer the wallpaper changes back to a solid color&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I have been trying to change up my settings on my Windows XP computer. So I changed the appearance from blue to silver, and my wallpaper suddenly changed to solid gray! So, I tried changing it back to this picture I made and it remained the solid color!
 After changing the appearance back to normal and trying so many times, I got it to change!!! But, when I shut the computer down and turn it back on/restart it, the background changes right back!!! How do I get the wallpaper to PERMANENTLY be there? Thank you!!!

            <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding this concern about how you can boot non-UEFI mode from the same disk. It would be best to reach your computer manufacturer about this, since this is no longer scope of Windows. To set an expectation, every computer was manufactured with unique
<strong>UEFI/BIOS</strong>. A much accurate guide on how to modify its settings can be provided by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Just want to mention that legacy BIOS does not support GPT partitioning. So if your hard drive is set up with UEFI and GPT, you won't be able to access the hard disk unless you boot with UEFI.</p>

<p><span>Hey brumby,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 7 supports most modern video and audio codecs<em>and</em> container formats. However it doesn’t support
</span><span>Matroska video files as it doesn’t have native mkv splitter. Using DivX plus you should be able to play mkv files. Now if there’s no sound, try installing audio decoder and
 processor filter from third party source. Please use your favorite search engine and see which one serves the purpose.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> dgeltz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 shows BSOD</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My girlfriend's computer has the blue screen of death issue and I have done a few different methods on these forums to recover the laptop, but none have worked. Upon starting the computer, the blue screen has an error code: 0xc0000185 and also says a required
 device is not connected or can't be accessed. To throw it out there early on, this laptop does NOT come with a CD drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I press F8, I am taken back to the blue screen with error code: 0xc0000001 on the file: WINDOWS\system32\winload.efi</p>
<p>I followed another method: Shift + F8 immediately after restarting computer and I am taken back to the blue screen before I can complete any other steps. Any help on this issue would be much appreciated! Thank you in advance</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.</p>
<p>This issue may occur either due to corrupt Windows startup files. This may also happen due to corrupt installed drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might have opened BIOS(<strong>Basic Input/Output System</strong>) which shows date and time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>run automatic repair from Windows recovery environment
</strong>and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow these instructions to get to the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>. You may need to connect a keyboard to complete the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have installation media for Windows 8.1, start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>",
 do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>"
 to start the Windows recovery environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the Windows recovery environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the Windows recovery environment, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>Automatic Repair</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Automatic repair may take some time to complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may <strong>create Windows installation media </strong>using the following article:<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Create installation media for Windows 8.1</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</span></a></p>

<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>What are the troubleshooting you have tried to fix the issue?</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>Oracle 10g Express Edition Database is a compatible application to install on Windows 8.1. This error message occurs due to the following reasons:</font></font></span><br />
- You run the Setup program from a virtual drive created through the subst command.
<br />
- The driver IDriver.exe is not registered correctly.<br />
- The installer Msiexec.exe is not registered correctly.<br />
- The user account does not have permission to access the C:\Windows\Installer folder.<br />
- An older version of the Windows Installer engine was installed from a network drive that is no longer available.<br />
- The user account does not have permission to install software on the computer.<br />
- Another instance of Msiexec.exe is running.<br />
- Another Windows Installer-based Setup program is running.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div>I would suggest you to rename the Install Script folder on the computer. You can follow the methods accordingly:</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Rename the InstallShield folder.</strong></div>
<div>a) In File Explorer , open the following folder: </div>
<div><strong>DRIVE \Program Files\Common Files\</strong><br />
b) Right-click the Installshield folder, and then click Rename.<br />
c) Type InstallShield1, and then press ENTER.<br />
d) Try to install the application.<br />
<br />
If the problem continues to occur, go to Method 2.<br />
<strong>Method 2: Locate and then close the files</strong></div>
<div>To resolve this problem, locate, and then close the Idriver.exe and Msiexec.exe files. To do this, follow these steps:</div>
<div>a) Open the Task Manager. Type task manager on the start screen and click on
<strong>Task Manager</strong>.<br />
b) On the<strong> Processes </strong>tab, locate <strong>idriver.exe </strong>and
<strong>msiexec.exe</strong>.<br />
c) Select each instance of both processes, and then click<strong> End Process</strong>.<br />
d) Click<strong> End Process </strong>on each Windows Task Manager window that opens.<br />
e) Close the Task Manager.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to install the game in clean boot state and check if any other services or programs are leading to this issue.<br />
Please follow the link below to boot the computer into clean boot state:</div>

 not clear as of now, whether Method 2 should have any positive outcome on my PC, as the said processes do not exist. Please HELP..&nbsp;</div>

<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem and I fixed it by using the built in Administrator account. An account belonging to the Administrators group would not work it had to be the build in account.</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 laptop boot failure with new battery - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 laptop boot failure with new battery</h2>
                    My Dell M6600 laptop battery is losing power so I bought a new Dell battery and installed it. The computer started correctly with the old battery and on AC adapter. On the new battery it will boot through POST and start to load windows 10 then completely
 shut down the laptop.&nbsp; I starts correctly and runs fine on AC adapter power. The battery shows full charge and will run the computer on battery after it has booted un on AC adapter power. I need it to boot when only on battery power.

            <p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that since the issue occurs after using the new battery, there might be some driver conflicts as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check in Device manager for any conflicts. If yes, then reinstall the drivers by using the latest version from Dell website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I recommend you to update the BIOS by contacting Dell.</p>
<p>Refer: <strong><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/precision-m6600/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Drivers for Dell M6600 laptop
</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>BIOS Disclaimer:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><br />
Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
&nbsp;
<p>If the issue still persists, then DELL would be the best place for support since this issue seems to be on the hardware side as Windows OS will not affect the POST status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Reply to the post for further assistance on this issue, we will be happy to help you.</p>

<h2>            Windows XP is Slow - Process Explorer shows Constant Hardware Interrupts</h2>
                    
<p>XP Professional SP3</p>
<p>AMD 965 x4 Black Edition running 4gb Corsair memory</p>
<p>Gigabyte Motherboard</p>
<p>With XP Pro running and no other programs other than Process Explorer, Process Explorer shows continuous 'Interrupts' at 23% avg, with System Idle running about 75%. When looking at the individual cores, it is entirely the 4th core running at 100%. It does
 this with the network connection enabled or disabled. I've tried individually disabling processes and devices with no changes. There was also no change after reinstalling software and drivers. The interrupts are not there when running in any of the 'Safe Modes'.
 I searched though the internet and tried suggested solutions with no success. This does slow down my operation quite a bit (25%). Other independent forms report that it happens on various brands of motherboards. Mostly with XP, but a few in Vista. And the
 the problem seems to have to do with the Microsoft/Atapi drivers on the hard drives. A lot of them reported the problems after Microsoft updates were applied. Some were solved, some are still searching for a solution. I'm in the latter.</p>

<p>Have you checked to be sure the devices attached to the IDE controllers aren't running in PIO mode instead of DMA mode?</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/817472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IDE ATA and ATAPI disks use PIO mode after multiple time-out or CRC errors occur</a></p>
<p>Check the controller in Device Manager to see what the settings are. &nbsp;Note that in the event you do find the device is using PIO instead of DMA, simply changing the drop-down will not be adequate - you have to uninstall and reinstall the controller as described
 in the workaround section of the referenced article.</p>
<p>If that isn't the case, since you're running XP, it seems like you'll be spending some time with KernRate and RATTV3, to try to figure out what's causing the interrupts... x_x</p>
