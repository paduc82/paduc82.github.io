    <title>Surface Book Blue Tooth Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roger stenson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book Blue Tooth Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>Following my last update&nbsp; to OS build&nbsp; 16299.248. the blue tooth has disappeared from my machine. The system reports that it is fully up to date and in this processor is not involved in any way with the Insider Program.&nbsp; That activity takes place on my development
 machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver reports that it is disabled due to 'a problem', unspecified.</p>
<p>It was suggested that I update the driver for my product which is an ' Avastar Blue Tooth Radio Adaptor' .
</p>
<p>Following a system search my system reports that I am on the latest driver for this device.</p>
<p>All my blue tooth has gone so no mouse&nbsp; (Arc&nbsp; Touch Blue Tooth)&nbsp; , earphones, or watch connection.</p>
<p>I would be grateful to hear if there is any way of rescuing this situation &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Roger Stenson</p>

            <p>Depending on the options you chose during setup, you might have to reinstall your applications.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
What are my options for what I want to keep?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you can keep depends on the current version of Windows running on your PC. These options only show up if the current version of Windows supports them.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the options you might see:<br />
&nbsp;¬∑ Windows settings. Windows settings like Ease of Access, your desktop background, or Internet favorites and history will be kept. Not all settings will be moved.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>¬∑ Personal files. Anything saved in the User folder is considered a personal file, like the Documents and Desktop folders.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>¬∑ Apps. Some apps are compatible with Windows 8&nbsp; and will just work after Windows 8 is installed. Some apps might have to be reinstalled after Windows 8 finishes installing, so be sure to find the installation discs and installers for apps you want to keep.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>¬∑ Nothing. Delete everything and replace your current version with a copy of Windows 8. Your personal files will be moved to a windows.old folder.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose Nothing, make sure to do the following before you continue:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>¬∑ Back up your files to an external hard disk, DVD or CD, USB flash drive, or network folder.<br />
&nbsp;¬∑ Find the installation discs and installers for the apps you know will work in Windows 8&nbsp; and need to reinstall.<br />
&nbsp;¬∑ If you use a fingerprint reader or other biometric device to sign in to your computer, make sure you write down your password. You‚Äôll have to sign in by typing your user name and password the first time you use Windows 8<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Depending on the version of Windows you are upgrading from, you will get keep the following:</p>
<p>Windows Settings, Personal Files and Apps - Windows 7</p>
<p>Windows Settings, Personal Files - Windows 7 and Vista</p>
<p>Personal Files - Windows XP<br />

    <title>Type Cover backlight switches itself randomly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adriankomiÂÑski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Type Cover backlight switches itself randomly</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes when I work on my SP 2017 with keyboard backlight enabled (as pretty much always), I find that the keyboard switches its light intensity by itself. Today it went completely nuts and actually disabled the backlight completely, in the middle of my
 typing. It did not disconnect (as it occasionally does, which in itself is a separate issue), but simply turned off the backlight, which I then had to restore manually. On other occasions, it will simply turn the backlight intensity on from 1 to 2, and then
 2 to 3. There's no pattern to it really, or at least I never discovered one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never heard about this thing being controlled by the light sensor (which I have disabled anyway), so my question is: what's going on? Am I hitting some secret shortcut? I'm obviously aware of the Fn+F7 combo, but there's no way I could accidentally
 hit a button as far north as F7 is.</p>

<p>Hi Adrian, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This can be a hardware issue. However, here are some solutions you can try. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Install the Surface and Windows updates</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In many cases, downloading and installing the latest updates for Windows and your Surface will fix the issue. On how to install the latest updates, click
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023505/surface-install-surface-and-windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Force shutdown your device</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.</li><li>
<p>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.<br />
The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.</p>
</li><li>
<p>After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.</p>
</li><li>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If force restarting your device doesn't fix the problem, try reinstalling the driver for your Surface Cover.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select the search box in the taskbar, enter<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>device manager</strong>, and select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Device Manager</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>in the results.</li><li>Expand<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Keyboards</strong>.</li><li>Right-click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Surface Type Cover Filter Device</strong>.</li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Uninstall</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Restart your Surface. It'll automatically download and install the Surface Cover driver the next time you connect to the Internet.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, you can bring the Type Cover to a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/answer-desk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Store near you</a> and have it checked by one of our personnel. If you're outside the US, contact our

<h2>            how to increase video ram on a laptop</h2>
                    I'm on a laptop with 4GB RAM and 512 VRAM and inorder to play NSF the run, my VRAM didn't meet the minimum system requirement to play that game. And I've been scouring the internet about it and have found a way of increasing them at the cost of RAM. What
 will happen to the system if I push the VRAM to 1024 MB VRAM on a 4GB RAM ?

<h2>            Windows 8 Pro says already installed on another computer</h2>
                    I installed Windows 8 and soon after had to do a system refresh. Now it is saying "Activate Windows". When I try to enter my product code it says "This version of Windows 8 is being used on another computer. Add or buy a new product key." So I did another
 refresh and got the same message. I don't understand why it's doing this. Can someone give me some answers ?

<p>Why can't I activate Windows?</p>
</b>
<p>If you received a message saying that Windows couldn't be activated, here are a few reasons why it might not have worked, and some things you can try to fix the problem.</p>
<b>
<p>You upgraded to Windows 8, but didn't have a previous version of Windows installed (error 0xC004F061)</p>
</b>
<p>If you see error 0xC004F061 when you try to activate Windows 8, it means that you're using a product key for an upgrade version of Windows 8 and a previous version of Windows wasn't on your PC when Windows 8 was installed. To install an upgrade version of
 Windows 8, you must already have Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP installed on your PC.
</p>
<p>If you formatted the drive before the upgrade version of Windows 8 was installed, you won't be able to use your upgrade product key to activate Windows 8. To activate Windows 8, you'll need to install your previous version of Windows, and then reinstall
 Windows 8. For help with the activation process, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=260480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u>contact support</u></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>A different version of Windows or product key might have been used as part of a repair</p>
</b>
<p>If you took your PC to a repair shop or to a friend who builds and fixes PCs, it's possible that a different version of Windows was installed to complete a repair. Or if the repair shop or your friend used a different product key for your PC, that key might
 be blocked if it was used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow.</p>
<p>If Windows was activated before you took it to the repair shop or your friend, then re-entering the product key that came with your PC or original copy of Windows might solve the problem. You can also try reinstalling your original version of Windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>One copy of Windows might have been installed on multiple PCs</p>
</b>
<p>If you have one copy of Windows and installed it on more than one PC, activation might not work because the product key has already been used on another PC, or it's being used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow. Normally, the rule
 to follow for most copies of Windows is 1:1, meaning that one copy of Windows can be installed only on one PC.</p>
<p>If your product key is being used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow, you'll need to buy a product key for each one of your PCs in order to activate them.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>Counterfeit software</p>
</b>
<p>If you have a counterfeit copy of Windows that wasn't published and licensed by Microsoft, activation won't work because Microsoft won't be able to create a match between your PC's hardware profile and your 25-character product key.</p>
<p>Microsoft's <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=71144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>How to Tell</u></a> website can help you figure out if your copy of Windows is counterfeit. If it is, you'll probably need to
 buy a new copy of Windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>Used PC</p>
</b>
<p>If you bought a used PC with Windows already installed on it, it's possible that the product key is being used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow.</p>
<p>You might need to ask the seller you bought the used PC from for the original Windows DVD and product key. If the DVD and product key aren't available, or if you tried them and still can't activate, you might need to buy a new key.

            None of those apply to me. When I get my hard drive replaced on Monday , which dell is going to send one formatted with W7 because that's what the computer came with , I'll reinstall and see what happens. If it persist I will call MS like you suggested
 before. Thanks a bunch !

<h2>            Homegroup problem Windows 10 -- computer that set up Homegroup no longer exists</h2>
                    <p>Short version:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up the original homegroup on a windows 7 machine. That machine hasn't been on the homegroup in years. It's gone gone gone. I have three other computers, two of which were on the homegroup... until I upgraded them to Windows 10. Now none of the computers
 are on the homegroup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But they know it's out there. They all refer me to the computer (let's call it, "Dave's-Computer") to get the homegroup password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave's not here now. Can't get the homegroup password from Dave's computer. Yet I can't figure out a way to just tell my three computers that, and create a new homegroup. It's getting to be insufferable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jason -- Who's really not angry, just misunderstood.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Aswin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you missed it in my post. They aren't ON that homegroup. They simply see it out there, and the only option I have is to try and join it. Except it's really not there, since the computer it was created on (Dave's-Computer) no longer exists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So no way to "leave" it since they aren't in the homegroup. And no way to "join" it since I don't have the password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I kept digging through the depths of the web and finally found something that worked. Figured I would share it here since I've read probably 50 posts with people having a similar problem, but no final answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is your problem, i.e. a phantom homegroup which none of your existing computers are on, but insist is out there, do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Turn OFF ALL OF YOUR COMPUTERS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Once they are all off, turn on the primary computer you want to create the homegroup from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Wait a few minutes for everything to boot up, including the homegroup services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. You should now be able to create a new homegroup! Yay!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently the problem is that the existence of the phantom homegroup remains in some sort of cache in each computer, and all of your computers "see" this somehow, and become convinced there's a homegroup out there, waiting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, powering off all the computers breaks the connection, and allows you to start from scratch and get homegroup working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jason H is rather satisfied now</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 and Dock with Multiple monitors</h2>
                    I have a Surface Pro 4, the SP dock, and two Dell P2415Q monitors connected with mDP to DP cables.&nbsp; I can't get both monitors to work.&nbsp; I've updated the dock firmware and tried just about everything I've found searching the web.&nbsp; When I go into Display
 Settings it shows the SP display, one of the external monitors, and a teeny, tiny display labeled "3" which will not connect.&nbsp; I can actually get either of the displays to work... but not at the same time.&nbsp; Am I missing something here?&nbsp; The dock has two mDPs.&nbsp;
 It SHOULD be as simple as connecting two external monitors and docking the SP!&nbsp; :(

<p>Have there been any updates on this? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am experiencing the same issue. I have a Surface Pro 3, an SP Dock, and two HP EliteDisplay E221 monitors that I am attempting to connect to the Dock. I can connect either monitor with a mDP to DP cable and the monitor works. I borrowed a mDP to VGA active
 adapter and I am able to run both monitors from the dock (Monitor 1: mDP to DP cable | monitor 2: mDP to VGA active adapter).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I connect both monitors using mDP to DP cables, neither monitor works. I am running the monitors in native resolution. Changing the resolution does not help. Connecting one monitor directly to the surface mDP port and leaving one connected to
 the dock does not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping not to have to purchase the additional adapter when it seems that this should work without an adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dock firmware is up to date.</p>

    <title>Question regarding Windows 10 Version 1709 Clean Install and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gabe1972  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question regarding Windows 10 Version 1709 Clean Install and Activation with a Digital License.</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my Windows 10 Pro 1703 desktop to 1709 through Windows Update and it's working well so far.&nbsp; I will, most likely, perform a clean install in a month or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is regarding my laptop.&nbsp; I have a laptop with Windows 10 Pro 64bit version 1703 that is activated with a digital license.&nbsp; I would like to perform a clean install of 1709 right from the start (from a USB flash drive (already created)).&nbsp;
<strong>My question is, will my laptop activate with the digital license from a clean install of 1709, or do I need to first upgrade it to 1709 through Windows Update (like I did with my desktop), allow it to activate, then perform the clean install of 1709?</strong>&nbsp;
 I'm reasonably sure I can just perform the clean install of 1709 right from the start without needing to upgrade it to 1709 through Windows Update, but I wanted to make sure before it would activate doing it this way before I did so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, I'm reasonably sure that the digital license tied to the computer is NOT tied to the VERSION of Windows 10 (as in 1703 vs 1709), but rather just Windows 10 itself (it must be the same version as in Home or Pro, though, of course).&nbsp; And if that's
 the case, I don't need to upgrade it first and I can just do the clean install of 1709 from the USB and it will activate just fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if this is in any way confusing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key
</span></span><span><span>you already own</span></span><span><span>to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.</span></span></p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, but that doesn't really answer my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a very simple question that needs a very simple answer.&nbsp; The laptop presently has 1703.&nbsp; If I do a clean install using the user created USB of 1709, will it activate with a digital license without issue, or do I first need to upgrade it to 1709 through
 Windows update, allow it to activate with the digital license, then perform the clean install of 1709?&nbsp; Do the versions matter (as in 1703 vs 1709), or do the digital license and the activation servers only care that it's Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hate copy/paste answers that don't answer the question, or maybe do, but in some convoluted way.&nbsp; I don't care about product keys.&nbsp; I don't need one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The laptop presently has 1703 installed and activated with a digital license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two possible answers:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it will activate when performing a clean install of 1709.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, you must first upgrade to 1709 through Windows Update, allowing it to activate with the digital licence, then perform the clean install.</p>

<p>I agree with Barb Bowman to take your machine to a Microsoft Retail Store and have them test your charger.&nbsp; If no retail stores are nearby, try a Best Buy.&nbsp; They will test your charger.&nbsp; If defective, they&nbsp;often have&nbsp;replacement chargers available, but you
 will likely need to pay for it (around $100).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my Pro 3 daily for work and have experienced this same problem - several times.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now on charger #4!&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, there is a charger power cord recall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing a user definitely expects is not to have charger problems.&nbsp; This is a commodity, not cutting edge technology!&nbsp; Either the charger design is defective or the manufacturing processes are defective.&nbsp; If this were a car, there would be a recall!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft!&nbsp; Step up and fix the root cause and issue free replacements!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Display Help - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Display Help</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a bit of an issue with my text display. Basically, some programs have blurry or fuzzy text. I had this problem when I went from 8 to 8.1 as well, which I fixed by going to display from my control panel and selecting 'let me choose one scaling
 level for all my displays'. I went to do that to solve my issue again after updating to Windows 10, but it seems that option is no longer there! I've looked over a few internet pages and tutorials and what-not and every solution I could find was involved with
 that option. Where is it? Am I just missing it? Did the 'let me choose one scaling level for all my displays' option move somewhere else? Help is much appreciated!&nbsp;</p>

            I'm having this issue too and it's not an issue with display drivers. The option of "let me choose one scaling level for all my displays" has either been removed or placed somewhere obscure. Can we please get a fix for this because it's really annoying
 having fuzzy text in programs

            Updating the graphics cards didn't seem to help for me. However, what I did end up doing was turning my display to 100% instead of the default 125%. You can get to this through your display tab in your control panel, or through settings. Turning it to
 100% solved the blur problem, but things were now way too small for my comfort. I went through to all of the places that I could barely read and changed the text size to a larger setting. This is working for me now; nothing is uncomfortable to read anymore.
 It is a lot of steps, and it still isn't perfect, but this is the best solution I've found for now.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi! Opening the device manager is the perfect exemple of blurry text in windows 10. Even these windows features are blurry. In Windows 8.1, there was a simple solution when you changed the text scale, and put it back the way it was. In windows 10, it works
 if you change the text scale to 100%, but it's way too small for me. And it's not a display driver problem, it's really how it is (just notice how many people talking about this problem). I have one simple question: Is there a way to have at least a 125% text
 scale that is not blurry? it's just a bit annoying and it hurts our eyes!</p>
<p>

            <p>I have the same problem. The text is initially clear but quickly degrades - in some places the problem is worse than others, but results from the taskbar search menu are very bad and also text in Thunderbird. I have noticed it in Microsoft Edge too. I have

<h2>            USB devices stopped working after boot-up</h2>
                    
<p>Well basically, I have build a custom machine running 64-bit Windows 7 Prof. I am using an HP Wireless Comfort Desktop and now it has stopped working after windows 7 loads. Before the loading takes place, I can perefctly use the leyboard (e.g. bios). I have
 reset the bios, run windows repair, tried different USB ports and tried running Safe Mode but with no success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><span>Hey kevinp93,</span></p>
<p><span>Does it happen with all the USB devices or jus with the keyboard?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If it happens only with respect to the keyboard, then<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Uninstall all the drivers for the wireless desktop from programs and features and from device manager and download and install from
 the below link and see if it works fine or not:<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=da-77622-1&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=uk&amp;product=3840650&amp;sw_lang=&amp;os=4063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=da-77622-1&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=uk&amp;product=3840650&amp;sw_lang=&amp;os=4063</span></span></a><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Uninstall drivers from device manager:</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Device Manager by clicking the<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking
<strong>System and Security</strong>, and then, under <strong>System</strong>, clicking
<strong>Device Manager</strong>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span><span><span>‚Äå</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the list of hardware categories, find the device that you want to update, and then double-click the device name.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the device to uninstall the drivers.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 the computer to reinstall the drivers.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Uninstall from programs and features:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If not, I suggest you to perform a system restore from WinRE (Windows recovery Environment) and check.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To access the System Recovery Options menu:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have a Windows 7 installation disc, you need to restart (boot) your computer using the installation
 disc. If you do not restart your computer from the disc, the option to repair your computer will not appear.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer using the computer's power button.</span></p>
<p>
<span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do one of the following:</span></p>
<p>
<span>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If
 the Windows logo appears, you need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to repair, and then press and hold F8.</span></p>
<p>
<span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the<strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong> screen, use the arrow keys to highlight
<strong>Repair your computer</strong>, and then press Enter. (If <strong>Repair your computer</strong> isn't listed as an option, then your computer doesn't include preinstalled recovery options, or your network administrator has turned them off.)</span></p>
<p>
<span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select a keyboard layout, and then click<strong>Next</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the<strong>System Recovery Options</strong> menu, click a tool to open it. Means select System restore option.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check with a different mouse and a keyboard.</span></p>

<h2>            TV not picking up HDMI feed from Laptop</h2>
                    I have a HDMI cord connecting my laptop (Dell XPS M1530) to my Samsung LCD tv. I was previously able to simply plug the two units together and my TV would automaticaly pick up my HDMI feed. However, it now seems this autoplay feature isn't working. Oddly
 enough my computer makes a sound when i plug and unplug the cord into the laptop
<br />
(as if its acknowledging I'm connected) but my tV never sees to pick up the feed. I've checked the TV and it doesn't appear to be the problem.

            Hi CanerA, when you say mono, do you mean sound from one side only or the same sound from both sides?
<br />
<br />A good first step is to run the Audio Troubleshooter:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - Playing Audio
<br />
<br />Run that troubleshooter to see if it resolves this issue . . .

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I play a test sound from speakers properties, sometimes right channel is slightly audible, even though&nbsp;balance shows equal levels. after I "fiddle" balance manually and return them to the previous position, this time I can hear one side's test sound
 clearly from other side, I mean at least 70% of left sound plays from the right side while the left side is 100%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
        </p>
