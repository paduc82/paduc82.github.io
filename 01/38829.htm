<h2>            My Xbox is having a crisis</h2>
                    There's this problem to where it says "There's a problem getting this content right now." This is happening to where I cant even see my own profile party and full, I cant see who Im sending messages to, cant join my friends game or partys but I can accept
 invites. This is probably the worst thing that has happened to me on xbox so far. Wait thats not the only part, I cant see the store, mixer, community or even the gamepass Tab. I've done everything in my power to fix this yet nothing works, I may be the only
 one with this problem.

<p>Hi there Huddledcoin!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us! I'm unsure about what troubleshooting you have already done to your console but if you're not able to view much of anything, then that is definitely a problem. You may want to
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
perform a factory reset to your console</a> and select the option to keep your games and apps. This will delete any potentially damaging files that may be on your console's operating system and hopefully get you back in the game. Please be sure to be familiar
 with your credentials to log back into your profile (or other profiles) and your wifi network, if applicable.</p>
<p>

            Hi,&nbsp;XBF Amber M&nbsp;gave awesome helpful suggestions, If I was to add anything else that
 may be useful, I would suggest checking to make sure your subscription is still active, or another trick I've used is clearing the MAC address which is quick and easy. To clear the MAC Address go to settings - All settings - Network - Advanced Network - Alternate
 MAC address - Clear - Reset. Your console will restart at that point and hopefully you will be gaming again soon after.

            To add to all the other great advice here, I have found that sometimes hard rebooting your modem/router can clear up these type of issues when a fresh connction is there. I have also had success with the hard reset of the console. Hope it works out for
 you!

<h2>            Windows Defender is Preventing a Program from Running</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 30px">Hello! </p>
<p>Recently, I decided to start learning how to ROM hack, and to assist me, I got a somewhat obscure program called
<span style="color: rgba(133, 98, 0, 1)">FEBuilderGBA</span>, which was translated into English from Japanese by a colleague of mine. I got it and unzipped it, then ran a Windows Defender scan on all &gt;1000 files, none of which were marked as a potential threat. However,
 after double clicking on the application, it was blocked by Windows Defender, saying simply "<span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">Windows Defender SmartScreen has prevented a program from starting. Running this app might put your PC on risk</span>." Upon clicking "<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">More
 Info</span>" (which was below the message), it showed two lines, stating simply the file name ("<span style="color: rgba(133, 98, 0, 1)">FEBuilderGBA_28_1_18</span>") and the publisher ("Unknown Publisher"). The only thing I could do other than clicking the X in the top
 right was click the button stating simply "<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">Don't run</span>". Running as Admin did nothing, and it had the accesses needed to run. Another anti-malware program scanned it, as well as my Antivirus software, both running up no red
 flags. I am lost on what to do, because I cannot find this type of issue anywhere else on the support section of the Microsoft website.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">If anyone knows how to tell Windows Defender to "Except __ Program", or something else, please say something. I'd appreciate any help, thanks!</p>

            You should allow this program through Windows Defender.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Hi,<br />
<br />
We have various different bugchecks:<br />
<br />
<u><b>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (3b)</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>An exception happened while executing a routine that transitions from non-privileged code to privileged code.</i><br />
<br />
This bugcheck is generally related to a video driver issue, however hardware memory related is possibly as well.<br />
<br />
<u><b>SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M (1000007e)</b></u><br />
<br />
A system thread generated an exception that the error handler did not catch.<br />
<br />
Usual causes are a bug in a device driver.<br />
<br />
We have an access violation in this dump - c0000005. If we run an .exr on the 3rd parameter of the bugcheck (exception record address) we get the following:<br />
<br />
3: kd&gt; .exr 0xfffff88003fb3798<br />
ExceptionAddress: fffff880039e7da9 (<u><i><b>dxgmms1</b></i></u>!VidSchiSubmitRenderCommand+0x000000000000019d)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ExceptionCode: c0000005 (Access violation)<br />
<br />
We can see dxgmms1.sys is mentioned, which is the DirectX MMS system driver.<br />
<br />
Ensure you have the latest video card drivers. If you are already on the latest video card drivers, uninstall and install a version or a few versions behind the latest to ensure it's not a latest driver only issue. If you have already experimented with the
 latest video card driver and many previous versions, please give the beta driver for your card a try.<br />
<br />
<u><b>MEMORY_MANAGEMENT (1a)</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that a severe memory management error occurred.</i><br />
<br />
BugCheck 1A, {<u><i><b>41201</b></i></u>, fffff6800007c840, f970000260266847, fffffa80107f1bd0}<br />
<br />
The 1st parameter of the bugcheck is <i><b>41201 </b></i>which falls under the 'other' subtype in regards to this bugcheck. This means that an unknown memory management error occurred.<br />
<br />
<i><b>If you've already messed with video card driver versions, run a Memtest for NO LESS than ~8 passes (several hours):</b></i><br />
<br />
Memtest86+:<br />
<br />
<b>Download Memtest86+ here:</b><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a><br />
<br />
<b>Which should I download?</b><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
<b>How Memtest works:</b><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />
Any other questions, they can most likely be answered by reading this great guide here:<br />

<h2>            Remove read-only attribute from all files</h2>
                    I had to reinstall my OS (Vista Home Premium) on my Dell Inspiron E1505.&nbsp; Now all of my files, including the ones on my WD Passport, are marked read-only and I cannot get that changed.&nbsp; I have tried almost all of the other suggested remedies in this forum
 but none of them work.&nbsp; Several of them mention a security tab in the file properties window and I don't have that.&nbsp; Can someone please tell me how to change this as I have several files that need to be renamed.

            That's gonna take a while...for solving it I guess<br />
open Run type mmc go to file-&gt;add/remove snap inns and configure the policy for folders and users including you.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per description,Centrophorus Redragon Gaming mouse is not getting installed on your system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may face this issue only if while connecting the mouse the drivers were not installed properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to Uninstall and reinstall the mouse drivers from the device manager and check.</p>

            <p>Note: For me, my windows 10 upgrade was the issue. When I upgraded to Win 10, there was some sort of error in my registry that caused this error message any time I attempted to install a new driver:<br />
<br />
"The Configuration Registry Database is Corrupt"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting my PC to factory settings and updating then to 8.1 seems to make it stable and able to install new drivers.</p>

            <p>Look for c:\Windows.old which archives all of the old OS in it.&nbsp; Your files will be there under your User account so you can copy them out into the new User folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to why Programs, Files and settings were not carried over as normally happens in an in-place Upgrade, this could be due to Norton which causes more problems than anything I've seen in seven years of helping daily in Forums.&nbsp; It literally ruins the OS,
 and since an Upgrade is an inferior Install to begin with, likely caused yours to malfunction.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However since you appear to have Windows 10 now, please merely turn on the built-in protection at Settings&gt;Update and Security&gt;Defender.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then if there are any other problems, you can go over your install to check that it's set up correctly, optimize it for best performance, and repair most problems following the

            <p>You can copy them to an external USB Flash/Thumb drive (or an external USB drive). This should keep them safe from any changes you may make to either Windows 10 (if you decide to stay with 10) or if you go back to your previous version of Windows.</p>

<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />To better understand the issue and help resolve, could you please log to Skype web (web.skype.com)? Are you able to login there? 
<br />
<br />This will help us understand if the issue is with the account or with the Skype installation.
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week!

<h2>            How stupid do you have to be to think that the enforcement action &#91;Mod Removed- Profanity&#93; is actually going to work&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I got banned from communicating because some sensitive snowflake got mad that I tried to get revenge on him for killing me. He then messages me talking
<strong>[Mod Removed- Profanity]</strong> and then tells me he is going to ban me from live. How did Xbox not know that people were just going to abuse being apart of the enforcement unit. I suggest that Xbox gets rid of the enforcement action
<strong>[Mod Removed- Profanity]
</strong>as it just seems to be a social experiment gone wrong. I thought I was playing on a consul that treats all players equally. I didn't know certain players had certain privileges. I will be switching to a consul that respects all players equally and
 I suggest you all do the same.</p>

<p>He has no power to ban you and is only using empty threats, and probably tried to goad you into swearing etc. which WILL&nbsp;get you banned pretty fast. Reporting a player in isolation does nothing, action will only be taken against you if a sufficient number of cases against your account have been made, or if you clearly and obviously breach the TOS (e.g. by abusing someone). You should just block them and ignore them, they won't be able to do anything especially if you haven't done anything wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, you can check out complaints made against you at enforcement.xbox.com and then clicking on the reputation box. I've been accused by several people of 'Cheating' which is pretty amusing, I&nbsp;must have really beaten them badly to make them mad. As you can see it's had no effect on my account as I'm an Ambassador, and only people with great track records can become one.</p>
<p>The system is pretty fair, and so long as you don't swear you probably won't find yourself ever banned unless you've done something to earn it. Anyway, you can go to the enforcement site 24 hours after your ban first took&nbsp;place to&nbsp;file a dispute to have people look into the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

<p>Peace!</p>

<h2>            Adding shortcut to User desktop folder</h2>
                    <p>I created&nbsp; setup project in vs 2008 and added shortcut to project output by following steps.</p>
<p>1.In File system editor Right click on project output and click create shortcut to project output.</p>
<p>2.Rename shortcut and drag it to user desktop folder.</p>
<p>Shortcut is getting created on desktop but problem is that when you Right Click on the short cut it dose not show's Run As Administrator option.</p>
<p>Also when you open the properties of shortcut ,in shortcut tab,Target location is empty and in Target edit control it only display name of file insted of full path to project output file in application folder.</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1)&nbsp;Does the issue of ‚Äúrun as administrator‚Äù occur only with this file or all files?<br />
2)&nbsp;Do the properties for shortcut on other files also show up the same information as this file?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To work with this issue, I would suggest you try the following step.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Press and hold shift key on the keyboard and then right click the file. You should get the option run as administrator.
</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Check if you are able to open the file.</div>

            This is due to how the shortcut is created by the packaging system. &nbsp;Some other programs (notably Microsoft Office) also disable the Target box in Shortcut properties. &nbsp;To be able to have control and run-as-admin, you'll need to create your own shortcut
 manually.

            But As i created setup project, shortcut is automaticaly get&nbsp;placed on user desktop and it is not good practice to tell user to create shortcut manullay.Also our application need to Run as Admin very first time to create registry keys.

            <p>The option Run as Admin is not display only for shortcut that i have created.And also information like target, location is display properly for another shortcuts.I think this issue is regarding&nbsp;to installer package that i have created using VS 2008.</p>

<h2>            My computer isn&#39;t projecting to a second screen... any thoughts&#63; &#40;more detailed explanation in post&#41;</h2>
                    <p>
i have a Windows 8 Laptop, HP, Quad-core processor. my computer won't project to a second screen. it isnt working... it won't project to another monitor and it won't project to a TV through HDMI cable. i went into my control panel to see what was wrong and
 it said i was project to to a TINY screen.</p>
<p>
Here is when it stopped working: I was projecting to another monitor working on something and when i pulled the cord out it went black and the screen turned back on (like it's supposed to do) but then when i tried to plug it back in later... NOTHING HAPPENED!!
 i researched my problem for a long time, but could never find the solution.</p>
<p>
Could anyone help me out? I would be very grateful :3</p>

    <title>Reverting to Local account after re-activation with Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xredline  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reverting to Local account after re-activation with Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to revert back to using a Local account after a re-activation with a Microsoft Account after a hardware change?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why I'm asking is I'm planning on switching mobo/cpu, which would mean Windows 10 would need to be reactivated. Linking the license to a Microsoft account seems like the simplest (and probably only???) solution, but I would like to only use a
 local account, not a full Microsoft one, for the main windows user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will the activation disappear again if I revert to a Local Account? Maybe I can have two users, a Local for everyday use and a Microsoft one just for license activation?<br />
</p>
<p>I have a Windows 10 Pro N upgraded from a Windows 8.1 Pro N key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>xRedline</p>

<p>Switching to a local account will not affect the activation status. The activation is registered to the hardware, so changing hardware such as your motherboard can invalidate the activation status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had originally upgraded from a retail Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to the Windows 10 free upgrade, yes, you can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 came preinstalled with your computers motherboard, what is known as a an OEM license, then you cannot.

<h2>            Windows 10 - desktop now cuts off all around the edges of the screen</h2>
                    <p>H,</p>
<p>
</p><p>since the upgrade to windows 10 my desktop is displaying slightly larger than the screen display. (It cuts off enough to cut the date off in half on the bottom rhandside and similar on all 4 sides)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using an iiyama pl2273hd with a Nvidia Geforce GTX 660</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my drivers are up to date; ive just reinstalled them all</p>
<p>My screen resolution is at recommended settings</p>
<p>I did not have this problem with windows 8 or 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update I've also lost all sound and followed several steps in the help threads but to no luck
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help is appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Dave</p>

            <p>So ive self fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rolled back to 8.1 and still had the same problems. So it warranted more investigation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The desktop i've resized manually through the nvidia control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open nvidia control panel</p>
<p>2. select under display tab "Adjust desktop size and position"</p>
<p>3. select size tab</p>
<p>4. tick box in section 2 "enable desktop resizing"</p>
<p>5. Click resize and move till the arrows look correct</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sound issue i have no idea how it happened but monitor had set itself to mute in the digital menu, which i hadn't thought to check as id assumed it was a win 10 issue....</p>
<p>
</p><p>So either when the nvidia driver updated to win10 or when i updated my iiyama driver something reset/changed which caused my problems. But all fixed now and reinstalling win 10; hopefully everything's still fine once that's done and sorted!</p>

    <title>Would windows 10 Enterprise version eliminate all the game software - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benit18  say:</h3>
<h2>            Would windows 10 Enterprise version eliminate all the game software that comes up for each user of W10 pro&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In the past windows version the pro version was what companies should use. With Windows 10 pro we aren't seeing that. For each person who logs into a company computer running Windows 10 pro a whole bunch of games show up and have to be removed individually
 either manually or by script on a user by user basis.</p>
<p>Would&nbsp;running windows Enterprise stop the games or provide a way to block the games from coming up for each user?</p>
<p>Does windows Enterprise have any benefits for a company computer?</p>

    <title>Windows Hello fingerprint scanner only works when I bypass username - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mohammad yazidkamal baharin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Hello fingerprint scanner only works when I bypass username and password to use computer</h2>
                    <p>I always access my workstation using the fingerprint scanner on my Wacom Mobile Studio Pro 16". However today somehow it was disabled and the only sign-in option available were through a password and PIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I checked the Sign-in option setting and it says Windows Hello isn't available on this device!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Upon inspecting the the device manager there's an exclamation sign on the Biometric device (ELAN WBF Fingerprint Sensor).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/645f7a7c-1db7-4ffa-a0b1-9ceffeea845d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/645f7a7c-1db7-4ffa-a0b1-9ceffeea845d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Troubleshooter could not find any problem, and my Windows 10 is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I have uninstalled the driver, removed it and it gets auto-installed after restarting, yet with the same exclamation mark error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. After so much frustration I decided to bypass security by running ntplwiz and uncheck the box where "Users must enter a username and password to use this computer" is at.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/675b15dc-d8d9-4bfc-924e-57797c51f768?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/675b15dc-d8d9-4bfc-924e-57797c51f768?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>6. Restarted, lo and behold: Windows Hello was running smoothly and functioning well! Device Manager also showed that the driver is functioning properly, no exclamation mark! Tried to setup the fingerprint again but it says that the finger has already been
 recognized and is registered under the default user (me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. So I checked the box again (from no. 5). Put it on sleep mode, and turned it back on and the fingerprint scanner worked JUST FINE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. After I restarted/shut down, the problem (from no. 1) persists!&nbsp;WHY does the fingerprint scanner only work when I uncheck the box (from no.5)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is it that the driver stopped working otherwise after restart/shut down? Please help. This is so annoying!</p>

<p>I SOLVED IT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed EVERYTHING relating to my account: My password, my PIN, and unlinked the account, and had it manually set up again after installing the Wacom driver, like a new user. I had to set up the fingerprint again and now it's all working....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for entertaining my frustration. The PIN was the culprit.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Achievements not popping&#47;unlocking&#47;showing. </h2>
                    
<p>Figured I would attempt support with this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Played Minecraft Win 10, &nbsp;Disney Infinity Win 10 and Minecraft Story Mode Win10. &nbsp; On both Disney and Minecraft Story got to a point that an achievement should unlock, it did not. &nbsp;Played it straight from the direct app. &nbsp;Uninstalled games and reinstalled.
 &nbsp;Logged out of the xbox app. &nbsp;Logged back into the xbox app, launched the games from within the Xbox app. Played the games to the same point, still no achievements. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Rebooted computer, Removed games again, reinstalled and tried again. Still no achievements unlocking/displaying/anything really. &nbsp;The games DO show on my profile so they are registering that I am playing them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Found this thread,&nbsp;http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4270/t/1958241.aspx</p>
<p>Not sure if the Win8 solution applies to Win10. &nbsp; Note, 3 achievements have unlocked for Disney Infinity 3.0 as of last week but now it is like they do not exist. &nbsp;Have not attempted on a different computer or my surface yet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other tips/ideas? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not removed the Xbox App yet, that was going to be my next step.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Narudian - I'm having the same issue with RotTR for Win10. &nbsp;I've tried both xbox support and Square Enix with no useful information so far. &nbsp;Tried redoing achievements, uninstall/reinstall, wsreset.exe, install on another pc and redoing achievements, redoing
 achievements in new game.</p>
<p>I know the problem is not achievement-specific. &nbsp;Connecting on trueachievements, others have the same issue with different achievements.</p>
<p>With this info - someone who understands how the achievements system operates should be able to narrow down where the issue is at least.</p>

<p>BKLortz - I'm starting to feel this is restricted to the new UWP system Microsoft is pushing. Other Windows 8/8.1 games are unlocking perfectly fine in the time I've played them. They still work to this day in fact. But lately with Minecraft and Tomb Raider
 I've been getting quite a lot of errors which makes me worry. My friend who started his first Xbox game as RotTR (Win10) unlocked all his achievements PERFECTLY fine while I sat there frustratingly searching for answers. I've noticed A. Veteran players are
 being affected (judging by our gamerscores) and B. It's only UWP apps. Since the Xbox-Enabled games coming to the Store are all UWPs....I'm feeling very sceptical on their release of Quantum Break. If it's plagued with problems like this, I'm afraid Microsoft
 has more than just achievement issues to worry about.</p>

<p>Hey Narudian - sounds like a good theory re UWP system being the common denominator. &nbsp;It's consistent with my feeling that the issue is somewhere in the system for unlocking achievements as it applies to xbox on win10 games. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My experience with Win8/8.1 games is also like yours - I've had a few issues where an achievement might not unlock there but it could always be unlocked by redoing it.</p>
<p>As far as affecting veteran players more - I can tell you that smrnov posted on my Rise of the Tomb Raider thread that he is also had the same thing happen to him. &nbsp;(He's no. 2 in the world according to TA - you don't get more "veteran" than that.)</p>
<p>I just wish someone "official" would address this with something more than "achievements unlocking is sometimes delayed." &nbsp;We need someone who really understands the achievement unlocking system for win10 to work out a fix - perhaps refreshing the data for
 a particular gamertag in a maintenance process. &nbsp;On xbox sometimes you have to delete and then redownload your gamertag to clear issues like this. &nbsp;I don't think there is an equivalent process for win10.</p>
<p>It's been over two weeks now for me - I think that's long enough for someone from MS to tell us something real is in work.</p>

<p>Hey Mightymango!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just spent the whole day searching for a solution to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right before i gave up and uninstalled &amp;&nbsp;<span>wsreset, i got the idea to log into a different gamertag from the xbox app and try to unlock an achievement. As I got the achievement on my alternate account I realized that
 its not an issue with the game so i proceeded to log back into my main account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After logging back in i played a game and sure enough to my surprise i unlocked a previously locked achievement.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Possible Solution:</em></strong></p>
<p>1.) Launch Xbox App for Windows 10 and navigate to settings</p>
<p>2.)Sign out</p>
<p>3.)Sign back in</p>

    <title>Windows Media Player not burning my MP3 music onto a CD-R - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lcutler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player not burning my MP3 music onto a CD-R</h2>
                    
<p>When I plug my G1 mobile phone (T-Mobile), into my Gateway laptop to sync my iMusic; with a CD-R disc in,&nbsp; It shows my MP3 songs on my disc, under the (D) drive, but unable to "Burn to Disc."&nbsp; When I hit the "Burn to Disc" button it gives me the message
 "There are no files to burn"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However I can double click on a song, and it will automatically play it,&nbsp; using Windows media Player. I can eject the disc and put it in my car or any other CD player and it will not play it.&nbsp; I have only made one disc once and it worked just fine in
 my car or in a regular CD player, but for some reason I can't figure out why my other MP3 songs are showing on the disc, but not able to "Burn to Disc"&nbsp; Can anyone help please???&nbsp; I appreciate it all the help?&nbsp; Thanks so much LCutler.</p>

<div>Hi LCutler,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Where are the music files stored? Is it on your T-mobile or on laptop?</div>
<div><br />
<div>When you double click on the song file, did you try to check the location where the file is stored?</div>
<div><br />
<div>For your information, to sync the music files to your mobile, you need to copy the music files to the laptop first and then burn the files using Windows Media Player. You cannot sync the music from the CD directly. You can rip the CD to Windows Media Player
 and then you can try to sync with your T-Mobile from the list.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Rip music from a CD</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Rip-music-from-a-CD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Rip-music-from-a-CD</a>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once the ripping process is over, the songs will be added to the Windows media player library. You can add the files to the burn list and then you can use the burn option to burn it on to a CD.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Visit the link below on that talk about how to burn an audio CD in Windows Media Player.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Burn an audio CD</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Burn-a-CD-or-DVD-in-Windows-Media-Player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Burn-a-CD-or-DVD-in-Windows-Media-Player&nbsp;</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, if you‚Äôre getting a message of ‚ÄúNo files to burn‚Äù, then try adding one or two files to the CD and then try to burn the disc. You should be able to burn successfully.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this information is helpful. If you need any further assistance, please post us back.</div>

            <p>Yes!&nbsp; Please answer&nbsp;<em>each of the following diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>2. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>3. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>4. <em>Assuming Windows XP SP3 is installed =&gt;</em>&nbsp;Open <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> &amp; make sure the
<strong>Show Updates</strong> box at the top is checked (and leave it checked); then select the
<strong>Name</strong> option in the <strong>Sort by</strong> box on the right. Now scroll down &amp; tell me if ALL of the following updates are listed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) KB2675157 &amp; KB2653956;</p>

<p>Most will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows XP</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>If IE8 is installed,&nbsp;one will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 8</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>5. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>6. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; Advanced
 System Optimizer; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; CCleaner)?</p>

<p><strong>I'm trying to connect a PowerPanel UPS to my new ACER computer with Windows 7 64-bit software via a Prolific USB-to-serial connecter. The troubleshooter says it has a driver problem the the troubleshooter cannot fix. However, messages elsewhere says
 my driver is up to date and the device is working properly. I have installed, uninstalled and tried to fix several different drivers, run the troubleshooter, etc. I've attempted to run the Windows Standalone Installer, but it says "not compatible with your

<p><span>Hi Mary,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we troubleshoot the issue we need more information about the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><span>What
 is the exact error message you receive when you connect the</span><strong><span>Prolific USB-to-serial connecter to your computer?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><strong><span>Were
 you able to connect the connecter to the computer earlier without any issues?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><strong><span>What
 is the model number of the connecter?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><strong><span>Who
 is the UPS and the computer manufacturer and what is the model number?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><strong><span>Which
 is the Windows Standalone installer you have tried to install?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>You may first verify if the Prolific USB-to-serial connecter model if its compatible with windows 7.</span></strong><span>Access
 the link below to check the compatibility of the device with Windows 7.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also contact the</span><strong><span>Prolific
 USB-to-serial connecter manufacturer and check if the device is compatible with Windows 7 and if you need to install any other drivers to get the device to work.
