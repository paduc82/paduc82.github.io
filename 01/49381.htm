            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me assist you. </span><span>Provide us with the below details for better clarity on the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span> </span></span></span><span>Are you facing the issue on a local or Microsoft user account?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span> </span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span> </span></span></span><span>Are you able to boot to your Desktop?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to unplug all external devices connected to the system and restart the system to check if the issue persists. Sometimes new hardware can cause blue screen errors. If you recently added new hardware to your computer, shut down your system,
 unplug the new hardware, and then restart to check the status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Many blue screen errors can be resolved by making sure that Windows is up to date.
</span><span>Windows Update helps keep your computer up to date with the latest system updates and drivers. You can check Windows Update manually to help ensure you have the latest updates.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to check for New Windows updates as well as optional updates. Refer the below steps to install the pending updates on the system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Steps:- </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>1.<span> </span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Go to
<strong>Start</strong> and then <strong>Settings.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>2.<span> </span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on
<strong>Update and Recovery.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>3.<span> </span></span></span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check for updates</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> under
<strong>Windows Updates</strong>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>4.<span> </span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Restart the system and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, boot the computer in Safe mode and check the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try booting the system in Safe Mode and check the status of the issue.</span><span>
<strong>Safe mode</strong> starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start your PC in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes. Refer the
 link below for steps to boot in Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            How do  I install Windows over an expired Windows 10 Preview, while keeping the contents of my HDD&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I try to install an actual version of Windows 10 now, but it keeps saying my HDD is of the GPT partition style, and I can't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I googled a bit, and everytime it says&nbsp; I have to format my HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do I have to do that? That's way too extreme for accidentally letting W10 Preview expire, and it not even a punishment, it's just cruel.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has to be a way to fix this, while keeping all of my data. Why the **** is my HDD locked like that, anyways? It's MY HDD. Not microsofts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't even install it on a new partition in an attempt to dual boot. </p>

            <p>You can first try running the media from the preview version by opening it to run Setup as Administrator, skipping the Product Key and choosing Upgrade.&nbsp; But unless you'd originally upgraded from Windows 7 or 8.1 to the Preview you'll still need to insert
 a Product Key after install to Activate.</p>

 since it will replace the OS.&nbsp; If you don't delete or format the C partition but merely choose it for install then it should create a c:\windows.old folder archiving all of the old OS including your files, but I wouldn't count on that as a backup method.&nbsp;

            not exactly helpful either. the issue is that i can't overwrite any windows installation because it keeps giving me the error that it's of the&nbsp; GPT Partition style, and i absolutely refuse to format my HDD because something that extreme should never be
 the solution.

<p>Im just curious to see who still plays the first fable or Fable: The Lost Chapter. I Just got back into Fable when my cousin and I traded game he gave me Fable 2 gave him some other game. And from then i got Fable 3 but then i remembered i had Fable 1 a
 long time ago and wanted to play it again so i got The Lost Chapters and im loving it a little weird at first since im used to the Fable 2 and Fable 3 style of fighting but man Fable is so awesome I love how you can wear armor which is what i hope they bring
 back to Fable 4. </p>

<p>TeeMan, you never played Fable 1? OMG you have no idea. If you like Fable 2 you will love Fable 1. Since Fable 1 was original xbox the controls are different like to draw your sword it is LB to draw your bow it is RB, to run it is B, to attack it is still
 X, to block it is Y, and to use magic you hold the RT and your spells are mapped on X,B,and A, when you get more spells you press Y and they will be mapped on the same Buttons only now you are on a different slot and pressing Y will take you back to your other
 spells. Only thing that I find weird about Fable 1 is that when you target anyone the show up red so be careful when attacking, i did this on accident but it only gives you 5 evil. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As for clothing and stuff like that Fable 1 has a ton of it and what is cool is most of it is armor and it looks awesome go to the Fable wiki and find the Fable armor it looks sweet.
</p>
<p>Story is really good i still haven't beaten it but i did a long time ago when it first came out. But has been a while so i don't remember what all that happens. If you do get Fable 1 get Fable: The Lost Chapters it continues the story from where Fable 1
 ended so you get more gameplay out of it and a sword similar to the power sword at the end of the game called The Sword of Avos. Really great game. The only thing i have run into with since this is an original (i like to call classic) xbox game is there is
 some tears in the audio at times but nothing game breaking, there was one point where my game froze on me but it took a long time for this to happen so if you do get it save regularly. But other then that it is a great game.</p>

<p>Cool. If and when I finish Fable 2. My buddy was going to lend me Fable 3. So I don't know if I'll have time for Fable 1. If I do' I'll pick it up. I haven't seen it in any stores tho. New and used. So I think I'll have to do the Download off the Marketplace.

<p>OleMissRebel10, the is the place i got mine and i was really surprised because the original Fable on amazon is like 50 bucks weird. But yeah Get Lost chapters it continues where Fable 1 (the one on xbox market place) ends and has a little more stuff to do.

<p>It's because amazon has TLC's and they aren't jacking the price up. That original Fable is sold by some guy selling stuff on amazon. I saw some guy trying to sell Mass Effect 2 the collectors edition for $2,000. I guess if some douche wanted to buy it for
 that much I'd sell it too...lol</p>

<h2>            Over G Fighters</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Xbox Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>after the E3 presentation of Flight Simulator for Xbox, I am exited about the fact a real flight simulator reach the console finally. But for how long we have waited for this. The last sim like game on Console in a modern setting was Over G Fighters for
 Xbox 360. Release June 27, 2006.&nbsp;It would be nice to see it in the&nbsp;<span>backward compatibility program. And&nbsp;besides, it will shorten the waiting time for Flight Simulator. So please please please, make it happen.</span></p>

<p>Hi Andre_Achteur</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, there are no more titles being added to the Backwards Compatiblity list for Xbox One. The developers who work on these titles are currently working on Project Scarlett due for release late in 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree though&nbsp; its good to see the Flight simulator finally hit Xbox!! Am sure it will be a very popular download this year!</p>

            Well, we still want Over G fighters on Xbox One.&nbsp; We got Ace Combat 6 but Over G has realism and great multiplayer.. hopefully it happens soon for us hardcore console fighter combant fans. I doubt flight simulator will feature combat missions or multiplayer
 battles where you can fly f14's and other fighter craft

<p>My word, I thought I was the only person on the planet to play Over G! Great little game and damn shame there aren't more games like it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd love to see it backwards compatible, but even more so, i'd love to see a new flight combat simulator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do enjoy Ace Combat, but it is very over the top with hundreds of missles everywhere. Campaign wise, I preferred 6 to 7, the missions felt more interesting, with a wingman you could work with and direct as needed. Ace Combat 7 is awesome for the online
 and the community are decent too with plenty of mutual respect between players. I'd recommend picking up AC6 or 7 to anyone looking to scratch their Over G itch :)</p>

            I liked Over G Fighter at the time, only being able to carry missile's that each aircraft is limited to carrying, some only had 6 missile others had 8 and so on and that all you had, compared to Ace Combat aircraft's, carrying over 200 missiles.

            Hello dsx75
<br />While this is a known issue with the 1803 update you should be able to remove the unwanted language via and elevated command prompt if you are comfortable. Please try the following
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Then Press A
<br />
<br />In the Command prompt type lpksetup.exe /u en-GB
<br />
<br />Press Enter
<br />
<br />This should uninstall the unwanted language
<br />
<br />Full details on how to use lpksetup.exe to manage languages can be found here

    <title>Corrupt turquoise window logo on cold boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jack cameron  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupt  turquoise window logo on cold boot</h2>
                    <p>After upgrade of my Win8.1 desktop to Win10 I get a corrupt&nbsp;<span>turquoise window logo on cold boot; picture of it below. &nbsp;If I left the boot continue the display disconnects but the PC seems to be working as the disk light blinks as expected .
 &nbsp;But no way to know. Pressing the reboot button on the PC system does a proper restart with no corruption. &nbsp;You can also press the restart button anytime after bios and before the logo screen ends and it restarts aok. &nbsp;Just a cold start issue. &nbsp;I have an extended
 display card with VGA, HDMI, and DVI that uses the latest Nvidia drivers. &nbsp;I've tried HDMI and VGA displays with the same result. &nbsp;I've tried setting the primary display to PCI (was PCI-E) with no effect. &nbsp;I also notice that the logo screen is 16x8 stretched
 on my 4x3 display but is correctly 4x3 once Win10 comes up. &nbsp;How the heck does it think it's a 4x3 display at the logo screen point. &nbsp;If I did not have the reboot button on this PC I'd have a bricked system. &nbsp;So, I can live with this for now. &nbsp;This is an old
 system but bear in mind it was just fine with Win8.1. &nbsp;I'll open it later and get the board and card numbers. &nbsp;</span><span>But for now I'm open to ideas.</span></p>

<p><span>Would suggest you to perform a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10,
 Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>

            <p>I tired this;, with the exception of a bios update as that's beyond my 'safety zone'. &nbsp;Same problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I found that I could boot up after I unchecked the "Fast startup". &nbsp;Once up and running I did a hibernate and that found the exact problem with the resume. &nbsp; My guess is that Win10 is not allowing enough time to load the display drivers after bios completes
 and the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">turquoise window logo shows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So for now, no Fast Startup or Hibernate. &nbsp;There were some updates the other day, maybe I'll check hibernate again.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I had the exact same issue after upgrading from windows 8, i went to settings and unchecked the FAST BOOT option, now pc boots fine and in all faireness its faster than before, i was ready to but new graphics card and ram but its fully working on restarts
 and cold boot</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After upgrade of my Win8.1 desktop to Win10 I get a corrupt&nbsp;<span>turquoise window logo on cold boot; picture of it below. &nbsp;If I left the boot continue the display disconnects but the PC seems to be working as the disk light blinks as expected . &nbsp;But no
 way to know. Pressing the reboot button on the PC system does a proper restart with no corruption. &nbsp;You can also press the restart button anytime after bios and before the logo screen ends and it restarts aok. &nbsp;Just a cold start issue. &nbsp;I have an extended
 display card with VGA, HDMI, and DVI that uses the latest Nvidia drivers. &nbsp;I've tried HDMI and VGA displays with the same result. &nbsp;I've tried setting the primary display to PCI (was PCI-E) with no effect. &nbsp;I also notice that the logo screen is 16x8 stretched
 on my 4x3 display but is correctly 4x3 once Win10 comes up. &nbsp;How the heck does it think it's a 4x3 display at the logo screen point. &nbsp;If I did not have the reboot button on this PC I'd have a bricked system. &nbsp;So, I can live with this for now. &nbsp;This is an old
 system but bear in mind it was just fine with Win8.1. &nbsp;I'll open it later and get the board and card numbers. &nbsp;</span><span>But for now I'm open to ideas.</span></p>

            Not fixed with Win10. &nbsp;I'm positive that this is a BIOS issue with my older PC and not Win8 or 10. &nbsp;The issue has to do with the fast startup (boot) which uses hybrid sleep mode. &nbsp;Some older PCs need a BIOS update to make this work. &nbsp;Some very old PCs,
 like mine, have no BIOS updates available. &nbsp; The only solution is to disable Fast Startup... we've both done that.

<h3> robertortega99  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;SP4 Recording with Internal Mic&#93; Recorded files have popping sounds roughly every 5 seconds</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Original SP4 (i7, 16gb)</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off - this is NOT about speakers popping when playing sound.&nbsp; I can play MP3's and stream music from Google Play Music and it all sounds fine through the SP4 speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is with sound files recorded using the SP4 mic.&nbsp; About every 5 seconds or so in the recorded file I hear a popping sound. At first I thought it was only the Recorder app that comes with the SP4 but then I tried Adobe Audition and the files produced
 there had the same popping sound roughly every 5 seconds as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling/reinstalling the realtek driver various times.</p>
<p>This problem has been around since before the two creator updates (each time I was told to wait for the next major update to see if the issue is fixed and of course nothing changed).&nbsp; I don't know if there's anything else I can do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a test I connected a Blue Snowball microphone, recorded a few samples - are there are no problems with the recorded files from the Recorder app that comes with the SP4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas or suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Robert</p>

<p>Hi Robert, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Audio enhancements may cause issues with audio and sound. We suggest that you disable all audio enhancements.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, since the issue does not occur when using an external microphone, it is possible that the problem is with internal microphone itself. To verify this, reset your Surface. Please refer to this

                    <p>Original Title: Can not figure out which key is stuck&nbsp; </p>
<p>Dell inspirion Laptop, Windows 7<br />
<br />
My wife's keyboard is stuck holding down a key but we can not get past the login screen to figure out which key it is. When you get to the login/password section it is filling in the password field with a character that is changed hidden by asterisks. I've
 plugged in a USB keyboard to try and offset it. Also tried to use the Narrator at the start up screen to see if it would say the character being pressed but it will not work. What is another way we can figure out which key is being held down and once we do
 how do we fix it? Any help would be great, and thank you in advance. <br />

<h2>            Icons are resized randomly when using touchpad - Wishlist&#58; Win 10 future update &#34;lock desktop icons&#34; option</h2>
                    <p>I am having issues with my desktop icons randomly getting larger when I am using my touchpad. &nbsp;I have already lowered the touch pad sensitivity and it still happens with the icons on my desktop, on documents I am working on and on webpages (zooming
 in/out). &nbsp;It is really annoying!!!!!! &nbsp;In Windows 8.1, it took a deliberate action using the touch pad to zoom in or out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I "accidentally" enlarge the icons, I can right click on the desktop, go to "View" and set the icon size but then the arrangement of my icons on the desktop is totally messed up. &nbsp;I am tired of having to rearrange them. This has nothing to
 do with the issue that others were experiencing with their icons moving (fix was to uncheck "auto arrange" under "View") so please don't suggest that I try that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run every other fix that I could find out on the internet so please don't suggest that I reinstall Windows 10 or run scans, etc. It is a Windows 10 functionality issue that is exacerbated by the sensitivity of my touch pad (Sony Vaio S Series).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice if Microsoft would develop a way to lock the icons on the desktop to keep them from resizing. I am ready to uninstall Windows 10 because I am spending way too much time rearranging my icons</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why Microsoft has created Windows 10 so that the touch pad functions are overly sensitive. &nbsp;I never experienced any of these issues in Windows 8 or 8.1&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Dell vostro 3350, Intel HD graphics 3000 windows 10 issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently got the Windows 10 update. Installation ran fine. I did all the setup and reached the desktop. Once it installed the display adapter driver for my processor (intel i5 2450) which is the intel HD graphics 3000 driver, the screen went black. When
 I connect my laptop to an external monitor or TV (via HDMI or VGA) it works, but not on my laptop screen. It works again if I disable or uninstall the driver and swtich to the microsoft display driver (however at very low resolution). I performed a clean installation
 of Windows 10 after completely formatting my PC. The isssue returned when the first windows update installed this driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have similar experience with this laptop or processor? Does anyone have a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forwards...</p>
<p>
</p><p>kind regards,</p>
Jim

            <p>Hello Akheel,</p>
<p>Thank you for your solution, unfortunately it does not work. The diver for this graphicscard is not provided by intel and they suggest to download it through microsoft update. In the list of compatible OS, windows 10 is not listed. Microsoft must have scanned
 my hardware before they rolled out the update, so why is this incompatibility happening now?</p>

            I had exactly the same issue noted above with&nbsp;the 3350 laptop&nbsp;and resolved the issue by installing the A10 BIOS update from the Dell Support website (mine was previously A03).&nbsp; Hope this helps.

            This solution works great for my Dell Vostro 3350. I had A08 BIOS before, and face the exact same problem. After I flash it to A10, tralaaa... I got my display back! Thank you Stuart.

<h2>            Surface Laptop 2 - How to clean it from dust after few years of usage&#63;</h2>
                    I am wondering, is it possible and how, to clean your surface product from dust and other stuff. To be more specific i mean on the inside of it. All technology products after some time they got dirty inside of hardware and it needs to be clean so the performance
 could stay the same.<br />
<br />
If there is any solution for this, i would be grateful.<br />
<br />
Thanks

<p>Only an idiot would put a vacuum cleaner anywhere near a computer. The static charge generated by the brush motor would be lethal to the components if it made it's way to ground through the chassis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use a horsehair brush for inside and fans, an old toothbrush is oky in a pinch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use 50% distilled white vinegar and distilled water to dampen a microfibre cloth to clean the screen.</p>

            Surface Laptop 2 cannot be open as far as i know, how can i reach fans and other hardware to clean it?<br />
Brush sounds impossible, and vacuum because of the static charge.<br />
<br />
Only thing in my mind pops out is air compressor, but i am not assure about that also.<br />
<br />
I was hoping that Microsoft is providing service for such things. Dust is&nbsp;inevitably.

<p>Moving the console in the room/different room</p>

<p>Hey Nixher! Thanks for posting today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's great that you tried multiple troubleshooting steps already! We appreciate that. I can definitely understand the confusion after trying all of that and the issue seems to not go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By any chance are you still enrolled in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Insider Program</a>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I noticed you hadn't tried is possibly trying to connect your controllers to another Xbox and see if they don't disconnect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically narrowing the problem down to either a preview update if you are still enrolled, or possibly a software&nbsp;issue with the Xbox's signal transmitter for the wireless controllers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, have you performed a full <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
powercycle?</a> Letting the power supply reset for a few minutes is always a good thing. Also, if the Xbox Is plugged into a surge protector or inverter, we suggest you plug directly into the nearest wall socket.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

</p><p>Yes I'm still in xbox insider programme thing, not sure how to leave, yeah forgot to mention I've obviously tried full power cycle which is what I meant by power down/on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It used to be plugged into a surge protector but I plugged straight in wall and no different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest I've only posted today because my partner is playing the xbox now and sick of the controllers disconnecting, I gave up playing xbox because of it. Microsoft have been no use whatsoever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Nixher!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok well I would suggest leaving the Xbox Update Preview program. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>How to leave the Xbox One update preview program</strong></p>
<p>Whether you’re selling or giving your Xbox away, or just don’t want to participate anymore, you should remove it from the update preview program. If you’ve already sold or gifted your Xbox, you can launch the Xbox Insider Hub on another console or a Windows
 10 PC and follow these same directions. </p>
<ol>
<li>Launch the <strong>Xbox Insider Hub</strong> on your Xbox One or a Windows 10 PC.
</li><li>On the main landing page, select <strong>Settings</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Manage devices</strong> and choose the one you want to remove from the program.
</li><li>Select <strong>Done</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Leaving the Xbox One Update Preview is just as easy as joining it. You can remove yourself from the Xbox One Update Preview by following these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch the <strong>Xbox Insider Hub</strong> on your Xbox One console. </li><li>On the main landing page, select&nbsp;<strong>Insider content</strong>. </li><li>Under <strong>System</strong>, select <strong>Xbox One Update Preview</strong>.
</li><li>Select <strong>Join</strong>&nbsp;or <strong>Manage</strong>. </li><li>At the very bottom select <strong>Unenroll</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you leave the program, I suggest doing a soft factory reset to download the live update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you'd like to go over warranty details and service options I would suggest contacting
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Customer Support</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            I'm sorry, but what I get from your response is that Microsoft is so big that it doesn't care if it loses xbox customers. Nor does it care about its customers enough to fix the problem.&nbsp; That is very disappointing.

<p>Hey Nixher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes that is what I'm saying. When you sign up for the Xbox Insider Program, it is possible the update previews can cause some bugs or other issues and you can either report the problem or leave the program. You can find more information about the program
 and the agreement you accept when joining the program with these two links:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-program#a059f2729f3846918912eda32af69584</li><li>https://www.xbox.com/en-US/legal/insider-program</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If that's not the case then,&nbsp;your console would need&nbsp;to get repaired. You can contact
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Customer Support</a>&nbsp;to go over warranty details and service options with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a good day</p>

<p>I've read too many posts that have been closed by MS about this controller disconnection issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All saying it happens on all controllers, one day console was fine, the next disconnections, Microsoft requesting people to send in for repair but unable to fix. Very common, happening on xbox one, S, x, old controllers, new style, elite posts always closed,
 never resolved, bit odd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Needs to be properly addressed by Microsoft, can't have ambassadors etc keep coming on these help sections throwing out generic advise for a more complex and widespread problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's a known fault we should be told, so people can repair their own consoles if it's the WiFi board.</p>

    <title>Taskbar changes height when toolbars have icons set to &#34;Large&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spiffyfitz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar changes height when toolbars have icons set to &#34;Large&#34;</h2>
                    <p>There has been an issue with the Windows taskbar which drives me crazy. It has been a problem since Windows XP and the "skinning" of the underlying user interface controls. It still persists in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using a Toolbar on the Taskbar and the icon size is set to "small", the clickable targets are smaller than the vertical height of the taskbar. No problem, right? Either make the taskbar icon set to "small" as well and the clickable target area matches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what if I like the large buttons to click on? Setting the Toolbar (not taskbar!) icons to Large causes the taskbar vertical height to increase. This is fine for the Toolbar, but the application icons in the Taskbar now have an unclickable space beneath
 them. See image below (not my image... found online when trying to find a solution to this.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6f777bb5-ca6a-4272-baa3-52616c5b675b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6f777bb5-ca6a-4272-baa3-52616c5b675b" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>This doesn't happen in Windows 7 when using the "Windows Classic" scheme... so the problem must derive from the Aero skinning of the taskbar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To recreate:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Right click on the taskbar and Unlock it.</li><li>Ensure taskbar is set to "large icons" mode from Taskbar properties dialog box.</li><li>Right click an empty area of the taskbar and create a new Toolbar.</li><li>Right click on the label of the toolbar and choose View &gt; Large Icons</li></ul>
<p>This wouldn't necessarily be an issue if the clickable region of the Application Icons was the full vertical height of the visible taskbar. It also wouldn't be an issue if the Toolbar "Large Icons" setting didn't have icons bigger than the Application Icons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Edjay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to capture some screenshots from a Windows 10 machine demonstrating the same user interface issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17f27479-11a3-4d55-8312-882b67dae117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17f27479-11a3-4d55-8312-882b67dae117" /></a></p>
<p>In the above image, you can see the Windows 10 taskbar is unlocked (doesn't matter if its locked or unlocked for this to take effect) and the Application icons are set to Large from the control panel. However, the Toolbar on the right has icons set to small,
 and the clickable target area is small and doesn't take up the full height of the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e75f0cf5-0f73-4df1-8655-9bcfe3430575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e75f0cf5-0f73-4df1-8655-9bcfe3430575" /></a></p>
<p>The effect in Windows 10 is even worse than Windows 7... when the toolbar icons are set to "Large"-- the taskbar increases in height by about 12 pixels and as seen in the image above, the Application Icons clickable area doesn't span the full taskbar height.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Toolbars are an integral part of the operating system, it blows my mind that nobody has ever come forward and talked about getting this fixed. The same effect happened on Vista and XP as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason this is a problem is that for fluid operating system usage with a mouse as an input device, there are certain tasks which you don't want precision for. Throughout a day if I click the taskbar 100 times and I have to correct my mouse cursor position
 to hit the target, it adds time and frustration. This seems like a simple 15-year oversight that hasn't been fixed in the windows backend code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Refresh 8.1 without losing files from command prompt&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all. &nbsp;Long story short, my windows store has&nbsp;completely&nbsp;broken. &nbsp;I cleared the cache, reset the store, fiddled with the&nbsp;registry&nbsp; and the closest I got to having store apps work was getting the actual Store app to open. &nbsp;Everything else, including the
 settings metro app,&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;closes. &nbsp;I have resolved to refreshing my PC, however, I can't access the settings app to get to the refresh option. &nbsp;Is there a command prompt workaround for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Community Clips</h2>
                    <p>I have just moved from Windows 7 to 8 with the purchase of a new laptop and no longer have full functionality with Community Clips. I uninstalled and downloaded the latest version I could find. &nbsp;Audio clarity is now spotty and PowerPoint slides are cut off
 on the right. &nbsp;Is there a setting that needs to change for this to work as it did? &nbsp;(I had upgraded to Windows 10 but had to downgrade since nothing was available with the no longer present Community Clips.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I too miss SnagIt- and never knew about Community Clips.&nbsp; SnagIt got pretty pricey, but it was so versatile!&nbsp; I'm new to 8.1, and (I'll keep looking) if you find anything similar, especially for free, please pass the info on!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Snipping Tool and PrtScr options just don't do it for me- I loved the ability to capture text (OCR) and not just pictures as .jpg or whatever, and video was great as well- in regions!&nbsp; If ever stumble across anything, will pass it along as well, though
 it sounds like you're all set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe someone out there knows something similar??&nbsp; Great program!&nbsp; Thanks :)</p>

            <p>I have good news to share about SnagIt - it is available for Windows 8.1 and it works well. &nbsp;Since I'm new to the tool, I don't know how it might have changed in this version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since no one from Microsoft has responded, I have to assume that continuing to support a free tool - no matter how excellent - is no longer of interest. &nbsp;It will be very welcome to learn from the community if another good free tool is available.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the update, now just the cost is unfortunate.&nbsp; Don't know how much (just got your response) but I really used it for capturing regions of the screen and being able to save as text instead of a .jpg, I worked great at that.&nbsp; It was terrific to
 capture an area that was not just a 'block' or square, and to be able to scroll to get exactly what I needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only recently got Win 8.1 after a short stint on XP w/o SnagIt (XP computer died), so I have tons of digging to do on many fronts, but the 'snipping tool' and hitting PrtSc and pasting to Paint just aren't cutting it for me.&nbsp; Frankly I could just about
 live without either, but I suppose some are happy with just those limited capabilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned,&nbsp;I have a lot of digging to do, but will keep this open to post back anything I find.&nbsp; I never realized how much I missed SnagIt until it was gone!</p>

</p><p>Let's keep each other informed on whatever we stumble across :)</p>

<h2>            Using 2nd Monitor with Laptop and Goes Into Sleep Mode</h2>
                    So I use a laptop and I am trying to connect a second monitor via HDMI and when I plug it in, it goes into sleep mode and I've tried going in display settings but changing stuff there doesn't seem to make a difference, any way to fix this?

<p>Hi Charlie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your second monitor goes in to Sleep mode after connecting it to your laptop, it could be that some settings of the Power Options in Windows 10 are incorrectly configured. We recommend that you restore all power settings to default and see if the second
 monitor still goes to Sleep after connecting it. Here's how to restore the power settings to default:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows </strong>logo key + <strong>I </strong>to open the <strong>
Settings </strong>app.</li><li>From <strong>Settings</strong>, select <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>Power &amp; sleep</strong>, then select
<strong>Additional power settings</strong>.</li><li>From the <strong>Power Options </strong>dialog box, select <strong>Choose when to turn off the display</strong>, then select
<strong>Restore default settings for this plan</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After setting it to default, observe if the issue persists. If it does, kindly connect the second monitor to another computer and see the problem is observed. Also, kindly use a different HDMI cable to rule out the possibility of a faulty cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to an update from you.</p>

            Hello, I tried a different HDMI cord and it didn’t make a difference, also currently I do not have another PC to test the monitor on, and changing to default settings didn’t seem to work either.

<p>We appreciate the information you have provided. Since the problem does not occur with a different cable, we could deduce that the issue may be with the settings of Windows 10 or with your monitor. May we know if the monitor is detected in the
<strong>Display </strong>settings from the <strong>Settings </strong>app? If yes, is the settings under
<strong>Multiple displays </strong>from that page set to <strong>Extend these displays</strong>? If not, kindly do so and see if the second monitor works as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We look forward to your prompt response.</p>

</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Reinstall Options:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not say if Windows 7 came preinstalled (Dell, HP, etc.) or you bought your own Retail License.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If preinstalled, you can contact your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.
</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost, IF they still have them available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you received&nbsp;your&nbsp;Laptop/computer there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall&nbsp;Windows back to how&nbsp;it was when new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the Key/s to press at Boot to start the Recovery Process back to Factory Settings (new condition). Under each Manufacturer in the list below are the instructions in the respective links for you to follow on how to use their Recovery Partition</p>

                    <p>I cannot burn audio&nbsp;CD from my Windows Media Player, I do see the cd burning and as soon as it gets to 100% it ejects the cd and gives me an error message about how&nbsp;WMP cannot burn the cd because I need to&nbsp;reinstal or update drivers. How do I do this? I
 have Windows 7.</p>

            <p>Hi ScholasticaAbibu,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question. I understand that you are unable to burn CD in Windows Media Player. In order to provide you with a quick resolution, please
 reply to these questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the complete error message?
</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you have any burning software installed on the computer?
</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b>You may run the Playing and Burning CDs, DVDs, and Blu<span>‑</span><span>ray Discs troubleshooter &amp; check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Open the Playing and Burning CDs, DVDs, and Blu</b><b><span>‑</span></b><b><span>ray
 Discs troubleshooter </span></b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-playing-and-burning-cds-dvds-and-bluray-discs-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-playing-and-burning-cds-dvds-and-bluray-discs-troubleshooter</a></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> I would also recommend you to reduce the burn speed and check the result. To do this, try these steps:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open <b>Windows Media Player</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Organize</b> and select
<b>Options</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Burn</b> tab and change the burn speed to
<b>Medium</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>ok</b> to apply the changes.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restart the Windows Media Player and try burning the disc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:
</b>If the troubleshooter doesn’t fix the issue, you may remove and reinstall the existing drivers for CD\DVD drive. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>Start</b>, type
<b>Device Manager</b> in the search box, Press <b>Enter</b>.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In Device Manager, expand
<b>DVD/CD-ROM</b> <b>drives</b>, <b>right-click</b> the CD and DVD devices, and then click
<b>Uninstall</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When you are prompted to confirm that you want to remove the device, click
<b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restart the computer.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>After the computer restarts, the drivers will be automatically installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may check for an updated driver from the manufacturer and install the latest version. Refer to the below mentioned link for guidance:

            Hello Imran,<br />
I tried all the links and suggestions you provided and I also uninstall the device driver but the problem still perist.<br />
The error message that keeps popping up is: <br />
<br />
Windows Media Player cannot burn the files. If the burner is busy wait for current task to finish. If necessary, verify that the burner is connected properly and that you have installed the latest device driver.<br />
<br />
Do I need to buy an external CD Burner in order to burn audio CDs?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            hey guys i had that problem and i been so pissed cause i did what you all suggest but  it didnt work. now i found out how to fix that **** its so easy just find and download your laptop / PC SATA AHCI Driver and it will work 110000000000000% cause this error *- Windows Media Player could not complete burning because the disc is not compatible with your drive. Try inserting a different kind of recordable media or use a disc that supports a write speed that is compatible with your drive.*- show up only when u dont have ur SATA driver
