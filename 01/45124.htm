                    <p>so I sent a message to someone who was giving it mouth in game chat saying your all noobs at this game and he was really bad, call of duty. So I said to him he sucks at it then he sends me a message as I was turning the console off saying noob so I said I have a d**k if you wana suck, implied he sucks. And he said reported, OK that's fine. So I said to him to annoy him report me to his mum please do. Come back on the next day and I'm banned for game chat, PARTY CHAT! and all other communications but it's blocked me from most games, I'm not happy and I pay to play like everyone else. Block my chats but not games. Hope people will learn from this as 1 report will get you banned, no warning just straight up ban</p>

<h2>            IntelliMouse TrackBall downloaded driver, but won&#39;t install, says file is corrupt.</h2>
                    
<p>Recently&nbsp;installed 2yr old computer with Vista, want to install my very old Microsoft IntelliMouse TrackBall, (1999)&nbsp;with PS/2 plug, had to&nbsp;add a USB adaptor,&nbsp;as no PS/2 sockets,&nbsp;&nbsp;was working on my XP&nbsp;PC okay, (original CD didn't work had to download software
 for XP),&nbsp; tried downloading new software, okay, but it won't install, says&nbsp;'File is corrupt',&nbsp; no further information, I downloaded&nbsp;from the the following&nbsp;website:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/download/DownloadResult.aspx?category=MK&amp;type=Mouse&amp;name=B75-00113&amp;os=WVista_32&amp;lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/download/DownloadResult.aspx?category=MK&amp;type=Mouse&amp;name=B75-00113&amp;os=WVista_32&amp;lang=en</a>&nbsp;
 says it's a Microsoft product, when I right click the download, yet says its not got a digital signature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advice me, whether I can get another driver download for this, or am I flogging a dead horse?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this trackball so old it can't be used on Vista?&nbsp; I hope not, as I like it,&nbsp;very few trackballs about now. Thanking you in anticipation.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What does lifetime of the device mean?</span></strong></p>
<p>This is still being debated, but the logical conclusion is as long as the machine is operable, it will continue to support it with updates. So, if the machine still works 5 or 10 years from now, revisions and updates to Windows 10 will be made available
 to it. Please note that Windows 10 uses the same life cycle policy of 5 years mainstream support and&nbsp;5 years extended support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From Microsoft:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the
<strong>supported lifetime of the device</strong> </em></span><span><em>â€“</em></span><span><em>at no additional charge.

    <title>On Skype for Business there are Subscription costs per minute for PSTN - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            On Skype for Business there are Subscription costs per minute for PSTN Dial in and Dial out and a pay per use&#63; Which applies&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am investigating applying PSTN Dial in / Dial out conferencing access for our services and wanted to check how the pricing is applied based on the two files you can download from here:&nbsp;https://products.office.com/en-gb/skype-for-business/calling-plans
 ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When would it be the case that a pay per use vs Subscription cost will be applied to the cost for the host as there seems to be duplication of prices?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is S4B just VoIP only as standard? So if you want to have dial in numbers available on your meetings you need to buy and apply the "Skype for business PSTN Conferencing" License to the account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then buy Communication Credits on the account for PSTN dialing and conferencing minutes per participant I assume? To cover you if you go over the 1,200 minutes or use routes that are not provided in the minute bundle - e.g. non-domestic calls, dial out to
 mobiles etc.? Is this right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the host incurs the cost per minute based on which of these files please? Or can I just buy this as a pay per use option without having the communication credits?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Adrian</p>

<p>Hi Adrian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For subscription costs per minute or per use, if you want to know which ways is suitable for your organization, you can see the two Excels about rates for where you want to call, and you can choose
 which one based on your needs, you can see the detailed price for different region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Communication Credits, you can see detailed information from this

<p>Hi Richard,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry yes I wanted to try again to do a full review but I am sorry to say I am still confused. Why two files for pricing on audio as the subscription file costs and the pay as you go costs both look identical to me or am I missing something?&nbsp; Why would I
 choose one over the other please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I buy the fully loaded E3 license at $32 per user per month. This gives me free VoIP, dial in toll of 1,200 mins + 600 international dial in (to then have access to dial in on your 88 country numbers and I need to chose the available local, toll free
 or both for the company) for conference calls (and this includes standard fixed line calling for my business as well).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to set up communication credits for all of my users based on my forecast of minutes expected to spend. You alert me if I am close to exceeding this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Costs incurred over and above the bundle for any of my users:</p>
<p>I get charged if I go over my 600 international or 1,200 domestic monthly minutes, or if I dial in/out to a fixed line or mobile domestically or internationally if not covered in my standard package by either the subscription or pay as you go rate applied
 to each minute and leg of call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I take it these minutes are not pooled to the company but assigned to each user per month and lost if not used in that month?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a user is blocked from calling because they have exceeded their monthly allowance and communication credits have not been added to the account, are they automatically re-instated once funds are cleared or would we have to re-activate/notify Microsoft
 to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about all the questions but I have spent the best part of 4-5 hours trawling through the MS site and you really do not make it clear/easy to understand the principals of how you deliver and bill these services for a non-MS expert in this area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help is appreciated on clearing this up for me at your earliest convenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />

<p>Hi&nbsp;Adrian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For which applies, it really depends on your business and how many calls you are making. If you are making a lot, then Subscription will be better. If not, the pay per use will be better.&nbsp;The Subscription is usually a months worth of credits. These credits
 don't roll over if they aren't used up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For "Is S4B just VoIP only as standard". Yes, you need to have credits and the add on license for this to be possible.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I installed jetaudio player &amp; the sound doesn't work, so download k-lite codec pack &amp; now its working.

<p>My question is that (is it safe to use it with window xp?) </p>

            <p>My recommendation would be to uninstall both <em>JetAudio Player </em>and <em>
K-Lite Codecs Pack</em> and replace with <strong>VLC Media Player</strong>. There's no need to install a codecs package.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure, but the programs you installed may have come bundled with other unwanted and/or unneeded software. Therefore I would also suggest using
<strong>Malwarebytes Antimalware (Free Edition), AdwCleaner </strong>and <strong>
JRT </strong>to remove the extra software that may have been installed.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 HDD Erase and Reactivating W10 License</h2>
                    <p>Hello person who has the time to read this, I have a problem that i've had for months now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been thinking about wiping the hdd clean by taking it out and plugging it into another computer, then reformatting it (as it has several useless partitions), before placing it back inside the laptop. From there I plan to plug in an iso Windows 10 Boot
 disk and reinstall windows fresh and new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only one problem... i'm afraid of losing my license which I paid full price for when i bought the laptop. I've read articles about people wiping hard drives only to have their activation key lost and their laptop without a license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently running windows 10 2018 edition. Someone help me please!</p>

            Hi, Henry,
<br />
<br />Question: Did you upgrade from an earlier version of Windows? (8, 8.1 or 7)
<br />If you upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7, 8, or 8.1, you will not be able to transfer the Windows 10 license since it is tied to the Original OS on the system. 
<br />
<br />You can perform a clean install on the Unit which does reformat the drive without having to take the hard drive out. Follow these steps here.

            Hi Henry.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is no need to remove the drive to wipe it.  Any Clean Install includes deleting all partitions down to Unallocated Space first or it isn't a Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />Follow these steps which compile the best possible install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>The CAVE Rave - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> azrael008uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            The CAVE Rave</h2>
                    
<p>Activision, Epic and Bungie don't make the best shooters...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CAVE do!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to 2D SHMUPS (Shoot 'Ep Ups) CAVE is king.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people who've been gaming for a while remember the original "R-Type" with fondness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you're one of those people who think it would be great if they made games like that today... on our 'next gen' consoles... THEY DO!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some ways they are like glorified Arcade Titles (though perhaps with resale value) because compared to something like "Skyrim" they are shorter and on the surface simpler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But they sure are fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite not taking double digit hours to complete they will definately take triple digit numbers to master.&nbsp; It's easy enough to get to the end of the game using infinite continues but good luck trying to do so without dying at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Akai Katana" is out today and has been specially made for the XBox 360.&nbsp; My copy should be waiting for me at home and I can't wait.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Â£ 20.00 seems a little steep for hours and hours of fun you can pick up previous titles for even less if you have a look online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Dodonpachi: Ressurection" - Brilliant</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Deathsmiles 2" - Brilliant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven't given these a go you really should</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are a great throwback to nostalgic gaming while remaining challenging and above all... fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You too will rave about CAVE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Az</p>

<p>You're right about "Deathsmiles 2".&nbsp; It's only in Japan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's the "Deathsmiles: Delux Edition" that you can pick up in the UK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=deathsmiles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=deathsmiles</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather amusingly all CAVE games are capable of running the chaotic on screen action with absolutely zero slowdown... but this makes them slightly different from how the originals were in the arcades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a response to Japanese outcry "Deathsmiles" was patched to put the slight graphical slowdown back into the game so people's timings wouldn't be off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good fun and CAVE really care about their Customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When they released&nbsp;"Mushi Mushi Pork Sweets" in Japan they they released the Japanese 360 Version as a region free disc so that people could import it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They make quality fun games which is why more and more of their stuff is now being published&nbsp;and sold in the West.</p>

<p>It seems best suited as an Arcade game and not for retail even if it is at a low price. I would rather see super top quality next-gen-esque&nbsp; titles being released in boxes. Maybe more people would be inclined to give it a purchase if it was on the Xbox Live

<p>It seems best suited as an Arcade game and not for retail even if it is at a low price. I would rather see super top quality next-gen-esque&nbsp; titles being released in boxes. Maybe more people would be inclined to give it a purchase if it was on the Xbox Live
 Arcade Marketplace.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They could have been released as "LIVE Arcade" titles like "Ikagura" but I'm glad CAVE took the time to update their Coin-Op classics and release them on disc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're put off by your games having re-sale or trade in value you could always wait until they're released on Games On Demand?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's no shortage of quality titles on the 360 and CAVE's contributions only serve to swell the ranks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I enjoy "Modern Warfare 3" but I've been shooting people since the original "Wolfenstien".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CAVE rekindle the genre and playstyle of the retro 2D&nbsp; side scrolling shooters where the acheivement was in getting the highest score and mastering the game while injecting it with a dose of Crack Cocaine visuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You're not going to play it and think "Wow... this is better than "Skyrim".&nbsp; But as you get to grips with how the game plays you start to appreciate just how much fun a decent SHMUP can be.</p>

<p>Will have to pick it up. Hopefully it is more user friendly than DoDonPachi Maximum for the mobile. Ressurection is also a great SHMUP but it doesn't have the same flare Deathsmiles 1 did. I haven't had a chance to pick up a Japanese port of the second,
 but I do love to hear when a CAVE bullet hell game has been given an EU release. Cheers!</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drawings have Specific number and Title/Name. </p>
<p>For example, <strong>Drawing No.: </strong>123,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Title/Name:</strong> Foundation Cross Section.</p>
<p>Here&nbsp;I wish to display the&nbsp;TITLE of drawings&nbsp;by adding column&nbsp;"TITLE" as shown below:</p>
<p><strong><u>Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Title</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Size&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date Created&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I&nbsp;have tried this way. </p>
<p>Opened 'Properties' ,&nbsp;clicked 'Description' tab then wrote title of drawings in 'TITLE',&nbsp;cliked OK.
</p>
<p>Opened Folder containing the PDF File. Right click 'Detail Pane',&nbsp;added column TITLE.
</p>
<p>Of course TITLE column appeared but shows nothing, did not appear the title&nbsp;I wrote.</p>
<p>Hope my requirement is clear here.</p>
<p>Please also advise is there any way to send you SCREEN SHOT other than "SKYDRIVE".</p>

<p>Wilson,</p>
<p>I cannot help you with any repairs. I am a victim of the same update. 1809 first tried to hide all of my documents, pictures etc. I found them once and restored them to where they should be. Three days later it came back and reinstalled itself. This time
 it got rid of everything for good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may see you at the Apple store. Or perhaps in a Learning Linux class.</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I download Mcafee software from BT</h2>
                    Everytime I try to download mcafee anti-virus from the BT website (free with my broadband package) - I get the following security warning.<br />
<br />
Windows has found a problem with this file.<br />
Name: DMSetup-Serial.exe<br />
Publisher: Unknown publisher<br />
<br />
this file was blocked because it does not have&nbsp;a valid digital signature that verifies its publisher.<br />
<br />
how can I bypass this and download the software. I pretty sure it's safe<br />
<br />
thanks

<h2>            Mouse pointer on second screen</h2>
                    I have a Surface Book connected to a Dell monitor.&nbsp; I'm using the Surface's touch pad as the mouse.&nbsp; The mouse pointer goes missing on the second screen, but only on certain parts of certain apps e.g. it goes missing in the text box of MS Outlook, but
 reappears for the menu bars etc.&nbsp; Can this be fixed?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why the mouse pointer disappears in your extended monitor, in this case, it only disappears in the text box of Outlook but not in it's other functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try to fix this by first ensuring that all drivers are up to date.&nbsp; In order for you to update the drivers, we recommend running the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit (SDT).&nbsp; To know more on how to run this, simply click at this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After running SDT and it does not detect any error or after it has been able to update your drivers, try to see if the issue still recurs.&nbsp; Sometimes, the difference of resolution between your extended monitor and your Surface device may cause this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also opt to change the mouse pointer size to see if this could fix the issue.&nbsp; To fix the mouse pointer size, if you're on Windows 10, you simply have to go to Control Panel and change the settings there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try this update fix which can be found in this <a href="https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Check the Mouse Properties Pointer Options.&nbsp; The mouse pointer can be changed to be an I-bar icon for text areas but there is also an option which makes it be suppressed.&nbsp; Looks like you should also check out the Pointers tab in that dialog and see what
 Scheme you have and whether it has been customized.</p>

<h2>            Windows keeps trying to update, then undoes the update on restart</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows updates are ready to install. I have to anyway if I shutdown or restart the computer on windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the computer turns off it finishes 100% of the updates. When the computer comes back on to finish the updates, it immediately&nbsp;said there was a problem and has to undo the update. There is no % of completed updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer then restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later on, the updates are waiting when I want to shut down the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I don't really want to turn off the updates but my computer has limited space on the HDD left. Recently I had to uninstall outlook mail client to free up space. So that could be it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Josh</p>

            Hello, <br />
<br />
Have you tried checking for any application that might be causing this? <br />
<br />
How about any changes made prior to this issue?<br />
<br />
Run the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/bd832f07-1420-0c14-d2a5-0a5a24ba40be/using-system-file-checker-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System File Checker</a> to scan your system. Please note that the scan may take some time, so be patient. Windows will repair any corrupted or missing files that are found. If information from the installation CD is needed to repair the problem, you may be
 prompted to insert your Windows CD.<br />
<br />
We look forward to your update.<br />
<br />
Regards.

            <p>I ran SFC, and it competed with no issues found. &nbsp;All &nbsp;other programs run fine. &nbsp; Task manager shows nothing significant consuming CPU. &nbsp; Windows explorer is top CPU user at 2.2% while the green bar trudges along. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It takes about 5 minutes to get to the 95% mark where the green bar seems to get stuck, and then another 5 minutes to finally display the contents of "This PC".</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></div>
<p>Since you're done with the SFC scan, let's go on with the next troubleshooting methods to resolve the issue you're experiencing with your File Explorer. But first, please provide the answers to the following for further isolation of your concern:</p>

</li><li>What are the changes made or the things you've done before the issue start?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1 - Run the Memory Diagnostic Tool.</strong><br />

</p><p><strong>Method 2 - End the File Explorer process and create a new one.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>File Explorer</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Press the <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>Shift</strong> + <strong>Esc </strong>
keys from the keyboard to execute the <strong>Task Manager</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>More details</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Find the <strong>Windows Explorer</strong> under the <strong>Processes</strong> tab.<br />
</li><li>Right-click on it and choose <strong>End task</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click on the <strong>File</strong> tab, then choose <strong>Run new task</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Type <strong>explorer.exe</strong>, then press the <strong>Enter</strong> key from the keyboard.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3 - Run the System Maintenance.</strong><br />
Running the <strong>System Maintenance troubleshooter</strong> finds and cleans up unused files and shortcuts, and perform maintenance tasks.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the<strong> Start </strong>icon, then select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />

<h2>            How to restore &#34;pin to task bar command&#34; to context menu</h2>
                    <p>For reasons unknown, the "pin to start menu" and "pin to taskbar" options have disappeared from my right-click context menu.&nbsp; I have tried several things that I found during searches about this problem, but so far non have worked.&nbsp; I would appreciate any
 guidance toward solving this problem, which first arose when the task bar icon for Windows Explorer disappeared.&nbsp; I've been trying to restore it ever since.&nbsp; Right now, I'm using a shortcut that&nbsp;I placed on the desktop.&nbsp; Several of the found solutions involved
 deleting the arrow from short cuts in an invalid way.&nbsp; I have never attempted this, so I don't know what caused this issue to develop????</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            I know, Donald, I understood you. I suggested that only as a trial-and-error-method...<br />
<br />
Since I don't know which Win 7 version you are running, the following might not apply to you:<br />
There is a special Group Policy Setting which doesn't allow pinning of new programs. Perhaps you toggled that accidently?

The "Pin to task bar" menu item appears only for some file types and not for others, hence my question.

<h2>            Changing User Account memory allocaition</h2>
                    I'm getting memory errors for the files that get created when I scan documents or create DVD presentations.&nbsp; The applicaitons work fine they can't save the files.&nbsp;&nbsp; My system uses Vista Home premium and it is set up with three accounts.&nbsp; 2 admin and one
 guest.&nbsp; One admin account has 4.1 gig of local memory and the other has 2.63 and the guest account as 29.2gig.&nbsp; My system has 2 gig of ram and 86 gig hard drive with 31 gig free. Could my problem be related to user profile memory settings I can't seem to change
 the allocation amounts.

            Hi Sa-morgan,<br />
<br />
â€¢&nbsp;Does the issue happen with all the user accounts?<br />
â€¢&nbsp;What happens when you save a file?<br />
â€¢&nbsp;Do you get any error message?<br />
â€¢&nbsp;When did the issue start?<br />
â€¢&nbsp;Was there any changes done prior to this issue?<br />
â€¢&nbsp;Are these office Application like PowerPoint, Word?<br />
â€¢&nbsp;Do you have issues when saving other file types?<br />
<br />
You may try running a disc clean up to delete temporary files and unwanted data. Then try saving a file.<br />
<br />

            Hi Diana D,<br />
<br />
Yes, my issue happens with the other admin account by the guest account&nbsp;seems to work fine&nbsp;I can scan and created DVD.&nbsp; When I try to save or create the scan.&nbsp; When I try to scan or save the video presentation I am working on I get a memory&nbsp;error or in sufficient
 priveliges for the accounts.&nbsp; The frustrating part is the two accounts are admin accounts that aren't working and it wasn't until I turned on the guest account&nbsp;that I found out that the appliations worked on that account.&nbsp; I run a disc file clean up utility
 from McAfee and iolo\System Mechanic regularly.&nbsp; I just recently started having this problem with the memory.&nbsp; Not sure if it's related but I have noticed that when we switch between users&nbsp;quite often&nbsp;the other users&nbsp;profile doen't load and I end up shutting
 down and restarting to avoid having a default profile load.&nbsp; No, these are not office appliations.&nbsp; The cannon scanner uses CanoScan Toolbox Ver5.0 and the presentation applicaiton is Photodex ProShowProducer 4.1.2712.&nbsp; I haven't experience problems saving
 other types of files ie. word but have notices when connected with internet explorer there is problems with delay typing or sessions shutting down for no reason.&nbsp; Do you think the problems may be related to the memory allocations for the different accounts.<br />

    <title>Wireless internet stops working after a few minutes upon start-up. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eli_gaultney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless internet stops working after a few minutes upon start-up.</h2>
                    I've recently moved to a new apartment where I'm using the same internet provider but a different router. Upon first arriving the internet would work for a few minutes and then I'd get a DNS Lookup error for every web page I tried to go to. At the same
 time, background applications would often seem to work just fine connecting and updating, but I couldn't browse webpages. I called the internet company and they sent out an upgraded router (3.0).&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>With the new router the problem is the exact same, but now I'm getting a time-out error message after about 15 minutes for any website I wish to visit.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried a new wireless adapter. When I boot up on the same computer with a different operating system there are no problems using the internet. Intermittently the internet will start working just fine for a short period of time before giving me the
 same time-out message. I have repeatedly tried flushing the DNS cache to see if that would fix the problem with no success. I've tried manually setting the DNS servers. I've tried resetting the network adapter. When I run windows diagnostics it gives an error
 that says it can't connect to microsoft.com but it doesn't know why.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Whenever the problem occurs if I restart the computer I have access to the internet for a short period of time and then the same error occurs. I'm losing my mind trying to figure this out but all I'm sure of is that it's a Windows 7 problem. Any help would
 be MUCH appreciated.</div>
