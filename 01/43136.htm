            Yeah i knew that was an option, just thought there may be a way to either bypass the auto update or maybe unlock my profile some way through my phone. But doesnt look like its possible... imo its a little silly the system updates are automatic even when
 you have it turned off ü§î

<h2>            Verfying Valid Windows 10 Product Activations</h2>
                    <p>As an Insider and a registered Microsoft Refurbisher, and updating laptops from both Windows 7 Professional and Windows 8.1 Professional with legitimate product keys I would like some additional information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I check to see if the product keys for Windows 10 upgrades from the Insider program are valid for the life of these devices?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i change each of these devices back to Local Accounts will the Product keys stay active for the life of these devices?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a Microsoft Refubisher all of these Dell laptops are given as gifts to high school students who can't afford to buy them. I have gifted over 450 laptops over the past 5 years for both Windows 7 Pro and Windows 8 Pro, and now I will gift Windows 10 Pro
 if all of the upgraded product keys stay valid for the life of the devices.</p>

Dual boot configurations is the best way in my estimation to evaluate Windows 10, an article was written showing you how to do that.

<p>
</p><p><strong>‚ÄúI want to continue as a Windows Insider!‚Äù</strong> If you want to continue as a Windows Insider past 7/29 there is nothing you need to do. You‚Äôre already opted in and receiving builds in the Fast or Slow ring depending upon your selection. This
 is prerelease software and is activated with a prerelease key. Each individual build will expire after a time, but you‚Äôll continue to receive new builds so by the time an older prerelease build expires you‚Äôll have received a new one. Since we‚Äôre continuing
 the Windows Insider Program you‚Äôll be able to continue receiving builds and those builds will continue to be activated under the terms of the Windows Insider Program. We provide ISOs for these builds for recovery from any significant problems, but they are
 still pre-release software. As part of the program we‚Äôll upgrade Insiders to what is for all intents and purposes the same build as what other customers will get on 7/29, but that will be just another build for Insiders, and those who stay in the program will
 simply get the next build after as well.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Greg, Thanks for reply. Above is not helping solve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>current issue is I am not able to get command prompt also on my bootable window CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is error message I am getting when I keep boot option as internal hard disk.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a24e2ead-85e2-4556-99a3-6521bc7da675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a24e2ead-85e2-4556-99a3-6521bc7da675" /></a></p>

</p><p>While installing from CD I got message that I can't create partition on my hard disk since driver is missing. Is there anyway, i can write code using command prompt to reset everything.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Does the booted install get to the screen where it shows the partitions on the hard drive, so you know the hard drive is even detected?&nbsp; Is the HD listed on the Main BIOS tab, usually by its serial you can google it to find the maker and run bootable
<a href="http://www.carrona.org/hddiag.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HD Diagnostics?</a>&nbsp; If not try reinstalling it to get it recognized or replace it with another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error for a driver missing usually means the media is bad.&nbsp; Create the media using only the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation Tool</a>.&nbsp; Test it boots and queues up install in another PC without the error.&nbsp; You should be able to access the Command Prompt on the second screen via Repair Your Computer link.&nbsp; If not the media is bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check also on the Main BIOS screen SATA controller&nbsp; is set to AHCI, after resetting the BIOS to defaults, Saving changes.&nbsp;&nbsp; We should probably see the settings on that screen, too.&nbsp; I don't think you have UEFI but there may be other settings awry we can
 spot.</p>

            <p>I suggested earlier to determine the hard drive maker and run it's <a href="http://www.carrona.org/hddiag.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HD Diagnostic</a> extended CD scan.&nbsp; This will tell you the exact condition of the hard drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it will repair enough to create a partition using the commands or installation media, you should also run a
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/guide-to-using-check-disk-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Disk Check</a> to further confirm the drive condition, with the /f switch to repair file system if needed.&nbsp; Passing both tests will save the drive, otherwise I'd replace it.

            <p>Try your solution, but still didn't do the job. got into ROM drive properties and device status read:(windows cannot load the device driver for the hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing . (code 39) .trying to find the manufacture is standard CD-ROM
 drive, but haven't had much luck. Try to get windows to find up to date driver, but the answer came back saying my software is up to date.
</p>
<p>thanks for your help anyways</p>

            <p>Windows error messages can sometimes be quite misleading.&nbsp; In this case, the error most likely is NOT that the driver is "corrupted or missing."&nbsp; Also, it's not likely to help if you "<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>check
 your manufacturer's website for the </span><span>latest driver."&nbsp; Most, if not all, CD/DVD drives installed in Windows systems use the driver provided by Microsoft and built into Windows.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The problem likely is a Windows Registry entry that often is the result of installing third-party software that relates to recording CDs or DVDs.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>First, create a System Restore point (<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/3195/create-a-system-restore-point-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/3195/create-a-system-restore-point-in-windows-7/</a>).&nbsp; Then use
 "Resolution 3" here:&nbsp; <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/314060/your-cd-or-dvd-drive-is-not-recognized-by-windows-or-other-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/314060/your-cd-or-dvd-drive-is-not-recognized-by-windows-or-other-programs</a> (you could first try "Resolution 2" but in my experience the Windows "troubleshooters" generally do not work very well).</p>

<h3> cfab1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue stop error screen is occurring almost once a day for about 5 days now.</h2>
                    <p>Virus scan had found 2 files and removed them after the first 'crash' but 3 new scans using different software finds nothing else.&nbsp; Any ideas on what else I can try?&nbsp; No new software or hardware has been installed, just the regular MS and McAfee updates.<br />
Does regclean still work on XP?&nbsp; I read something warning against using it...<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for all the responses...here's more info:</p>
<p>Computer: Dell Dimension 4700</p>
<p>Windows XP Professional w/SP3</p>
<p>No bootable system CD/Disk</p>
<p>McAfee antivirus software, and was running Windows Defender til I read I shouldn't run both (turned off Defender today).</p>
<p>I also ran the Malwarebytes software the other day, I'm pretty sure it's the program that found 2 files and removed them.</p>
<p>System boots up OK every day but seems to get the BSOD shortly after the first login, even if I just login and let it sit.</p>
<p>After powering off and restarting, I have then spent hours online&nbsp;researching and reading about these types of problems, trying to solve it myself and never get the BSOD....I have done some things trying to fix it, such as MS's automated 'Fix it Now' for
 some IE problems, thought it was fixed until the next morning when I booted up and logged in.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;A hardware diagnostics from Dell ran with no reported problems on components.</p>

Due to a a hideous oversight in the MS Answers forums design, we know nothing about your system.<br />
<br />
<div>
<div>Please provide additional information about your system:</div>
<div><br />
<div>What is your system make and model?</div>
<div><br />
<div>What is your XP Version and Service Pack?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation: &nbsp;McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</div>
<div><br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive?
<div><br />
<div>Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?</div>
<div><br />
Does your system seem to boot okay and then crash or does it not boot at all?
<div><br />
<div>If your system was working okay, what do you think might have changed since the last time it worked properly?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can you make the system crash any time you want? &nbsp;For example, would you say that there is any particular system activity that coincides with the crashes (like watching videos, playing games, etc.).</div>
<div><br />
The next time your system crashes, provide more information about what you see.</div>

<div><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If there is a file name listed under the STOP message, be sure to include that information too.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
Now provide more information about your system and information from the most recent crashes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click Start, Run and in the box enter:</div>
<div><br />
<div>msinfo32</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All,&nbsp;Copy and then paste the information back here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to&nbsp;be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Download BlueScreenView from here:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Unzip and run it (BSV installs nothing) and let it finish scanning all your crash dump files. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you double click on of the dumps, you will get some information about it (including the&nbsp;Caused By Driver field) and you may be able to spot the problem right away - especially if&nbsp;you see a pattern in the dumps where the Caused by Driver field is the
 same (start with that&nbsp;driver).</div>
<div><br />
<div>BlueScreenView tries to locate the right driver or module that caused the blue screen by looking inside the crash stack. However, be aware that the driver detection mechanism is not 100% accurate, and you should also look in the lower pane, that display
 all drivers/modules found in the stack.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Select (highlight) one or more of the most recent dump files by clicking them and holding&nbsp;down the Ctrl key to select multiples files. &nbsp;Try to select just the most recent ones that&nbsp;relate to your issue (maybe five or so dump files to get started).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click File, Save Selected Items and save the information from the dumps to a text file on&nbsp;your desktop called BSOD.txt. &nbsp;Open BSOD.txt with a text editor, copy all the text and&nbsp;paste it into your next reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is an example of the BSV report from a single BSOD that I initiated on purpose that&nbsp;shows the cause of the crash as the i8042prt.sys driver belonging to Microsoft Corporation:</div>

            <p><span>You have given us a general indication of the nature of the problem but specific error reports make finding a solution so much
 easier.</span></p>
<p><span>When a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) system failure occurs for most users there is insufficient time to note down in full what
 it says; the exact text is important to anyone trying to diagnose what is wrong. You can gain the time needed when the error next occurs by following the procedure described below.</span></p>
<p><span>If you haven't done so already disable automatic restart on system failure. This should help by allowing time to write down
 the Stop Error code and related information properly. Right click on the My Computer icon on the Desktop and select Properties, Advanced, Start-Up and Recovery, System Failure and uncheck the box before Automatically Restart. Do not re-enable automatic restart
 on system failure after getting this information as this setting is best left to not to allow Automatic Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>If the system failure occurs during the booting of the computer you need to try a different approach. You can access the Windows
 Advanced Options Menu on many computers by constantly pressing the F8 (Function) key during Start-Up and selecting the option - Disable automatic restart on system failure. This method is not always easy to use as it can be difficult to depress the F8 at exactly
 the right time. Try again if it does not work first time. On some computers a different key has to be used.</span></p>

            <p>After a week of struggling and a similar experience on 2 Dell Dimension 520 computers I have come to the following conclusion:</p>
<p>A recent Mcafee update has changed some Dell drivers and therefore caused the blue screen error.</p>
<p>We have had to completely re-install windows and dell drivers in order to overcome this error but as soon as Mcafee update downloads and installs the same problem reoccurs.</p>
<p>There is no way to overcome this unless you have a restore point just prior to the update so you can do a system restore. Make sure that you disable Mcafee automatic update as soon as the restore is complete or it will bluescreen again.</p>
<p>Two mcafee technicians deny any problem with Mcafee but I, and the computer engineer I asked to help, are now completely convinced that this was caused by Mcafee.</p>

            Thanks, this actually sounds like it was probably my problem too because things are much better since I removed Mcafee and went with MS Security and also re-installed some of the Dell drivers.&nbsp; I have had 1 or maybe 2 BS's since, but much better than every
 day!&nbsp; I must still need some driver replaced but haven't figured it out yet.

                    I have&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;on my PC and I added my Samsung Home Audio Device to my Devices and Printers list. When I try to sink the audio it only connects for a second then immediately disconnects. Also troubleshooting&nbsp;will&nbsp;not identify the problem. Is there a

<h2>            Running Chkdsk utility does not fix my problem.  What do I do next&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am running a 2007 Excel spreadsheet using both .xlsx and .xls extensions on a zip drive.&nbsp; I attempted to open both files on my PC at work, which uses Windows XP SP2.&nbsp; I received the error message that "Excel cannot open the file &lt;filename&gt; because the
 file format or file extension is not valid.&nbsp; Verify that the file has not been corrupted and that the file extension matches the format of the file."&nbsp; I ran the utility twice using the following process: My Computer &gt; click Drive where file is located &gt; Properties
 &gt; Tools &gt; Check Now &gt; Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors.&nbsp; When Check Disk process is complete, a dialog box appears that reads "check disk is complete".&nbsp; No exit code was given at the completion of either run.</p>
<p>What should I do now?&nbsp; BTW, I did run the Recovery Toolbox for Excel.&nbsp; Message read that "the file or directory is corrupt and unreadable.&nbsp; Please run the Chkdsk utility."</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<br />
You should always start your own thread, even if you think your problem is "exactly the same" as the issue raised by the original question.&nbsp; After all, if you had exactly the same problem, you should be able to use exactly the same solution and wouldn't have
 to ask.<br />
<br />
Data recovered by chkdsk may or may not be usable.&nbsp; The simpler the data -- e.g., a plain text file -- the more likely that a recovered file will be usable by the appropriate application.&nbsp; More complex data -- such as files created by Excel, Word, and Powerpoint
 -- may be missing crucial pieces of formatting data that may make the file unopenable.<br />
<br />
That said, you should rename a recovered data file with the extension (the 3 or 4 characters after the dot) appropriate to the application that you intend to use with the file.&nbsp; For example, if you see a file named Dec12Letter.chk and you know that it is a
 Word file, rename it to Dec12Letter.doc.<br />
<br />
For Excel files, use .xls and for Powerpoint, use .ppt.<br />
<br />
If you are using Office 2007 or 2010, use the 4 letter extensions: docx, xlsx, pptx instead.<br />

<h2>            A network cable is not properly plugged in or may be broken - error message</h2>
                    I bought an MSI laptop about a month and a half ago, and since I've had it I've had issues with the internet connection dropping. It's Windows 8, and after troubleshooting the message says "A network cable is not properly plugged in or may be broken" -
 as far as the issue being the cable, no other device in the house has that issue, just my laptop. It looks like this is a common Windows issue, but no one can give me a Windows 8 solution!!

            Hi all
<div><br />
<div>In the end I found a disc in the box my laptop came in with wireless internet drivers and after downloading it seems to be working fine - my bad.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's definitely a driver issue but if any of you have MSI laptops good luck, that website is not easy to navigate and I had no idea which driver to install, it was a list of numbers and letters.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Thanks so much to this forum, you guys are on form! I had a response so quickly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope everyone else finds their solutions!</div>

<h2>            Solitaire does not work</h2>
                    Solitaire does not now work on Windows 10.&nbsp; When I originally installed Windows 10 it did not work.&nbsp; I was able to make a comment to Windows and then Solitaire began working.&nbsp; A couple of days ago my computer was asleep and would not wake up.&nbsp; I turned
 the power off and then rebooted the computer.&nbsp; Now Solitaire does not work.&nbsp; In addition, YouTube will not work.

Kabir (I've been to your predecessors tomb in Delhi). You haven't answered the questions. The link is not helpful. Why does Edge show many of my pages in Times when they were never posted in Times and are not shown in Times on Chrome or Firefox? motorcyclemeanders.com

    <title>I Screwed Up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaveman2280  say:</h3>
<h2>            I Screwed Up</h2>
                    
<p><span>So, I had an older 360 that my old boss had given me as a Christmas gift 3 or 4 years ago. Well, it finally died, and I went to buy a new one.
<br />
I wanted one of the smaller, black, quieter ones anyway, and this was the time.<br />
<br />
I didn't get one with a hard drive, because I'm an idiot, and just figured my old one would snap right on.<br />
When I got home and realized that wouldn't work, I purchased a 250 gig HD from NewEgg, and a transfer cable.<br />
Transferred everything fine, all my save were there, etc. <br />
<br />
Then, when playing Nascar 09 last night, it occurred to me that every time I played it asked which storage device I wanted to use.<br />
I always picked the hard drive, but noticed that data was also on the internal memory unit. I transferred that to my hard drive thinking that was more of the game, and it wiped my saves.<br />
<br />
It's like I've never even played the game, everything is gone. I'm so pissed I can't even play the game anymore.<br />
<br />
So, for any gaming junkies like me out there, is there any way to reclaim those saves? Are they hidden somewhere, or just gone?<br />
Thanks for any help.</span></p>

<p>You can view whatever save data is on your system in the 'System Settings' menu of the Xbox Dashboard. In 'System Settings,' select 'Memory.' From there you can inspect your profiles, games, etc. If the data is there but listed as corrupted, there is unfortunately
 no way to recover it. </p>

<h2>            Passcode&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Okay so my parents are getting tired of my brother never doing his homework and wanting to play Xbox instead. They would take the Xbox away but they do not feel that it would be fair to me if
 they did that. So what I am wonder is if there is anyway to set up a passcode so that you cannot even play Xbox unless you put in the code?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>To set an Xbox LIVE pass code:</p>
<p>From any area of the Xbox Dashboard, select your gamer profile.</p>
<p>From the Gamer Profile screen, select Account Management, Xbox LIVE Pass Code.</p>
<p>Enter a four-button code using the X and Y buttons, triggers, bumpers, and directional pad on your Xbox 360 controller.</p>
<p>Confirm your code by entering it again. If you type it differently the second time, repeat from step 3.</p>
<p>To reset your pass code, repeat this procedure at any time. (You will have to enter your original Xbox LIVE pass code before you can create a new one.)</p>
<p>Set a Family Settings Pass Code</p>
<p>A Family Settings pass code keeps anyone who uses your Xbox 360 video game and entertainment system‚Äîyour kids, for instance‚Äîfrom altering your Family Settings.</p>
<p>Use your Family Settings pass code to override game and movie settings if you (or those with whom you share your pass code) want to play games or watch DVD movies that your console settings would normally block.</p>
<p>To set a pass code for your Xbox 360 console:</p>
<p>Start from the System area of the Xbox Dashboard or‚Äîif you're using the Xbox 360 system for the first time‚Äîfrom the Initial Setup Complete screen. Select Family Settings, Console Controls.</p>
<p>Select Set Pass Code.</p>
<p>Select Pass Code, then enter a four-button code using the X and Y buttons, triggers, bumpers, and directional pad on your Xbox 360 controller.</p>
<p>Confirm your code by entering it again. If you type it differently the second time, repeat from step 3.</p>
<p>Choose a pass-code reset question. The default question is "favorite fictional character."</p>
<p>To accept this question, skip to the next step.</p>
<p>To choose a different question (or to choose this question after you've used another), select Pass Code Reset Question and choose from the options given.</p>
<p>Select Pass Code Reset Answer and enter your answer using the on-screen virtual keyboard and either your Xbox 360 controller or a standard USB computer keyboard plugged into a controller port on your console.</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Pick a question for which your answer will be obvious and unlikely to change in the forseeable future. Also, be sure to type your answer in a way that will be easy to retype later if you forget your pass code.</p>
<p>Select Done from the Set Pass Code screen, then select Done once more from the Console Controls screen. When prompted, select Yes, save changes to put your new settings into effect.</p>
<p>To reset your pass code, repeat this procedure at any time.</p>
<p>Reset a Forgotten Pass Code</p>
<p>To reset your Family Settings pass code after you've forgotten it:</p>
<p>From the System area of the Xbox Dashboard, select Family Settings, Console Controls.</p>
<p>Enter an incorrect pass code.</p>
<p>You will be told that your pass code is incorrect. Select Reset pass code.</p>
<p>You will then be shown your pass-code question and asked to answer it.</p>
<p>Type your answer using the on-screen virtual keyboard and either your Xbox 360 controller or a standard USB computer keyboard plugged into a controller port on your console. Your answer is case-sensitive and must be typed exactly as you entered it originally.
 This will clear your original pass code and allow you to enter another.</p>
<p>Repeat the Set a Family Settings Pass Code procedure, beginning with step 2.</p>
<p>If you've forgotten the answer to your pass-code reset question as well as your pass code, please call Xbox Customer Support at 1-800-4-MY-XBOX (1-800-469-9269).</p>
<p>If you've forgotten your Xbox LIVE pass code, please call Xbox Customer Support at 1-800-4-MY-XBOX (1-800-469-9269).</p>

<p>Infinity Ward lost around 50 of its best employees. Not to mention, Activision has made intentions clear since Call of Duty has been copy and past since CoD4.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless there is something done to drastically alter gameplay, I don't see how new maps, new perks, re-skinned weapons, and 4 hour campaign can warrant $60. Maybe $30 but I'm getting extremely tired of these games functioning more like expansion packs than
 actual games.</p>

<p>But isn't that every games sequel ? The same thing/game just re-skinned. I think it will be fine, I'm pretty sure they have the tech and the know how to make this game work.</p>

<p>No, sequels always upgrade something. As much as Halo seems similar between all 5 or 6 games, there are major differences in features, graphics, and gameplay. In Call of Duty, the graphics really haven't even changed since CoD4. They have all just been expansion
 packs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I'm going to get this game, I want to see something new. If it looks like MW 2.2, I will not be purchasing.</p>

<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows is the program originally designed for?
<br />
<br />I would try installing in compatibility mode to see if it works.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Hello DreadingBeast21 ,
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />On the website of your pc, with the exact model, you should be able to find the initial version.
<br />Another way would be to perform a reset factory if the OEM partition is keeped an in good state.
<br />What are your PC manufacturer and exact model ?
<br />
<br />If it doesn't work, I suggest you call Mcrososoft support with the product key and they will tell you the edition corresponding.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/</a>
<br />
<br />To extact the product key,
<br />
<br />1- Open  'Command Prompt' with Admin privileges (right click -&gt; Run as Administrator) 
<br />2- Copy/paste the Following command + Enter
<br />powershell "(Get-WmiObject -query ‚Äòselect * from SoftwareLicensingService‚Äô).OA3xOriginalProductKey"

            Hello,
<br />&gt;The company no longer exists.
<br />I didn't refer to it.
<br />
<br />Did you execute the command I told you to find your product key ?
<br />
<br />This pc was sold before Windows 10 was released, so I think it came with Windows 8.1 preinstalled.
<br />
<br />I suggest you extract product key and call Microsoft support as I told you.

<p><span><font color="#000000"><br />
Thank you for the update.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><br />
Since the issue persists, in safe mode then could be some hardware conflicts.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<br />
I would suggest you to </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">disconnect all the external devices (printers, scanner, USB (universal serial bus) drives, etc...) Except mouse and the keyboard and then boot
 up.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<br />
If this fixes the issue, then add the devices one after the other until you discover the piece of hardware causing the issue. Then we can update driver software for that particular device.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was just wondering if you resolved this problem since I have it also. I had win 8.1 in the beginning and it booted slowly (the problem that we are talking right now), and then I upgrade it to win 10. Win 10 booted in 8 seconds (there was no problem at
 all with the booting). I returned to win 8.1 again and the startup is again very slow (black screen with little white dash flashing in top let corner, and then after 25-30 seconds log in appears). Sorry if bothering you, I was just checking if I have the same
 problem as you do, and weather you fixed it?</p>
        </p>

                    <p>I am caught in a vicious cycle of not being able to cancel. You keep trying to charge my paypal, which keeps trying to charge AN OVERDRAWN ACCOUNT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the steps found in EVERY post of this type. Please CLOSELY review the screen shots I am posting. HELP. This is absolutely the most abhorrent billing/accounting system I have ever seen. Kindly CANCEL MY SKYPE NUMBER like I requested 3 months
 ago and STOP TRYING TO CHARGE ME. I am being hit with overdraft charges every 2 or 3 days you do this!!!!&nbsp;</p>
