    <title>Resizing a partition with Win 7 Disk Management applet of CP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Resizing a partition with Win 7 Disk Management applet of CP</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;I'm trying to resize a partition using the Disk Management sub-applet of the Control Panel's Computer Management, and need help because needless to say&nbsp;this beast doesn't work like the good old Partition Magic that I knew and loved back in the XP days of
 yore.&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp; On my test machine I have a hard drive with 5 partitions as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary Partition&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logical Drive</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; C:</p>
<p>&nbsp;4 GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31 GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 105 GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18 GB&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;27 GB</p>
<p>I wish to expand the 27 GB C: partition to include the 18 GB of free space adjacent to it (I freed up the 18 GB from the E: partition to enable doing this).&nbsp; However when I right-click on the C: partition, the "expand" option is greyed out, and I can't figure
 out how to get this to work.&nbsp; I know I could back up the E: and C: partitions, delete and reallocate everything, then do a restore, but there's got to be an easier way!&nbsp; Back in the Partition Magic days this always worked, but I'm missing something with this
 Disk Management applet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; If some kind soul could point me in the right direction, I'd sure appreciate it.&nbsp; TIA</p>

<p>SC Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I never heard of Easus Partition Master before yesterday, but I just downloaded it from Download.com.&nbsp; Download.com shows close to 3 million downloads of it, and they have a most favorable CNET review of it there too.&nbsp; Additionally it seems everywhere
 I turn in researching this, there's someone recommending this program, so I'll test it tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Interestingly, I ran across another post from this guy Santosh where he said you can't expand a partition that has Windows installed in it, and that's what I'm trying to do.&nbsp; I guess I was hoping the Disk Management was worth bothering with, but as I feared,
 it's not good for much more than frustration!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to your question I have both Win 7/32 and Win7/64 installed on the PC in question, so I'll install EPM under the 32 bit version.&nbsp; I also have XP installed in a 3rd partition that has Partition Magic installed, but I ran into a lot of trouble
 months ago when I tried to use it on a Win7 partition.&nbsp; If I didn't know better I'd think MS went out of their way to make Win7 as incompatible with XP as they could!&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>Thank you SC Tom.&nbsp; I'll get back to you here and report my experience tomorrow.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t connect to third-party paid internet services - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gsahelp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to third-party paid internet services</h2>
                    <p>I am at a conference and we are paying to use the hotel's conference wireless. When I look at the list of networks, either the one that pops up when I click the taskbar icon or the one at Settings&gt;WiFi, &nbsp;there is no "Connect" button for the wireless network
 we're supposed to use. Instead, there is the text "Buy Wifi From Windows Store."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In normal usage, one connects to the network and enters one's access code in a launch page, but I can't do this because there is no way for me to connect. I didn't originally have Microsoft WiFi, so I installed it, thinking perhaps that the new system was
 a little buggy and that having the app would allow me to connect. However, the behavior hasn't changed -- except that now I can purchase a connection from Microsoft to connect to a network that I'm already paying the hotel for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm a conference manager, and this is directly affecting my ability to do my job. The lobby has free wireless, but I can't get that in the rest of the hotel. What am I supposed to do?</p>

<br /> 
<br />If you have not I would restart the computer to see if that clears.
<br />
<br />If not I would do a Performance check for the entire system since there may be other unknown issues after that update. Yes it seems like a lot however this will clean system corruption.
<br />
<br />If using an SSD or hybrid hard drive be sure it has the latest firmware.
<br />
<br />Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a  process of elimination :
<br />
<br />Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin)   OR   Windows PowerShell (Admin) - at the prompt type in 
<br />
<br />MSCONFIG 
<br />
<br />and hit enter

<br />Do all of these :
<br />
<br />If you had a 3rd party antivirus on the OS you upgraded OR if you have one now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype out there
<br />Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are true superstars.

<br />
<br />The below is additional help with some of the methods in the "Tips to improve...." link.
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />------
<br />
<br />
<br />Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS, chipset drivers, and all the major device drivers.
<br />
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click Start Button - Right Click Start Button - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -  REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<h2>            I get the same error everyone else is getting during the 1709 update.  W 10 could not configure one or more system compnents and First_boot phase</h2>
                    <p>I am an IT guy but this is a bad one for Microsoft.</p>
<p>I have spent over 80 hours trying to resolve this error.</p>
<p>I have done everything possible that I know of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; clean boot</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; scanned disk drives</p>
<p>3.Tried update - same error.</p>
<p>4. Tried update from downloaded W 10 .ISO disk - same error</p>
<p>5. Tried the tool&nbsp;that was suggested - same error</p>
<p>6. uninstalled newly installed NVIDIA card (put older card back in) that worked perfectly before all of this.&nbsp; Same error</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Updated the chipset and bios drivers on the ASUS Z87 Deluxe Quad Motherboard - same error</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extremely disappointed in Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is t here a way to update these updates one at a time instead of in mass?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will not do a clean install on my computer - too much work and should not have to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will revert back to the 1703 version - that worked.&nbsp; No reason 1709 doesn't work.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi Alan, </p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your sentiments. For the error "could not configure one or more system components" that you are getting, you may try the following troubleshooting suggestions:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>1.</em></strong> Create a Windows 10 USB Bootable flash drive using this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><em>support link</em></strong></a>. </p>
<p>When using a USB drive, make sure to set up your BIOS to boot from the USB drive.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.</strong></em> After booting into setup, choose the <strong>Repair Computer option</strong> &gt;
<strong>Troubleshoot </strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Command Prompt</strong>. If you are using a recovery drive, click
<strong>Troubleshoot </strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</p>
<p>On the command prompt, you will need to issue a set of commands to find and resolve issues that might be preventing your computer from booting.</p>
<p><em><strong>3.</strong></em> Type <strong>BOOTREC /FIXMBR</strong> and click <strong>
Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>This command will attempt to fix any corruption issues with the master boot record.</p>
<p><em><strong>4.</strong></em> Next, type <strong>BOOTREC /FIXBOOT</strong> then click
<strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>This will attempt to write a new boot sector on the hard disk if Windows detects damage. Usually, this happens in cases where an older version of Windows was installed, or a non-compatible operating system such as Linux was installed.</p>
<p><em><strong>5.</strong></em> If you see "Boot Manager is Missing" error, then the
<strong>BOOTREC /RebuildBcd</strong> command may be able to fix it. This operation can also restore boot entries for older versions of Windows if you have a dual boot configuration.</p>
<p><em><strong>6.</strong></em> If <strong>BOOTREC /RebuildBcd</strong> does not work, then Microsoft recommends you back up your
<strong>BCD</strong> (Boot Configuration Data) store, then run the <strong>BOOTREC /RebuildBcd</strong> command again. Here are the commands:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bcdedit /export C:\BCD_Backup</strong>&nbsp; then click
<strong>Enter</strong>. <br />
<strong>c:&nbsp;</strong> then click <strong>Enter</strong>. <br />
<strong>cd boot</strong>&nbsp; then click <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
<strong>attrib bcd -s -h -r&nbsp;</strong> then click <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
<strong>ren c:\boot\bcd bcd.old</strong>&nbsp; then click <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
<strong>bootrec /RebuildBcd</strong>&nbsp; then click <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
<br />
<em><strong>7.</strong></em> If you are dual booting with older versions of Windows such as Windows 7, you may use the
<strong>BOOTREC /ScanOs</strong> command. The ScanOS command can find and restore entries for older versions of Windows.</p>
<p><em><strong>8. </strong></em>After all these commands, you may try running the
<strong>chkdsk </strong>utility on your Windows 10 computer. Please refer to the post Gerry C J Cornell Community Moderator&nbsp; | Article Author by clicking this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/running-chkdsk-in-windows-10/26fe8552-a553-400f-ac86-7f71d147df9d"><em>link</em></a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: </p>
<p>It is always safe to back up your personal files to avoid any inconvenience. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result for us to assist you further. </p>

<p>This is why there is so much confusion over this issue.&nbsp; It seems that the suggestions have nothing to do with the problem.&nbsp; Like, they want to get rid of you and give you anything to get you of their back.&nbsp; Being an IT person I have been down this road
 with many tech companies.</p>
<p>This is not a boot issue as far as I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the Windows ISO W 10 disk to upgrade the Windows version from 1703 (which worked perfectly, to version 1709) that will not install because it could not configure one or more system components .&nbsp; (version 1703 had no problems why now?).&nbsp; This is
 not a booting issue.&nbsp; It is a Microsoft issue that puts out an error and does not describe it so it can be corrected.&nbsp; In fact it may be a false error also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wasting a lot of time in my lab over this situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, Can we update one at a time instead of dong them all at once??&nbsp; Then if there is an issue we will find it on the specific update.</p>
<p>

<p>I have decided to abort installing the 1709 update and wait for MS to come with a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer has been put back together under the 1703 revision and works perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft need to get their act together and separate updates so you can watch each one so you can see failure points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Identifying failure points so they can be fixed is paramount.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>This is a major pain and there must be a solution to&nbsp;resolve this.</p>

            <p>You normally encounter the warning if you are copying or moving a copy of a file to a new folder that already has a copy of the file in the folder. You would not normally encounter the warning if you open a file and save to the same folder. You will get
 the warning if you open the file and use the save as command to save to the same folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How are you open the file? Is it whilst in Windows Explorer or from a list of recent files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you pin Word to your taskbar you can more easily switch from one Word file to another by uselecting from the jump list. The same tip can be used with Excel and Outlook.</p>

            <p>Please don't post your question multiple times, it just leads to extra work for us.</p>
<p>Download freemake, this will convert your ogv file to a wmv, you can import the wmv to WMM and edit it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure that you can then add it back to your game and stop it being there.</p>

Yes I want to trim the .OGV file down, then put it back into the game. Every video editing program I tried so far has been unsuccessful up to this point. Some will open the .OGV file but save as another file type and this wont work and effects the startup of
 the game.

            <p>Hi Nin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for responding back. I understand that you want to convert your .ogv file. Similar to what my colleague have posted, the file type you are trying to open is not supported in Movie Maker. You can check that on the list of supported file types that
 was indicated on the link given to you by Helene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we can suggest is for you to find another program that can process that kind of file type but&nbsp;I apologize if we cannot give you any suggestion for it. The use of third-party software may cause some issues that we cannot guarantee if fixable. Kindly
 use it at your own risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

<h3> helgatheviking  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding folder to automatic backup causes  0x80070032 error</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to set Automatic File backups via Settings&gt; Backup&gt; Automatically back up my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under "more options" I set the external hard drive and the backup frequency. Then under "Back up these folders" I try to add a new folder. I'm trying to add "C:\Data" which is actually a separate partition mounted to that path.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to add this folder I am met with the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Sorry, but that didn't work. To find out more, look up error code 0x80070032"</p>
<p>
</p><p>From Google research it appears that this error code is related to&nbsp;Windows Update (see:&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-update/error-code-0x80070032-windows-update/aff3d9cd-32ed-4e80-b2de-cbe557040cd4)&nbsp;, so I'm confused as to how
 it relates to the file backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I resolve this error and add my folder to the automatic backups?</p>

            <p>(1) What do you mean by "it is a separate partition mounted to that path"? Isn't the partition available w/o you having to mount it? Are you trying to make it a part of C:? Why not use it with its own letter? I'm thinking File History isn't equipped to do
 what you want.</p>

            In partition manager you can mount a partition as a folder or as a drive letter. I've gone back and recreated the partition as a letter to make life simpler.

            <p>I think&nbsp;you are mounting an image (.iso, .vhdx, etc.) to access it as if it were a partition. OK. That seems more sensible than what I first thought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) Does File History now accept it?</p>
<p>(2) Do you intend to write to it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've mounted a .vhdx (Windows system image) but never tried to write to it.</p>
<p>(3) Do you intend to keep it mounted for extended periods of time &amp; have File History periodically make file backups from it?</p>
<p>

            <p>No, I was not mounting an image as a partition. I was mounting a partition as a folder. This is possible with the built-in partition manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>I don't know enough about any of this to be helpful.&nbsp;But -&nbsp;as I&nbsp;first suspected -&nbsp;you were trying to have File History see the partition (or just some files on it I hope) as an input by including it in a library on C:. File History only takes certain inputs...</p>

</p><p>I think that may be beyond its capability. Maybe wait for someone else to say definitively it can't be done. But I personally wouldn't want to do it. Seems it would be tough to handle &amp; keep track of.</p>

            <p>Good point and thought I'd test this. I mounted partition D:\ to folder - C:\DDD. Then added one of the sub-folders under DDD to the Documents library. Ran file history backup, and found that it silently skipped the sub-folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same happened when I tried to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add a subfolder to a <strong>custom</strong> library</p>
<p>Add the <strong>entire</strong>&nbsp;folder DDD (mounted volume) to a <strong>custom</strong> library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In every occasion, File History skipped the location, but backed up rest of the changes (in desktop, documents etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But no error message what so ever.</p>

</p><p>The section entitled "Modifying default Libraries in Windows 7, 8 and 8.1" gives me access to my external drive, (but I stopped short of actually clicking to add&nbsp;anything from it into my documents library). It says...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) Plug in the external drive whose stuff you want added to a library.</p>
<p>(2) Open File Explorer.</p>
<p>(3) Click "Libraries" in the left pane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your libraries show up in the right pane.</p>
<p>(4) R-Clk a library in the right pane, &amp; select "Properties".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A "Documents Properties" requestor opens.</p>
<p>(5) Click the "Add" button on the requestor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An "Include Folder in Documents" requestor opens.</p>
<p>(6) Scroll to &amp; click a folder of the external drive in the left pane of the requestor.</p>
<p>(7) Click the "Include Folder" button at bottom.</p>

            <p>- With the CD Wizard, I get through the whole process, it asks to restart the computer, and then to plug the device and wait.
</p>
<p>- When I plug the webcam (and I tried all the USB ports), I hear the bip sound from Windows, but nothing else happens, and I stay stuck on the Wizard image below.
</p>
<p>- If I do press next, it terminates the program and the camera remain nonfunctional.</p>

            <p>It might be that your WiFi adapter does not support this feature to share its connection.</p>

<p>If it says&nbsp;<strong>No</strong>&nbsp;then this is at fault, since your WiFi adapter does not support this feature, and there is not much to do about it (except&nbsp;buying another WiFi adapter that does support it.)</p>

    <title>Purple, plaid flashing screen when Windows XP loads in normal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeremyboston  say:</h3>
<h2>            Purple, plaid flashing screen when Windows XP loads in normal resolutions</h2>
                    
<p>GeForce 8600 GT Video card. &nbsp;Windows XP Home edition. &nbsp;Widescreen LCD monitor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boot screens display perfectly. &nbsp;Boot to VGA mode (640 x 480 works perfectly). &nbsp;When windows loads, the screen goes purple and plaid, and starts flashing. &nbsp;Also happens when I up the resolution from 640 x 480.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing I changed recently was upping the resolution used in the computer game Oblivion. &nbsp;But I haven't loaded Oblivion since I've no longer &nbsp;been able to use the computer.</p>
<p>Is this likely a graphics card problem? &nbsp;A Windows XP problem? &nbsp;A computer problem? &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

<p>Please clarify:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Boot screens display perfectly.</em> &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's because the display here isn't controlled by Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Boot to VGA mode (640 x 480 works perfectly).</em> &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, your video adapter works at low res.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>When windows loads, the screen goes purple and plaid, and starts flashing. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I assume that you mean that this happens when Windows loads normally.&nbsp; So your video adapter isn't working properly at whatever resolution you set it to when playing the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Also happens when I up the resolution from 640 x 480.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>This is the part I don't understand.&nbsp; Do you mean that when you boot to the Advanced Boot Options menu (aka F8 menu), select "Enable VGA mode," get to Windows in VGA mode, and then adjust the resolution you get the problem?&nbsp; Does this
 happen with all resolutions greater than 640 x 480? Did you also change the refresh rate? Have you tried downloading the most recent driver from nVidia and installing it?</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"&nbsp;Do you mean that when you boot to the Advanced Boot Options menu (aka F8 menu), select "Enable VGA mode," get to Windows in VGA mode, and then adjust the resolution you get the problem? "</p>
<p>That is exactly correct!</p>
<p>It does happen at all resolutions greater than 640 x 480. &nbsp;Although one time it was okay at 800 x 600 (and then started flashing plaid purple when I upped the resolution from there.)</p>
<p>I did not change the refresh rate.</p>
<p>Yes, I updated to the newest driver yesterday, after this problem occured. &nbsp;The new driver did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>If this is likely to be a broken video adapter card, I'm happy to buy a new one. &nbsp;But I'd just as soon not buy a new one if there is a decent chance the problem lies elsewhere.</p>

<p>I was hoping that you would give a different answer.&nbsp; I find it hard to believe that you suffered a hardware problem (with either your video adapter or your monitor) coincidentally with setting an unsupported resolution ... but I suppose it's possible.</p>
<p>Before you buy another video card (hopefully from a vendor with a good return policy), try asking at nVidia support:</p>

    <title>How to control when indexer runs&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redhonker  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to control when indexer runs&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The problem I have is that it generates a lot of disk activities.&nbsp; If I am doing works that are heavy on disk usage, it becomes nearly impossible to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to control when indexer runs in the background?&nbsp; I can work a couple of ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If a process of a given name is taking up CPU, do not run indexer</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. During certain time window, do not run indexer (or limit indexer only to run in a time window)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p><span><br />
Thank you for your response.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can always revert back to your default configuration by unselecting the additional folder you added at indexed location (Control panel -&gt; indexing option -&gt; modify) and rebuild the index (Control Panel -&gt; indexing option -&gt; Advanced - &gt; Rebuild). Indexing
 the whole system might result in huge search index database that might result in eating up your hard disk space and also slowing down your system.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If still the issue persist I would suggest you refer to the below link:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Refer to Mike Hall replied on March 15, 2012<br />

            <p>A blue screen is sometimes caused by driver issue or program accessing a location in memory it should not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you can try doing is simplify your system configuration by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- disconnect any non-essential hardware you might have attached to the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- A common driver that can cause system hangs on a fresh install is your video card. Try booting into Safe Mode then disable the video, reboot in Normal Mode then then update the video card driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See instructions in the following article how to boot into Safe mode:</p>

<h3> lord himbleton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Bars on screen</h2>
                    
<p>Hi! I have had my xbox 360 for about 2 years and have played it just fine. My tv is an older one, and is a normal box tv, so i have it set on normal. When I play games like Gears of War and GTA it works just fine, however, today when I purchased Call of
 Duty Ghosts, their appears to be black bars on the bottom and top of the screen. I tried adjusting the vertical and horizontal horizons, but they are maxed out and their are still the bars. I tried going to system settings and changed it to widescreen, however,
 the screen was extremely distorted, so I switched it back. Please help, as I am frustrated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there. That should be normal.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>A lot of times, games will have your standard 4:3 ratio and your 16:9 ratio for widescreen and depending on the game, you would get a full screen experience no matter what kind of TV you have.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>It's funny because when I still had my box tv, I remember a lot of FPS games giving me the forced widescreen to...but I remember CoD2 did have the full screen.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>A lot of times while using a standard def / box TV, you will come across other standard def media while watching TV or playing a video game that only supports the 16:9 widescreen ratio as it main viewing mode so you the viewer, even though you aren't on
 a widescreen TV, you would still get the full viewing range... So with a TV show or movie you would see the whole shot instead having a person or item being cut off the screen and with your game, you would have a full field of view without worrying about being
 killed by someone that is right in front of you...but slightly to the right so he was cut off by the 4:3 ratio.</p>
