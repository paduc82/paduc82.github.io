<h2>            XBOX Live Account Cannot Log in &#47; error 0x87c40132 &#47; now all my data online is lost . . .  &#61;&#40; need help</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>Hear my story, last night I was playing witcher 3 like ordinary day, it was fine nothing was wrong and I turn it off the natural way, like quitting the game and removing the disk before turning off the console and unplugging the power supply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then this morning I was planning to enjoy the whole day by finishing the game because im like at the last part already, because I'll have a very busy schedule this coming 2-4 weeks and it means I can't play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now this things happen OMG!!! , alright I got 2 accounts in my xbox one console, 1st account is for my gaming where all my saved data games are stored and i got a password where I always log in before playing, and 2nd account is only to link my alternative
 skype account for my family chat (i have no password for this)</p>
<p>2nd account, can easily log in i have no problem, but since I have no data saved in this account its useless in my gaming</p>
<p>1st account, nothing is happening when a start input my password, it just goes back in the same log in screen like nothing happen, then for the 2nd try this error&nbsp;0x87c40132 is showed.</p>
<p>this are the things i have done to see if it will go back to normal.</p>
<p>1.) hold the power botton of the console for 10 secs. tried to unplug and did different ways how youtube uploaders done their way on their own xbox one.</p>
<p>2.) I checked the xbox live core services (it was normal and nothing was wrong)</p>
<p>3.) I tried to log in my microsoft account here online but it says (there we're no account like that) (is my account got deleted?? I have not done anything like this)</p>
<p>3.) and the last one I did, RESTORE TO FACTORY SETTINGS, (still nothing happen and it got worst,)</p>
<p>please help me anyone, T_T , after I did this restore factory settings, I know that the games data are stored in my Microsoft Account, I was thinking that if I do this I can still log in my Microsoft account and retrieve my saved data from my games. and
 maybe it will log in normally.</p>
<p>but what happen it just got worst, after restore factory settings, I input my gaming account in microsoft, and the xbox one console ask me to input new profiles. new name, birth and everything, so ok I did that (means my xbox live profile got change) I was
 thinking it might be fine, because the saved data are in the microsoft account. so ok, but when I started playing witcher 3, My saved data are not there, and all saved data are not there, it lost. &nbsp;I dont know how to retrieve this. please help me. anyone T____T</p>
<p>my previous xbox live name is Aldrino28 or Aldrino. cant exactly remember now.</p>
<p>I hope that the XBOX ONE Team can retrieve my saved data in my previous xbox live account linked on my microsoft account. (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</p>
<p>please help . . .</p>

<h2>            Dark Souls 3 Server Issues</h2>
                    <p>I realise intermittent server issues are common to the dark souls series. However, currently it is worse than ever. This is server-side as many others report similar issues to other sites. I have a solid 100mbps connection with open NAT and no issues with any other games or live services. Completely unable to join Dark Souls 3 servers, receiving the message "Failed to log in to the DARK&nbsp;SOULS&nbsp;3 game server.". Wouldn't ordinarily complain but the issue has become more rampant than ever and appears to no longer have a workaround.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>edit:&nbsp;server-side*</p>

<br />2. Uninstall and Reinstall Windows Media Player
<br />To Uninstall - Type appwiz.cpl in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) &gt; Click appwiz.cpl &gt; Turn Windows features on or off &gt; Scroll down to Media Features and uncheck Windows Media Player &gt; Reboot the computer
<br />

<br />3. Microsoft has not been investing in WMP. With each new update, WMP getting broken probability has been increasing. It is better to use VLC Media Player which has all the codecs required and will play all the audio and video files.

            <p>Hardly, most laptops come with 4 GBs or more RAM installed. Even those that come with 2 GBs only have 64 bit Windows 8.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest, if you must run 32 bit Windows 8, should purchase a 32 bit System Builder license and install it in a virtual machine utility:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>There are no full retail versions of Windows 8. If you need a full version, you will need to purchase the Windows 8 Pro OEM from New Egg. This requires a custom clean install.</p>

<h2>            Whole Computer Backup&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to back my whole HP desktop computer up to a 128-GB thumb drive (Local Disc C indicates I'm using only 89 GB of 931 GB). &nbsp;I found article that indicated how to get to the backup stage, but cannot find the last step - the "backup" line item (I found
 the sequence of things to click beginning with Start, ending with backup in an article on line, but hit a wall when couldn't find "backup").&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an easy way to copy my whole computer, &nbsp;program files and all, to the thumb drive? &nbsp;Can you provide screen shots to show me locations of "next steps," or advise where I can find this information? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 7.</p>

<p>It sounds like you want to create a "system image."&nbsp; If you use the backup application that is built into Windows 7, you can do this, although Microsoft says that you can't access individual files from the backup, but only use it to restore the complete
 image (this is not completely correct: you can access individual files from a system image, but not by using Windows 7 Backup and Restore).</p>

<p>It's not that I can't follow the steps, it's that I can't find the last one that should say "backup" (using the Start button). &nbsp;I don't know what you mean about "create a system image" (I'm not very tech savvy). &nbsp;What I'm trying to do is save everything
 in case I get one of these "new" viruses (virii?) that can affect all the files, so I could clean off all the bad stuff and replace(?) them with clean files. &nbsp;Maybe this is not something that can be done the way I'm thinking of it working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have Malwarebytes (paid subscription) and MSE (free) on my computer, hoping they will catch anything that tries to get in uninvited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking to be able to copy (reinstall?) everything (programs, files, etc.) on the thumb drive back onto my computer if necessary, not just to backup one or more files/folders. &nbsp;I figured the best way to find out was to go to this community and ask. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll take a look at those links.</p>

</p><p>I have Windows 10 64-bit on an AMD A10-7400P. For the past few weeks, there has been a shadow (as if from a closed window) on my desktop. It changes location every day, but nothing short of restarting the computer gets rid of it for any period of time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attached a screenshot for clarification<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca8cda9f-ddf3-4864-8ff9-b2d8be3be152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca8cda9f-ddf3-4864-8ff9-b2d8be3be152" /></a></p>

            <p>Hi Vahn X,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since issue still persists even after you repaired and reinstall your Windows Live Mail, we would need you to provide us HTTP logs for Windows Live Mail using FiddlerCap for us to investigate the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps on the link below on how to get HTTP logs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail-program/how-to-collect-http-logs-for-windows-live-mail/681dba83-f866-48e7-a8f6-949ca875a847">How to collect HTTP logs for Windows Live Mail using FiddlerCap</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I created a private message area where you could&nbsp;upload the Fiddler Trace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: To view the secure private section, you'll need to be signed in and click on the notification (which can be found at the top of the thread) that states "<i>You have a private reply to this message. Click here to read it on our secure private
 message</i>" section or by clicking the "<b>Private Messages</b>" tab.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks. </span></p>

            Unfortunately I went through tons of my mail manually and transferred what I could, then I just deleted what seemed to be 20 or so corrupt emails, so we won't be able to get to the bottom of this. Thanks anyway!

    <title>Unable to login to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mountain man 08  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to login to Windows 10</h2>
                    Basic problems: &nbsp;away from home, &nbsp;no restore &nbsp;media<br />
(1) Windows 10 installed about 2 weeks ago with no apparent problems. Used an existing MSN account and password to log in. Changed passwords on several accounts about 4-5 days later. No problems logging in or using.<br />
(2) visited friends in PA and used their unsecured WiFi with no apparent problems. Sent last messages Saturday AM before driving to New York City. No apparent problems.<br />
(3) In hotel when I attempted to log on to hotel WiFi - connectivity problems arose, so I thought I would reboot.<br />
(4) When rebooting noticed that there were several large patches being installed (Saturday afternoon?)<br />
(5) Unable to Log into Windows 10 and keep getting message: "Your device is offline. Please sign in with the last password used on this device." Repeatedly got this message with same password used all of last week.<br />
(6) Tried to reset password via smartphone to previous password used after Windows 10 installation. Apparently this is not allowed by Microsoft - this resulted in need to change MSN accounts to third password in one month. Pin option didn't work either.<br />
(7) Unable to get past WiFi "limited" triangle warning.&nbsp;<br />
(8) Confirmed hotel WiFi was operable by logging in with iPad<br />
(9) tried accessing Internet via USB connection to iPhone. Was able to get to stage of inserting password, but this also failed.<br />
(10) error message: "Your device is offline. Please sign in with the last password used on this device" I've tried the one used last week, the one I used previously, and the new one just set up. None of them work, but if I can't access WiFi how could this work?<br />
(11) I Googled the error message and did not find much useful that matched my specific issue.<br />
(12) I attempted "Startup Repair" by repeatedly powering off laptop. Error message: "Startup Repair couldn't repair your PC<br />
Log file: C:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt"<br />
(13) System Restore -- attempted several previous restores. None worked.<br />
"System Restore did not complete successfully. Your computer's system files and settings were not changed. Details: System restore failed while scanning the file system on the drive C:\ &nbsp; &nbsp; The drive may be corrupt. You might want to retry System Restore after
 running chkdsk /R on this desk. &nbsp;An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. (0x81000204)<br />
(14) Suggested Checkdisk /R does not work either. Error message: "This type of file is NTFS. Cannot lock current drive. Windows cannot run disk checking on this volume because it is write protected."<br />
(15) Plain Checkdisk did work and indicated errors in 'uppercase file' It recommended running CHKDSK /F. Error message: "Windows cannot run disk checking on this volume because it is write protected."<br />
(16) Changed directory to C: from X: (whatever that is?) to see if this would do any better. Seems to go into things in greater detail. Got through three stages and found no errors. &nbsp;"Windows has scanned the file system and found no problems." "Failed to transfer
 logged messages to the event log with status 50"<br />
(17) tried Safe start enabling boot logging. Did nothing and did not log anything.<br />
(18) Some of the suggested fixes on Microsoft support site seemed to be related to initial Windows 10 installation which is not my problem. I ignored these.<br />
(19) Some of the suggested fixes on the Microsoft community site suggested Registry Edits, which sound pretty scary to me. I did not try these.<br />
(20) Googled how to bypass Windows 10 login". Unfortunately all solutions (Windows+R, Netplwiz) are based upon already being in Windows 10 already.<br />

<h2>            Map Pass REFUND</h2>
                    
<p>Due to Microsoft's error, many people were able to download the Crimson map pack FOR FREE without having purchased the map pack pass.</p>
<p>The pass is valued at $25. If you DID NOT purchase the pass and downloaded Crimson today for free, you will pay $20 for all three map packs in the end.</p>
<p>I bought the map pass and demand a refund of $5.</p>

<p>If I am unable to be refunded, how about YOU SEND MY SPECIALIZATION CODE that I still have yet to receive!</p>

<p>But its value is hugely diminished and we are now paying over the odds for items. ANYBODY who prepurchased is now paying MORE for the items. When Microsoft shrugged and admitted to dropping the ball they gave free rein for everyone to download the map pack
 free and basically legalized the theft. How is this fair for those who paid hard-earnt money in advance? Unless it's some ridiculous PR scam.</p>

<p>Hey everyone! There were some initial complications with the distribution of the “14 day, Buy and Play” reward tokens, and so we decided to provide the additional reward of complimentary access to the Crimson Map Pack, for a limited time, as a “thank you”
 to our customers that contributed to the success of the Halo 4 launch. Those of you that own the Halo 4 Map Pass via standalone purchase or the Limited Edition will not be impacted and will continue to have access to the content after the complimentary access
 period ends on Tuesday, December 18 at 9am UTC/GMT.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple reasons behind why this issue occurs and to determine what's causing this, we would like to have the exact screenshot of the error message you're getting. Also, have you made any modifications/configurations&nbsp;(aside from Windows Update)
 on your computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can run <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/512a5183-ffab-40c5-8a68-021e32467565/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Troubleshooter
</a></strong>as this usually resolves issues during and after installing Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            As you see from the snapshot you posted, the unallocated disk area is not adjacent to drive C:. Windows 10 has no facilities to join these two partitions. You would need to use a third-party tool such as AOMEI to move the partitions before joining them.
 Remember to back up your data beforehand and to test if the backups are readable!

<p>I downloaded AOMEI and tried to move the unallocated partition right after the C: partition with no success.&nbsp; I got a message that the D: partition is too much fragmented which isn't true since I defragmented the partition before.</p>

<p>I had the same problem that you have and got this message but I guess you've solved this issue, since it's more than a month. but you can make the bootable media from Aomei itself, just like that:</p>

<h2>            Engineering Softwares work on windows RT&#63;</h2>
                    I am in love with Microsoft Surface but the only problem is that I am a Civil Engineering student and my friends keep telling me that windows rt won't run my engineering softwares like autocad, eagle point, etabs, safe etc. Please help me out what should
 i do? Should i buy surface or not? And also is it possible that once i buy surface i change my windows afterwards?

            As missing-link indicated, unless it's in the Windows Store for RT you won't be able to use it.<br />
<br />
Depending on your price point, you can go with an ASUS or Samsung tablet based on ATOM that will run these apps. They are both in the $500-$700 range.<br />
<br />
You can get a Lenovo Yoga 13" that also runs full Windows 8 and will install any app. The Yoga is a convertible (a laptop that folds into a tablet). It runs about $800-$900.
<div><br />
<div>The Surface Pro coming in January will also run your apps however at the price point ($1000-$1100 with keyboard) and the small screen, especially for engineering apps, I think you'll be happier with the Yoga 13.</div>

<h3> zz.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2 - 200&#37; scaling on internal display without &#34;one scaling level for all displays&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want 200% for the Surface Pro 2 (Windows 8.1 Pro) internal display, but I want 100% on my external monitor. I can't find a way to do it. Unchecking the "one scaling" checkbox only allows 150% maximum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I played around with HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\DesktopDPIOverride registry key as documented on Microsoft Technet, but that didn't seem to make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another workaround besides manually changing the scaling factor every time I switch displays?</p>

<p>Yes, and the algorithm seems to be working correctly. The max offering for 1080 px vertical is 150% according to the algorithm. Thus, I am looking for a good workaround (or perhaps a fix from Microsoft).<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to us with your question.</p>
<p>In regards to changing the resolutions of your internal and external monitors, you can only change the resolution of ALL monitors simultaneously with changing the percentage.<br />
If you would like to adjust the resolution of each monitor, unclick the box ("one scaling level for all displays") to get the option to choose from Smaller to Larger.<br />
As you can see, there is no option to change the percentage of each monitor.<br />
If you change the resolution to 200%, ALL monitors will be changed to 200%.</p>

            <p>Thanks for trying, Shiho_P, but I already know all that. What I would like, and I can't believe I'm the only one, is either a clever workaround that someone has already figured out, or a fix from Microsoft that removes what seems like an artificial maximum
 when the "one scaling level" checkbox is not checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a good reason for having 150% maximum on the slider?<br />

            I was so hoping that scaling would have been handled much better in windows 10, alas its equally bad, if not worse.<br />
<br />
So at work I have my Surface Pro 3 attached to a 24" 1080x1920 monitor. When connected the default setting is 150% scaling on my surface (looks fine) and 100% scaling on the external monitor. However, the external monitor settings really don't work. The task
 bar icons are definitely smaller than they should be, and text on apps like chrome are not sharp.<br />
<br />
I've figured out a work around, but man it's a headache, and definitely sketchy at best. I'll post it below, but if Microsoft has a better fix, I'd love to hear it.<br />
<br />
<br />
My settings:<br />
Open up control panel and go to display. Set custom scaling to 115%. Sign out, sign back in. Open up settings from the start bar and go to system. Set Surface Pro screen to 150% scaling and external screen to 100% scaling.<br />
Now you should have sharp text and icons on your external, and things look good on the Surface pro too.<br />
<br />
I'm sure everyone will agree that this is hardly ideal, I'd love to hear what Microsoft suggest.

<p><br />
Hi <span>Ronzie125,</span></p>
<p><span>I may help you on this. Few questions that I need to ask.</span></p>
<p><span>a. When did the problem start?</span></p>
<p><span>b. Did you install/uninstall any program before this problem happened?</span></p>
<p><span>c. When does the error message appear? Is it happening only once when you reboot the system? Or it's appearing once in a while only?</span></p>

            Do you have Malwarebytes premium installed or Malwarebytes free as this is a known bug with that software &amp; BF games as I too have the error with every game.
<br />The solution is to disable ransomware protection before opening/playing the game &amp; it should work - it does for me.
<br />This bug is also affecting programs downloaded from the internet - there’s an error upon running the installer.
<br />MB are aware of the problem.

            Hey Thomas,
<br />
<br />There is no official feature for that, but what you can do instead is to create a symbolic link from your Camera Roll directory in your Pictures folder to your new directory.
<br />
<br />Try this. Go into Command Prompt (elevation not necessary).
<br />
<br />Enter the following: mklink /J "%USERPROFILE%\Pictures\Camera Roll" "%USERPROFILE%\Documents\NewLink"
<br />
<br />The first link here is the old Camera Roll link, you'll need to keep that.
<br />
<br />The second link %USERPROFILE%\Documents\NewLink is where you would like it to be saved in, use whatever directory you want enclosed in quotations.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps, I realize this may not exactly be an intuitive solution, but at least you can do something about this. Let me know how it goes.       
        </p>

            Hi Thomas,
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to System - Storage
<br />
<br />Scroll down and click 'Change where new content is saved'
<br />
<br />On that Settings page you can set where new Photos and video is saved . . .

                    <p>Just purchased these and have paired with my Apple devices no problem. Now trying to pair with my new HP EliteBook/ Windows 7&nbsp;with no success. Windows 7 says it needs peripheral device drivers. I know the Manufacturer is Meelec (<a href="http://www.meelec.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.meelec.com</a>)
 but they or their web-site provides no help. I have also paired this laptop to other Bluetooth devices without any isssues.</p>
<p>Where can I find a free peripheral device driver that should work to connect these headphones?</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This usually means that the Bluetooth device driver is not installed or it’s out of date or even not compatible with Windows 7. You need to install the latest device driver&nbsp;and check with the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform the steps provided in the article. </p>

    <title>COM Surrogate Causing Crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hbur73  say:</h3>
<h2>            COM Surrogate Causing Crash</h2>
                    <p>The night before last I was researching some articles for a paper I was writing&nbsp;when I noticed the mouse started not only moving slower but not in the direction I was moving it in.&nbsp; Long story short, I tried shutting everything down and checking for malware
 but even in task manager, it would not let me shut windows or programs down.&nbsp; I noticed that error messages about COM Surrogate started popping up telling me to close it.&nbsp; I would select 'Close the Program' on each pop up but the processes continued to run
 under task mgr and I could not close them.&nbsp; After a short period of time, the computer would shut down with the blue screen of death.&nbsp; This happened repeatedly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried several things in safe mode like updating dllhost.exe through msconfig as it recommended, shutting down Microsoft programs from start up and a myriad of other things suggested on blogs.&nbsp; Nothing was working.&nbsp; I asked my son to look at it the next
 day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He went under his user name and was experiencing no issues though he went ahead and ran the malware program and cleaned some things up.&nbsp; As soon as he went under my user name, it started up again.&nbsp; He created a new user name for me because he was at his
 limit of knowing how to help and the new user name works (has suggested I try in bits and pieces to remove what I want from old username&nbsp;and then delete the&nbsp;defective username)&nbsp;but I want my old user name to work because of how I had it set up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention,
 not knowing what is causing this, what is to say it won't start up under a new username at some point.&nbsp; There is one other user name on this computer besides my son's and it works fine as well.&nbsp; It is ONLY under my username.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The errors start up as soon as I sign on, before I am even have time to access anything or start any programs up&nbsp;which is contrary to what other people within this community, and other forums&nbsp;have suggested.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to be able to access my username.&nbsp; How do I fix this?</p>

            <p>On your Windows operating system, if you ever receive and error message: Program exe or COM Surrogate has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available, then
 here are a few troubleshooting steps, I’d like to suggest which may help resolve such errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>14 600x302 Fix: Program exe has stopped working </p>
<p>There are few reasons that could causes such errors bad or corrupted program, UAC settings, Malware infection, DEP settings etc. Here are few solutions.</p>
<p>UAC Settings:</p>
<p>On Windows 7, you have User Account Control (UAC) settings that would prevent administration access for programs due to security reasons. Certain programs needs administrator access in order to run properly so to work around this issue you have to Right
 Click on the executable file and Run as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>24 Fix: Program exe has stopped working </p>
<p>If you want always to run that Program as administrator then Right Click on the shortcut and go to Properties and Click on Compatibility Tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>33 Fix: Program exe has stopped working </p>
<p>Then check on “Run this program as administrator” Then click on Apply / OK.</p>
<p>Sometime you also might need to enable the Compatibility Mode as certain programs might not be fully compatible with Windows 7.</p>
<p>Note: If the program is compatible with Windows 7 make sure you don’t enable Compatibility Mode if its enable uncheck it because it can crash the program as well.</p>
<p>Malware Infection: </p>
<p>If you’re getting the error for multiple programs then there are chances your Windows computer might have got infected. In such cases download a good 3rd party freeware like Malwarebytes or Emsisoft and install it.</p>

    <title>What does dxcore.dll do&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What does dxcore.dll do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Recently I've downloaded a game involving xTrap. Whenever I launch it, a window pops out and says the system was modified and the file involved is dxcore.dll in system32. I've asked some of my friends and they all reflect that it is nowhere to be found on
 their PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attempted to delete it in different ways including in safe mode but all are to no avail. I would like to ask if there's any programs related to dxcore.dll and what should I do to delete it once and for all. Thanks.</p>

            Hi Ayaneru
<br />
<br />Where exactly on your PC is this dxcore.dll file located
<br />
<br />If you right click that file and choose properties, on the resulting dialog, choose 'Details' what details are on that Tab, does it mention DevExpress?
