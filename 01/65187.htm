<p><strong><span>Hi Ize of the Owl,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Is Iron Man 2 a DVD or a Blu-ray disc?<br />
2. Are you getting any more details about the security update needed?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I would suggest you to try installing a third party player and check if you can play the movie in that particular
 player.</span></strong></p>

<h2>            How do i clear up my E&#58; Drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I ended up getting a virus on my computer and I wiped everything out. And by everything, I mean all I have now is a low-grade internet explorer and a couple card games, (the most basic of computer settings).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to install an Anti-virus system online. It would let me push "run" and appeared to be downloading, however, as soon as it all appeared downloaded,&nbsp;it still didn't install. I tried this also with an online anti-malware system and on an update to my
 Internet Explorer. Same thing happened. I looked in my "uninstall a program" area, and it said nothing has been downloaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From there, I put in my Microsoft disk for programs like Word and Power Point. That couldn't install either. So I put in my Recovery Disk again and it can't even run because it says my E Drive is pretty much full. Disk Cleanup didn't help at all so I wondering
 how (or if)&nbsp;I can fix my computer.</p>

What virus were you infected with? How did you know?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You said "I wiped everything out," but please clarify exactly how you did that. It sounds like you didn't really do it properly and you are still infected. the proper way to wipe *everything* out is to boot from the installation DVD and do a clean reinstallation
 of Windows.</p>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is the first computer I've built, so I was very pleased when everything worked on the first try. &nbsp;The only BIOS changes I made were to the time and memory profile (the new profile was provided by the manufacturer - no custom&nbsp;modifications&nbsp;were made
 otherwise). &nbsp;I installed windows and then formatted the drive twice because I decided I wanted to do something different. &nbsp;On the third&nbsp;install, I used a NTSF junction to move the Users folder onto the second drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>C:\ (SSD - System)</div>
<div>D:\ (1TB HDD)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It seemed to work pretty well until I got the occasional BSOD. &nbsp;It always said "A process or thread crucial to system operation has unexpectedly exited or been terminated." &nbsp;Error code was 0x000000F4. &nbsp;The first parameter was 0x3, so it's a process. &nbsp;I
 changed the memory profile back to default in the BIOS, but the BSOD kept coming back.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had trouble getting Windows to update after that and, after some failed troubleshooting, decided to just reinstall Windows one more time. &nbsp;Now I'm on my fourth install (Users is back on the SSD for now) and I'm still getting the BSOD with the same errors.
 &nbsp;The BSOD doesn't dump any reports or restart the computer, either, so I have no additional information to work off of. &nbsp;It has happened when updating, downloading, idling, and booting, leading me to believe it is a hardware issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All drivers are up to date (except for maybe the wireless adapter since the TP-LINK site is down).</div>
<div>All Windows updates have been installed.</div>
<div>SFC reported no errors.</div>
<div>MemTest86+ reported no errors (one pass).</div>
<div>ChkDsk (read-only) reported no errors.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, ChkDsk on restart gives me a BSOD before it can finish. &nbsp;This one says "BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO" with error code 0x00000074. &nbsp;This leaves me wondering if it's a problem with the RAM. &nbsp;Is it possible that MemTest86+ not report an error and the memory
 still be malfunctioning?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Some resources have also suggested that the 0xF4 error could be because of a faulty SATA connection between the motherboard and drive (SSD in this case). &nbsp;The SATA cable doesn't hook into the hot-swap ports in my case very firmly, but it seems to stay
 in just fine. &nbsp;Could this also be the problem?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Other resources have also suggested that the 0xF4 error could be caused by a timeout when waking the computer from sleep. &nbsp;I've done this, though, without a BSOD. &nbsp;I think the problem has to be with the SSD, RAM, or Processor. &nbsp;I'm thinking about RMAing
 the memory, but I want to make sure it's the RAM before I head back to college.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for any help!</div>

            I haven't removed IE in any of the install, but I have used Google Chrome when able.
<div><br />
<div>I just installed Windows 7 Ultimate fresh (with an access key this time). &nbsp;I installed the mobo drivers,&nbsp;graphics&nbsp;drivers, and then the wifi driver - all without a network connection. &nbsp;I didn't allow it to connect to any networks after installing the wifi
 driver, but it crashed shortly after anyway.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not sure what to make of that. &nbsp;Regardless, I'm doing a system recovery right now to remove the wifi driver.</div>
<div><br />
<div>EDIT: It already crashed after that. &nbsp;Now I'm recovering to before the graphics drivers.</div>

<h2>            Music stutters when loading webpages</h2>
                    My normal browser is Google Chrome but, I have tried Internet Explorer 8, and Mozilla Firefox and the problem still occurs. I have also tried different places to listen to music from. Normally I use iTunes but, I have also tried Google Play Music and YouTube
 and they all get the same problem. I have also cleared history, cache etc from all the browsers and the problem is STILL&nbsp;occurring. I have looked on many websites and the problem still occurs. I did try changing the priority of iTunes to 'Above normal' and
 that worked but ended up making the windows behave&nbsp;weirdly.&nbsp;
<div><br />

            Thank you Ramesh, but there is a missing feature now in Window 10. On Win 8.1 when the time limit reached, there comes up a window, where one of the administrator on the computer could give more time. When you selected the administrator user you can select
 from a combobox the desired plus time lime like 15,30,45 minutes 1 hour and etc. Now that window doesn't come up and in the website you can change the time limit for example from 1 hour to 2 hour, but the changes don't sync back to the computer. The only thing
 that is work if you change the current day time limit to unlimited.

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t accept my password</h2>
                    I upgraded last night to the public version of Windows 10. On the initial boot it asks for my password (which I know!) but won't accept it. In addition to the numerical password I use everyday, I also tried my Microsoft password for good measure. I also
 verified that numlock, etc. Not an issue. I have no CD drive, so inserting some start up disk not a option.

            Have you checked that you are set to the right keyboard? Try typing the password in then press the button to the right that shows your password and ensure it is coming out the same as the special characters differ with the american keyboards.

            <p>I have tried to use every password I have ever used and it's still not letting me in. So I have a Windows 10 install that isn't working and the screen is flashing at me. I can't fix this issue because it won't recognize the password. My business is tied
 to my computer and I'm sure that no one at Microsoft is going to replace my lost wages. I was supposed to get a call from support on this issue in 55 mins over 2 hours ago. What is going on with all of this? Why release something with so many issues? Can someone
 please help me with this serious issue? </p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I'm so angry I'm in tears!!! Why would you have support people that don't offer any support!!! I waited over 2 hours for a call, finally get it and this person speaks to me for 20 minutes and asked if he can put me on a brief hold. This jerk throws
 me back into the que which is a 45 minute wait. I currently have a $2000 paperweight thanks to Windows 10!!!</p>

            I'm having the EXACT same problem. I attempted to load the Windows 10 upgrade to my Lenovo laptop on Saturday, August 8, 2015, around 3:30 p.m. EDT. The update appeared to work fine at first, but I put my laptop to sleep and returned to it about an hour
 later and found I could not get it to accept the Microsoft Outlook password need to log in. After getting into a hold loop, I managed to request a callback, which happened about 9:00 p.m. EDT. The first rep tried to tell me it was just a system error, and
 my password would "catch up" in 48 hours. I knew this was wrong because I could use the password to log into Outlook on another device. I asked to speak to another rep who was no help, and transferred me to another person in "troubleshooting" who was equally
 unhelpful. I'm not supposed to get a call from someone on Tuesday, August 11, 2015, at 10:00 a.m. EDT, and I have no confidence this person will be able to do anything, either. This may have been the final straw for me, because if I cannot

            <p>After numerous attempts I finally got in, my upgrade was from Win 7 on which I had never used a password. I tried to use my two microsoft account sign ins and passwords, but neither would work. Then I finally hit upon the idea of using the PC name and leaving
 the password field blank and hit enter. This took me straight in.</p>
<p>Needless to say I have now configured Win 10 to accept my microsoft account login details</p>

            No @ sign and it was the same password I have used for &nbsp;years. It works outside of this install so it is a valid password. I just can't use it here.

<h2>            Controller not recognized by my computer.</h2>
                    Hi. I used to be able to use my PS3 Controller to play games on my PC. But now, my controller is not recognized at all! Its plugged in but it will not charge or anything. Before I used to get a pop-up that says "Windows is installing drivers" etc but now
 nothing. Is there a way to uninstall whatever is there, so its like I never plugged it in to begin with?<br />
<br />
Just to clarify the problem is not me getting the controller to work. I know how to do that, and install the PS3 controller drivers, etc. The problem is that my computer doesnt see the controller AT ALL. Any ideas? The controller still works on PS3, works on
 other computers, its not the USB port because I tried a different one, and all other USB devices work. Thank you<br />

<h2>            Why dont my contacts in People show up in Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    I have looked over responses to similar questions but have found no definitive answer. Its a new computer and I have imported my email addresses from my old computer via .psv file. They show up in People but not in Outlook. Why is this a mystery?

 last answer that is under the screen shot showing what I am to add. I can't read that or don't know how to make the image overlaying it go away. Did you type some more pertinent information under the "Add an account"&nbsp;box?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should be able to get it to work by setting the Compatibility Mode of "SETUP" on the Lexmark installation CD to Win 7 or possibly XP SP2 or 3 depending on how new the model is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It probably has more features than anything you will download...mine turned out that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>To find setup on the CD, select Open or Explore instead of just running it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Then right click on SETUP and select Properties...Compatibility Tab is at the top.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Part way down is a Compatibility Mode check box and a drop down option list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>I used XP SP3 with a X5340 and it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>IMPORTANT...</p>
<p>If you have previously tried to install the printer, REMOVE it from your system in Devices and Printers before uninstalling and reinstalling the software.</p>

            <p>I&nbsp;blocked the user but the messages continue to flood my inbox. &nbsp;I&nbsp;don't think it's the same person sending the message anymore although it could be. It appears to be sending me a message every time a person leaves the conversation. &nbsp;Since the SPAM was sent to unknown mass amounts of people, every time someone leaves the "conversation" we are all receiving a new message stating that so-and-so has left the conversation. &nbsp;I'm given the option to either delete the message or leave the conversation. Either way it seems to only delete the message and continues to send me notifications every few seconds.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>For the sake of spear-heading this, I've tried blocking all communications in the Setting menu for anything related to messages or communication. &nbsp;It hasn't worked. PLEASE&nbsp;HELP!!! I've been a loyal&nbsp;Xbox user since the very first Xbox and I've never had this problem. &nbsp;I'd hate to have to kill my account because of this. Surely there

<p>for the XBOX 360, try this</p>
<p>Restore Xbox 360 network settings to factory defaults</p>
<p>Note Before you reset the Xbox 360 console's network settings, make sure that you write down the current settings in case you have to restore them later. If you are using a secured wireless network, you will also need your wireless network password.

<p>4.Select Configure Network.</p>
<p>5.On the Additional Settings tab, select Restore to Factory Defaults. When prompted, select Yes, Restore to Factory Defaults.</p>
<p>Note This resets the console's network settings only, and not other settings.</p>
<p>6.Turn off your console. </p>
<p>7.Turn on your console. </p>
<p>Wireless only: You will receive a message to configure wireless settings. Follow the on-screen instructions to connect to your wireless network.</p>

<p>I'm not tech but I had the problem getting in the Tower and one mission on the moon. &nbsp;Kept disconnecting me after 5min in mission. &nbsp; My system is through a D-Link router and the simple fix was to add the Xbox IP in the MDZ setting of the router. &nbsp; &nbsp;Haven't
 had any problems since. &nbsp; Not sure why other posts out there seems to make it extra complicated. &nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe I'm just lucky on this simple fix.</p>

                    With a Lenovo computer and Windows 10, after I properly shut down my computer, at some point later on it will start up on its own.&nbsp; After some time with no attention paid to it the computer goes to sleep and periodically wakes up and goes to sleep again,

<br />Until it is fixed you can roll back Fall Creators Version 1709 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Sometime HID devices will wake the computer when needed for certain tasks. This can be the network adapter or maybe a peripheral device. Here is an article that explains this and how to search and disable such devices. I personally would use this article to open the device manager right click on your network adapter and go to properties, click on the power management tab and make sure to check "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" and uncheck "Allow this device to wake the computer"

<br />Press Windows key + X

<br />Uncheck 'Turn on fast startup (recommended)

<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters.

    <title>Can not check for windows update, but do not get a reason for failure - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can not check for windows update, but do not get a reason for failure</h2>
                    My computer seems to be unable to check for windows updates. I don't get any error messages, it simply does not tell me if there are or are not updates available. When I open update section of the control panel, it shows the following window:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92aabe7e-f408-415a-aaa1-a2d4bcf386e7" />I
 am unsure why it states that I have never checked for or installed updates, as I know I have done so before. The red x shield also confuses me, as from my limited experience it generally means something is turned off or running with a setting opposite of what
 is recommended, but I currently have it set for the recommended automatic updating. When I click on the check for updates button, the Screen briefly (for less than a second, in fact it was difficult to take this screenshot) changes to the following:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2f162a61-2c35-4605-8268-8235a8481aac" />The
 bar does not fill and it goes back to how it was before, displaying no indication that anything has happened. No error message, no new window,no change in text or images, nothing. This happens no matter what settings I have for Windows update. Does anyone
 have a clue what is happening?

<h2>            Black Screen after downloading Windows 10</h2>
                    So after having windows 7 for several years I decided to download windows 10. So i downloaded it and everything was great, It downloaded quickly and I was able to use for several hours before I had to close the laptop for a minute to get some food. When
 I returned like 4 minutes later and opened it, it was in a black screen. I tried everything to get it off the black screen, pressed every key and nothing! after several minutes i decided to turn it off using the power button, i held it for several seconds
 till it turned off. Then afterwards turned it back on and everything was fine, I was on the desktop, using the internet, word, etc. Then i tried to close the laptop for a minute and then re-open it and the same thing happened! I tried this multiple times with
 the same result! please help, i use this laptop for my school work! its a hp pavilion m6. serial number CND222SKY4 AND PRODUCT NUMBER IS B5S08UA#ABA.

<p>Try to get to Recovery-Advanced Options and start up in safe mode. In safe mode you will want to install "Microsoft HD video adapter driver" to replace your current driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HD driver:</p>
<p>In safe mode type "device manager" in search or use run "devmgmt"</p>
<p>In device mgr. go display adapter folder and right click on current video adapter.</p>

<p>It seems your Windows 10 install has many issues beside video. I would use the same above process that got you&nbsp;<br />
Recovery &amp; Advanced Options but click on "go back to previous build" this time.</p>

<p>Just in case, you should back up files &amp; folders to external drive usb or in cloud before you go to recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should not try to download Windows 7 again for awhile. </p>

</p><p>I would check your pc's support site and see it has any updates for windows 10 for your model. If it does that means that they may be supporting upgrades to Windows 10. If no updates for windows 10 upgrade are in support then I would wait until after October
 2015 to give Windows 10 upgrade another chance. By say Nov. Microsoft may have improved Windows 10 upgrade process for Windows 7 users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of Windows 7 users are getting this black screen problem, constant reboots and various errors in windows update when trying to upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly, Microsoft should have really put in big letter "Have <strong>external</strong> recovery available for current Windows OS before upgrading to Windows 10" like a DVD or USB recovery. A mfg install DVD would be even better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, the free offer period is good from July 29, 2015 to July 28, 2016. No matter how many attempts to upgrade, it is free during that period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have feeling that Microsoft will probably be creating some updates to Windows 7 between now and Nov. to get the upgrade process working smoother. They're committed to getting as many as possible users on this new OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 Home now. It runs very smooth and I like it a lot. My pc had W8 installed when I purchased it. W10 is so much better than W8.1.</p>
