<h2>            Error 8015D002 Starting Session on XBOX Live</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying for days to start session on Xbox Live from my XBOX 360, but it keeps appearing the error 8015D002. I've done all the steps that support service recommends but still cannot iniciate the session. I've reset my password, I've erased the profile from my XBOX360, but now i cannot download it because this error keeps appearing. I´ve contacted Microsoft Support Service and by mail, they recommended me to ask here what to do , because they do not find anything wrong with my account.&nbsp;</p><p>Please help me, I can't buy or do&nbsp; anything else until i can use again my account.</p><p><br /></p>

 </blockquote> <p>Hello, Miss Bijoux, and thank you so much for your response.&nbsp;</p><p>In my sign in preferences there's just the main email address&nbsp;marked.&nbsp;</p><p>I've tried to start session on xbox live on my xbox360 using another email address ( i mean that i've tried to&nbsp;download a friends's profile on xboxlive) but it doesn't connect either. Still gives me the same error. I rechecked the connection to xboxlive and wifi and that works fine. Even more, i can still watch Netflix from my xbox 360, but i cannot download my profile, and i cannot either update the xbox360 and the apps or games. Another thing: when i look on My account, "My devices", the Xbox360 doesn't appear anymore. I can see my windows mobile and my Pc but no longer see the xbox360.</p><p>Thanks so much in advance!</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Hello again,&nbsp;Miss Bijoux!</p>
<p>In response of your later question, i bought my xbox360 less than a year ago, it has a 500gb internal hard drive; i don´t have much more&nbsp;information to give to you about this because when i go to the information menu on&nbsp;my xbox, it doesn't tell me more. I do have a pendrive , but &nbsp;i don´t have any other friend who uses Xbox consoles (they use the other one on the market).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think i can guess that you want me to transfer the &nbsp;profile to the usb (which &nbsp;i 've formatted on my xbox to use it as storage device), but i remind you that the profile from my xbox was deleted when i was tryind to resolved this problem with the connection. Is there a way to download my profile from my PC to the usb, to later transfer it to the Xbox????</p>
<p>Thanks again for your patience!!!</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
You can use the registry to change this back to the default.<br />
<br />
1. Go to Start and type regedit in the Seacrh box and press Enter to open the registry editor.<br />
<br />
2. Navigate to the following Key.<br />
<br />
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CompressedFolder<br />
<br />
3. With the CompressedFolder key selected, go to File/Export. Name the file Zip backup and save it to the Desktop. This will be the back up file that you can use to revert any changes in case of problems.<br />
<br />
4. Expand the CompressedFolder key and select the DefaultIcon key.<br />
<br />
5. In the right side window, double click the&nbsp; (Default) value.<br />
<br />
6. In the Value Data: box, copy/paste the following path.<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\system32\zipfldr.dll<br />
<br />
Press OK.<br />
<br />
Exit the registry editor and reboot the computer.<br />
<br />
After you confirm that the change worked, you can delete the registry back up file on the Desktop.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<div>!!! The same thing is happening to me!!!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>But what I think happened to me is:</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have the registry cleaner, ccleaner. I don't use it often, but i just did. (i always leave backups) Right before I hane the registry cleaner, I changed the settings in 7-zip to associate all file extension with 7-zip. I didn't notice it, but it might
 have changed the icon of .zip files, and then when I ran the registry cleaner, it noticed that the icons were changed, and so it decided to delete the registry for that icon. I try what Ronnie says, but just like you what I should paste in the value box was
 already there.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Any suggestions???</div>
<div><br />
<div>P.S-- The picture of the wierd icon for .zip folders isn't on the web site anymore...could you put it up again?</div>

<p>I have a very <strong>strong</strong> suggestion. CCleaner is a good program to use,<br />
as long as you do <strong>not</strong> use its registry cleaning functionality.</p>
<p>If you got away without its causing you a serious problem, consider<br />
yourself lucky!</p>
<p>Registry cleaning programs are <strong>all</strong> snake oil. Cleaning of the<br />
registry isn't needed and is dangerous. Leave the registry alone and<br />
don't use any registry cleaner. Despite what many people think, and<br />
what vendors of registry cleaning software try to convince you of,<br />
having unused registry entries doesn't really hurt you. <br />
The risk of a serious problem caused by a registry cleaner erroneously<br />
removing an entry you need is far greater than any potential benefit<br />
it may have. <br />

<p>Let me point out that neither I nor anyone else who warns against the<br />
use of registry cleaners has ever said that they always cause<br />
problems. If they always caused problems, they would disappear from<br />
the market almost immediately. Many people have used a registry<br />
cleaner and never had a problem with it.</p>
<p>Rather, the problem with a registry cleaner is that it carries with it<br />
the substantial <strong>risk</strong> of having a problem. And since there is no<br />
benefit to using a registry cleaner, running that risk is a very bad<br />
bargain.</p>

    <title>Fullscreen bug on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markokralj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fullscreen bug on Windows 10</h2>
                    I can't play fullscreen games on windows 10. When I run the game icon appears in taskbar, but when I click on the icon it goes crazy. I can hear background music but I don't see the game. Screen just show black for a&nbsp;second then it show desktop for a second&nbsp;a
 it goes like that&nbsp;until&nbsp;it stops by itself. When I click on the icon in taskbar again I starts to do the same thing.

            <p>Hi Marko,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you referring to a particular game or even while not playing game?</li></ul>
<p>I would suggest you to visit the computer manufacturer's support website and install the latest display driver available. It may be for Windows 8.1. Install the driver in compatibility mode and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to: <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</a></strong> (information holds good for
 Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists and if the issue is confined to a particular game, I would recommend contacting the game developer for further support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            Only when I play games&nbsp;(every games)&nbsp;in full screen. It's normal when I don't play games in full screen. For example, in Minecraft when I press F11 it goes to full screen. But&nbsp;then begins&nbsp;the same thing. But when&nbsp;I&nbsp;play games from store and&nbsp;I press button
 for full screen in upper right corner, the full screen works.

            <p>I also has the same problem, which was not on Windows 8.</p>
<p>I'm sure it's connected to scaling.</p>
<p>I use 4K display and if i run an app in any resolution lower than that i cannot go fullscreen. Sometimes it helps to launch an app from clean desktop.</p>
<p>But it helps everytime, if i set my display scaling to 100%. I use 200% by default.</p>
<p>So, scaling related.</p>
<p>Fix it, please, it's really irritating.</p>

            I fixed the problem. Go to desktop, then right click and select display settings. Once you get there click identify. A number should show on your screen. If on your screen showed up number one and on your display settings is set that screen 2 is your main
 screen then set that screen 1 is your main screen. On my computer when I install windows it's automatically set that you have 2 monitors and that second one is main screen.

<p>My screen is 2nd, yes, it's connected through HDMI2.0, and it's always set as main display. First one is DVI.</p>
<p>(I do not see BIOS or loading on second, only on first).</p>
<p>Tried to completely remove DVI cable from videocard - does not help.</p>
<p>Tried different scaling percents - does not hep, only 100% works.</p>

            <p>I had this problem, my setup includes integrated Intel graphics and a nVidia discrete graphics card. My problem was solved by going into the nVidia control panel applet, going to Manage 3D settings, Global Settings, and changing the Preferred graphics processor

    <title>Windows 10 User Account Settings Stopped Syncing Across Devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silversee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 User Account Settings Stopped Syncing Across Devices</h2>
                    <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Seems fixed for me at least provisionally&nbsp;as of this writing (Jan. 25, 2017).&nbsp; Microsoft Support contacted me yesterday and informed me that a recent Windows update may have fixed the issue, but at the time I had&nbsp;not noticed any
 changes. However, this morning wallpapers and other settings seem to be syncing again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Original post: </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>In recent days, Windows 10 settings, along with Edge browser favorites and reading list content, have stopped syncing across my Windows 10 devices.&nbsp; I have been experiencing this both with my own Microsoft account and my son's.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit</strong>: I've ascertained that this issue is very likely with our Microsoft accounts, and not with our local Windows 10 configurations. Please see my latest reply below.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Helpful note: my family was among the very last set of users to have been migrated to the new Outlook.com email infrastructure, and we've seen multiple issues with contacts (either going missing or becoming duplicated) since then (occurred a month or two
 ago). I don't think this is related--but I could be wrong** <strong>(**I now think this could be relevant--see latest reply below)</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background: I first noticed this after installing a new SSD into my son's desktop computer, and setting up Windows 10 from scratch. None of his settings and preferences would sync.&nbsp; Since it was a new build, it was easy enough to perform a PC Reset, which
 did not help. I also dropped and recreated his local user profile at least twice to no avail. I later discovered that this was happening on my machines and user account as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you suggest general troubleshooting, please know that I have checked and performed all of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Note that Microsoft <strong>accounts are verified.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>ALL sync options are enabled in <strong>Settings-&gt;Accounts-&gt;Sync your settings</strong>.&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Toggling these settings did not help, even after a reboot</em></span>.</li><li>Edge browser settings option <strong>'Sync your favorites and reading list'</strong> is enabled.&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Toggling this setting did not help, even after a reboot</em></span>.</li><li>All machines are running <strong>production (not Insider) Windows 10 build 14393.576</strong></li><li>OneDrive, Outlook Mail and all other Microsoft services <strong>are syncing properly</strong></li><li>Windows Update <strong>is working fine.</strong></li><li>The Windows Store and other Microsoft apps such as Groove, Xbox, etc. <strong>
all connect to our Microsoft accounts just fine</strong></li><li>I have rebooted my router at least twice; no change</li><li>I have cleared the Edge browser cache; no change</li><li>Running the <strong>Microsoft Accounts troubleshooter </strong>(which seems to date from Windows 8), reports the following issue: '<strong>Can't connect to the sync service</strong>'</li></ol>
<p>In case it helps: on a newly installed user profile the picture associated with the Microsoft Account does not sync to the PC. On an existing user profile where settings have synced successfully in the past, the photo remains intact.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll reiterate: I&nbsp;have no problem with Windows Updates syncing, or OneDrive files syncing, or email syncing, or anything
<strong>other than what is covered in points 1, and 2 above</strong>.&nbsp; My Bing and Google searches have revealed no online help, official or otherwise, about how to correct this issue, so if you send me to an online resource, please be sure that it is pertinent
 to what I have described. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for listening.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With regard to your query, the reason why you're getting the error "<strong>Can't connect to the sync service</strong>" it's because the Microsoft account troubleshooter is for Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try the following steps if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Accounts </strong>&gt;<strong> Your info</strong>. Make sure you've verified your account (you'll see&nbsp;"verify" if you haven't).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know the result.</p>

</p><p>Prior to posting here, I had already tried the troubleshooting steps of dropping and recreating our user accounts, including the trick of creating a local account, then adding our Microsoft account to it. In fact,&nbsp;beyond this I have performed a complete
 PC reset, twice. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I will go through the motions one more time and report back here, but to date this is not resolving the issue for us.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Rafael, I hope you had a good holiday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have performed the steps you suggested (again), and there is no change: user account and Windows 10 settings are not syncing, even after 12 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I now <strong>have some new information</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to determine whether this issue was Windows-related or related to our Microsoft accounts, I performed the following test on several machines:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I added user profiles on affected computers tied to <strong>a different Microsoft account</strong>, one not associated with my main Microsoft account or part of my Microsoft Family Safety group.<br />
</li><li>On all of these devices, this account <strong>synced settings correctly</strong>, and right away (little delay).
<br />
</li><li>However, on these same devices, my own account (and other accounts tied to my family),
<strong>continued not to sync</strong>, as previously reported.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, I now believe that this issue is not Windows-related, but <strong>specific to our Microsoft accounts</strong>. My son is tied to my Family Safety group, so I suspect this issue is affecting all of us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that you can connect me with an escalation agent in Microsoft Account support to look into this further?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm in the same boat.<br />

I did some investigation on this issue but with no success.<br />

            <p>I am currently working the problem with a Level 3 tech support engineer with Microsoft. It's been about a week and a half, and no sign of a fix yet. However, based on my conversations with him, this issue is affecting other users too (as we know), and so
 they appear to be taking it seriously. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am convinced it has something to do with the provisioning or configuration of certain Microsoft accounts on Microsoft's servers, and that it is not a problem with Windows per se.&nbsp; For example, I can add a different Microsoft account to my machines, and
 that account syncs fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll update this thread if I learn more.</p>

<p>Good catch on the Event Viewer logs. Mine show similar errors. I'll bring this to the attention of the Microsoft Support rep who is working on this case with me.

            <p>Thank you, </p>
<p>hopefully there will be a fix. I even got to reset EDGE and still no favorites sync. This is weird as a few months ago it was working perfectly. I don't know if being in the insider builds and then going back to the production makes a difference but I noticed
 sync stopped.<br />
keep us posted, hopefully that engineer will help us.</p>

    <title>BSOD MEMORY MANAGEMENT possible fix. Windows update fix. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanmccafferty  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD MEMORY MANAGEMENT possible fix. Windows update fix.</h2>
                    <p>Basically guys I have had this Error very frequently recently. Just bought new RAM so can rule that out as a possibility for the error (Ran Windows Memory diagnostic tool and MemTest86 with no errors). Also Clean installed windows 3 times but problem persisted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seen that drivers or updates could be the problem. So uninstalled the latest 1903 cumulative windows update and also uninstalled my most recent graphics card update (Nvidia Game Ready driver 430.86 I think). And haven't had the Error for quite some time
 now. Would recommend try the fix and see if it helps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How long will it take for WINDOWS 8 to REFRESH&#63;</h2>
                    I've had my Toshiba Satellite laptop for several months and yesterday it crashed. Luckily I had made a Boot Recover Disk and my husband is doing the Refresh on it so I don't lose my information. I just want to know how long it will take for the Refreshing
 to end? It seems it's been on 31% for the past three hours.&nbsp;

            It can stay stuck on one percentage for a while and then zoom past it to the end. It could take hours more depending on size of drive. However if it never moves, you should contact Toshiba and get help with checking the hardware. Hardware failures the
 are still warrantied could be causing your problem. Find out from support how to run the hardware diagnostics. If the hardware checks out including the hard drive, you might try a Remove and reinstall win 8. Or follow Toshiba's instructions for returning to
 factory settings.
<div>
<div><br />
<div>BTW--you will lose some or all of your information with either method. The only thing a refresh saves is your personal files and apps from the Store. No added programs will be there after the refresh. All those will have to be reinstalled.&nbsp;</div>

            In Windows 8.0/8.1 the product Key is embedded in the Bios and should Automatic Activate. Install a copy of Belarc Advisor

            <p>The only key you have is the one integrated by the manufacturer, it is only valid for Windows 8 and only for the version preinstalled on the computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Even if you use Belarc as suggested the key will be of no use as it cannot be used for any Windows version installed from disk.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you have to recover your system you have to reinstate it to Windows 8 as supplied by the manufacturer and re-upgrade via the Store. The alternative is to create a system image of your working computer as it is now and the restore disk to recover the computer
 to that point you did the image.</p>

            Windows 8 did not come "pre-installed" by a manufacturer, but was purchased by me through the Microsoft store.  So I have my Windows 8 product ID key.  The problem occurred when I "upgraded" (for lack of a better word) to 8.1 for free, meaning that I have no product ID key to use if for some reason I need to "refresh" my pc.  What a total waste of my time.  I lost an entire day to this and am SO not happy.  Furthermore, Microsoft Support kept me on chat for 30 minutes longer than necessary simply because they did not want to admit that refresh is now useless.    If I pay for a product, I expect that product to be mine.  This  "upgrade" **** is utter nonsense.  I thank you for your responses.

            Exactly what happened to me too. My&nbsp; laptop does not have an imbedded&nbsp;bios key, a new one was sent to me in an email after yet another Microsoft store purchase&nbsp;for Windows &nbsp;8.0 &nbsp;which now is being rejected after working for more than&nbsp;two years?&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;
 windows 8.0 beta tester and was eventual&nbsp;forced (a popup message)&nbsp;to buy a new 8.0 key after&nbsp;its final release was made public. &nbsp;The 8.0/8.1 key failure began after I had to do a refresh because of an installation error with a (FREE?) Windows 10 upgrade.&nbsp;
 I just can't win.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems like all versions of MS Windows are habitually beta versions!&nbsp;&nbsp; My frustration has turned to laughter when I finally figured that out. LOL

<p>Most versions of Windows XP will not come with an MPEG2 decoder. &nbsp;What brand is your video card? &nbsp;Here is a list of DVD Decoders for XP:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-media-player/plug-ins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-media-player/plug-ins</a></p>
<p>My favorite is the Nvidia one. &nbsp;I believe it still has a trial version that you can examine risk free, but you will have to have a video card with an Nvida chipset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you might consider getting a Windows 7 Upgrade from XP. &nbsp;Windows 7 runs quite well and has standard MPEG-2 DVD playback build in. [1]</p>
<p>[1] - While Windows 7 will play standard definition MPEG-2 DVDs by default, it does not come with a Blu-Ray decoder. &nbsp;If/when you move on to Blu-Ray, you will still have have to purchase a decoder for that.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            External Hard Drive Problems</h2>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have recently purchased an external Seagate Backup Plus Slim Portable Hard drive, and it is not working correctly with my laptop. It shows in the file explorer, but it has no storage space listed, and in the properties it says 0GB free, 0GB used.
 I try to open it and it says "F:\ is not accessible. The parameter is incorrect". However, when i use it on another laptop, everything works completely fine. My laptop is running Windows 10, while the other one it works on is running Windows 7.

    <title>Skype on Samsung s8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sekiryuu34  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype on Samsung s8</h2>
                    So, I have a Samsung Galaxy S8 and I have a built-in Skype app, However. My issue is the updating of my Skype app. But, I can only update it through the Play Store or the "Galaxy Apps". My version of the app is 7.46.0.596 which is an old version of Skype.
 I have a friend who has an S8 and has the built in app but has the latest version, Version 8. Now, I also have a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge which was my previous phone as I have upgraded about 3 days ago, The Version on that phone is 8 and is the latest. My android
 version of my phone (The S8, same with my S7) is 7.0, My Samsung Experience Version is 8.1. I don't know if that matters. Another issue is that. I cannot message on the version of Skype I currently have on my S8 and just says "sending"&nbsp; but can call with people
 just fine. Another thing is that the version on "Galaxy Apps" for Skype is the same which is 7.46.0.596, I want to know how I can UPDATE my Skype because I cannot and do not have an option to, I can't delete the app

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br /> Often time if it's not interfering you can just wait and it will catch up.  If not I'd also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  These steps are the same for WIndows 8.1 as for WIndows 10.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then I'd do the Refresh which is easy in Windows 8.1:  <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2293-refresh-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2293-refre...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            This is ridiculous. An umovable blue&#47;white screen with NO HELP.</h2>
                    This is ridiculous. <br />
I'm using Skype now for more than 10 years. I have a subscription. <br />
Suddenly a few weeks back after signing in I get for a few moments a white screen, a blue screen, and then white again. Nothing to click on.
<br />
I've tried each and every "solution" I could find including re-installing. Nothing. And I'm not exactly the only one with this problem.
<br />
I don't understand that Microsoft/Skype is hanging its customers out to dry and forcing them to go all over the internet for weeks on end to find a solution instead of living up to their responsibility and providing one.
<br />
So, I now have uninstalled Skype and apparently lost all the money in my account.<br />
Skype/Microsoft, he ball is in your court.

                    <p>My Windows Warning Sound (Exclamation) is not getting to the appropriate event popups...ie, the popup that says "are you sure you want to permanently delete these messages" and "restore desktop icon layout". &nbsp;There may be others. &nbsp;This is a recent problem,
 perhaps a month old. &nbsp;All other sounds are perfect. &nbsp;Many possible solutions have been tried with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told today that there may be a problem with my Microsoft Framework Net 4.5, since Windows sound associations apparently reside there. &nbsp;However, I don't what to do at this point, how to test it, and how to fix it. &nbsp;Does anyone have any suggestions.
 &nbsp;By the way, I'm running Windows Vista. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

I have not installed any updates to Microsoft Framework Net 4.5. Someone just told me the problem may be there. &nbsp;With my limited knowledge, I'm more inclined to think it is a missing or corrupted registry file, but who knows. &nbsp;</div>

            Yes. &nbsp;I hear your wav file and I hear every sound in the sound section of the control panel. &nbsp;All sounds are heard loud and clear. &nbsp;What I am
 the exclamation sound with those two events (perhaps more). &nbsp;I always had that sound with those events until about a month ago. &nbsp;Thank you for trying to help me.&nbsp;

            <p>[I've gotta hunch your problem has nothing to do Windows Updates.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em> diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without </em>quoting my post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Is it a Vista 32-bit or a 64-bit computer?&nbsp; See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827218</a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<br />
</span>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">when</span> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5a. Is KB2964358&nbsp;<em>and KB2936068</em>, KB2922229; KB2929961, KB2930275; and/or KB2916036 listed in
<strong>Installed Updates</strong> (<em>not </em><strong><em>Update History</em></strong>)? [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>5b. How about KB2893294, KB2892075, KB2901674, KB2887069 and/or KB971029?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. <em>Assuming Java is installed</em>, is <strong>Java Version 7 Update 55</strong> (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://java.com/en/download/uninstallapplet.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://java.com/en/download/uninstallapplet.jsp</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Is <strong>Adobe Flash Player v13.0.0.206</strong> (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>8a. Is IE7, IE8 or IE9 installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8b. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic;<em>System Mechanic</em>; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; Glary Utilities; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser;
 SpeedUpMyPC; PC Doctor; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer; CCleaner

            I'll answer your questions as best I can. &nbsp;It will take awhile, in particular, locating all of the installed updates you listed. &nbsp;I'm sure you must think this could lead to a solution to the problem. &nbsp;It is an uncommon problem and may not get solved unless
 I do an HP System Recovery, and I'm not there yet. &nbsp;Do you think all of the answers to your questions could lead to a solution. &nbsp;If so, I'm right with you and will do my best.

                    <p>I accidentally deletec DISK C , with the entire windows on it . I was trying to upgrade to a 64 bit version of windows 10 from an usb with the windows 10 64 bit thingy.. I was getting the error that I coudn't install windows in disk C or D cause it had a
 MBR partition &nbsp;, I googled a fix and found something , I did what the video said and after that I restarted windows and this message apeard : Recovery Your PC/Device needs to be repaired.</p>
<p>The application or operating system couldn't be loaded because a required file is missing or contains errors.</p>
<p>File: Windows sytem32 winload.exe</p>
<p>Error code: 0xc000000f</p>
<p>You'll need to use recovery tools . If you don't have any installation media (like a disc or USB devide),contact your PC administrator or PC/Device manufacturer.</p>

<p>If u have any other&nbsp;PC or LAPTOP connect your pendrive in which u have windows 10 iso. Transfer the iso file to the desktop and format the pendrive download iso burner (link https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool) flash the
 iso file in the pendrive. </p>
<p><strong>switch on the repaired pc and keep pressing f12 key repeatedly so u boot into the bios setup</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>(note your mouse wont work in this setup you must use your keyboard only.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Go to the section that contains your boot devices.</strong></p>
<p><strong>With your USB drive plugged in, the USB drive should be listed. If it isn’t, your system might not support booting from USB. Assuming that it is supported (as is the case with virtually all modern hardware), promote your USB drive to the primary
 boot device.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Exit from the BIOS configuration, saving all changes.</strong></p>
<p>RESTART YOUR COMPUTER IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY BOOT INT YOUR PENDRIVE.NOE FOLLOW THE WINDOWS 10 INSTALLATION SCREEN
</p>
<p>HOPE THIS WORKS...</p>
