<h2>            After Windows 10 update, my 2&#39;nd monitor turns off when Windows Login prompt appears</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>after last (same thing happened on several older updates and it "fixed itself" with Auto Update) update (Fall Creators Update 1709) every time I turn on my PC for the 1'st time, my 2'nd monitor turns off when Windows Login prompt appears (I guess, that's
 when it should change to "Extended display"...It's turned on until then and it shows Windows logo, loading etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I:</p>
<p>1. restart my PC (with or without log in), it (2'nd monitor) stays turned on as it should</p>
<p>2. reinstall Display adapter (ATI Radeon HD4800 Series) drivers (after I "Uninstall device" 1'st monitor turns off and 2'nd turns on...they are "switched" for some reason)</p>
<p>&nbsp;a) with</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - I can "Update driver" both with "Search automatically for updated driver software" and "Browse my computer for driver software" (C:\Windows.old\WINDOWS\System32\DriverStore)...installs everything with information message ("Installation successful")
 and turns on both monitors as it should from start</p>
<p>&nbsp;b) without</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - it's enough to "Scan for hardware changes"...installs everything automatically and turns on both monitors as it should from start</p>
<p>a)/b)^^ "Delete the driver software for this device"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked this:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/display-problems-on-some-amd-radeon-video-cards/037b84cc-2b3f-4192-aa51-83239bf1b61b</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional info:</p>
<p>I've installed:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4057291" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB4057291</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Current (I'm not sure which Drivers were installed before I've tried fixing it) Display adapter (ATI Radeon HD4800 Series) Driver info:</p>
<p>Date:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2015/13/1</p>
<p>Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;8.970.100.9001</p>
<p>
</p><p>...but doesn't seem it helped, same problem still prevails.</p>

            Hi Marko, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br /> 
<br />By your description, It does seem like there is some sort of driver conflict in the process.
<br />
<br />Try this to fully remove the driver:
<br />
<br />Make a Restore Point : 
<br />
<br />Start - type in --&gt; Restore ......... find at top and click on - then use Create 
<br />
<br />Download the latest and any other older driver you wish to try from the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and also check the actual video device maker (such as Intel, Nvidia or AMD/ATI). Do not install yet. 
<br />
<br />Use this method to remove the present video drivers. 
<br />
<br />Display Driver Uninstaller 
<br /><a href="https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dr</a>... 
<br />
<br />Then install the desired driver you previously downloaded. 
<br />
<br />=====
<br />
<br />Another method to try would be to uninstall any update which seems to be at fault (not the 1709 FCU which would require a clean install to revert back to 1703).

            Hello,
<br />Please see the below options:
<br />Option 1.Try Rolling back if you have an option:
<br />Go to Device Manager by typing in Devmgmt.msc in Run dialog box. 
<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version. 
<br />Option 2. Remove drivers completely and Install the the newest ones available from the OEM or the maker.
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of Display driver using DDU
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the driver from the OEM or the maker like AMD
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.

<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for all provided suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't seem that provided link is working:</p>
<p>"<span>Display Driver Uninstaller&nbsp;</span><br />
<a href="https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dr</a><span>... "</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Even so, regarding driver reinstallation</p>
<p>...I did try to fresh (Like I've said...uninstalled manually...then) install original/legacy drivers.</p>
<p>Comparing Driver version led me to conclusion that drivers are the same...</p>
<p>I've end up with version 8.970.100.9001 which as far as I've read are suggested and working Drivers.</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>Regarding reverting update...as I've said main "F<span>all Creators Update 1709" seems to be responsible because all updates in between didn't have any negative effect.</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to keep 1709 Update because as far as I know it patched up some serious security issues</span></p>
<p><span>and to be honest, I wouldn't like to reinstall my OS since I don't have reason to believe, that would help (I did try to reinstall it several times when I encountered this problem for 1'st time and nothing helped until
 MS released patch in 1 of the Updates).</span></p>
<p><span>====</span>Unfortunately contacting AMD/ATI didn't get me far since they don't provide support for so old hardware (they have legacy drivers and that's it)...it's understandable since it's in their interest to sell
 new hardware, same as MS doesn't support old OS (eg. XP)</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>All this led me to conclusion that I'll need to wait for MS to (hopefully) patch it up because it doesn't seem that problem is in drivers and could be in OS loading them since simple restart/re-installation does the trick which isn't case with faulty drivers.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Marko</p>

<p>Hi Sumit,<br />
<br />
thank you for suggestions.<br />
<br />
Option 1:<br />
Unfortunately, I don't have Roll back option<br />
Option 2:<br />
Since You've provided working link, I've decided to give it another shot...</p>
<p>1. I've restarted into Safe Mode</p>
<p>2. Cleaned drivers with provided DDU</p>
<p>3. Rebooted</p>
<p>4. Installed drivers</p>
<p>5. Rebooted...everything was working fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Turned off (Shut down) my PC</p>
<p>7. Both monitors were ON until Login prompt when 2'nd monitor turned OFF</p>
<p>8. ...and I was back where I started (Drivers are fine, but Windows OS doesn't seem to load them as it should)</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Arcadio,<br />
<br />
1. What happens when you try to delete?<br />
2. Do you get any error message, if yes what is the exact and complete error message you get?<br />
<br />
</span><span>I suggest you try using Diskpart command to force-delete it.
</span>Please perform the following steps:</p>
<p><span>1. Open a command prompt as administrator.</span><span><br />
</span><span>2. Run Diskpart application by typing<b> Diskpart</b> in the command prompt.</span><span><br />
</span><span>3. In the ‚ÄúDiskpart‚Äù prompt, enter<b> rescan</b> command and press Enter key to re-scan all partitions, volumes and drives available.<br />
4. Then type in <b>list disk</b> and press Enter key to show all hard disk drive available.</span><span><br />
</span><span>5. Select the disk that contains the partition you want to remove. Normally, with just 1 hard disk, it will be disk 0. So the command will be:
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Select disk 0</span></b><span><br />
</span><span>Finish by Enter key.</span><span><br />
</span><span><br />
6. Type <b>list partition</b> and press Enter key to show all available and created partition in the disk selected.</span><span><br />
</span><span>7. Select the partition that wanted to be deleted by using the following command, followed by Enter key:

            <p>Hi Vijay,</p>
<p>According to what I have read, the 'correct' way to remove it is to use the recovery media to create a usb recovery stick,&nbsp;while checking the option that is greyed out to force it to copy the existent partition, and selecting the remove partition option
 at the end of the process. But, as you can see in the photo, the checkbox is not active.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I already thought of using diskpart, but I'm worried about if it will cause any errors when windows suddenly doesn't detect the recovery partition. Can I do it safely?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;for your help</p>

<h2>            I can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t change the email address associated with my live account</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I want to change the email address associated with my Live account/gamertag.</p>
<p>It is currently an 11 year old hotmail email address I created when i was 15. As you can probably tell it is quite a childish address and because of this i don't use it anymore for anything other than signing into Games for Windows Live (i no longer own
 an xbox 360). <br />
This is fine for the moment but I am thinking of buying a windows phone and would just like to change the email address to a more sensible one so I only have to manage one account for Live and use a sensible email address when contacting people.</p>
<p>The problem is, when i go to the account settings and click the 'change' button next to my email address I am presented with the error:<br />
"Your Windows Live ID can't be changed<br />
Your Windows Live ID can't be changed at this time"</p>
<p>I read somewhere that Live accounts with hotmail addresses cannot be changed but that seems utterly ridiculous to me.</p>
<p>I just want to change the email address associated with my gamertag, preserving my gamerscore and games for windows live licenses associated with that account.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>I've personally never heard of such a thing as not being able to change a ID that was a hotmail, as you can have any e-mail address setup as Windows Live ID. Either way, I believe the only way you can change the e-mail address associated with your gamertag
 is to change it via an XBOX 360, by recovering the account and then following the directions here &gt;

<p>contacted the support team who replied stating that i have to make this change on an xbox 360 console. apparently they do not have access to email addresses associated with gamertags and there is no way they can change them.</p>
<p>Bit annoyed about this. One live account/gamertag for both xbox and games for windows live but you must have an xbox to manage the actual account. Why is this facility not available on the games for windows dashboard. it is ridiculous.</p>
<p>I will have to find a friend with an xbox who will let me recover my gamer tag to do this.</p>

            <p>Hi Guy,</p>
<p>When you search, do you find no results at all, or just the wrong results entirely?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also just keep in mind that only the first few most-likely results are shown, it will never show all the results unless you open the folder and use the "Windows 7 style" search box.</p>

            <p>Alright.&nbsp; You know since you mentioned it I went to play around.&nbsp; I just picked a file I know I have buried deep in my user folder somewhere (under \shawn\onedrive\public\apps) called "desktoplistview.exe".&nbsp; I found that my charms bar finds it, and if I
 go to C: drive to search it does too, but not from "This PC" as you said (to be fair I didn't let it finish searching, I gave up after about 3 minutes and cancelled it, so it really might have eventually found it if I had the patience).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was this a problem previously, or was it working for you before?</p>

Most new machines come with a recovery partition allowing you to go back to the time of purchase, you will have to check your user guides (or the manufacturer's Web Site) for instructions.&nbsp; Choosing that path requires you to save all valuable data first.&nbsp; Unfortunately
 upgrading to Windows 8.1 may lose such Recovery Partition.</p>

<h3> rdk45  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro &#40;32bit&#41; PC will not update from version 1511 to 1607 and then to Creator Edition</h2>
                    <p>This weekend we discovered that my wife's Windows 10 Pro (32 bit) PC was stuck at version 1511.&nbsp; We were alerted to this problem when it wanted to start the process to install the latest version (Creator Edition), but first wanted to install 1607.&nbsp; All tries
 to get something beyond version 1511 have failed, multiple times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, we have one other PC and two laptops which have been updated successfully&nbsp;to the Creator Edition with out issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read many of he posting about this and have tried most of the "fixes":</p>
<ul>
<li>dism /online /add-package /packagepath:C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download\b0a5da1b24245bc4237166e09bae92da\windows10.0-kb3122947-x86.cab</li><li>check the system Files from CMD running with Admin authority<br />
sfc /scannow</li><li>run the System update readiness command<br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth<br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</li><li>Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services.<br />
net stop wuauserv<br />
net stop cryptSvc<br />
net stop bits<br />
net stop msiserver</li><li>rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder.<br />
ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old<br />
ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</li><li>restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services<br />
net start wuauserv<br />
net start cryptSvc<br />
net start bits <br />
net start msiserver</li></ul>
<p>Initially Windows was trying to update via the "setup"/"Update&amp;Security" app.&nbsp; Later I tried the "Windows 10 Update Assistant".&nbsp; All tries failed with the message "Something has gone wrong" and then a hex error code.&nbsp; Here are two that I managed to write
 down</p>
<ul>
<li>0xc1900208</li><li>0x80072ee2</li></ul>
<p>I don't recall&nbsp; all of the details, but the last couple runs with the Update Assistant ran like this: Download completed (over an hour); verification completed (fast); install (at least a couple hours) got at least to 87% before it threw the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone assist with this issue? Thanks...RDK</p>

<p>Hmmmm,&nbsp; I did as suggested, ran the Media Creation Tool, selecting: Update this PC, keep files and programs, etc.&nbsp; It downloaded, analyzed, ask me to uninstall my Symantec A/V, installed, rebooted, installed, rebooted, ...&nbsp;and finally ended with an ERROR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not fast enough to copy down the whole message but it was something like this:" Install failed at the SECOND-REBOOT ... during<em> (not real sure here)</em> the DATA and FILE MIGRATION PHASE" And then went on to say it had returned the PC to its state
 before the upgrade process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line, my wife's PC is still at version 1511 with Windows trying to do the -&gt;1607-&gt; Creator Version update each time we boot up the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do we have any other options?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks...RDK45</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the error message is similar to the one shown below, usually the error is due to having an unusual machine name.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fd2fcdd-8b3b-4e9b-a716-a3dfd6632fc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fd2fcdd-8b3b-4e9b-a716-a3dfd6632fc8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using an account with a name such as User, Account or System, then change it to a regular user name. Make sure your machine name is simple, without periods, hyphens or dashes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another suggestion is to uninstall your antivirus utility and other security software, then restart setup. If you have to temporarily disable it, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restoring folders such as Documents, Music and Public to their original location on the system drive can also resolve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall the Symantec software and use their cleanup tool to "remove" remaining files...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure as to whether you will need to download again, but it would have been better if you had created a Flash Drive or saved a ISO as opposed to installing directly from the tool...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have the media, all you need to do is run it from within windows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create the media from any machine of at least Win 7, but be sure to manually select the options, and not let the creation process do it automatically...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might not be a bad idea to do a Disk Cleanup of "System Files" before attempting another upgrade...&nbsp; After the first scan look for "System Files" button on the lower left and scan again...</p>

<p>Thanks folks.&nbsp; I'll do another download tonight, bandwidth here is the pits during the day, and let you know.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the "cleanup tool" you refer to the Symantec Clean-Wipe utility?&nbsp; That one seems like a utility to remove Symantec SEP without using the Windows Uninstall function?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the info....RDK</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps....Yes that was the error message as I recall.&nbsp; PC name and user name look pretty normal to me. It is in a workgroup (not domain).&nbsp; ..</p>

            That may be the one. When you uninstall with the Windows Unibstall there is a lot of code left on the computer and this is the code that disrupts Windows installer.

<p>Folks.....I did as you suggested, mostly.&nbsp; Last night I set the Media Creator app on her PC under an admin user id and had it&nbsp;building on&nbsp;a 16GB USB memory stick.&nbsp; It was done when I got up this AM with no error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC name is MargesPC and the logon IDs are very vanilla, no special characters and no "special" words.&nbsp; It is in our local workgroup, RDKWorkgroup.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled Symantec SEP and then ran the Symantec CleanWipe program.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also did the Disk Cleanup as you suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to get it to boot off of the USB stick.&nbsp; Went into the BIOS and the boot order was CD, external device and then a internal hard drive.&nbsp; It did not specifically say USB device and that was also not an option to add.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it would not boot directly off of the USB drive, I went to that USB drive in the file explorer and double clicked the setup.exe.&nbsp;&nbsp; That seemed to work and it proceeded the questions, agreements, etc and then went into a screen where the % counted up
 and it said something like:&nbsp;"this will take a&nbsp;while and will reboot several times".</p>
<p>
</p><p>That it did and following the "last" reboot and message was something like&nbsp;"restoring to your original version".&nbsp; When I signed on, I got the same message as before, almost the one posted in one of the above posts, except the error code was 0x8007001F 0x4000D.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus as above I'm back to her PC still being at version 1511.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas or suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the content on the USB stick is over 7 GB, it obviously would not fit on a CD or DVD.&nbsp; I have an external Blu-ray USB drive which I could put into this project.&nbsp; Could I make a bootable&nbsp;Blu-ray disk&nbsp;from the USB stick?&nbsp; It is an idea, but I would not
 hold out much hope for a different result.....RDK</p>

<p>Thank you for the update. The error code 8007001F - 0x4000D means that a device attached to the system is not functioning. Outdated and incompatible device drivers are known to work against the methods that Windows 10 follows. In most cases, this issue can
 be resolved by just obtaining the latest version of that driver from the device manufacturer. Check if your device drivers are updated, and if they're not, we suggest that you download and install the latest version of the drivers. Then, proceed to installation.
</p>
<p>

<p>OK, I'll look at it again.&nbsp; I unplugged all of the USB devices except the keyboard and mouse, but I guess I could have missed something.&nbsp; I'll also check the device manager again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll look into updating the drivers for keyboard and mouse and also for a different&nbsp;keyboard and mouse from my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess other obvious drivers are for the network, audio and video functions, although I would have thought Windows would have kept them up-to-date. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>How do I install MagCore.dll&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> merchag  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I install MagCore.dll&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was working on Live Movie Maker recently when a message box appeared saying that MagCore.dll was missing and needed to be reinstalled.&nbsp; I downloaded this onto a USB stick - I don't have broadband on my laptop - and attempted to install it.&nbsp; That's when
 an additional problem came up.&nbsp; A message box gave me the option of where to install it, so I chose Live Move Maker, as you would think it was the obvious choice.&nbsp; Another message box then appeared saying it did not recognise that MagCore model.&nbsp; So I'm a
 bit stumped as to what to do next.&nbsp; Can anyone help?</p>

<h3> dkeierleber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bitlocker code</h2>
                    <p>My wife turned my convertable tablet over to a scam service. They trashed all office programs, all wireless connectivity and recovery tools, that I know of. I had the bit locker code stored on another computer. It doesn't work. When I get to the recovery
 screen, the Key ID listed is not the one I had stored with the recovery key. Putting in the recovery key as I wrote it displays that it is not correct---can't unlock with that code. I can only get to the recovery by booting into the recovery screen. Trying
 to get there from settings the continue button isn't available, only the cancel button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also can't seem to access the original product key via any means I've found on line. Command Prompt and Powershell, run as administrator or not, report that the service is not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a recovery medium ordered but that will take a week. Asus said they could send me the product key but it would take 48 hours (should be up about 3 this morning but I'm not that hopeful).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't I get to a data set that will give me a recovery code from the key ID? I had the unit repaired and they replaced a small board. Would that have affected the recovery code? No documents or programs were lost. I've emailed Asus for the recovery key
 but they haven't responded.</p>

            <p>I retrieved the Windows product code from the computer. The online articles on how to do this did not work as I continually got syntax errors. Not sure why the guys writing the articles can't &nbsp;provide the proper syntax for the commands in both command prompt
 and power shell. So I bought a 3rd party software. The program returned product keys for Win and Explorer, not for Office. Am I going to have to buy another copy of office? Maybe there is an alternative because I'm not pleased with you guys at MS right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to make my own recovery disk as I'd like to get my computer back before the likely time frame for delivery of the recovery drive I ordered. It seems to me that someone on this forum or at MS help could have provided some information that might
 have saved me frustration and time.</p>

</p><p>Update on what the hacker did. They created a windows.old file to use up available space on C. Access to parts of the folder was denied. They disabled commands, including diskpart and manage-bde, disabled reset and refresh by altering (I think) the BitLocker
 code, disabled file history and event log, deleted or disabled all Office programs, disabled the tablets ability to see or use wifi networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created my own recovery flash drive. Could not perform a complete install of Win 8.1 as the volume I needed to install on was protected by BitLocker. Couldn't turn BL off. (Still not seeing a way to turn off in control panel.) Couldn't use command line
 to turn off as the manage-bde command was missing or disabled. Couldn't do a soft install of the OS because there was no space left on C. Finally got aggressive with removing stuff and managed to free up enough space to do the soft install. That recovered
 wifi capability and the commands that had been disabled in command prompt. I turned off BitLocker with manage-bde and that worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tablet still having some issues. I cannot do a reset. Was going to try that just to see if the BL code I have written down now works. Reset reports that I need an additional 284 MB of disk space to perform the operation. Drive C has 12.1 GB free so something
 isn't right. Manage-bde is, again, no longer working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although Asus told me they could send my BitLocker code, I'm pretty sure they were lying. The BitLocker thing is an excursion down a wrong road, as far as I can see. The aggressive move to make it difficult to access certain functions means hackers have
 greater access than the computer owners. All it did in my instance was give the hacker another tool to use against me. The whole object of this attack was to make it impossible to use the tablet and difficult to restore functionality. BitLocker made restoring
 the computer to working order that much harder---still not there. The fact that there are some glitchy things still happening means I'll have to do a complete re-install of the OS but I've been putting it off.</p>

<p>Mas acho que TWD vale a pena, mesmo desta forma o TWD √© mais barato/mesmo pre√ßo que um jogo normal, a diferen√ßa √© que ele √© vendido em epis√≥dios, que eu acho que vendido assim ficou bem maneiro e combinou com o jogo que √© baseados em HQ's/Seriado ao contrario
 de Family Game Night e Crimsom Alliance que sendo vendido desta forma se tornou um na minha opini√£o em jogo f√∫til.</p>

<h2>            100 &#37; High CPU usage after installing XP SP3</h2>
                    Dear all.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>After deploying/ installing - SP3 in WINDOWS XP Profl edn ,(WindowsXP-KB936929-SP3-x86-ENU) the performance in the taskmanager shows 100% CPU utilisation always. Thereby the system performance becomes deadslow. I have confirmed by uninstalling SP3. In SP2
 the CPU utilisation is less than 60 to 90%..</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div>It is SVCHOST process which consumes more than 85% CPU. &nbsp;As suggested by Mr. BinodShaoo, if I &nbsp;kill the process, the CPU usage varies from 15 to 50 %. Some what system speed is normal.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Because of the SVCHOST process cpu consumption , moment I start the PC for 20 minutes i.e. till I kill the process, PC will be slow. So, what shall I do. With out uninstalling SP3 shall we improve the performance of the system.? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kindly suggest NEXT step to improve the the performance. SP3 is wanted, just uninstalling SP3, won't be a solution. More over, now a days internet-security AV pack need minimum requires SP3. So., Please help me...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>NOTE: Currently used Anti- Virus pack used is TOTAL-security pack of K7. &nbsp;<span>My CPU: intel X86 1.5GHZ, 1.5GB RAM</span>.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>KEY WORD: CPU Usage 100% Windows XP SP2 SP3 SVCHOST very slow taskmanager performance&nbsp;</div>
</div>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />My name is Jennifer, an independent advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />
<br />can't sync files between your computer and OneDrive? Try the following:
<br />
<br />Ensure OneDrive is running. Manually launch OneDrive by going to Start  , type onedrive in the search box, then select OneDrive (Desktop app) from the list of results.
<br />
<br /> Make sure your file is below the OneDrive file size limit of 15 GB.
<br />
<br />Make sure you have the latest Windows updates and the latest version of OneDrive.
<br />

    <title>No sound in Windows 10 after recent update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No sound in Windows 10 after recent update</h2>
                    <p>After the recent update, the sound icon was crossed out. I read about the problem here, and followed every single step, but none of them actually worked. Even after fully updating the driver and restarting it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would highly appreciate help on this. It happens nearly every time W10 has a new large update.</p>

<p>Just tried this and it seems to have worked for me. It might work for you. Follow the instructions from Windows go into your
<strong>"Device Manager" in Windows 10</strong>.&nbsp;Find your sound card device in the drop down list under.&nbsp;<strong>"Sound, video and Game Controllers".
</strong><strong>"Uninstall" </strong>the driver for your sound card.&nbsp;IMPORTANT STEP: While you are in the "Device Manager" look for any&nbsp;Windows 10 software drivers for any known "on board" software devices, usually marked
<strong>"HIGH&nbsp;DEFINITION AUDIO DEVICE", </strong>right click and <strong>"DISABLE"</strong> them. Reboot your computer and Windows 10 will auto install the drivers for your sound card. As long as you your on board Sound Card is
<strong>"Disabled" </strong>Windows cannot reinstall the drivers for those particular items.
<em><strong>If you are prompted to allow Windows to reinstall the drivers for the "HIGH DEFINITION AUDIO DEVICE", ignore it and delete the download.

Make certain that you have the latest driver updates for your sound card directly from the manufacturer of your sound card.

<p><span><span><em>Hy
</em></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><em>thanks for the responses. There is indeed a couple of numbers on the back of the controller. One is the same as the larger 14 digit one on the packaging [with SN as a prefix]
 &nbsp;and this is the one that appears to be too long to fit into the registration form. The other is &nbsp;smaller combination 10 letter/number.
</em></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><em>Does anyone know if the serial numbers all begin with a certain set of numbers initially that are common too all controllers and then maybe only the last say 7 for example
 are the controller individual number.That would explain the number being too long. It could just be the site form that's a problem. I'll try them both again and see what happens</em></span></span></p>

<p>Hy Folks </p>
<p>I think I may have solved the problem as I have just re read the registration bit. I'm assuming that you can only register your actual console and not the controllers? I'm guessing that the console serial number has the correct amount of digits for the site
 form. </p>
