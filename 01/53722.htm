    <title>People App Not Syncing Full Contact Info - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            People App Not Syncing Full Contact Info</h2>
                    <p>The People App in Windows 8 is a mess. It doesn't even sync full contact data. Ridiculous. Why should I have to use my Windows Phone 8 or go to people.live.com to see the full contact info? If it's on people.live.com or on my phone it should certainly be
 showing in the People app. I sign in using the same login for all these services. This is ridiculous. It makes the Mail app even less useful than it currently is, which even after the update, is still a miserable experience. Does Microsoft even hire for talent
 anymore? Do they promote doing a good job or does their review/raise process of pitting everyone against each other do nothing more than screw the consumer out of a decent product experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone please explain this huge oversight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Thanks for the reply but that did not help. I even ran the "App Issue Detector" or whatever and let it run and rebooted. The "People" app on my Windows 8 laptop is still not showing "Live" contacts that are in either my Windows Phone 8 or show up at people.live.com.
<div><br />
<div>Not sure why this is an issue. Seems like a pretty big oversight if the People app on Windows 8 doesn't sync with your Windows Live address book correctly. Getting sick of all these issues on BASIC features not working. Don't even get me started on Windows
 Phone 8... that's a whole different beast.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>C'mon Microsoft, use some of that $60+ BILLION dollars in cash reserves to hire people that can actually make this work...</div>

            <p>I have had the exact same issues.&nbsp; I really enjoy the "idea" of the live tiles but if they never work properly what is the point of having them.&nbsp; I received a Lenovo Yoga for Christmas and love it, but find all the problems with the Windows&nbsp; live&nbsp;tiles disappointing!&nbsp;This
 seems like it should be an easy fix.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also&nbsp;gone through all the "fix" ideas several times and nothing has changed. I would love to recommend the Windows platform, but at this point I really can't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other information would be appreciated to&nbsp;fix this app!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            Tried all of the above, but no results. People app just doesn't connect to Facebook, linkedIn, Twitter or Google. Useless in other words. Only Microsoft, Live and Outlook connect and I do see my contacts, but when I try to see "What's new" or to open ones
 profile, I get a message to connect to Facebook. I then go ahead, reconnect and get a message&nbsp;

            I'm having this exact same problem. I've been trying to find fixes and haven't seen any topics that aren't at least a year old. I've done all the same things you have to no avail. I have no idea how this OS has been out as long as it has and without this
 bug being addressed. I've owned Windows 8 for less than 3 months and my initial reaction is not a good one.<br />
<br />
Sorry I'm not providing any help. I just wanted to let you know that you're not the only one experiencing this problem.<br />

 in the "People" app, it shows how much they care about the "people" who use windows 8.1.&nbsp; I operate all within the Windows ecosystem. I am not asking to sync with gmail or anything else, just between windows 8.1 and windows phone 7.8. I almost never go out
 on a rant like this. But I can't help it anymore. This People app is a joke and it has wasted so much of my time and energy.<br />

            <p>I agree....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried getting my Surface set up with all these confounded Windows "apps" and it's a nightmare. &nbsp;The people app took me to people.com. &nbsp;"OK" I thought to myself "I must have to set them up here, and then the app will sync with the cloud..." &nbsp;So I spent
 30+ minutes trying to figure out how to import and export contacts (with spreadsheets? &nbsp;really microsoft? &nbsp;it's 2015 ffs) and finally got it set up on people.com where I could see all the contacts across all the accounts I wanted to see. &nbsp;The I gleefully go
 back to the people app and search for the contact that was previously missing... still missing... it's on people.com, but not the people app... &nbsp;What? &nbsp;How are you going to have to separate services, call them the same thing, and not share info between the
 two?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks l like &nbsp;I'll be sticking to the Chrome app and continue to use Inbox. &nbsp;Such a disappointment. &nbsp;Hopefully Windows 10 fixes some of these issues... but likely it will just pile more broken programs on top of already broken programs.</p>

            <p>As you use the Surface and Win 10 you will come across defects that make both items useless as a productivity tool.&nbsp; The surface is an expensive toy, sad.&nbsp; There aren't enough people reporting this stuff so Microsoft isn't responsive.&nbsp; I have yet to talk
 to anyone there who actually cares and I am a stockholder (not for long) and a developer.&nbsp; It's hard to believe they don't have the programmers to fix this mess so it has to be poor management.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The people app is useless and that is arguably the most important app in the suite.&nbsp; OneDrive is completely useless on any Surface computer.&nbsp; They actual ruined it in Win 10.</p>

            <p>I was planning a trip and had saved some web pages in a folder in my laptop running windows 10. I moved the whole folder to OneDrive documents hoping that I could access them from my Lumia 640 LTE phone running Denim.&nbsp; None of the web pages from that folder
 opened on my windows phone. The only file I was able to open was a text file with extension .txt.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should stop worrying about holograms and flying and self driving cars and fix the People app as well as the OneDrive.&nbsp; People app is probably the least complex of all the apps and Microsoft is struggling to find engineers to fix it.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Hotspot not working... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shreyaskulkarni_nsk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Hotspot not working...</h2>
                    <p>I have TP-Link Tl-WN722N USB Wi-Fi adaptor and my laptop's internal PCIe Wi-Fi cards. I use USB adaptor to get good Wi-Fi reception in my room and I frequently use the inbuilt Wi-Fi hotspot function frequently to share internet to my mobile. The inbuilt
 wifi hotspot is created in internal Wi-Fi card and the internet is connected to USB adaptor. But, the Hotspot is stopped working and it says&nbsp; "we cant set up hotspot". I have tried the hosted network (CMD &amp; MyPublicWifi too.)&nbsp; but it is created on external
 Wi-Fi adaptor which slows down the speed of hotspot. So I prefer the Inbuilt hotspot (And Its kind of easy too!). I tried all methods to fix it like disabling Bluetooth and refreshing the interfaces in netsh via cmd,&nbsp; still it doesn't work :( . Then I tried
 "Network Reset" and It fixed it for 2-4 days and again it stops working. After 2-3 network resets, I tried to enable ICS and I got the "null" error. Then I tried to restart firewall service in services and confirmed that it is set automatic startup. Then I
 uninstalled the Wi-Fi direct virtual adaptor in device manager and it didn't reinstall the drivers :/ .</p>
<p>So, anyone knows how to fix this problem and how to reinstall Wi-Fi direct drivers and or use two network adaptors, one as Wi-Fi receiver and second as Wi-Fi AP let me know. Or any other application or command prompt command etc. that can make use of both
 Wi-Fi adaptors.</p>
<p>I appreciate your help. Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: BTW, I'm on latest Windows 10 Insider and both my Wi-Fi adaptors have Atheros 9K chipsets (For any driver issues.).&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Xbox live issues with accessing digital content. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s0ulch4sm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox live issues with accessing digital content.</h2>
                    <p>I've been seeing this issue pop up with all my digital games for three years now, where xbox has issues verifying if I actually own the content im trying to play. Regardless of how long I've owned the content, how many hours I've put into a game, doesn't matter at all. I get any number of different error codes with a message saying in some form or fashion that xbox thinks I am trying to access content that I have not paid for. Why is this still an issue, and why does it seem like some people are more prone to have this issue than others? I know people who have never had this problem and yet for me this happens on a weekly basis... Denied access to content I legally have access to and nothing I can do about it other than continue to listen to Microsoft telling everyone that the problem is being worked on when it is clear they haven't done anything to fix this issue.</p>

            <p>It honestly doesn't seem to be an overly difficult concept to go back to a process similar to how the 360 did things. I know that this is an attempt to prevent illegal access to content but it seems that in that attempt you are ticking more people off than you are helping. I can defiantly tell you I will never purchase digital games from Xbox again, at least if I had physical copies I could still play. You've taken what was supposed to be an improvement for ease of access and turned it into a nightmare for someone who just want to relax and play games when they get home from work.</p>

<h2>            MicroSoft should not allow this</h2>
                    
<p>Why do Microsoft allow Activision to release a new Map Pack so soon after the last one</p>
<p>Game released November 2010</p>
<p>First Map Pack (First Strike) released Feb 1 2011 (3+ months after release)</p>
<p>Second Map Pack (Escalation) Released May 3 2011 (3+ months later again)</p>
<p>Third Map Map Pack (Annihilation) Released June 26 2011 ( Less than 2 months after previous one)</p>
<p>I think this is unfair on people who do not have the free cash available as they then become outcasts, parties do not want them in because they will not get to play the new maps because someone in the party does not have them.</p>
<p>Considering the Maps are 50% more expensive than previous versions (and there's more of them) I think they should not be allowed to do this.</p>
<p>Microsoft why have you allowed this to happen?</p>

<p>$15 is really demanding? Lol.</p>
<p>Oh and it came out on the 28th, which is today. Not the 26th... so yeah.</p>
<p>No one is asking you to buy the map pack so who cares if all your friends have it, but you don't? I didn't buy either of the MW2 map packs because that game wasn't worth it, but this one is hence why I have bought all 3 map packs so far.

<p><span>Microsoft and Activision are in the business of making money. In order to do that they must supply their customers with a product. If they don't the customers will go elsewhere.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There is no law or regulation stating when a company can release a product or how many products. So long as the product meets the necessary requirements they can release as many whenever they want.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In this economy if you find yourself in tough times you should be prioritizing your spending. The map packs have been 1200 ms points since MW2. So there shouldn't be any surprises there. Skip a few take
 out meals and you'll have the money to buy them in a day or two. <br />

<p>I don't understand why people complain about the release of new map packs. If you can't afford it or don't want it, DON'T BUY IT. Simple as that. Believe it or not, there are people out there that do enjoy new maps, I being one of them.</p>

<p>Well I guess the answer is above :) they know people will pay and abuse that fact.</p>
<p>My point was not about price but more the fact they have released 2 x map pack so close together, now in my case I have 2 accounts (mine and my sons) so that is $60 in 6 weeks, More than my phone line and internet.</p>
<p>some families do not have that amount of money spare, yeah its fair enough saying you don`t have to buy it in reality if you don`t have it your game is degraded as you cannot play in parties as they want to play the new maps and won't if your in the party
 unless all your friends don`t have it also, it is just unfair on poorer families to release them so close together.</p>

<h2>            Unhighlight Start menu item</h2>
                    I must have done something.&nbsp; When I go to the Start button, the item just above All Programs is highlighted in beige.&nbsp; Kind of distracting.&nbsp; I right-clicked and chose Remove From List, but that item just got replaced by another item (highlighting remains).&nbsp;
 What causes this? How would I get rid of the highlighting?<br />

            <p>What item do you see just above&nbsp;<strong>All Programs</strong>? Is this a newly installed program?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you see is dependant on how you have your system setup and what you have installed so what you see may be different than what others see on their Start menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is a newly installed program, right-click an empty spot on the <strong>Taskbar</strong> and in the context menu select
<strong>Properties</strong>. In the <strong>Taskbar and Start Menu Properties</strong> window click the
<strong>Start Menu</strong> tab, then click the <strong>Customize</strong> button. Scroll the list in the
<strong>Customize Start Menu</strong> window until you see <strong>Highlight newly installed programs</strong>; is this option checked? If so, uncheck it and click
<strong>OK</strong> at the bottom and the next window. This should have removed the highlighting from the Start menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>PC Settings and metro apps won&#39;t open after upgrade to win 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> risky febrian  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC Settings and metro apps won&#39;t open after upgrade to win 8.1</h2>
                    I found this issue is only happened to several win 8.1 users, and this question is already asked before, but i still can't solve this on my computer.
<div>A few weeks after upgrading to win 8.1 (and after installed some important update i think), i found that i can't open any metro apps, it goes blank and back to start screen. Then i realized that my PC settings wont open too, so i cant do "refresh my PC"
 solution. And there is another issue, i cant change the folder view options in windows explorer (e.g. when i changed it in "large icons" view mode, then i closed the folder and open that folder again, it goes back to the default view mode before i changed
 that) and that's really annoying because i use my computer like 24/7. Please tell me if there's any solution possible without clean install my computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>*i already tried the sfc scan, and the result is "Windows resource protection found corrupt files but unable to fix them blablabla..."</div>

            Hey, finally i think i found out the cause of this issue. in my case, i think its caused by a tuneup utility program, like ccleaner or advanced system care, the "clean up registry" feature on that will wipe out some important registry. which is would not
 happen when you use it in previous version of windows (i've been using asc since windows xp and nothing wrong until this 8.1). So, i did CLEAN INSTALL, and its been like two weeks and everyhting runs perfectly bcs i didnt install the tuneup utility **** haha.
 so dont be afraid to upgrade to 8.1, but do just careful with the program you install bcs i think its still vulnerable. or, dont upgrade at all :D

    <title>On screen keyboard randomly stops playing sound when I type - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter  say:</h3>
<h2>            On screen keyboard randomly stops playing sound when I type</h2>
                    At seemingly random times, the on screen keyboard stops producing sound when I tap on the keys.&nbsp; The touch cover is attached, but folded back.&nbsp; I have not had a similar problem with the touch cover, it is only the on screen keyboard.&nbsp; This can be very
 annoying because it is hard to tell when the key presses are registering without the click feedback.&nbsp; Sometimes the sound returns after a period of time, but in other cases it stays muted for long periods.&nbsp; All Windows updates have been applied.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Is there a firmware / software update expected to fix this problem?<br />

            I followed the steps given and for the time being the problem seems to be resolved.&nbsp; The tablet had been working with key click sounds for almost a month before the problem started occurring and the PC settings had not been changed during that time.&nbsp; Hopefully
 this simple reset of the key click sounds was enough to solve the problem permanently.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>There are no files in minidump folder or no folder named memory. dmp was not found in the computer. The minidump folder is empty because a day before I received this message from u, I used ccleaner which may have clean the the files from the minidump folder.
 I have seen that page file is in the same drive in which OS is present and its size is less than the installed RAM. I even tested the RAM by using MEMtest and no error were seen after 8 passes. I tried all the thing mentioned in the link posted by you.
<strong>Please help in solving the issue. </strong></p>

            <p>I have also seen this issue on a Acer laptop shortly after upgrading to Windows 10. It wasn't realized right away, since the issue only occurs when the laptop is on battery. It works fine with no issue when plugged in to the power adapter. If the laptop
 is disconnected from the power adapter, the BSOD with this message comes up in maybe 15-30 seconds. After the count down, the laptop reboots, then repeats the BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to the .dmp files from the Minidump folder. Hopefully they will shed some light on the cause of this BSOD. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

                    <p>Does anyone know how on earth I can recover my Skype password? </p>
<p>The email address I used to setup my account is no longer in service, I've tried a password recovery 3 times and answered as many questions as I could but get told each time that it was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>I've also spoken to the live support staff who tell me they are not in a position to assist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems crazy to me that its this difficult just to simply reset my password!!!</p>

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;account recovery form&nbsp;is the only way to get back into your account when your security info won’t work. We do not have that kind of access to your account for privacy and security reasons. Microsoft's top priority is the privacy
 and security of your respective account.</p>
<p>The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer that has successfully signed into that account previously.&nbsp;Also, it's much better if you can&nbsp;do this process from a network location (i.e. home

    <title>Problems with group e-mails and sending attachments windows live mail - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with group e-mails and sending attachments windows live mail</h2>
                    I have 2 problems with Microsoft Windows Live Mail:
<p>1.&nbsp; I set up a group of 18 people and mailed them all.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of them "replied all" and it turned out that my message had only gone to 6 of the 18 people.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me why this is?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I sent the same group of folk an e-mail with 3 attachments which were files that had been mailed to be by 3 other people. I saved them onto my PC and them attached them to an e-mail fro group mailing.&nbsp; All the files became corrupted and couldn't be opened
 by the recipients, some couldn't even open the e-mail to read the text!&nbsp; The files open fine in my Sent items folder but when I tried mailing them to my husband - same PC, different account - they arrived corrupted.&nbsp; So what happened there and what can I do
 about it?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting. I understand that you are having issues with Mail. As for your first concern, let's try to isolate if the issue was with corrupted Mail related files. Try to repair it by following these:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Press <font><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows</span> +
<p>2. Select <font>
<p>3. Click <span style="font-weight: bold">
<font>Repair all Windows Essentials Programs</font></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After repairing, try to reconfigure account by following the steps here on how to remove and re-add again the account. This is to refresh the connection of the account to the email client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case the issue still persists, try to compose an email and put the name of the group on the
<strong>To:</strong> box. After that, click the <strong>"+"</strong> icon and check if all the contacts listed on that group was listed. Also, I would like to ask if the recipients not receiving the message are consistent whenever you send an email to that
 group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your second concern, I would like to ask for the sample .eml file of the corrupted email for our investigation on our end. Upload it in the private message area. Access it by signing
 in to Microsoft Community and hit <strong>Private Messages</strong> link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

            <p>Richard,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I ran the repair option that you described but this didn't help.&nbsp; Where are the steps on how to remove and re-add an account?&nbsp; My wife doesn't want to lose her received emails in the process unless necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked further at the groups problem.&nbsp; The group has 18 members that you can see when you click on Contacts.&nbsp; When starting a new email you can select the group by clicking the To button in the new mail window.&nbsp; This brings up another window where I can
 select the group from the list of contacts.&nbsp; When I click the + icon&nbsp;in this window all 18 contacts in the group appear.&nbsp; However if I apply the group to the new mail message window and select the + icon in the To line only&nbsp;6 contacts appear and it is the
 same 6 each time.&nbsp; Not sure if I'm making sense here!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The corrupted attachments are also a problem.&nbsp; As far as I can tell nobody is able to open them, but we can open them from our sent items OK and can open them normally from an explorer window.&nbsp; This is affecting both accounts on the computer.&nbsp; Can you explain
 what a sample .eml file is so that I can send it as you request?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for coming back and I apologize if I wasn't able to provide the link for the instructions. You can follow the steps
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>here</strong></a> for reconfiguring the account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the .eml file, you just have to open an email where you are having issues with then save it as a file. After that, kindly send it to the private message area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I would like you to recreate the group you created then try checking again if when you attach that group in To: box it will still show the same 6 contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply.&nbsp; Lets' fix the attachments issue first.&nbsp; I tried removing the accounts and then re-adding them (I assume this is what you meant by reconfiguring the account).&nbsp; This didn't work.&nbsp; I tried uninstalling and re-installing Windows Live
 Mail.&nbsp; This didn't work.&nbsp; I still have a Windows Vista laptop - I might try using that to see if there is a problem with our email service provider.&nbsp; I'll also place an eml file in the private message area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there some kind of live help option that I can use that might speed things up?&nbsp; Somewhere where someone from Microsoft can view and control my desktop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you want to fix the issue as soon as possible but we can only support through this forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the .eml file and found no issues with it. To further isolate the issue, I would like to ask some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>In your statement "<em>The files open fine in my Sent items folder but when I tried mailing them to my husband - same PC, different account - they arrived corrupted</em>", are you referring to a different account in Windows Live Mail or different user account
 in computer?</li><li>Does the issue happen to all of the emails with attachment?</li><li>If you try to disable your protection software, do you still encounter the issue?</li><li>Do you remember any changes you made in your Mail or computer prior to the issue?</li><li>What is the version of your Mail? To check, press <strong>ALT + F</strong> in Mail, click
<strong>About</strong>.</li><li>What is your operating system?</li></ul>
<p>As for your isolation on your other computer, please do so and update us any results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Richard,.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; Did you check both eml files I sent you?&nbsp; There was one eml which was&nbsp;a received email from my wife's account which has an attachment that we can't open and a second eml file that was direct from the sent items folder which we could
 read OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife and I both have separate email and user accounts on this same computer.&nbsp; We have the same email service provider and both use Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; We've been doing this testing with emails between the two of us, but we understand that other recipients
 are also unable to open our attachments.</p>
<p>We've tried this with all types of MS Office files and jpeg images, none of which seem to open in received attachments from ourselves. We can open attachments from other people OK.</p>
<p>I've tried disabling Norton Antivirus and firewall before sending again, but this didn't work.</p>
<p>I don't remember any specific changes to Mail or the computer before this started.</p>
<p>The version of Windows Live Mail is Version 2012 (Build 16.4.3508.0205).</p>
<p>We are running Windows 8.</p>
<p>I tried sending emails with attachments between our accounts using our old Windows Vista laptop and Windows Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Kay,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; First of all the groups issue appears to have been resolved.&nbsp; I re-created the group from scratch and it seems to be OK now.&nbsp; Not sure what was wrong before.&nbsp; I'll keep an eye on it and see if it goes wrong again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next the email attachments issue.&nbsp; I used Outlook.com to send an email to my wife's account using the same attachments as before.&nbsp; This worked fine and she was able to open the attachments in Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; So the issue appears to be related to sending
 using Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tested emailing between our accounts on an old Windows Vista laptop and Windows Mail and this works fine, suggesting there is nothing wrong with our email service provider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll keep doing some tests and hope to hear from you further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hello Darren,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For us to check if there's something wrong within the email provider's end, please verify if you're having the same issue if you use an account with a different domain. (GMail, Yahoo, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would also need to know the attachments that you're referring. Is it zipped or are the files raw? (ie: jpeg, avi, doc etc.) In addition, try using a different computer with Windows Live Mail. Do you receive the same issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll await for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Could Twitch app stream TV app&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>It would be a very nice feature if twitch app in Xbox One could stream the TV (HDMI input) app... That way we could also stream X360 games! I use the HDMI input just for playing in my xbox 360. After Dark Souls 2 release I would love to stream it in Xbox
 One Twitch... Any chance we could see that available?</p>

<p>But if you wanna stream from x360, get a game recorder instead.</p>

<p>no, due to copyright issues, this will never happen, guaranteed. They cannot detect what you have on the input so it automatically adds HDCP when you are not in the game channel. Sorry, do what all others do and pay for the devices if you want to do that.

    <title>Windows 10 re-activation issues when upgraded from Windows7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adminbvh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 re-activation issues when upgraded from Windows7</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We face this issue with the second original Dell machine, which was purchased with Windows 7, then upgraded to Windows 10 in the free period.</p>
<p>There were no hardware changes to the PC and after using them with Windows 10 for several years the re-activation would not complete even after re-entering the original Windows 7 product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a couple of call with the Windows Activation support and they found the key valid.</p>
<p>They also advised to ask for "Up and Running Windows" support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This what I have already tried on one of the PCs from the suggestions get from the calls:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Force Installed 1809 as Windows Update was not picking that up</p>
<p>- changed various firewall setting even turning it off completely</p>
<p>- turned off and on the proxy server setup</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually get 0x800704cF or similar activation servers unreachable error codes after entering the product key once again.</p>
<p>Internet access is working properly as I am writing this from one of the machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re-activation from the same company network works fine for other PCs also upgraded from Windows8&amp;8.1 even when having some HW changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please help me what to check to complete the re-activation of these machines?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Attila</p>

            <p>I agree that connecting the power cord&nbsp;should be easier (it takes more time than I'd like), however, mine has never fallen off. Once it's connected, it's connected.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I connect mine so that the light on the tip is facing up. This way I know when it's getting power.</p>
<p>(if you have access to another power supply, you might see if the same thing happens - if you know another Surface person)&nbsp;</p>

            Hi&nbsp;Keith Eaton,
<div><br />
<div>The only thing I've noticed is that it's a little more difficult attaching it when the Surface is closed, but it appears to be much easier if it is open.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just my two cents worth.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this helps!<br />

<h2>            Remote desktop Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>I am using remote desktop to view and control my laptop from my workstation. Both are running Windows 10 Pro. I can connect, but it times out or disconnects after about 10 minutes. I don't have the same problem with my laptop VPN into our company's server.
 Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The time out that you're experiencing might be due to Session Time Limits policies on your PC. Try disabling active Session Time Limits policies and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Access <strong>Run </strong>by pressing the <strong>Windows key + R</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>gpedit.msc</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Navigate to <strong>Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Desktop Session Host\Session Time Limits</strong>.</li><li>If there are any active policies, <strong>disable </strong>it.</li><li><strong>Restart </strong>your PC.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>
