<h2>            Windows 7 SP1 Gives ERROR_TRANSACTIONAL_CONFLICT&#40;0x80071a90&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have tried installing Windows 7 SP1 via Windows Update, the recommended option by Microsoft.&nbsp; It says updates installed successfully, but after reboot I get a not successfull dialog box and Error: ERROR_TRANSACTIONAL_CONFLICT(0x80071a90).</p>
<p>I followed the link to go online to learn more, followed and ran the troubleshooter in Control Panel.</p>
<p>Tried installing SP1 again using Windows Update.&nbsp; Again successful, but after reboot again same error message.</p>
<p>I have no anti-virus software.&nbsp; This is the first time I am getting this error message.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>How can I change username in Windows Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swenthetinbeard  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I change username in Windows Mail</h2>
                    <p>Windows Mail does not want to send my e-mails anymore. I did not change anything in the configuration, I suspect some recent update has screwed up things. I've read that this is because username does not e-mail address (so the address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
 but the username is just my_name). I would like to change the username but in the settings the username field is just greyed out. How can I change it?</p>
<p>Oh, and deleting my account in Windows Mail and adding the same one again under a different username is not an option for me unfortunately. This would delete all my data associated with this account which I cannot afford because Windows Mail does not sync
 sent mails properly so I don't have them backed up. I just want to change the username. Why is it so hard, Microsoft?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you with changing your username in Windows Mail, you may refer to this support article on
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12407/manage-aliases-on-your-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
how to manage aliases on your Microsoft account.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This will change the way you sign in. An alias is an additional account name that can be an email address, phone number, or Skype name. It uses the same inbox, contact list, and account settings as the primary alias. You can sign in to your account with
 any alias—they all use the same password.</p>
<br />
Do get back to us should you need further assistance.<br />

<p>Windows 10 mail stopped sending email.&nbsp; I believe the server data has changed and the old data suddenly died.&nbsp; To change this data I need to change my account data.&nbsp; When I get to the changing sync page my user name is grey and the Advanced Settings is absent.&nbsp;
 How do I get rid of the grey user name (which is my e-mail address)?&nbsp; Then the Advanced Settings will probably appear. &nbsp; My e-mail is with Bellsouth (at&amp;t).</p>

<h2>            How do you fix errors&#58; 0x3ec, 0x80072EFD, 0x800704cf, And the &#34;Something went wrong.&#34; error&#63; &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Previously, my laptop software was on Windows 7 performing pretty well with very little errors. Unfortunately, after the upgrade to Windows 10 I have been experiencing errors that will not allow me to use an Internet connection to the following windows
 10 applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xbox</li><li>Weather</li><li>Onenote</li><li>News</li><li>Store</li><li>Microsoft Edge</li></ul>
<p>And many other applications. Otherwise it will project an error on the PC saying: "Something went wrong." Then showing the error code bellow the display.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These errors have been occurring ever since I have upgraded from Windows 7. I have went through many troubleshoots and yet this problem still persists. The troubleshoots include having to &nbsp;power cycle the PC, Get a wired connection to the router, Set
 my time to automatic, Check my timezone, Use the command starting with "Dism", Uninstalling Networks going by the name of 6to4 I believe, Checking and Installing Updates, I have also checked to see if I still have files from Windows 7 still running. Also Instead
 of being recognized on the Microsoft website as Windows 10 it is recognized as Windows 8.1 but in settings it is recognized as Windows 10. This doesn't seem that important as long as I can still access my applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As you can tell I am very upset and also frustrated with the performance of this upgrade please help and Thank you.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have found&nbsp;a solution although please forgive me about being away for so long. Follow the following steps to ensure that your windows 10 upgrade continues without the errors. Also If you have precious items on your computer please buy or use&nbsp;a USB
 drive to save these items</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows (WIN)&nbsp;&gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under "Reset This PC" Click "Get Started" Also Please ensure that you have a&nbsp;USB before continuing if you have any precious Pictures, Videos, etc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There should be a few more notifications, DO NOT choose "Recycle This PC" Chose "Delete my files."</p>
<p>Don't worry about your windows 10 upgrade it will reinstall your upgrade afterwards.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Gregg, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the Turn On/Off Media Features and began to turn off Windows Media Player.&nbsp; Among the selection to replace it as the default Video player, VLC Player was not listed, despite being the world's most popular media player.&nbsp; Instead I was offered a
 reduced version of the VLC Player from the Microsoft Apps Store.&nbsp; The reduced VLC is unacceptable to me since it lacks features that I use and that are on the fully loaded VLC Player that you can download from the Internet and which I already have on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, your suggested solution to the problem of trying to keep VLC as my video player default app is unworkable at this time on my computer because the only VLC Player available is a less capable one from the APPs store rather than the fully capable one
 downloaded from the net and already on my machine.</p>

<br />
<br />You should be able to open it from the All Apps list in Start Menu, set it as Default at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps &gt; Choose Default by App. 
<br />
<br />If not then uninstall it there are reinstall it from the link I gave you.

            You wouldn't want to try S Mode.  You'd want to disable it as shown in the tutorial I linked.  As stated S mode restricts you to only the Store apps, which is why I thought it might be enabled since you said VLC cannot be installed from it's download.  Did I misunderstand?

<p>
</p><p>thanks for the check.&nbsp; No, you didn't misunderstand.&nbsp; I did try the S mode alternatives and found the VLC app woefully short.&nbsp; I've kept your advice on going outside of S mode and will try it again at a later time.&nbsp; It appears the lead-in pages to escaping
 S have changed and I will investigate getting around them later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your continued help after my initial shock at finding my preferences on my own computer replaced.&nbsp; I remain baffled by the design priorities of Windows10.&nbsp; They appear to have abandoned all of their own past advancements (Windows Live family,
 earlier Windows allowed you to select downloaded files (VLC etc) from your own Program files rather than a centralized and less capable APP list) in favor of anything APP.</p>

                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with Windows Update agent on Windows 7 SP1 enterprise.</p>
<p>We are using Configuration Manager 1606 and Windows 7 SP1 and about 140 computers works without any problem.</p>
<p>On the other 10 computers I got the following error message in the windowsupdate.log:</p>
<p><em>WARNING: SyncUpdates failure, error = 0x8024400D, soap client error = 7, soap error code = 300, HTTP status code = 200</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>I've tried several actions although none does any help. Here is the list of actions:</p>
<p>- upgrade&nbsp;windows update agent to the latest version</p>
<p>- windows update agent reset by this instructions https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components</p>
<p>- empty Temporary Internet files</p>
<p>- check the rules and blocked traffic on windows firewall and physical firewall between server and workstation vlan</p>
<p>- sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like significant Windows 7 error, although reinstalling is not my option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<h2>            Need help with 4k on Xbox one S &#33;</h2>
                    <p>I could do with some advice on setting up my TV/Xbox for 4k. The picture when in menus on 4k games is perfect, clearly alot better than when i had the OG xbox...but when i play any 4k game there is a thin blurred line around the edge of the screen (like
 a frame) whenever i move or turn camera etc.. And there is sometimes really bad motion blur on the whole screen if i turn the camera quickly or on racing games when the screen is moving fast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im not sure if i need to change settings on either my TV or Xbox to fix this? Or is this a common problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be appreciated!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my TV if that helps..</p>

            If your TV has a game mode, turn that on. It will turn off all video processing which isn't needed as the Xbox handles that&nbsp; If it it doesn't, go into your TV's video settings and turn off all video processing settings ( things like auto motion, contrast
 enhancing, digital clean view which enhances sharpness for fast moving images). None of that is needed. The Xbox menu interface isn't in 4K btw.&nbsp;

If it is the official version and the link does not help it might be prudent to give support a ring as soon as you are able.<br />

            This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

            Hello, Bette
<br />
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Restart the Windows Explorer service from the Task Manager
<br />
<br />This is one of the most traditional methods to restart this service.
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />To access the task manager we can use any of the following methods:
<br />Using the key combination Ctrl + Alt + Del and in the options displayed select Task Manager
<br />Right clicking on the Start menu (Or use the key combination + X) and in the list displayed select Task Manager
<br />Right clicking on the taskbar and selecting the Task Manager option
<br />Using the key combination + R and in the displayed window enter the command:
<br />
<br />taskmgr
<br />
<br />And press Enter.
<br />
<br />In the Task Manager window we go to the Processes tab and there we have two options to restart the Windows Explorer process:
<br />
<br />Restart file explorer process
<br />Right clicking on the process and selecting the Restart option
<br />Press the Reset button located in the lower right
<br />
<br />In this way we restart the process from the Windows 10 Task Manager.
<br />
<br />I hope it helps you

<span>Hi Carl225.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thanks for posting your concern.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Surface Pro 3 is a full laptop replacement and can run many of the most popular PC games. The ability of the device to run the game that you want will depend on the game's minimum and recommended system requirements. You can check the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/surface-pro-3-specs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Technical Specifications</a> of Surface Pro 3 to see if it's compatible with the program.</span><br />

<p>Hi WantedChicken66,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums for this issue. Sorry to hear you're having issues getting connected to your wifi. I've been there before myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd recommend the solution as previously provided by our awesome Ambassador, M3tal Daz3, to begin with as that can offer you some great solutions. You can also feel free to try out our
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/cant-see-wireless-network-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox One Wireless Network Connection Solution</a>as well. Also, you'll want to be sure to cycle your network router for about 5 full minutes while your console is completely off as well if asked to unplug your router. I know that sometimes it says 30 seconds,
 but I personally find that by doing it for about 5 full minutes, you get a better result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go ahead and give these solutions a try and please let us know the results!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that this helps you out!</p>

    <title>How to take ownership of hard drive since upgrade to Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john10001  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to take ownership of hard drive since upgrade to Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 7 from XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I can not access any of the files on my old hard drive which is on my computer as drive E, nor can I access any files on the external USB hard drive either. It says access is denied. Those drives are linked to my previous account on my XP system
 which crashed and died.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I "correctly"&nbsp;take ownership of these other drives on my new Windows 7 system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have previously tried to do this by setting my new username on the Windows 7 system to have full permissions. It doesn't work. It changes the attributes of all the files and folders on my other drives but once that is all done I still have the same problem
 and am unable to access them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried using a program called "change permissions" and that did the same thing and I still have the same problem. Neither method worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please Microsoft, you designed these operating systems, please explain to me how I take full ownership and control of "MY" hard drives from my XP system so I can access all "MY" files and folders?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

<div>There are lots of options built into Windows to help you get out of this predicament:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Reboot the machine with your Windows Repair CD, then use System Restore to set Windows back by a few days (works only if you changed the password recently).</li><li>Log on under your spare admin account, then reset the password to your usual account (works only if you set up a spare admin account).</li><li>Log on as Administrator in Safe Mode, then reset the password to your usual account (the password is usually blank).</li><li>Insert your USB flash disk with the password keyfile (works only if you took the time to create such a keyfile).</li><li>Use the password hint (works only if you created a hint and if it is good enough to let you guess the password)</li><li>Check your paper records (works only if you jotted down the password somewhere)</li></ul>

    <title>Error 2203 - An internal error has occurred - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clarkey4boro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 2203 - An internal error has occurred</h2>
                    Every time I try and load up iTunes or any Microsoft Office 2007 program I get a message saying;<br />
<br />
Error 2203. An internal erro has occurred.<br />
(C:\Windows\Installer\19bbbb.ipi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -2147287035)<br />
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) for assistance.<br />
For information about how to contact PSS, see PSS10R.CHM<br />
<br />
The thing is, both programs have been on my computer, and working fine, for almost 2 years now, yet all of a sudden I am getting this problem. Whenever I click on an Office produce, e.g. word, it pops up "installing..." but i've already installed everything.<br />
<br />
I searched microsoft support but all the information I was getting was for XP or older, so they weren't relevant for me fixing it. Any help?

<p><span><span>Hi Clarkey4boro,</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We would like to get more information from you, to help troubleshoot your issue. Please answer the
 following questions as best you can.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>When was the last time it was working?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Do you remember making any changes to the computer recently?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>What is the version of Windows installed on the computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This error message is related to corruption in the Windows installer files on the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>First would suggest that you check if the Windows installer is turn on and is running.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click on start menu and type services.msc and in the list of services look for “Windows installer”
 and double click on it and check if the service set to “Manual and started”</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest that you uninstall all the products related to ITunes and Microsoft office application
 using the windows installer cleanup utility and later reinstall iTunes and Microsoft office application and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the below link and download the Windows Installer Cleanup Utility.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above steps does not fix the issue would suggest installing the latest version of Windows
 installer on the computer and check.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>The power supply for the Xbox One has a fan in it and it does require positioning to allow proper ventilation. If the power supply is excessively noisy you will need to request a repair/replacement from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Please see the link below fore more information on the power supply.</p>

<p>Hi OP-</p>
<p>The console's power supply (PSU) has a small cooling fan built into it- this is what you are hearing. If your Xbox One is turned on, you may be able to hear a slight audible humming sound coming from the PSU due to the fan. If you have your Xbox One configured
 to the "Instant On" power mode, the PSU fan will remain on, which explains your issue. If the room you're in is quiet enough you can definitely hear it.</p>
<p>As gds pointed out in the post above mine- if it gets REALLY loud you have a problem. Check the link that he posted.</p>

<p>Use the software that came with the web cam, it should have a video function on it, with record and save to file.</p>
<p>FYI the answers are better when you supply more details, ie web cam type, any software given with web cam etc.</p>

These were related to netio.sys and were caused by your McAfee.&nbsp; I would remove it and use the built in defender<br />

<h2>            Xbox Keeps asking for email and password at startup</h2>
                    
<p>So I signed in as I usually do today and received a message that the Xbox needed to confirm my email address and password.&nbsp; So I do so and it claims that either my password is incorrect or my email does not have a membership.&nbsp; Now I know these are both wrong
 so I go on to download my profile again.&nbsp; It all checks out without any issue but then when I log in again I get the same message again.&nbsp; This time I hit the middle button/the home button and I manage to get out of it and stay online.&nbsp; Basically I know at
 this point that my email is connected to a xbox live membership and that my password is correct.&nbsp; I even changed my password to see if that would solve the issue and its still giving me this issue at startup.&nbsp; So what's the problem here?&nbsp; Why do I keep getting
 this message when everything clearly checks out?</p>

<h2>            Why did CD&#47;DVD Rom stop recognizing disks.  Keeps asking to insert a disk evenwhile there is a disk inthere.   </h2>
                    After installing windows 7, Dell inspiron 530 desktop cd/dvd-rw rom does not recognize cd/dvds.&nbsp; I insert disks and nothing happens.&nbsp; When I click on the cd/dvd rom, it ejects and asks me to insert a disk even when there already is one in there.
<br />
<br />
I already uninstalled it the device driver, and rebooted.&nbsp; Still same error.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to fix?<br />
<br />
The only way I could use a disk is by using an external drive and it worked, so I know its not the disk that's bad.
<br />

<h2>            After recent update in Windows 10 AMD Radeon graphics driver is causing BSOD errors.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: AMD Radeon driver messed up after latest upgrade</p>
<p>
</p><p>On 1/13/2016 my computer did a forced upgrade. I already had upgraded from windows 8.1 to Windows 10 and you can imagine my distress when I leave the room only to come back to my computer upgrading like it did when I upgraded to windows 10. Well after dealing
 with that for 2 hours, when it booted up I got an error message about how a license cannot be found. I also one morning got a message about needing a 32 bit driver or something. I have the AMD RADEON R4 Graphics the processor is the AMD A6-6310 APU with AMD
 Radeon R4 Graphics and the system is Windows 10 64-bit. When I right-clicked the little radeon settings icon in my taskbar, I got a BSOD and was told on it that a thread was stuck or something. What can I do to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the auto detect tool from AMD I have the latest driver.<br />

<li><span>What is the exact error message you are getting?</span></li><li><span>Did you try starting the PC in Safe mode and check if similar issue persists?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may be facing the above issue due to the incompatible graphics driver installed on Windows 10 operating system.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong><span>I suggest you to Login into safe mode and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: L</span></strong><span>ogging into Safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Safe mode</span></strong><span> is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows.
 The words <strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear at the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Expand the options to boot into
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>:</span></p>

<strong>Safe mode</strong> and start the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
