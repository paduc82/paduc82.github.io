<p>If you are looking for a clan with thousands of members where you are just a number we're probably not for you. &nbsp;If you are looking for a clan managed by 15 year-olds who assign you to some kind of "brigade" depending on the skill you exhibit during a "tryout"
 we're probably not for you.</p>
<p>However, if you're looking for a relatively small (i.e., approx. 30 active members) community of gamers who have been around since 2002 and who are much more interested in getting to know you as a person than judging you by your skill level you might consider
 giving us a shot. &nbsp;Our members range in age from 16-41 years old. &nbsp;Many of our members are college educated and/or past/present military. &nbsp;We are a cohesive group who care about each other and are always on the lookout for a few additional people to join us.
 &nbsp;Come by, check out our forums, and throw in an app if you think you'd be a good fit. &nbsp;We're all looking forward to gaming it up with you.</p>
<p>See you on the battlefield....</p>

<h2>            How to Disable Defender Security Center Battery Health Report</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the&nbsp;Windows 10 Creators Update Defender Security Center, under 'Device Performance and Heath' I have a yellow triangle next to 'Battery Health' (please see image below). Is there a way to ignore or disable this? I am happy with the current settings, and
 do not want to change them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I just want to know if there is a way to disable this message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But to answer your questions;</p>
<p>1. Yes, I have restarted. 2. I have made no hardware or software changes to the computer. This has been going on since I installed the Creators Update. 3. I have clicked the notification and it brings me to the places to change the settings. 4. I have looked
 in the Windows Defender Security Center settings, and&nbsp;if I make the changes it recommends the messages go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Other Info/ Venting Frustrations:</p>
<p>I have 4 Windows 10 laptop computers in my household 2 of witch are set up as desktop replacements. They all have the Creators Update, and this message. I&nbsp;<strong>do not</strong>&nbsp;want my settings the way Microsoft recommends. I like my back-light to be at
 full brightness and the screen on all the time. In my opinion settings like that should be adjusted on a per computer bases depending on how it is used and how the customer wants the computer to look, like your background image or start menu pin locations/
 sizes.</p>

            Similar issue that since 1703 update, when the&nbsp; night lite is activated, Defender health report (battery) indicates screen rightness is at 100% when it is actually only at 60% and recommends reducing brightness to improve battery life. The triangle with
 yellow exclamation point is displayed in system tray.<br />

            Same problem here. I have my settings the way I want them. Turn off this crap that keeps telling me about my batter life. With my settings I can work and entire day on battery and not have an problem. I don't need Microsoft telling me to change my settings
 every few days and have no way to turn off these stupid notifications.

                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like the option in Windows 10 that you can make the Start Menu bigger in width, but at once (probally since an update) I simply can not resize it anymore in width, now only in height. Is there a fix for that?<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you suspect that the issue has occurred after the Windows update, I would request you to perform a System Restore to an earlier date and then check if it helps.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Right-click (or press and hold) the Start button, and then select
<strong><span>Control Panel</span>. </strong></p>
</li><li>
<p>Search <span>Control Panel</span> for <span>
Recovery</span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <strong><span>Recovery</span> &gt; <span>
Open System Restore</span> &gt; <span>Next</span>.</strong> </p>
</li><li>
<p>Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select
<strong><span>Next</span> &gt; <span>Finish</span>.</strong></p>
</li></ol>
<p>Please revert if you cannot resize the start menu. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

<p>The fact that it's a dual-core processor is largely irrelevant. But 2GB of RAM is a tiny amount, and a 160GB HD is very small. Windows 10 should run on such a configuration, but its performance is likely to be terrible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And with such an old computer, there's a good chance that you might have other incompatibilities, and that needed Windows 10 drivers for some of the hardware isn't available.</p>

                    I have&nbsp;3 vista systems one 64bit and&nbsp;two 32bit,&nbsp;one 32bit and one 64bit are having the&nbsp;problems with a high number of taskeng.exe processes (over 500 to be exact).&nbsp;The total number of processes run any where from 450 to 701. The taskeng uses anywhere from
 372k to 1468k. There are time when I can't open an internet window because of so many processes. Is it normal to have that many processes with vista and is it normal to have that many taskeng.exe processes running? If it is not normal how can I fix the problem.

            You can always disable the services for task scheduler if the maleware scan did not work.<br />
http://forums.techarena.in/operating-systems/1124908.htm<br />
or you can do it yourself<br />
1. From the Start Menu, type task scheduler.<br />
2. Right-click on task scheduler and select Run as Administrator. Accept the UAC prompt.<br />
3. The Task Scheduler console will come up. In its menu, select View/Show Hidden Tasks.<br />
and see what the problem(s) are

    <title>How to use ICC profiles in the WCS system-wide&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n.rohwer  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to use ICC profiles in the WCS system-wide&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everybody,</p>
<p>while trying to understand the WCS (Windows Color System) I noticed several issues. Some of them might be intentional, while others might not be:</p>
<p>- Windows-generated profiles for monitor calibration do (at least on my system) not conform to ICC-standard.</p>
<p>- Such profiles contain all relevant transformation data ONLY within the MS00-tag. There is no redundant copy/original in the appropriate tags specified by the ICC.</p>
<p>- Such profiles can be applied system-wide to all color output to the display device, while ICC-conform profiles without the MS00-tag can only be used in certain programs such as the "Windows Photo Viewer".</p>
<p>Is it possible to use externally generated ICC profiles for monitor calibration (system-wide, not for single applications) under Windows 7? Do they have to contain the MS00-tag?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>N Rohwer</p>

            Hey steve!
<div><br />
<div>Too bad that you had to switch back to Windows 8....</div>
<div><br />
<div>But i Got my problem fixed!!!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>All you had to do is to first uninstall &amp; then re install the Conexant Audio drivers which you can get from your drivers folder in your laptop.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then after that, go to control panel--&gt;Sound--&gt;in that set your speakers as your default device &amp; same for the headset too when plugged in.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then you will see everything will be working just fine!!!!!!!!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>All the best!!!!!!&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Failure configuring updates after reboot and sometimes error 80070643 on initial install</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 SP1 Ultimate x64</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently I cannot install the following 3 updates: KB2660649, KB2676562, KB2690533.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically I get the "failure configuring updates, reverting changes" error on startup.&nbsp; Sometimes if I try to install right after that then I get the 80070643.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>- Installing 1 at a time and pulling them from the download center.</p>
<p>- every "fix it" I have found, including the built in one for windows and the one with the "run aggressive options" checkbox.</p>
<p>- stopping wuauserv and renaming C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution folder.</p>
<p>- clean boot -&gt; resulted in the same "failure configuring updates, reverting changes" error.</p>
<p>- SFC.exe /SCANNOW</p>
<p>- The System update readiness tool for Win7 x64 <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20858" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its too late to run a system restore because I don't have an old enough image left now :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the CBS log I see mostly CBS_E_INVALID_PACKAGE.&nbsp; </p>

.net cleanup tool</a>&nbsp;and re-installing .NET.&nbsp; It's obviously related to windows installer because I also recieved the same error code (643) when trying to uninstall VS

I ran the .NET cleanup tools, re-installed 3.5 and 4.0.&nbsp; I was able to install the updates for .NET, but as soon as I get to those 3 updates I have started failing again (whether using WU or going to the download center):
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On different attempts I get different errors in the WindowsUpdate log.</p>

            I flattened the OS.&nbsp; But its funny you should ask because I was looking at the permissions on C:\Windows and they did not look correct.&nbsp; (System was missing).&nbsp;&nbsp;I took&nbsp;ownership of the folder and re-added&nbsp;System.&nbsp; I was still not able to successfully install.

<br />
It says: Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing. (Code 39)</p>
<p>Click 'Check for solutions' to send data about this device to Microsoft and to see if there is a solution available.<br />
<br />
When i say update, it says that the latest version is already installed and when i ask for a solution nothing happens it just sends a report.<br />
<br />
I dont know if i need to delete the driver and install a new one, or whether i have no hope of fixing it and need to take it to the shop to get repaired. Also i&nbsp;have no idea where i can get the driver&nbsp;for Windows Vista as i have looked.<br />

<h2>            How to have mute videos in a slideshow from windows 10 app &#39;Photos&#39;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>In the Windows 10 app 'Photos', there is a slideshow mode. In the slideshow mode, how do you display videos with no sound? I would like just the video to show, not the sound to play, because I will have music playing over it. I can't just mute the overall
 sound on my computer, I need a way that the photos app will not play any of the sound for the videos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Santtu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you aren't able to boot to Windows due to the Boot Error, <strong>
0xc000014c</strong>. We would suggest trying out the troubleshooting steps listed below and then check if it will resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Insert the installation media and then check if the following suggestion helps to find out if the boot manager is missing although chances are less for this kind of situation.<br />
2. Follow this path: <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced Options</strong> &gt;<strong>Command Prompt</strong><br />
3. Please enter the following command line to check the disk partition for errors:
<strong>chkdsk/f /r X:( drive letter)</strong></p>
<p>4. Then please try the following command lines to rebuild the BCD store:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>CMD&gt; bootrec /scanos</strong><br />
<strong>CMD&gt; bootrec /rebuildbcd</strong><br />
<strong>CMD&gt; bootrec /fixmbr</strong><br />
<strong>CMD&gt; bootrec /fixboot</strong><br />
<br />

<p>Thank you for your fast response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I regret to inform you, that i cant acces command prompt, at all, because the original error keeps coming up before installation media starts up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant access any of the options that come with the installation media, because i havent gotten to that part yet. Like i said on my original comment, i dont have a installation of any windows on the HDD/SSD and none of my installation medias work. Im trying
 to perform a clean install on a new hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to replace SSD with a formatted HDD but i run into same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>The error... </p>

<p>
</p><p>You might go into the Boot Options at the POST screen and look for a "USB Flash" and\or a "UEFI USB Flash" and see if one will work...</p>
<p>

    <title>Personal programs uninstalling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> enachos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Personal programs uninstalling</h2>
                    <p>I am sick and tired of windows 10 uninstalling my software. &nbsp;Every time I login, something else needs to be re-installed. &nbsp;Tonight, after not booting into windows for two days (because I now run Linux as my primary OS, due to the ridiculousness that is microsoft)
 - my firewall and anti-virus were uninstalled (again!!!), along with my screen capture software. &nbsp;This has been going on since Windows 10 was introduced, and I am sick of it. &nbsp;This happens with random software, at random times - and never happened before with
 the same exact software in windows 8.1 and windows 7! &nbsp;The friends I game with (I can only game on windows due to the games I play), have received similar results with this piece of garbage OS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix for this, some setting I need to apply, or do I just need to deal with and accept this bottom of the barrel product that seems to be attempting to control the things I want to do with MY computer?</p>

<p>I am positive it is not my Linux OS messing with my Windows drive, I do not have it auto-mounted upon booting into Linux, nor do I mount it while in Linux - therefore Linux cannot access it. &nbsp;I prefer my third party anti-virus/firewall/screen capture software
 over built-in microsoft apps, such as the generic screen capture method mentioned. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>This example was just the recent iteration of the problem. &nbsp;It was just those two pieces of software this time. &nbsp;Last time, it was a few apps I use while gaming, such as Roccat Power Grid, and FreePie for my VR headset. &nbsp;Before that, the ones I noticed missing
 were the Intel Turbo Boost Max software, and Firefox. &nbsp;Every time it happens, it is different software that is completely un-installed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find any mention of any actions in the Event Logs either, that coincide with the missing programs. &nbsp;Errors, warnings, etc, that are in the viewer have nothing to do with the missing programs.</p>

<h2>            Updating Drivers for Ipod Classic 160gb &#38; Iphone 4 Error Installing Updates</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've spent $39 dollars to Apple to try and fix the issue of my Iphone 4 and Ipod Classic 160gb by adding a device, uninstalling and reinstalling and reparing hardware devices and still get error. I want to use iTunes as i'm a radio dj and want to upload
 my&nbsp;latest podcasts. I was told by apple that my Windows 8 was a Microsoft problem with this issue. I tried to ring Microsoft at 9:30am yesterday morning only to say that they are receiving high volume calls and would ring me back during the day. I couldn't
 wait all day and been working on my iTunes trying to get that software to work, also devices manager for Apple products. Also I get continuously a blank screen when loading up windows 8 and Microsoft troubleshooted this and I have to sign out and sign back
 in again for desktop.</p>
<p><br />
Cheers,<br />
Chris Carragher</p>

<h2>            Caps lock indicator not working.</h2>
                    I recently was messing around in the msconfig and services.msc trying to streamline some things. I also switched the desktop to basic but switched back to an aero theme. Now the on screen pop up indicator for the caps lock is no longer working. I have
 no idea of what the status of the caps lock is without it, as there is none on the keyboard. How do I get this back on?

<br />
Hi<br />
<br />
I believe the popup text message for the Caps Lock key is an item that is installed by the computer manufacturer. Check the computer documentation or ask the computer maker about this.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

You can do this by going to your "Settings" &gt; "Display and Sound" &gt; "Volume" &gt; "Party Chat Output" &gt; and set it to either "Speakers" or "Headset and Speakers". That way the audio will play over the TV stereos.

                    why can't my windows 7 computer connect to my VHP computer, even though communication is possible in the other direction? Never had a problem with the network until I upgraded. Now file-sharing is possible from the VHP computer but the Windows 7 machine
 just comes up with an error message that it recognises the the VHP machine as a file sharing source but can't connect to it. No amount of troubleshooting works.

 doing that because sometimes I forget and then it runs all night long. &nbsp;I have ran a powercfg request via command prompt and pasted the results below:</p>

</p><p>I believe this could be my problem but I have no clue how to fix it. &nbsp;I've exhausted all my options as far as cleaning up the HDD to no avail. &nbsp;When I restart the machine and run the prompt everything returns 'None' but it still will not sleep. &nbsp;I give it
 10-15 minutes and run the prompt again and I get what I posted above. &nbsp;Any thoughts? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found a solution to this problem and a few more problems I was having in 10. &nbsp;I did a clean install and it seemed to take care of my problems and my machine is now running as fast as it should be. &nbsp;This was not an ideal solution though. &nbsp;It is very
 time intensive. &nbsp;You need to backup all your files and make a list of your programs(apps) to download/reinstall afterwards. &nbsp;I also ran into the infinite restart loop issue that was happening to some people after one of the updates they pushed out. &nbsp;I had
 to create my own iso disc to fix it. &nbsp;It was a major hassle. &nbsp;I'll give a little more detail as to the process I went through:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In settings go to 'Update and Recovery' then click on the option to 'Reset this PC'. &nbsp;The wizard will give you the option to keep all your personal files but I would strongly suggest doing a backup before this in case you run into problems with this process
 like I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. At this point my machine reset but when it tried to come back on it was sent into the restart loop I mentioned above. &nbsp;If this happens you can fix it by following the links provided on this thread:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-10-start-up-error-inaccessiblebootdevice/cb7cf8bb-6915-4fff-be49-0873bb926e26">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-10-start-up-error-inaccessiblebootdevice/cb7cf8bb-6915-4fff-be49-0873bb926e26</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. After creating a repair disc I did a completely fresh install on my HDD, which means I let it delete all my personal files in addition to programs/apps. &nbsp;The install worked and now it's like a completely new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The downside to this is that now I have to move all my files back from my backups and redownload/reinstall all my programs/apps. &nbsp;This can be a long process depending on how much stuff was on your computer to begin with, but my computer is now working like
 it was before I updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: &nbsp;I wanted to mention that if you do the reset you will no longer have the option to downgrade back to Windows 7 so that's something to keep in mind.</p>

<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows </strong>Key and type <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>
and click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>System and Security</strong>.</li><li>Select option <strong>Power</strong>.</li><li>Follow the ongoing instructions.</li></ul>
<p>Let us know if the issue still persists and we'll be glad to help.</p>

            I tried the troubleshooter already and it just suggested that I change my power plan settings. &nbsp;That did not work and it didn't find anything else wrong. &nbsp;I don't see why those settings would prevent it from sleeping when it is still set to sleep after
 a set time of inactivity regardless of whether it is in power saving or high performance. &nbsp;Also, it is a desktop, not a laptop, so there is really no need for it to be in power saving. &nbsp;I just want it to save power when nobody is using it.

<p>
</p><p>I don't use the command line that often, but have you tried changing the menu options via Settings, Power &amp; sleep?</p>

            Yes. &nbsp;I have been through all those settings numerous times. &nbsp;I've gone through the advanced settings as well and even through device manager to make sure all my hardware is set correctly. &nbsp;I'm seriously thinking of just downgrading back to 7. &nbsp;This is
 not the only problem I've encountered in 10 so far and Microsoft support is useless. &nbsp;

            I have both a laptop and a desktop that will no longer fall asleep on their own since the Win10 upgrade. I can put them to sleep. They both wake up fine. But they won't fall asleep on their own. Both were falling asleep as expected under Win 8.1. Troubleshooter
 finds nothing wrong. Very annoying.
