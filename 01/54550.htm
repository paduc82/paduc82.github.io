<h2>            Gmail taking priority over my MSN account in Windows Live.</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows Live Mail 2011 for all my email usage.&nbsp; I have a gmail account in my Live Mail application.&nbsp; My gmail account is becoming the sent address even when I use my msn account.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; send email using "myaccount.msn.com" and when it shows
 up in my "sent" folder the email from address has been changed to "myaccount.gmail.com" so anyone replying to my original email are sending the reply to the gmail account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My default log in account is my MSN account and that is what is being shown in my "from" field when composing an email.&nbsp; Once the email is sent and appears in my "Sent" folder, the sent email address has been changed to "myaccount.gmail.com" so anyone replying
 to my email is sending it to my gmail account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help this is driving me bats!</p>

            <p>Since the problem started I have tried the following:</p>
<p>Re-imaged the machine to Windows 7</p>
<p>reinstalled Windows 8</p>
<p>result: problem still existed.</p>
<p>deleted the gmail account on Google</p>
<p>deleted the gmail account on Windows Live</p>
<p>refreshed Windows 8</p>
<p>result:&nbsp; I haven't seen any further issue of the problem so this must mean that either the Google gmail was responsible or my local environment was the problem.&nbsp; Either way it appears to be gone but this is a dramatic way to fix a problem.&nbsp; Obviously, I
 lost a lot of email that was sent to the gmail account and have no way of getting it back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of the current situation, it would do no good to send you my email accounts as I don't want to resurrect the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

This is the first time that you've mentioned that this is on Windows 8. Why are you using WLMail 2011, which is only still available because WLMail 2012 won't run on Vista?</p>

            <p>Actually I was using WLMail 2011 until the re-image, refresh, etc.&nbsp; Now I'm using WLMail 2012 Version 2012 (Build 16.4.3505.0912).&nbsp; I guess the system doesn't know it can't run WLMail 2012 cause its working now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something important must have changed because in the past, if you tried to install a Microsoft program that wasn't compatible with the operating system you would get a message to that effect and it wouldn't install.&nbsp; Is Windows 8 not capable of policing
 software installations?</p>

            <p>I checked out the link from your message and it looks familiar.&nbsp; The system requirements show that Essentials will load 2012 version on a Windows 8 machine.&nbsp; Not sure how I got the 2011 version so can't help you find that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, at this point I can't reproduce the problem so don't guess there's much can be done to retrieve my lost mail at this point.&nbsp; However, thanks for your responses.&nbsp; Maybe next time...</p>

<h2>            USB Headset Cannot use to listen to web content </h2>
                    
<p>I cannot set my USB audio device Microsoft Lifechat to hear web content in Internet Explorer. It continues to use my default laptop speakers. I have changed the mixer over to use the headset but apparently ie8 is not assigned as a device so it still is using
 the speakers not the headset.</p>
<p>Usually on XP when you plugin a USB headset it then swaps to that device so you can use it. How can I listen to youotube etc with my USB headset on Windows 7?</p>

<p>i set the headset as default. I noticed however that the speakers had applications assosciated with it, however i could not assosciate any programs with my headsets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did solve it however by disbaling the laptop speakers in the control panel, this then forced win7 to use my usb headset, and it re-activated the speakers when I removed&nbsp; the&nbsp; usb headset. This is fine I guess just confusing when used to XP doing both actions
 for you.</p>

<h2>            Upgrade fail on Dell Inspirion 15 7537</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was updating to Windows 10 from 8.1 on my Dell laptop model 7537.</p>
<p>It is having a nvidia 750 graphic card.</p>
<p>Right after a reboot during the installation of Windows 10 the laptop got stuck after bios and nothing happensScreen becomes black.</p>
<p>I have seen it also in windows 8.1 while going back from sleep modes, sometimes it got stuck and black and does not recover.</p>
<p>I have heard trouble with intel and especially nvidia graphic together is troublesome.</p>
<p>So after 2 reboots windows re-installed win 8.1 again automatic.</p>
<p>Ok now back to win 8.1.</p>
<p>I was thinking ok if I update to latest nvidia driver that would make the computer not possible to boot beacuse I guess win 10 is using the latest driver. I installed latest nvidia driver on the nvidia webpage. Computer got stucked after reboot.</p>
<p>So I guess the win 10 is using a new driver which isn't compatible with Dell laptops.</p>
<p>If this is the case, is there anyway to install win 10 ?</p>
<p>

    <title>SSD&#92;HDD File Explorer Folder problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mojo418  say:</h3>
<h2>            SSD&#92;HDD File Explorer Folder problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I thought I had it right but now have 2 different locations for MY Library Folders and This PC (D:\ HDD). Both folders are showing D:\ storage drive but in File Explorer but have different location paths. One set was done through Settings &gt; System &gt;
 Storage The other was done by changing &nbsp;the location in&nbsp;properties&nbsp;tab from C:\ to D:\ This PC folders are D:\Users\Name but My Library folders are D:\Name Is this right? Or should all folders be D:\Users\Name?
</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you have made changes to the save locations for the new apps and music etc in the File explorer and hence it is showing the way as in the given screen shot above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"My Library folders are D:\Name" -&nbsp; Yes this is showing right as you have changed the locations for saving the files and applications in the settings app in Windows. Those files will not be under the D:\Users\Name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the save locations are manually changed it would be done directly going into the user location and hence this would show as D:\Name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps regarding the File Explorer locations and folders. Keep us posted to help you better.</p>

 there are no pictures etc., how can we have trust &nbsp;in any of our mail being delivered correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same thing happened on another message 2 days ago - no attachments etc. just a reply to another incoming mail. &nbsp;MS put the symbol in why can't they tell us what it means!!</p>

</p><p>I will continue to copy all emails from the Microsoft mail client to my yahoo address for a few more weeks, hopefully this was a one time shot.&nbsp; However due to the "I don't know what that means" factor to the red X, I have to continue to rely on my yahoo.com

            Inconvenient for Windows 10 Mail without a legend, but it seems to indicate&nbsp;blinding the parties within conversation&nbsp;with your&nbsp;forwarding it onto someone else without them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 10 Mail uses conversation format but needs to indicate particulary those
 messages&nbsp;excluding.&nbsp; Therefore, the&nbsp;circled&nbsp;red X.&nbsp; &nbsp;

    <title>Problem with my computer slowing down signifigantly. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericwatterson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with my computer slowing down signifigantly.</h2>
                    <p>I have a 2009 dell studio 1558 running&nbsp; 64 bit windows 7. Specs are 500gb hard drive,&nbsp;Intel Core&nbsp;i3 CPU&nbsp;and 4gb of RAM. I recently upgraded to a 1tb hard drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;While watching a video on rollingstone.com the cpu slows down to the point of being unusable
 &amp; I am forced to restart it. Even after the video is finished the cpu is still super slow &amp; unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>***** I have very&nbsp;few programs installed on my cpu*****</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to speedtest.net and wrote down the results. I ran the test twice before the slow down &amp; three times after the slow down. Here are the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the slow down:</p>
<p>Download: 20.70/18.87</p>
<p>Upload: 13.05/12.86</p>
<p>Ping: 11/12</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the slow down:</p>
<p>Download: 16.07/9.24/3.88</p>
<p>Upload: 8.44/11.11/9.38</p>
<p>Ping: 14/107/80</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the slow down was occurring I opened up task manager and saw that at some points the amount of free&nbsp;memory space available was going as low as 1mb available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that the lack of memory available while watching the video&nbsp;signifigantly slows down the upload &amp; download speeds? If so, is that the cause of my cpu slowing down to a crawl?&nbsp; Would upgrading to 8 gb of Ram solve this problem? Any particular
 brand of RAM recommended?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You &amp; I really appreciate any input you can provide.</p>

            The Jury has reached a verdict. The answer was simply changing my web browser from the god awful IE to Google Chrome! No more freezing, error messages, (there is a long running script), there is no longer any slowdown, before my ul &amp; dl #'s slowed down

<p>Why do you think it is the firewall? What is the error message you are seeing? There are a number of reasons why a file would not download, rarely the firewall.</p>

    <title>Xbox One Spazzing out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hydek oo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Spazzing out</h2>
                    
<p>Ok i don't know if this has been a recurring issue with others but recently my Xbox Ones has been ejecting the disk by itself. This happens a lot while it is off and sometimes I even heard the sound of it ejecting but nothing ejects even though there is
 a game inside it or when there isn't a game inside it still makes the same noise and not the noise telling you nothing is inside. It gets really annoying because this turns my console on and sometimes i am not home or asleep and it is left on. I know i can
 turn that feature off but that's not the point of this. I am wondering why it is doing this and how can i fix this. It started happening after the recent update. Please help!!!</p>

<p>PS i have disconnected and have done a hard restarted and that does not work.</p>

<p>The sensors on the Xbox One are similar to those on the slim 360's., and anything that can bridge a small ectromagnetic gap can trigger the switch. &nbsp;On a small piece of paper towel, spray some glass cleaner (mild and non-damaging.) &nbsp;Power down and unplug
 your console, and gently wipe over the eject 'button'. &nbsp;Dry it with a separate piece of paper towel, and make sure any oils and smudges are free from the area. &nbsp;Be careful not to get any cleaning liquid in the dvd slot, and do NOT spray glass cleaner directly
 on to the console.</p>
<p>You actually should use rubbing alcohol instead of glass cleaner, but I've found many don't have it in the house, and glass cleaner is an adequate substitute.</p>

<p>This error usually means that you have a few failed sends under your belt. Remove any unsent messages from the outbox (below the account folders in the folder pane).</p>

<p>Roadrunner (TWC) doesn't support SSL for SMTP. Right-click on the account name and select
<em>Properties</em>. On the <em>Servers</em> tab, ensure that <em>My server requires authentication</em> is selected. On the
<em>Advanced</em> tab, deselect <em>This server requires a secure connection (SSL)</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you've made these changes, close down Windows Live Mail and wait a few minutes for the program to do its housekeeping and store the new settings. Re-launch the program, then compose a new test message and send it to yourself. Post any new error message
 in your reply: you can click on it to select it, then use right-click to copy it and paste it into your reply. This avoids typos, which can be critical.</p>

<h2>            No sound from external speakers when using HDMI connection.</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Microsoft,<br />
<br />
I am using HDMI connection to connect my newly built desktop PC to my LCD TV. &nbsp;The audio works perfectly fine&nbsp;when uses the&nbsp;TV speakers. Unfortunately when I&nbsp;plug the&nbsp;external speakers' cable&nbsp;into the line&nbsp;out socket, there&nbsp;are no sound from the external speakers.
 I have checked&nbsp;all&nbsp;applicable&nbsp;connections from the speakers to PC and&nbsp;disable Digital Audio (HDMI)&nbsp;but still not able to work. Under the Sounds, video and game controllers of Device Manager, I am only able to see High Definition Audio Device. Is this correct?
 Under such circumstances, how can I resolve this issue?<br />
<br />
For your kind advise asap please.<br />
<br />
Sincerely thank you.<br />

<p><span><span><span>Hi Garreth83,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>HDMI cables do support audio signals, but not all HDMI-enabled video cards support audio.
 If your HDTV has an audio input, you might be able to connect a separate audio cable from your computer's sound card directly to the TV. Otherwise, you'll need to connect the audio signal to a different output device, such as external computer speakers or
 your home stereo system.</span></span></span></p>

 is not blocking it because it was open on the 20th but now its closed for some reason.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/db87ae0d-c037-45fe-a466-e02332e58026" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2640da9d-2181-43a9-9af3-7980fe561722" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb14682f-4585-4ec0-a8b5-9873491f843f" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d4f21c3-380c-474a-a22c-422a61f37249" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f4c01ff-d5e8-4494-8576-e676e93ac218" />

<br />
I wondered about your mention that it had worked for you previously since OO does block Port 80.&nbsp; That might not be relevant if you are trying to access Apache from computers on your LAN only.&nbsp; Is that the case?<br />

<h2>            Missing CD Drive and Audio Output. Compaq Pressario V600</h2>
                    Hi All<br />
<br />
Need some help with my daughters Compaq Presario V600 Laptop. It was working perfectly until recently and over night lost both the CD/DVD drive and sound card
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thedvdforums.com%2fforums%2fimages%2fsmilies%2fsad.gif" />
<br />
<br />
I have searched around and tried all sorts of fixes from looking in device manager to delete the cd drive and then re-booting the PC (but there is no CD/DVD listed anywhere in Device manager) I have tried deleting the upper and lower filters in the registry
 (courtesy of Microsoft) but does nothing. According to both device manager manager and searching through the PC there is no CD/DVD or audio output device installed
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thedvdforums.com%2fforums%2fimages%2fsmilies%2fshrug.gif" /> Tried booting in Safe mode to look for drivers...still nothing<br />
<br />
I have looked at the HP/Compaq site for drivers and DL the audio driver and installed it, still nothing...really don't know where to turn. Anyone able to help? My daughter dropped it into a PC repair shop who said it was one of those things with Compaq lap
 tops.....<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thedvdforums.com%2fforums%2fimages%2fsmilies%2fxyxthumbs.gif" />
<br />
<br />
Edit. One thing that happens, there is no sound at all and clicking on the speaker in the tool bar gets a message saying no output audio device installed..however every now and then it lets off a very high pitched squeak...

<p><span>Hi Bravoman352,</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><strong><span>System Restore</span></strong><span>: Perform system restore to put the computer's system files to an
 earlier point in time.</span></p>
<p><span>Look for the steps mentioned in the link below.<br />
</span><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/What-is-System-Restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/What-is-System-Restore</span></a>
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
<span>&nbsp;</span>You may follow the steps provided in the link below by HP</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;docname=c00817052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;docname=c00817052</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Check in the BIOS (basic input output system), if the devices are disabled.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may want restore the default BIOS settings, Please check with the computer manufacturer before you attempt this step.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> Modifying BIOS/complementary
 metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications
 of the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, please contact HP for more help</span></p>

<h2>            ATI HD 3000 problems with WDDM 1.3</h2>
                    <p>Hi. Recently I attatched a second monitor to my computer. The first monitor is plugged into a Radeon HD 7870, and I plugged the second monitor into my motherboard. With the internal graphics set as the primary monitor, everything was working, and the resolutions
 were both correct</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I started having a problem opening different programs, Skype, and a few games on Steam. I managed to fix this by installing the 'Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Graphics Adapter WDDM1.3 - AMD Radeon HD 7800 Series</p>
<p>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Graphics Adapter WDDM1.3 software update released in July, 2014'</p>
<p>
</p><p>However after I install this I get two problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The second monitor isnt the correct resolution, and there are only 3 available resolutions to choose from</p>
<p>2. In Device manager, error code 43 appears for ATI 3000, which I fix by uninstalling and scanning for hardware changes. After this I'm back to the original problem of not being able to open certain programs</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm quite confused and appreciate any help</p>

<h2>            Your Console is connected to the internet but can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t contact Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys, I'm hoping someone can help.</p>
<p>My Xbox, which has been connected reliably to Live for years, has suddenly refused to connect to Live with the following error (during the testing process);</p>
<p>'Your Console is connected to the internet but can't contact Xbox Live'</p>
<p>I have reset all the equipment on my network numerous times without result. I have also reset the network settings to factory default on the Xbox but no luck there either.</p>
<p>My Xbox is wired, but I've removed the ethernet cable and connected to my wireless network, with the same 'Your Console is connected to the internet but can't contact Xbox Live' result.</p>
<p>Adding to the mystery is that I have a second Xbox on the same wired network and it can connect without any issues.</p>
<p>I have all the recommended ports open btw, and Live service status (in Australia) reports as all good.</p>
<p>If anyone can offer a brilliant bit of advice it's be much appreciated!</p>

<p>Thanks for the response, here's the details you've requested.</p>
<p>Network settings are set to 'automatic'.</p>
<p>I have entered the following port numbers into the port forwarding panel of my router;</p>
<ul>
<li>Port 88 (UDP) </li><li>Port 3074 (UDP and TCP) </li><li>Port 53 (UDP and TCP) </li><li>Port 80 (TCP) </li></ul>
<p>These numbers have been there for some time and the xbox has been able to connect to LIVE happily for years. Another Xbox on the same network continues to work perfectly.</p>
<p>________________________________________</p>
<p>What Country/State/Province do you live in? Victoria, Australia.</p>
<p>Modem brand &amp; model number: &nbsp;Motorola SB5101</p>
<p>Router brand &amp; model number: Netgear RP614v3</p>
<p>Things you have tried: Resetting all network equipment. Resetting network settings on Xbox to factory default. Disconnecting Ethernet cable and connecting via existing wifi network. I have another Xbox on the same wired network that connects without problems.</p>
<p>Is UPnP Enabled? Yes/no/Unknown. Yes.</p>
<p>Do you have a NAT error? If so, what is your NAT? No error.</p>
<p>Any Error Codes you encounter: No codes, only "your console is connected to the internet but can't contact Xbox LIVE"</p>
<p>Who is your ISP(Internet Service Provider)? Telstra Bigpond Cable</p>
<p>After you run "Test Xbox LIVE connection" press “Y” for "More Info”. In the pop-up that appears, what are the following values, if shown? (If a value below does not appear for you, just leave it blank.)</p>
<p>W:</p>

<p><span>UPnP conflicts with Port Forwarding. Suggest disabling UPnP.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, <strong><em>the order and timing of these steps is important to success</em></strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>1) turn off the Xbox then</span></p>
<p><span>2) unplug power from the Netgear</span></p>
<p><span>3) unplug power from the Motorola</span></p>
<p><span>4) Wait at least 5 minutes then replug the Motorola power.</span></p>
<p><span>5) Wait 'til the light on the front of the Motorola which says BROADBAND, ONLINE, READY, or CABLE &nbsp;is on solid (not flashing), then plug in the Netgear.</span></p>
<p><span>6) Wait until the WiFi light on the Netgear is on; you may not use WiFi, but it's still a good indicator your router is finished booting up.</span></p>
<p><span>7) Turn on the Xbox and retest.</span></p>

<p>I'm currently having this problem. I've tried everything suggested in this thread, but it's still not working. Xbox live is having a problem right now but I don't know if that is what is keeping me from connecting to xbox live. I have signed into xbox live
 on my computer and there are friends signed into xbox live, so xbox live isn't completely down.</p>

<h2>            the DVD&#47;CD player in my PC is having a problem playing my CD&#39;s</h2>
                    <p>"<span>Device: The DVD/CD Player in my HP Pavilion 20 "All-in-One" PC/ Windows 8.1 is not playing the CD. It keeps trying to correct itself but then eventually stops</span>"<span>‎</span><span>‏. This problem started a while back, maybe 4 months ago. I noticed
 that every once in awhile I would put in a CD to download onto my iTunes, the built in player would be detected on ITunes and I would prompt to pick and choose the songs I wanted in my iTunes library and would click on the 1 song on the CD and the player would
 try to play the song put couldn't. It kept trying to correct itself and&nbsp;eventually would correct the problem&nbsp;and start playing.&nbsp; This problem from then until now. The issue started becoming more frequent&nbsp;became to that the player wouldn't play them at all
 but it continued to try to correct itself&nbsp; until it just eventually gave up, if I waited that long and I would manually eject the CD.&nbsp;This problem&nbsp;only occurred&nbsp;to certain CD's but some CD's would have no problem at all.&nbsp;The CD player&nbsp;would never accept the
 CD's with the issue. Now, it is to the point to where it will won't&nbsp;play any of my CD's at all. I, at times wait until it gives up trying to play the CD&nbsp;and I manually eject, most of the time I eject while its trying and trying, I have become frustrated and
 without any more patience. I have stopped trying as of yesterday, 06/03/15. ALL Properties say "This Device Is Working Properly"... When it is not. Which leads me to believe this might be an easier fix than not. I really NEED to know What Happened? How Did
 This Happen?&nbsp;&nbsp;And How do I&nbsp;Prevent This From Happening in the Future? I've&nbsp;ran multiple&nbsp;"Troubleshooting's" with no luck.&nbsp;Sometimes I feel like I've done something wrong, broken some rule, or something and HP or Microsoft or BING/Google&nbsp;is in&nbsp;my computer&nbsp;shutting
</span>things<span>&nbsp;down. Listen to this, My Photo App was messed up and wouldn't open and when I finally figured how to fix that issue,&nbsp;once opened, I couldn't edit my photos. &nbsp;I couldn't access my photos in Windows "This PC - Pictures" They were all turned
 into the PhotoApp Icon and were&nbsp;locked and only&nbsp;had a quick blink when double clicked on and wouldn't open.&nbsp;&nbsp;My printer all of a sudden had its Spooler shut off... I'm mean REALLY?!! And then I find out that my Norton Security was disabled as well. &nbsp;All in
 the same day!! It took over a week to get out of that mess. Having to eventually uninstall Windows 8.1 and reinstalled, Along with a few apps!&nbsp;HOW does that Happen?&nbsp; I was editing a few of my Photos... that's it. &nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Xbox one soms zwart scherm en geen audio voor 2-3 seconden</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo beste gamers,</p>

<p>Heb de xb1 nu ongeveer 1-2 weken maar heb af en toe onder het gamen dat ik voor 2-3 seconden zwart scherm en geen audio meer heb</p>
<p>Ik heb een Phillips tv die 1080p ondersteunt dus dat zou het probleem niet moeten zijn</p>
<p>Ligt dit probleem aan een fout in de xbox zelf of misschien een fout in de instellingen (denk niet dat het aan de tv ligt want met tv kijken gebeurt dit nooit</p>
<p>hoop dat er snel iemand de gouden oplossing post</p>
<p><br />
Alvast bedankt voor de tips, hulp, en ideeën</p>
<p>Groet,</p>
<p>MoHxNICKxNL</p>

<h2>            Is my computer updating to the latest Windows 10 build&#63;</h2>
                    As of today (30th January 2016) I have Windows 10 (Build 10240). I have noticed via googling that build&nbsp;10586.3 appears to be available. If this is so why isnt my computer updating to the newer build? I have windows update set to automatic and have also
 tried it manually. I did have a problem with my display drivers about 3 months ago and so tried a windows 10 reset which failed with errors etc so perhaps that has something to do with it.

            <p>Does this do a clean install or is there an option to keep files and folders and programs installed?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if i do a new installation i assume i will be asked for a product key. I upgraded from Windows 8.1 so do i use that product key? Is there anywhere on windows 10 where i can see what the product key is now before doing a new install?</p>

            <p>The only antivirus i have is windows defender. I just tried turning it off and checking for updates but it didn't find any except for new updates for windows defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of months ago windows updated to the newer build of windows 10. For some reason one of my displays didn't work after the updates so i did a system restore to an earlier point. The system restore did not go smoothly. I think this system restore may
 have caused some software corruption.</p>

            None of the above have solved the problem.&nbsp; Candy Crush freezes every time a new round is going to start and also displays sporadic messages of api error.&nbsp; Also since going to win 8.1 the windows store keeps popping up on its own at random times.

            For you to get better help and for others to get help with their issues it is better to stay in one related thread or to start your own. I replied to a similar message of yours in a different thread. Reply there let me know what the result is

            <p><span>José,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue can be caused due to third-party application conflict or corrupted system files. I would suggest you to try these steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Boot the computer in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Safe mode</strong></a><strong> </strong>and check if the issue persists. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode then perform a
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>clean boot</strong></a> to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After troubleshooting, see the section “<strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong>” to return the computer to
 a <strong>Normal startup</strong> mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow these steps and run the
<strong>System Maintenance</strong> troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/where-is-control-panel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Control panel</strong></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click on
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click
<strong>View all</strong> on the left pane of the screen.</span></p>
<p><span>d. In the list of options, click on
<strong>System Maintenance</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click
<strong>Next</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Keep us posted.</span></p>
