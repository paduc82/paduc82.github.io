<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>First, make sure you have installed the latest drivers for your sound card.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try these steps and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Right click on the volume icon on the taskbar and select playback devices.<br />
2. Under playback tab, right click on speakers.<br />
3. Click on the enhancement tab.<br />
4. Uncheck <strong>Disable all enhancement</strong> if it is not checked.<br />
5. Now check the following options: <strong>Bass Boost | Loudness Equalization</strong>.<br />
6. You can also check either <strong>Virtual Surround</strong> or <strong>Room Correction</strong>, only one can be checked at one time.<br />
7. Click on Apply and then click Ok.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Connection to My Samsung LED40 Smart TV</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the newest Surface Pro and trying to connect to my Samsung LED40 Smart TV and can't get the two devices to connect. If I go into the TV's settings and search for devices I can find my SP in the available connecions but can't get it to connect. I've
 also tried the creen mirror mode which is all I want to do. I then start the screen mirroring search on the TV and come back to my SP10 and enter into settings "Home" then hit "Devices" and click on the "+" at the top of the devices box in the centre of the
 screen. I then select the add wireless device and hit search. My SP is then able to find my TV and I then hit the connect option. After a few seconds I get the following message "<span>Couldn't Connect" in bright yellow. How can I fix this as it is
 sending me crazy. Thanks</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Have you ever used that TV successfully before on that W10?&nbsp; If so, before trying to add it you should look down in the Audio and Wireless display sections to see if it is already there, then Remove all related parts of it first.&nbsp; It seems the other one
 is an earlier instance that is enough different from the new one that it can't connect until that discrepancy is fixed.&nbsp; BTDT.&nbsp; Alternatively, I would check the Control Panel Network Connections list to see if there is a Local Area Connection... which could
 represent your TV.&nbsp; You would be able to try to do a Network adapter troubleshoot with that.&nbsp; However, this is a new idea which I had while trying to help someone else with the same symptom.&nbsp; I only know it would be possible, not how effective it might be
 when there was actually a problem.</p>

            Hi Robert, thank you for the reply. However you need to treat me like a complete computer novice. I've never used this TV with this tablet but was able to use another W10 before I got this one. I can't remember what model it was though sorry.&nbsp; What do
 you mean by the Audio &amp; Wireless Display sections? My W10 can find the TV when I search devices it simply won't connect. Thanks

<p>
</p><p>I can only give you hints with sufficient keywords to enable you to use as search terms in order to find other answers or tutorials in order to help yourself.&nbsp; Then if you come back and explain what you did and what you saw I could give other explanations
 or suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was assuming that you had been looking in&nbsp;Settings&nbsp; Bluetooth &amp; Other devices.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pressing Win-i and clicking on the Devices tile would be one way of getting there.&nbsp; In there there are section labels,&nbsp; Audio and Wireless displays and docks&nbsp; are only two
 of them but that would be where you would see signs of your TV.&nbsp; If you see such items in there you would click on them to see a Remove device button and use it.&nbsp; And do that with all related items before trying to use the Add Bluetooth or other device button&nbsp;(or
 press Win-K to try to use the Connect dialog again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a reboot but before a connect attempt I would like you to know what you see in Control Panel's &nbsp;Network connections--in particular whether you see a Local Area Connection*... in there at that time.&nbsp; Check it also after your connection attempt with
 your wireless display.&nbsp; In fact, in my case I can see&nbsp;such an item&nbsp;pop up after I use the Win-K dialog while the Control Panel window is still open.&nbsp; One way to open the Control Panel at Network connections would be to do a Taskbar search for Network status
 System Settings, e.g. press Ctrl-Esc and start typing that, click or press Enter when you get a match.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is a direct link called Change adapter options (which strangely gives a different view than what I would be using normally.&nbsp; Normally I use
 List but it doesn't matter just to see what is there.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then my other point was that if you did see a Local Area Connection*... you could use the Network troubleshooter on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a link to the Network troubleshooter from the same Network Status dialog.&nbsp; Use the link to open the troubleshooter.&nbsp; Then click
 on the Show me other network troubleshooting options.&nbsp; And then Use a specific network adapter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then see the Local Area Connection*... item listed; select it; and click Next.&nbsp; Mine says "couldn't find a problem" (AKA NTF).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH</p>

<h3> nuwavedc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista&#58; Device Cannot Start &#40;Error Code 10&#41; for a USB CDC device that works great under XP</h2>
                    I have&nbsp;a USB 2.0 CDC based device that works great under all of our Windows XP machines, but not under Vista.&nbsp; The device uses Virtual Comm Port Emulation and the usbser.sys driver.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The enumeration text shows the same information on Xp and Vista, except on vista it shows no open pipes.&nbsp; Device manager shows:&nbsp;Device Cannot Start (Error Code 10).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Using Vista I cannot connect to the CDC device vista through hubs or any other wireless hub device except for a Dlink Wireless hub, which has a software layer between the CDC device and the PC.&nbsp; With Xp this all works great on multiple PCs, with Vista, there
 are issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am using the manufacturer supplied inf file for Vista, still no results.<br />
<br />
Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated.

<h2>            Windows File Explorer not responding WINDOWS 10.</h2>
                    <p>I am having this problem for 3-2 months and so I decided to ask people on a forum. Every time when I open file explorer it works fine or is slow as hell, but when I am trying to access a folder it says that it's not responding and freezes. After this, I
 searched on the internet&nbsp;for some solutions. I found a lot of solutions but I&nbsp;don't know which one is the right one. So I tried some of them and some worked a little. The one that worked a little gave me finally more access to file explorer, but it's still
 slow as hell. When I got my pc it worked all fine. It wasn't slow or freezes or anything like that. So my problems are: Slow, freezes when trying to get access a folder and not responding.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94a849d6-b187-4978-8722-55ef8408fea9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94a849d6-b187-4978-8722-55ef8408fea9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of my file explorer.</p>
<p>You can see how slow it is.</p>
<p>

<h2>            PC reboots or screen turns off due to Nvidia drivers for Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Im having a problem with my desktop, once ive loaded up windows 7, if i have my Nvidia drivers installed then the PC would reboot after 2-3minutes of use. Without the drivers, the screen would turn off and the PC would freeze. I swapped the PSU and with
 the drivers installed,the PC would only turn off the screen and freeze after a few minutes. Yet after swapping the HDD the PC would reboot.</p>
<p>Im currently considering it a motherboard problem but no quite sure. If i load it up in safe mode, its all fine. Ive checked for overheating and the CPU isn't. Any way to make sure it is the motherboard?</p>

<p>Hi choriisu,</p>
<p>Please be sure to install the latest drivers from Nvidia's website.&nbsp; Also, you'll want to update the chipset drivers for your motherboard.</p>
<p>Finally, have you attempted to install the drivers when using clean boot?&nbsp; Please see the following article:</p>

<h2>            I have just recently noticed a program called BDE Administrator in the control panel and I cannot do anything with it...is it native to Microsoft Windows 7 or has it been placed there&#63;</h2>
                    I am not able to access any pertinent data or even remove this...and as I have only just recently noticed it...I am in the mind that it has been installed without my consent. It is not in the programs section of the control panel but has it's own place
 in the panel right before Color Management. Google does not give much more than it is called the Borlund Dartabase Engine.

<h2>            How can I force &#34;shutdown &#47;p&#34; if regular shutdown hangs&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Basically what's on the title, if a regular shutdown leads to the system hanging for a long time during the process, is there any way I can automatically dispatch a `shutdown /p` command?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried it using a timer in a Powershell script, set as the shutdown script in gpedit.msc, but unfortunately it seems that Windows actually waits for the script to finish running before shutting down, so it has to wait for the full timeout anyway. Is
 there any way I can say schedule this task for 1 minute for now, if the system hasn't shut down by then?</p>

            Hello! I am an Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!
<br />
<br />You could try this command:
<br />shutdown /s /p /t 60
<br />
<br />What this does is issue the shutdown command
<br />/s states it is for a shutdown
<br />/p states that no time-out or warning message will appear
<br />/t 60 is what makes it wait 60 seconds before issuing the shutdown command
<br />
<br />The only thing I am not 100% sure will work is the /p being there. I think it will, but if the command I gave you doesn't work then try removing the /p and see if it works then.

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. However, shutdown /p does not accept any further arguments for setting the timeout. You can only use shutdown /p with /f and /d, as you can see in the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
documentation</a>.</p>

            You are correct. 
<br />
<br />If you use the command without /p does it work? Is there a specific reason you are trying to use /p?
<br />
<br />shutdown /s /t 60

            Using "shutdown /s /t <strong>$timeout</strong>" in the shutdown script leads to an error message, saying that shutdown is already in progress. shutdown /p, on the other hand, actually shuts down and leads to a poweroff.

<p>If the system hangs during a shutdown then your only solution is to press the power button for 10 seconds.</p>

            <p>Thank you very much Andre</p>
<p>I processed by following the steps as described in your mail. But the problem persist. So I tried downloading some new apps to be sure that the problem is related to window store or specifically the app Netflix. As result, I have been able to download two
 apps.&nbsp;Also I noticed in the store that&nbsp;I already owned the Netflix app.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;recall that firstly&nbsp;I&nbsp;uninstalled&nbsp;Netflix &nbsp;before trying to install it again.&nbsp;Hope that those new information&nbsp;may help&nbsp;!</p>
<p>Thank&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Unable to open File Explorer, ThisPC, Control Panel and others in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Old title: cannot open file explorer</p>
<p>I have a windows 10 system updated from a windows 7, and has installed all the latest update.</p>
<p>I recently have this issue with file explorer. The start bar and desktop works fine, implying the explorer.exe can basically run. But i cannot open any folder, like my computer, or control panel.</p>
<p>However, I can open file explorer in safe mode or by switching to another user in the normal mode.<br />
</p>
<p>In the normal mode of my main user account, two error messages show in event viewer when I try to open a folder:</p>
<p>One is:</p>
Faulting application name: explorer.exe, version: 10.0.10586.104, time stamp: 0x56aaffa0<br />
Faulting module name: comctl32.dll, version: 6.10.10586.0, time stamp: 0x5632d2ce<br />
Exception code: 0xc000041d<br />
Fault offset: 0x0000000000030ce7<br />
Faulting process id: 0x1444<br />
Faulting application start time: 0x01d166836f6ec15e<br />

Faulting package full name:&nbsp;<br />
Faulting package-relative application ID:&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>Another is:</p>
<p>Package Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperienceHost_10.0.10586.0_neutral_neutral_cw5n1h2txyewy+App was terminated because it took too long to suspend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By running system scan,&nbsp;</p>
It shows:<br />
Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some<br />
of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For<br />
example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. Note that logging is currently not<br />
supported in offline servicing scenarios.<br />
<p>
</p><p>If necessary, I can upload cbs.log file.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

Please uninstall the drivers and the device (from Device Manager).&nbsp; The next time it's inserted into the computer, let Windows Update take care of installing drivers (Don't use the disk that it came with).<br />

<h2>            Changing MS account on xbox profile</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>My name is Mattias.</p>
<p>I've been playing xbox for many years.</p>
<p>Recently I decided I wanted to update my xbox profile with a new MS account. I read that you're supposed to be able to change MS account for your profile and get any points on it transferred to the new MS account. So, I created a new account (this) on xbox
 live and connected it to Gold. When I tried to change the account on my xbox profile I got the message that it couldn't be done because that account was already connected to a profile.</p>
<p>How do I go about to change the account on my xbox profile and preserve the points on it? Is it even possible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Mattias</p>

<p>Yes. It is going to be a process for you. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need to create a new/ junk microsoft account. You can do this at accounts.live.com.</p>
<p>After that you will need to log into the gamertag that has the MS account on it that you want and swap the accounts. (The junk microsoft account will take over the gamertag.) if it has been less then 30 days since buying the subscription i would call them
 up and have them cancel it and refund it. </p>
<p>After doing this initial step you will have to wait 30 days to doing the next step. It is security measures in place to protect MS accounts. &nbsp;After the 30 days log into you original gamertag &nbsp;and sitch microsoft accounts. Your new account will take over
 the gamertag. </p>
<p>You can change the Microsoft account that's associated with your Xbox LIVE gamertag. Here's how:</p>
<p>Sign in using your Xbox LIVE gamertag.</p>
<p>Go to Settings and select account</p>
<p>Scroll right to Your Information and select Account Security.</p>
<p>Select Microsoft account (Your Microsoft account is your Windows Live ID.)</p>
<p>Do one of the following:</p>
<p>Enter the password for the Microsoft account that is currently associated with your gamertag and select Sign in.</p>
<p>Enter the email address and the password for the new Microsoft account that you want to associate with your gamertag, and then select Sign in.</p>
<p>Select Yes, change to change the Microsoft account associated with your Xbox LIVE account.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you. </p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Do you have any 3rd part antiviruses?
<br />Are use using proxy?
<br />
<br />Because you had some error using command prompt try to use in-place upgrade to update your OS (this should fix some issues as well) - <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-an-in-place-upgrade-with-windows-10/7f0b236e-3c6c-4913-9691-c4baa2a6190a?auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Do you remember when the issue appeared? If you know approximately date you can use a restore point.

<p>Now this patch driver does download but doesn't install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some time Code 43 is shown and Win 8 message indicates that it has stopped this driver from installing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time the VAIO Care Update shows the requirement of this program to be installed and necessary for balance function of the display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some times internet explorer malfunctions and sometimes the cursor is out of control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Need help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The patches could be drivers, application etc as stated in the following article:
<a href="http://www.sony-asia.com/support/help/supthelpdownloadtype/441468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sony-asia.com/support/help/supthelpdownloadtype/441468</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you receive an error code 43 which states that the 'One of the drivers controlling the device notified the operating system that the device failed in some manner.'</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310123?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Explanation of error codes generated by Device Manager</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you uninstall and reinstall the base device driver and then try re-installing the patch. To uninstall a device driver you may try the follow steps:</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>a)</font><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Press ‘Ctrl+R’ on the keyboard to bring the run dialog box and enter ‘devmgmt.msc’ and click ‘OK’.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span>b) Expand the device which you want to remove; right click on it to and select uninstall to remove.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>É verdade, infelizmente existe sim e vou contar um caso muito interessante que houve um época no Gears of War 3</p>
<p>Houve uma época no game que muitos começaram a usar controle turbo, o multiplayer dele ficou completamente impossível de se jogar, todas as salas do game tinha, e o pior de tudo o jogo já tinha 2 anos lançado.</p>
<p>Uma comunidade do jogo resolveu então ir direto da fonte, ir no email da desenvolvedora e reclamar, mas infelizmente ela não podia fazer nada! eles não podiam banir os caras, pois isso quem deveria fazer era a Microsoft, pois está ebulindo uma coisa que
 não pode no console, a Microsoft também não consegue ver quem usa ou não :c a única solução que a desenvolvedora deu foi denunciar pelo console a conta e sair da sala, só isso</p>
<p>Eu comecei a fazer, mas não vi nenhuma mudança de cara, mas depois de um tempo mais ou menos 1 ano depois, era difícil de se ver, é claro que não acabou completamente, sempre tem um pé rapado que usa, mas era bem menos</p>
<p>Hoje eu não sei como está mais, já que não tenho mais ele, mas eu recomendo que você faça o mesmo, eu sei que não é do nosso gosto sair bem no meio de uma partida frenética, mas é aquela situação, ou você sai ou fica prejudicada
</p>
<p>Não sei se você sabe, mas controle turbo funciona em muito jogos de fps e tps então com certeza deve ter em Sniper Elite
</p>
<p>É complicado mas é a realidade, neguin não aceita jogar limpo e apela pra modificação kkkk isso sempre existiu na 7 geração, principalmente nos CoDs, você pode pergunta pra qualquer um que jogou CoD ou joga, com certeza ele tem uma história pra dizer sobre
 isso.</p>
<p>Espero que isso não passe para a 8° geração :c </p>
<p>Também não garanto que essas pessosa sejam banidas, aliás controle turbo não é oficial querendo ou não é uma trapaça, e qualquer ebulição do sistema na rede Xbox Live é ban, mas como é final de geração, a MS deve está nem ai pra isso infelizmente, já a produtora
 que deve se preocupar </p>

<h2>            how to copy a disc with only one cd drive</h2>
                    <p><strong>Two part question.</strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>I have only one cd drive. </strong>I have a disc, containing windows folders, that I want to copy to another disc. The folders contain only data. NO VIDEO'S MUSIC, PHOTOS, ETC.&nbsp; I tried media player and all I got from that were
 copies of the folder on the same disc. Is there a way with Microsoft software, rather than 3rd party stuff?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.</strong><strong> Can I set up a password</strong> that the user has to provide to be able to open a folder?</p>
<p>

<p>I am not aware of a console command to format a CD but if you do an extensive search using a search engine then you probably find one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when burning files to a CD-R then you do not need to format the CD. Using Windows Explorer, it is sufficient to do what the many illustrated guides tell you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drag the files to the CD drive.</li><li>Drop them.</li><li>Right-click the CD drive.</li><li>Left-click "Burn".</li><li>Follow the prompts.</li></ol>

    <title>Problem with waking up Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bartekk2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with waking up Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Previously I was able to wake up my desktop&nbsp;computer by pressing random key on my keyboard. However, probably after one of Windows 10 updates, my computer is currenlty having some issues with waking up. To wake it up I have to press the power button (power
 LED indicates that it is on, but nothing appears on the screen) then I have to power it down by pressing the power button for at least 4 seconds and power it back. Then it is waking up recovering all my previous work.&nbsp; I`ve tried some of the the solutions
 from the internet, but none of these works. Can anyone help me with that problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in andvace</p>
<p>Bartek</p>

            It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Keyboards
<br />Right click your keyboard
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Power Management
<br />
<br />Make sure 'Allow this device to wake the computer' is checked. 
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK

<p>I`ve already tried to update BIOS and drivers but with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system details:</p>
<p>System: Windows 10.0.17134 17134<br />
MB: Asus H170M-E D3</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allowing my both keyboards visible in the Device menager to wake up my computer does not help either. One thing that I noticed is that before this issue starts after putting system into sleep my power LED blinks and my keyboard Num Lock key lit. Now both
 are going off after Start &gt; Sleep.</p>

            This is likely a compatibility issue with Windows 10 1803 and your configuration.
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

<br />BIOS:

<br />
<br />I recommend you apply these updates since they were released in the last couple of months since Windows 10 1803 was released.
