                    Windows 8 "UNINSTALL" does NOT work when I try to get rid of "weDownload Manager." I cannot figure out how to get rid of it.

 key. I don't have the product key. Help me get this off of my computer please!!!

            it is really difficult to get rid of.&nbsp; I have Norton Antivirus and had to use the power eraser to get rid of it.&nbsp; Just run the power eraser and then click the info icon at the far right and select enable fix and remove it.&nbsp; then you will need to restart
 your computer and go into your control panel and click uninstall.&nbsp; you should get a message telling you that it may already have been removed and do you want to remove it from programs and features.&nbsp; Click yes.&nbsp; there you go, it's out.<br />

            I will try the power eraser, as you suggest though I'm not sure I need to at this point. Shortly after I posted my question, I used the 'restore' option on Windows 8, resetting my computer to as it was on an earlier date--pre-weDownload Manager.
<div><br />
<div>That seemed to work--I don't see it listed as a program and all the annoying ads went away--but I'm unsure if it removed all traces.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do you think the 'restore' option was sufficient?</div>

            I have had the same problem as everyone else.&nbsp; Downloaded some freeware to try out a graphics applications and found this attached.<br />
<br />
When I looked closer at the download file, I found that it was a zip file that contained an uninstall application.&nbsp; Took a while to get to work, but the uninstall file finally removed the application and no longer shows up under the "programs and features"
 utility on my control panel.<br />

<div>Norton Power Eraser(NPE) did not work for me. &nbsp;It looks like I have a version that has been made stronger. &nbsp;I notified Homeland Security the cyberthreat task force in that this is a known issue and Norton, Microsoft etc, all the big companies do not seem

            I have this problem with a few bloatware's on new computer's!!!&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1st what is up with the anti-virus software, ie; Norton and McAfee!!! Windows comes with it built in &nbsp;and it's good!!! Why more???
<div><br />
<div>!!!To remove the bad stuff I use regedit!!! If you don't know what this is I suggest you don't try this!!!! Regedit used wrong "WILL" mess up Windows beyond repair!!! Always back up!!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;I scan the registry for what I want out. I often have to figure all the names the software might use.</div>
<div>Example: you can't remove Norton without searching for&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Symantec, etc....</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">&nbsp;I also remove what I feel is bloat!! ie: AOL I am never going to use but it's there!!! Why??!!!&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">&nbsp;Looked up weDownload Manager and it's nothing but adware that uses your downloads to push software on you. They are also the makers of&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">SmartPCFix
 also another program to try and remove your money from your wallet!!!!</span><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">&nbsp;</span></div>

            Just got an email from Norton, they suggested running Norton Power Eraser NPE in safemode. &nbsp;I will try and get back to you. &nbsp;I thought it was adware too, but when it destroyed a sector{corrupting a sector prevents restore} &nbsp;on my HD it became a virus.

            Genexxa... what do you mean when you say it destroyed a sector? How do you identify that? As I say above, I used the 'restore' option after I discovered the problem, and that seems to have worked. Here are some facts about my experience:
<div><br />
<div>1. My son tried to download a 'free' version of Minecraft</div>
<div>2. Immediately, crazy ads started appearing on websites where they typically would not appear</div>
<div>3. After an hour or so of tinkering, I identified the culprit as WeDownload Manager</div>
<div>4. I made attempts to uninstall from the control panel but this did not seem to work</div>
<div>5. I removed the WeDownload add-ons from both Internet Explorer and Chrome, the two browsers on my computer, but after re-starting computer, the add-ons reappeared</div>
<div>6. Like everyone here, I spent far too much unnecessary time researching the issue on the web, looking through discussion forums, etc. Most discussion forums would point me toward additional software that I do not presently own (such as 'Power Eraser')</div>
<div>7. Probably three hours into the problem, I then stumbled upon the 'restore' option on my computer, so I tried that</div>
<div>8. Between the date of my original post and now, I have not experienced any further problems</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is my belief that the 'restore' option solved my problem, but now I'm curious about the 'destroyed sector' comment.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am running Windows 8.</div>

            Hi Christy, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />I haven't heard of that file extension before, and it sounds like something has corrupted the file extension.
<br />
<br />See if it's fixed by renaming the file to "filename.JPG" where you replace "filename" with the actual file name. Just changing the extension to JPG might resolve the issue.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, see if you can take a screenshot of the files for me to try to diagnose the issue further. Thanks!

                    I use a polar sports watch that requires an infrared reader to upload data from the watch to my computer. I have previously successfully used an IRDA2mini USB on an XP OS. I have bought a new computer with Vista OS and it does not recognise the IRDA USB.
 I have searched the web for appropriate drivers for the device for Vista but &nbsp;I've had no success. I have also tried to buy a new device that is vista compliant but again with no success.&nbsp;

            I know this is kind of an overkill solution but... You could install VirtualBox and then Install XP in it and use your IRDA2mini USB from within virtual box. Since Virtual box allows the use of Usb devices this should work. Could hold you over until you
 find a more permenant solution.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro restore points missing.</h2>
                    I have read through every thread possible on this.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have my system protection on (see image) and yet my restore points are missing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I should have restore points back to at least October when I reinstalled the system.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have no viruses, I have no errors, I have no system issues (I have run scf / scannow
 etc and even Dell has been in my system trying to figure this out).&nbsp; &nbsp;The restore points just disappear.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have it set high for a reason I have over 2 TB free on this particular system there should be no reason restore points are missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I also have 3 Windows 7 systems and I have restore dates that go back to 2017 for goodness sakes.&nbsp; &nbsp;What is going on with Windows 10 Pro and the restore points?&nbsp;<br />

            Hi Olive,
<br />
<br />Welcome to our community.
<br />This is Leocadia, independent community expert, and I am glad to assist you today. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear about this inconvenience. Now, we would like to help you promptly. 
<br />
<br />Now, could you please perform some Troubleshoot steps?
<br />
<br />Fix #1: System Restore is enabled
<br />
<br />If the System Restore points are missing, it can be because the System Restore utility has been turned off manually. Whenever your turn off System Restore, all previous points created are deleted. By default, it’s turned on.
<br />
<br />To check if everything runs correctly with System Restore, follow the instructions below.
<br />
<br />For Windows XP:
<br />
<br />    Click Start &gt; Control Panel
<br />    Click System
<br />    Go to System Restore tab
<br />    Make sure the Turn off System Restore on all drives is unchecked
<br />
<br />    Search for system restore in the search bar
<br />    Click Create a restore point
<br />    Go to System Protection
<br />    Select which drive you want to check and click Configure
<br />    Make sure the Turn on system protection option is checked in order for System Restore to be turned on
<br />
<br />Fix #2: Check HDD space
<br />
<br />If your computer no longer has the free space, System Restore – even if it’s turned on – will stop creating restore points.
<br />
<br />You can also configure System Restore to use more space to save the restore points. To do so, follow the steps from until you reach the Max Usage option of System Restore.
<br />
<br />Use the Max Usage slide to increase the space for System Restore.
<br />
<br />Fix #3: Run chkdsk, sfc
<br />
<br />By running the chkdsk and sfc commands you can check if there are any issues with your computer’s hard drive.
<br />
<br />    Open Command Prompt
<br />    Type:
<br />
<br />    chkdsk /f
<br />
<br />    Press Enter
<br />    Type:
<br />
<br />    sfc /scannow
<br />
<br />    Press Enter
<br />
<br />If chkdsk or sfc (or both) output shows error in System Restore, your computer’s hard drive might be failing or it’s corrupted. This could be the cause for the missing System Restore points.
<br />
<br />ix #4: Check Volume Shadow Copy
<br />
<br />The Volume Shadow Copy utility from Windows creates backups of your Windows while in use. If Volume Shadow Copy is disabled, your computer’s System Restore points might not be available.
<br />
<br />To check if Volume Shadow Copy is running or not, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />    Click Start
<br />    Type services.msc in the Run dialog box or in the Search bar (for Windows Vista, 7 or 8)
<br />    Press Enter to open the Services utility
<br />    Find the Volume Shadow Copy item from the list
<br />    Make sure Volume Shadow Copy is running: check the “Status” column corresponding to this item.If it’s not running, click Start the service from the left in order to start it.
<br />
<br />Fix #5: Check page file for fragmentation
<br />
<br />If your system’s page file is fragmented, your System Restore points might get deleted at each restart. This is very common behavior for Windows 7 systems.
<br />
<br />In order to fix this, you can do the following: disable, delete or recreate the page file.
<br />
<br />To do so, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />    Open Control Panel
<br />    Type advanced system settings in the search bar
<br />    Click View advanced system settings
<br />    Click Settings under Performance
<br />    Click Change under Virtual Memory
<br />    Select your main drive, e.g. C:, and then select No paging file
<br />    Click Set
<br />    Click OK (three times) to exit the current menu
<br />    Restart your computer
<br />    Boot again and go to Computer (or My Computer)
<br />    Delete pagefile.sys from your main drive, e.g. C:\.
<br />    In this example, pagefile.sys path is: C:\pagefile.sysNote that pagefile.sys is a hidden file and you need to show hidden files and folders (go to Folder Options to enable this option) to view the file.
<br />    Click Start
<br />    Type cmd to open Command Prompt
<br />    Type:
<br />
<br />    defrag /h c:
<br />
<br />    Replace c: with the letter of the drive where Windows is installed.
<br />    Go back and enable paging file again. Follow the first steps and deselect the No paging file option.
<br />    Click OK (three times) to exit the menu
<br />    Reboot your computer
<br />    Check if System Restore or Volume Shadow Copy is running correctly. You can try to create a manually restore point.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope it helps, but, let me know if you need further assistance.

            Hi Olive11251 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />In Windows 10 they changed the time that restore points are saved.
<br />Windows 7 it was 90 days and I believe in Windows 10 it's only 30 days.
<br />Mine are only from as far back as January 23rd.
<br />
<br />Make sure you set your disk usage higher than what the default is.
<br />So at least 20GB if you want more to store.

<p>No help and I have done all the above.&nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft has been in my system and so has dell.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I run 3 Windows 7 systems and 2 10's I am a business.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have no control of the junk on Windows 10 PRO I can't get rid of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have no color and metrics and lowering screen resolution is not an option I am a photography business.&nbsp; &nbsp;I buy screens for resolution.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
NOW I have no control over restore points.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
WHAT are you all thinking?&nbsp; &nbsp; This is a PRO version and 7 is going away.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<p>Sarah.. thank you for trying.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
What a joke this is.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have over 67% allocated and it knocks all my restore points out on both my Windows 10's down to 4.&nbsp; &nbsp; My 7's I can take back almost a year.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Can't get rid of junk on the systems they are PRO version... can't have control over color and metric (third party app is the only resolutions Microsoft has given to me).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I suppose it's time to consider MAC's for my business.&nbsp;</p>

            As a business and using PRO versions I would think that we would have a little more control of our systems.&nbsp; &nbsp; And to take away normal functions like Color and Metrics is just plain not thinking on Windows behalf.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have been a Windows user for 20+ years
 and this is just reminding me of the Vista nightmare.&nbsp; &nbsp; It is starting to cripple my business.&nbsp; &nbsp;And yes, I have spoke with Pro support (Microsoft) and no resolutions.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just that they would report it and as you see in this forum that has been said since
 day one of Windows 10 and those issues are still present.&nbsp; &nbsp; I don't get it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I understand it on home versions but PRO?????&nbsp;&nbsp;

            There is a gpo that creates a system restore point daily.
<br />Under Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Windows Defender Antivirus &gt; Scan
<br />
<br />On the right side, double-click Create a system restore point.
<br />
<br />But can't find one that keeps them for a period of time.

            I can create all the restore points I want and I can custom do it... I get it.&nbsp; &nbsp; What my point and question is WHY can't we choose like we did in Windows 7 PRO how long to keep those restore points?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You all are missing my questions of concern here.&nbsp;
 &nbsp; I can take by my 3-Windows 7 Pro systems almost a year.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes I would have to reinstall the updates but I wouldn't have to reinstall the OS.&nbsp; &nbsp; Which since anything over 90days on Windows 10 Pro is being deleted no matter how much space I have allocated
 to it.&nbsp; &nbsp;And yes I have confirmed the allocation via the command prompt and all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I am just trying to cover it all.
<br />i get you want to store but as i said in my first reply they removed that feature.
<br />If you want to take it up with Microsoft directly then I would recommend contacting them either via support call or use the feedback hub.
<br />We are just volunteers that dont' work for Microsoft directly.

            I truly appreciate you assistance Sarah.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have contacted them for over a year straight now regarding this with no resolve.&nbsp; &nbsp; As I stated previously they have been in my systems and can't fix any of it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know that I am not the only one... I see
 it all over the internet.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just truly don't understand how this could go unanswered / fixed / resolved for us PRO users.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am sorry&nbsp; I thought that this was "specifically" Microsoft viewed and monitored forum.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
My mistake and I apologize if I was rude or short with you.&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn't mean to be.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am just beyond frustrated at what this is doing to my business right now.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's look like I am going to have to eat 6 systems this year and convert them all over to MAC's if this can't be taken care of. I have never had this issue with Windows 7 (I run 3-4 of those daily) it's the 2 Windows 10 that are a HOT MESS.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I send them emails and chats weekly trust me I am not wanting nor can I afford to take that kind of hit financially in my business right now.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You will be surprised that you won't need a DVD burner to create your own recovery disk. All you need is a blank USB flash drive with at least 8 GB of free space. Check this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article </a>for more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also have an option to create a system image so you can restore your operating system to the exact same state when you created the backup
<em>if </em>needed. Check this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-10/84fa6683-e3ac-4e93-9139-368af9267869">

            Please, you don't understand I have a very old computer and I cannot afford to buy a flash drive yet. Everytime I try to create a recovery drive in Windows 10 I get the error "Some files are missing". I only have 1 Hard drive and I would really like to
 have a Windows 10 Recovery DVD. I am now getting errors on bootup "The BCD is missing some required files" and I am not able to bootup at all. Please help me...?<br />

            Got it. However, we don't send out Recovery Disc. You might be able to request a copy from the store where you bought the device or from your device manufacturer itself. There's also a chance that they will give you a link to download the recovery media.

<h2>            HP Pavilion Not Reseting</h2>
                    <p>My HP Pavilion 360 will not reset. I tried the reset and keep files but it got to 34 percent and an error message popped up. It said that the reset could not be completed and the reset was done through the windows recovery environment. What does that mean
 and will choosing any of the other reset options work? If they won't then what should I do?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Why are you trying Reset? What problem have you been having?<br />
<br />
Run CheckDisk - in File Manager right click your Windows drive (probably C: ) then Tools tab Error checking.<br />
<br />
Windows Key + X&nbsp;- Command Prompt (Admin) - at the prompt type in these or Copy and Paste to run one at a time :<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
<br />
Note if that shows uncorrected errors - continue regardless.<br />
<br />
When that completes run these :<br />
<br />
Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
<br />
Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - continue regardless.<br />
<br />
Then restart the computer<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

 a few seconds&nbsp;the blank screen appeared.&nbsp; When I reboot the PC for the 2nd time, it would restore it to the previous Window 7 Pro.&nbsp; Before upgrading, I had ensured that&nbsp;Windows 7 was activated, and also update the softwares, etc.&nbsp; Please advise.</p>

</p><p><span><span>If the upgrade process sticks or is not responding at 99% it is best to wait and do nothing for 5 to 6 hours. If there is still no progress close the Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant, restart
 the computer and try upgrading following the advice detailed below. </span></span></p>

Many of these devices such as HP Stream came in a variety of colors with a full copy of Windows 8.1. Attractive qualities include an affordable price and a 11 or 13 inch display. Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations. This makes it difficult to install Windows 10 the conventional way.

 PC off and on again. &nbsp;When I did it on the 2nd times, it restored back to Windows 7. &nbsp;The &nbsp;blue screen shows error : OXC1900101 - OX30017 &nbsp; &nbsp;The installation failed in the FIRST_BOOT phase with an error during BOOT operation.</p>

    <title>the real reason ms did not go with gddr5&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dudeskis01  say:</h3>
<h2>            the real reason ms did not go with gddr5&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>obviously the gddr5 is superior than ddr3+esram. if 4k catches on or the cloud is a bust, then ps4 is going to have an obvious and easy advantage over x1. i dont think either is going to happen, but you never know. so why not go with the sure thing in gddr5?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>to keep costs down? maybe. but seems a bit unlike ms. they just wrote down $1b from surface rt stock and are quite alright with it now that they have forced their partners to develop quality win 8 tablets. i think if they felt gddr5 was the future they would
 have been willing to spend that money.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>so i started thinking about what the ddr3+esram is better at, since obviously it isnt better at games. but its definitely better at the windows+xbox os+hyperviser thingy. then it dawned on me. every single ms device now runs on some form of windows. there
 most powerful device combines windows and a gaming os. but how long before it isnt the most powerful device? for pcs 2 or 3 years tops. tablets? who knows but definitely before the end of the x1 cycle there will be tablets more powerful then the x1. does that
 mean we will see x1 tablets?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>now it makes sense to me. ms is laying the ground work for full unification of all devices. they may continue to make consoles, but in 7 to 10 years they are going to have mobile devices with the x1 gaming catalog.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>this would confirm the whole sony cares more about gamers theory. at least in the short term.</p>

<p>but the gddr5 isnt just bandwidth. there is a reason the ps4 apis, drivers, and libraries are farther along. the all gddr concept is easier to make games for. not near the difference that x360 and ps3 where, but its just another thing on top of the bandwidth.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>i do agree right now they dont need the bandwidth. ive argued this in previous posts. but eventually developers will start pushing each system to the limits. ms needs the cloud to keep pace. there is just no two ways about it, by the middle of this generations
 cycle they have to be able to offload significant amounts of ai, physics, etc to the cloud to keep pace. so that bandwidth issue is very short sighted.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>i could be off base on that, but the ps4 approach just seems far less riskier. so i really think the x1 approach is about long term eco system development.</p>

Both the Xbox 360 an the Xbox one use a shared pool of main memory (512 MB on the 360 and 8 GB on the XB1) and both have on chip ram (10 MB eDRAM for the Xbox 360 and 32 MB&nbsp;eSRAM for the XB1). I have no idea where you guys are getting that this is a risky idea.
 In fact intel uses this exact same setup of ram on CPU for their low to mid range OEM desktop/laptop processors.</p>

the 360 used DDR2 as DDR3 hadn't been finalized and released yet (wasn't released till 2007) and GDDR5 is based on the DDR3 architecture.</p>

<p>I don't know enough about tech to really comment on it, but I find your statement pretty funny - of course it'll be the best Playstation yet! However, that means you also alluded to the fact that you didn't say it's going to be the best video game console
 to-date. That means you must think the Xbox One is going to be, which is counter to your argument. God, I love a good play on words... ;)<br />

<p>4K gaming on the current gen consoles? Don't make me laugh. The processing power required to fill a 4k display even at 30fps is way beyond both the Xbox One and PS4. It is simply not going to happen this generation with games of the graphical complexity
 we have come to expect from our next gen games. Maybe via upscalers if people can come up with clever algorithms that don't make the image displayed look truly awful then maybe, but certainly not natively.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I've also said this time and time again over the last few months on so many threads and articles that I'm getting tired of repeating myself. Embedding RAM on GPU's and CPU's is actually incredibly common. It has been a design feature of silicon chips probably
 before most people on these forums were even born. Anyone ever heard of Cache? Well guess what, all the eSRAM on the Xbox One is essentially is a bigger pool of cache. Nintendo have used it before, as have Microsoft, and even Sony with the PS2. It's a common
 solution to a technical problem.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>actually in terms of bandwidth, Sony's solution is the radical one. Having a system wide bandwidth that is as wide as it is just hasn't been attempted like this before in a mass consumer product. That's not to say it is in any way complex or difficult, it's
 not, in fact it is simpler and more elegant than the standard solution normally taken by architecture designers, and will lead to an easier time for developers. As to why Microsoft didn't go the GDDR5 route?
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Well I think there are a number of reasons. in 2010 / 2011 when they were apparently starting to ramp up design on the Xbox One GDDR5 RAM was an exotic pipe dream unlikely to be ready for mass production early 2013. I'd have not wanted to bet on it. Hell
 throughout 2012 betting on large pools of affordable GDDR5 RAM becoming available was looking rather dumb. What nobody really counted on though was the demand for newer graphics cards hitting current peaks, and the demand for cheaper GDDR5 RAM causing manufacturing
 breakthroughs like have happened recently. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You could argue Mark Cerny is a genius and possibly a clairvoyant able to read the future... or that actually his and Sony's gamble has paid off in rather more spectacular fashion than anyone could have and probably should have predicted. If you honestly
 asked me in November 2012 if I thought the PS4 would have more than 2GB GDDR5 RAM I'd have said "probably not", so when the 4GB GDDR5 RAM rumours circulated I was pleasantly surprised. When it was upped to 8GB's I was astounded. Sony got lucky. It really is
 that simple, while Microsoft actually wisely played it safe. </p>

<h2>            Skype not installed with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My work laptop has Windows 10 Enterprise edition (64 bit) installed. Nowhere in the menu can I find Skype. I DO have "Skype For Business", but that's strictly for inside-the-firewall use. I have asked our IT about it, and they suggested I go to the Skype
 downloads page to install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I navigate to the site, there is no option to download because it thinks - since I have Windows 10 installed - that I must already have Skype installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a link that will allow me to install Skype on Windows 10? Or - is there something I can do to access it on my laptop even though it appears to me that I don't have it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks...</p>

<h2>            Hercules Webcam Dualpix HD Webcam not working.</h2>
                    Original title: Hercules Webcam Dualpix HD Webcam <br />
<br />
I used to use my Hercules Webcam Dualpix HD Webcam on a Windows XP Operating System and it worked fine.&nbsp; When I bought a new computer, it came with Windows 7 Operating System. I installed the software, and the webcam worked fine......for a while.&nbsp; I could still
 use Skype, but the person I was talking to couldn't see my face, and neither could I.&nbsp; I uninstalled the software, and re-installed it, and the webcam worked again....for a while.&nbsp; It stopped showing my face again and I don't know what to do.&nbsp; Can anyone out
 there help me?&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;

            Hi Dwi, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />You can create a bootable USB drive with Windows 10 installation files on it to clean install Windows. That's the most reliable and simplest way to fix the issue, but keep in mind it'll remove all your files and apps before reinstalling Windows.
<br />
<br />Here's a tutorial that'll help you clean install:

<br />
<br />You can start the process with the Media Creation Tool:

 long time, and said that a file was missing or corrupted.

<h2>            Windows cannot find.... Make sure you&#39;ve typed the name correctly and try again&#63; Help...</h2>
                    I've been searching and searching but I cannot find a fix to this problem, every time I use IE or google chrome this happens. I try and download a file from the internet, whether its a picture from my email or a file from my schools web page. I get this
 error message: Windows cannot find C:\ (Name): Downloads... etc. then says Make sure you've typed the name correctly and try again. Has anybody found a fix to this?

            Thank you for your reply but heres my issue
<div>1. It will download, and after the download completes ill either go to start, documents, downloads its not there. Because when I try to click the file from the internet that error message pops up.</div>
<div>2. Yes I am.&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. And yes i go to the destination folder manually, I still cannot find it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I dont know if this will help but from the research I did do, it said something about AVG is messing up or something. Im not too sure, I completely dont know what is wrong with it :/</div>

            <p><span>Hi DoctorEnigma,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for answering my questions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let's try the following and check:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to select "Save as" option when you try to download the file.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong>
<p><span>Normally whatever you download by default it will save in downloads folder. If you want to save your downloads in the different folders you need to change the locations.</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the steps to set the location of your default download folder.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Click on
<strong>Start</strong>, and then click on<strong> Computer </strong></span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on
<strong>C:\ drive,</strong> and then click on <strong>User’s folder</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Under user’s folder click on your<strong> user name</strong>, then click on<strong> Downloads</strong>, right click on downloads select<strong> Properties</strong></span></p>
<p><span>d) Click on the
<strong>Location Tab</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Under location tab Change the location to the require drive.</span></p>
<p><span>f) Click on<strong> Apply</strong>, finally click
<strong>OK.</strong> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope it helps!</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if the issue is resolved or not.</span></p>
