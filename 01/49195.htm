<h2>            Xbox Live Enforcement Team</h2>
                    <p>In the last 90 days I have received multiple threatening hateful comments from all these people that I'm posting screenshots about it.I want to open a dialogue to discuss why do people have to go this negative on Xbox should the punishment should be harsher
 for people that have multiple offenses should be banned for more than 90 days from communicating or playing their games even joining multiplayer games it's evident the Xbox enforcement team lets it slide for a first-time offense exact punishment should be
 extremely harsh to the person that is violating the terms of service of Xbox Live.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
These are the people in discussion I want to talk about you feel it's justify for them to communicate in this way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some of these screenshots contain alt accounts that he or she has used to harass people like me on Xbox Live. IF THIS IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE PLACE TO DISCUSS THIS PLEASE LINK ME A PLACE WHERE I CAN HAVE THIS DISCUSSION WITH AN XBOX LIVE ENFORCEMENT TEAM MEMBER.</p>

            This isn't the place to do this, you cannot name &amp; shame on the forums. The best thing for you to do is just report the profiles, and block using the Xbox reporting and block features. the enforcement team will then get the report and if they find they
 have done what you said, then something will be done about it.

<p>&nbsp;Calling out gamertags,including posting screenshots of peoples gamertags is not allowed on the forums.Nor is posting any offensive message you may receive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The enforcement team do not use the forums &amp; there is no way to contact them other than via a case review if you have received enforcement action longer than 24 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;You should always report &amp; block anyone you believe is violating the ToU/CoC on xbox live &amp; they will be investigated &amp; action taken if needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The enforcement team will not accept any pictures you have.They have access to everything they need,including any messages sent by someone you've reported.</p>
<p>&nbsp;There is no set length of a suspension depending just on whether it's a first offence,second offence etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The length of a suspension also depends on the severity of a offence.You could get a perma ban for a first offence if it's severe enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The more times you get suspended the longer the suspension will be each time.</p>
<p>Eventually a person who keeps receiving enforcement actions will be permanently banned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If a person keeps using multiple accounts that all receive suspensions then they will receive a console suspension &amp; eventually a console ban.</p>
<p>&nbsp;You can set comms to friends only if it becomes too much of a problem.Rest assured,all you need to do is report &amp; block &amp; these people will be dealt with.</p>

            I feel its very justified to put their names on the forms so people would be aware of what he or she is posting in Xbox messages to me this is here to start a conversation not a witch Hunt I'm here to show that Xbox enforcement team does not take the necessary
 or appropriate actions of reporting the same person multiple times on different accounts it is unjustified are you or somebody else saying that it's not okay to post their profile names this is&nbsp; the discussion forum right.

<p>It's against forum rules to call out gamertags or post screen shots containing someones gamertag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;You can find the forum rules&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/xbox-forum-guidelines/d5108514-749c-490e-8e46-080259b8f0a5">HERE</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;The enforcement team will take action on someone no matter if it's a first offence or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;You will never be told the results of any report you've filed although on vary rare occasions you may get a thank you message if someone is suspended/banned due to a report you've filed.</p>

            The Xbox Enforcement team does not monitor the forums. You will need to go <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/howto#sub-topic0-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Yes, sorry, but calling people out here will do nothing for your cause. To stop people from negative behavior, you need to just report them and let the Enforcement Team handle it. Trying to pull more people on these forums into your situation will have
 no impact on what is happening. Good luck.

<p>Hey there <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5b3c2861-9730-4b5a-bb7a-00ea48aa2eb0" title="End Gaming">
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to the Forums for clarity on how to communicate your disdain with this other user.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand your frustration but it is against the Xbox Forums Guidelines to post a screenshot singling out other players like that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry for the inconvenience you are facing, but as previously posted, reporting and blocking the user is the only means to confer with the Enforcement Team about what you're experiencing. If a person receives enough valid complaints/reports from someone
 else, they get increasingly more severe suspensions. One may feel that it is justified to deal something harsher, but being that a player must agree to Xbox's service agreement before even being able to play their games, everyone who plays an title on an Xbox
 console or&nbsp;PC&nbsp;will have to adhere to those terms. </p>

            One way is to install it again so that you will have access to the proper installation and you can uninstall it again.
<br />
<br />If installation is not an option, then I would recommend that you should use a third party tool Revo Uninstaller which will find all remnants of the program and will uninstall.
<br />
<br />Download from - <a href="https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstalle...</a>

<p>I tried that and it still didnt work, revo uninstaller couldnt find it, but whenever I try to reinstall the program it says its already installed on my machine. Is there any way to bring the program back into the apps and features?</p>

Assuming you are talking about &nbsp;<strong>Windows </strong>Movie Maker, not a 3rd party movie maker.<br />
<br />
Have a look at&nbsp;your 5 min movie file.<br />
What is the file format ? The last 3 letters represent the file format.<br />
<br />
Windows Movie maker will support only a small handful of video file formats :<br />
<span>Video files:</span> .asf, .avi, .dvr-ms, .m1v, .mp2, .mp2v, .mpe, .mpeg, .mpg, .mpv2, .wm, and .wmv<br />
<br />
If you movie file format is not on the list above, you'll need to google for a free video converter. No need to buy one. Free one will do the job.<br />
Use the converter and change your movie file format.<br />
The best and most reliable file format to convert to is&nbsp; <strong>WMV</strong> format.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>“wiaacmgr</b>.<b>exe</b>” is a process associated with Microsoft Windows Operating System from Microsoft Corporation. It is the Windows Picture Acquisition
 Wizard and is used in acquiring images from digital cameras and scanners. You cannot open webcam using this program.

            Hi Jerry,
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: shell:appsfolder
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Try launching Netflix to see if it launches then try signing in.
<br />
<br />If not...
<br />
<br />Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Netflix, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if you can then sign in.
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />2. Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />net stop bits
<br />
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />
<br />3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />
<br />ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />
<br />4. Now, let’s restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />
<br />net start bits
<br />
<br />net start msiserver
<br />
<br />5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it.

<h2>            Rock Candy Xbox 360 Controller not appearing in device manager</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I recently purchased an Rock Candy Xbox 360 wired controller and connected it to my PC. Although when I went to look in device manager, nothing came up. I am running Windows 8.1 and already downloaded the Xbox 360 Controller for Windows software. If someone
 could please help, that would be great.</p>

    <title>Registry changes for mailto to accommodate Eudora - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rgccle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Registry changes for mailto to accommodate Eudora</h2>
                    <p>For years now mailto had defaulted to Eudora 6.2.3.4, my principle email client. For another application I installed Thunderbird and it took over as the default (I may have missed the option on installing). Now even after re-installing Eudora I can't get
 it to be an option for assignment as the mailto default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't appear in the list of Control Panel / Default programs or&nbsp;<span>Set associations.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I believe it could be done with a registry change, but the way to do it is not clear to me since there seem to be many "mailto" entries when I search for them.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like guidance on the problem excluding switching to the open-source version of Eudora which I tried some time ago and found unsatisfactory.</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Ajay and Jim, I <strong>stumbled </strong>onto the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In desperation I figured that I'd install the simple mail program the MS provides and use it as a go-between, but didn't quite know how to find it in 8.1, so I searched with the term "mail." Up popped an offer to, among other things, change the default email
 program. OK, worth a try. Eudora was the suggestion that came up!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chose it and all is well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it hard to understand why the 8.1 query would do it when all of the classic methods would not. But anyway, the problem is solved. Thank you both for your spending your time trying to help me.</p>

            Go to the PC Settings app, and under the General section, start the process for "PC Reset".&nbsp; It will set the computer back to "brand new" conditions, and restart with a prompt asking for the name and details you want to use to set it up for yourself.

<p>
</p><p>This is your only option to get full admin control of the computer.&nbsp; This is for the privacy and security of the previous owner:&nbsp; if the previous owner didn't give you the admin password, we can't help you break past it without doing a full reset, because
 we can't know if the laptop was stolen.</p>

            There is no admin password as previous owner has not set any user account for himself. As of now I am able to change admin rights for any file/program. and i can login through admin ID.

            There are several downloaded programs which show the path C:// previous owner/program. Also there is a folder in C drive with his name with 1 GB used capacity which i am unable to delete as it shows some programs from this folder are in use. also whenever
 i download anything it goes to his folder and from there i have to move it to mine.

            Not sure what you are asking, but dxdiag always opens in 32bit by default. <br />
When you click on the 64bit tab it will display 64bit information, which is pretty much the<br />
same as 32bit informations.<br />
And when you click on Save All Information it will do just that.<br />
Save 32 and 64bit information to a file.<br />

            Not many games use a 64 bit mode, and those that do don't require it.<br />
In future try to be more specific details. The full name of the game for a start - there are a
<br />
number of Hitman games spanning over ten years.<br />

Previously, I was getting several errors already. Most of the time after reboot the machine will work fine.<br />
<br />
But, I know there is a problem for this happens quite frequently when I use there is lots of network traffic when I browse youtube or facebook or any cache type function right after boot up of the pc.&nbsp;<br />
I tried a few thing when browsing on the internet to find a solution but did not resolve any of the issues.<br />
I tried to change my homegroup name with no resolution to any of these issue.<br />
I have a hunch of what it could be but I want to wait for someone to post.&nbsp;<br />
I have no idea what issuse A, B, C could be.<br />

====================================================</p>
<p><br />
Does the system have RAID? If so that is also&nbsp;very suspect.<br />
<br />
This error is usually a driver&nbsp;issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though&nbsp;it could be others.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software issues&nbsp;can also cause the error. When you get to the driver section
 of the troubleshooter use my&nbsp;generic&nbsp;methods below and then return to the troubleshooter if needed.
<br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in&nbsp;Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-spyware/security programs.<br />

<br />
==================================================<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : <br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView -<strong>&nbsp;set
</strong><br />
<strong>VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers </strong>- update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names (and<br />
<strong>BIOS and chipset drivers</strong>).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

    <title>Automatic rotation of random photos in file explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leonardchen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatic rotation of random photos in file explorer</h2>
                    <p>Hey, guys. I've installed both Windows 7 and Windows 10 on my laptop. Recently,&nbsp; I found a weird phenomenon that opening a folder full of photos in Windows 10 caused part of photos randomly rotated by 90 degrees, while there was no rotation opening the same
 folder in Windows 7. Does anybody know why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>screen shot in windows 7:</p>

            There may be a problem with Photos app configuration. I would suggest that you execute following steps and check after each step
<br />
<br />1. Reset Photos app
<br />Windows+X &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Locate Photos by Scrolling Down &gt; Click Advanced Options &gt; Click Reset
<br />
<br />2. If Reset doesn't work, then you should uninstall using Powershell and reinstall the Photos App
<br />Windows+X &gt; Click Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below command and right click in Powershell to paste it
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage *photos* | remove-appxpackage
<br />
<br />Now, you need to reinstall it
<br />Use below Powershell command to install
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers *photos* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}

<p>Thank you very much for your advice.</p>
<p>I tried following your instractions step by step, and checked when every step was done. However, nothing ever changed.</p>
<p>Futher more, I've found something else.</p>
<p>1. I tried third party image viwers, but they all showed me photos exactly the same way they were shown in the file explorer in preview.</p>
<p>2. Some photos were rotated by 180 degree, which I didn't notice.</p>
<p>3. I tried to copy this folder to different PCs with Windows 10, they all showed the same symptom.</p>
<p>4. I checked other photos taken before. It turns out they are all normal.</p>
<p>5. It occured to me that I used to take photos with Sony A7R, A7R2, Canon 5DMarkIII,&nbsp; while these rotated photos were taken by Sony A6000. However, I didn't find any location or rotation informations about the photos in their properties.</p>
<p>I guess the reason caused this may have something to do with the new camera and the way Windows 10 file explorer shows the photos. But I don't know how to fix it.</p>
<p>In my line of work, I deal with thousands of images every day. I can't afford to rotate every image to the way it should be manually. It would really help a lot if you can give me more advice.</p>

You are currently posting in a Windows 7 forum. When reposting in a Vista forum, remember to state exactly what happens when you try to run as Administrator.<br />

<h2>            Changing Gamertag capitals.</h2>
                    
<p>As you can see, my gamertag has some annoying uppercase letters. I made it when I thought that was cool. Now after maturing a bit, it gets on my nerves. So I was willing to spend $9.99 just to fix this, but it tells me the gamer tag is already in use...
 by me!!! So I have to spend another $9.99 to change it to something else, and then back to Twis7ed Visions? That's outrageous. Is there anyway this can be done without bankrupting me?</p>

<p>Hi Twisted,<br />
<br />
Unfortunately yes. The thing about GT's are that they are not case or space sensitive.
<br />
<br />
For example, the GT <strong>Twisted</strong> is the same as <strong>T W I S T E D</strong> and
<strong>tWiStEd</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Phone support will also not be able to circumvent this. If you really want Twis7ed Visions, you will indeed need to pay for 2 GT changes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hope that clears things up, but let us know if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I wonder if it is possible for XBL to have a process that would allow for such a change through some sort of validation process? &nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as you are the current user of a specific gamertag and wish to change the appearance by adjusting the characters for upper or lower case how could it not be possible to make this change with a single gamertag change transaction? &nbsp;Either that or have
 a method to "release" your gamertag during the "change gamertag" process.</p>
<p>This is an excellent customer satisfaction opportunity! &nbsp;It seems unreasonable to expect individuals who wish to keep their current spelling spend double the price. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Ranjak,</p>
<p>That's an excellent question, with a specific answer that we don't have here at Xbox Community Support.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>However, we do have a fairly new place to provide feedback, suggestions, and ideas. &nbsp;I think that it would be a fantastic place for you to put your idea. It's our Xbox Feedback forum.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>You can find the entrance to the feedback site at <strong><a href="http://xbox.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">xbox.uservoice.com</a></strong> , which is always the best place to get started, and where you can see all of the categories. &nbsp;I think that your
 suggestion would best fit in our <strong><a href="http://xbox.uservoice.com/forums/251649-memberships-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"Membership &amp; Accounts" feedback forum</a></strong> there. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>That feedback forum is our newest and best way to get your suggestions in front of the engineering teams, and you'll see that in the "Recently Updated Ideas" on the entry page I linked you to, we've begun implementing the&nbsp;changes that our Xbox Live Community
 have submitted already.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Hooah! The "User's Voice", indeed. &nbsp;Thanks for sharing your ideas with us here in the forums, and be sure to make your suggestion in the feedback forum I've shared with you. &nbsp;Who knows? Your idea may be implemented someday.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks SO much, and don't hesitate to ask any questions if you ever need a hand. :)</p>

    <title>Cannot switch between project screen to TV back to dual monitor setup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c.liu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot switch between project screen to TV back to dual monitor setup using hotkeys</h2>
                    <p>A very specific problem here. Recently, I upgraded my old monitors (connected by DVI if that helps) to newer monitors (that use displayport). My setup is a dual monitor setup connected to a TV, so 3 screens. I also have 2 audio sources, speakers connected
 to the computer itself, and a soundbar attached to the TV. My graphics card is a GTX 1060 TI, and everything was working great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For visual reference, from left to right, it's: Monitor1, Monitor2, TV3</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually have 2 modes of operation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - Computer mode: Dual monitor setup where Monitor1 is my main display, Monitor2 is extended, and TV3 is off.</p>
<p>2 - TV mode: Monitor1, Monitor2, and TV3 are all on and TV3 is my main display. If TV3 isn't the main display, the video lags, and that's a known issue with graphics cards, where the fix is to make the TV the main display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, the issue is that after upgrading my monitors, I can't get the shortcut to switch between configurations. Before, I could use the hotkey Win+P and "extend the display" to all 3 screens to use the TV, and once I was done and wanted to go back to
 computer mode, I had a shortcut to go back to "extend to second monitor". Now after the upgrade, that option is replaced with "Second screen only". Even worse, I couldn't get it fixed in Windows, so I fiddled around with the NVIDIA settings before I gave up
 and attempted to reset options to default. It's such a shame because now I have to open the display settings and change 3 configuration settings every time I transition from TV mode to computer mode where previously it was just a keycombo and a click.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Surface Book - Can&#39;t charge battery 2</h2>
                    <p>Hi, <br />
<br />
I've encountered a problem with my Surface Book, after using Surface Book (i7, 256GB, 8G RAM) for about 1 month, the battery 2 which is for the tablet could not be charged, so each time I was trying to charge would not charge this battery in recent days, that
 causes I can't detach the tablet, and I can't boot the laptop after shutting down without a power supply (boot without a power supply, the screen would show an empty battery icon).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Than I got some ways from the website(https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/surface-wont-turn-on-battery-wont-charge?os=windows-10), to uninstall the batteries' driver and update Windows 10, or to update the batteries'
 driver, the trick pressing and holding the power and volume up buttons simultaneously for 15 seconds, but nothing has changed. Any other ways to deal with this problem? Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>exactly the same problem. Did you manage to obtain a solution ? I've contacted Microsoft by chat and they propose an exchange.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just one question. Did you remember when this problem occurs ? For me, I think i t was after the last firmware update (11/17/16) but no sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi, <br />
<br />
Thanks for your replies. I think the problem occurred on my laptop should be before last Saturday (12/3). I doubt the issue is from hardware, not from firmware maybe?<br />
<br />
After trying the 2 buttons (power and volume-up button near power) shutdown trick, actually there's a difference - batteries' order, the "Battery 1" is for keyboard, 2 is for clipboard (tablet), after uninstalling batteries' driver, the order changed, 2 buttons
 trick recovered this. But the fact that 1 battery couldn't be charged is unchanged, I've tried couple times, and am really frustrated.<br />
<br />
It seemed the condition had transformed just a moment, once I can boot the laptop without power supply, and the power condition showed:<br />
42%<br />
Battery 1: 58%<br />
Battery 2: 0% and not charging</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55850356-777f-4e6f-9c82-7d2f5b4a79e6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55850356-777f-4e6f-9c82-7d2f5b4a79e6" /></a></p>
<p><br />
but after a little while after I plugged the power supply, it returned to the bad condition.<br />
<br />
I hope Microsoft can help to fix my device, not to exchange the other one if the problem still exists. But maybe I'll need to wait for couple weeks after the device is fixed?</p>

            <p>I really think it's a firmware problem (but I might be wrong)... battery 2 is functional and completely charged when it is detected (it still occurs for me... less and less often).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I had a discussion with Support Team this morning and they proposed an exchange. Sending it back on monday...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck with yours.</p>

            The problem still exist, and I've chatted with the online staff, seems not possible to get my device back after being fixed since they don't do same-unit repairs, I need to send my device for an exchanged one, they promised the replacement is brand new
 originally but for some technicians would test it, so it will be tagged as refurbished. Is it true that I can get a brand new one or the refurbished one only used by MS technicians? I got mine from online store, some discussion pointed out one can exchange
 a brand new one if he exchanges in a retail store in US, is that true?<br />
<br />
The problem occurred merely about 1 month after I started using it...sigh...

            same but the reason i stopped is because my b button doesn't work and the analog stick wont move all the way for motion. plus i'm too cheap to buy a new controller.

</p><p>Paul from the Xbox Forums Team, It looks like you're experiencing an issue with your controller. What I recommend to do is to create a post about the controller that way we may try and assist you with that. As well you can contact
