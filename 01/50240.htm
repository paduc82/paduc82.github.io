<h2>            malware in Magic Puzzles App STILL</h2>
                    <p>I am so sick of MS Magic Puzzles pop-ups with the malware. I see this has been an issue since at least 2015. Since Windows Defender is my virus and malware security and it keeps saying nothing is wrong, then I have to believe MS WANTS the malware in their
 program. I want id OFF my machine. And I want you to do it free of charge. It's your program and your responsibility.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi LindaN1 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />From the picture, I am not able to make out whether this is due to Magic Puzzles. However, you should additionally scan your system with Malwarebytes. Sometimes, one Antimalware / AV is not effective 100%. 
<br />
<br />Malware Bytes - <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi Linda
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />That site you linked is not Microsoft's website, it is a site pretending to be <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com</a>
<br />
<br />Look at the URL. 
<br />
<br />Its a scam website, its not Microsoft's 'actual' website thats why you are sing that error.
<br />
<br />I just loaded it on my Mac and ESET detected it as a malicious website. 
<br />
<br />2018 has turned out to be a year when fake scare sites have appeared all over the Internet with fake ads pretending to Microsoft support and insisting you call them. You need to watch out for these sites. They look like a genuine Microsoft website but they are not. 
<br />
<br />Warning: There are "Tech Support Scams" pretending to be Windows 10 Support and Activation Technologies. Please be vigilant. Microsoft never calls or emails users to inform them their license is expiring, accounts will be closed or they need access to sensitive information such as passwords or banking information. Neither should you get an email. Learn more in the following article:

            Hi Linda.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That's the Fake Virus scam which can emanate from a mistyped URL it occupies.  If you have a shortcut for Favorite/Bookmark of the site be sure to delete it.  It may have also set itself as your Home page or be lodged in your Browser Add-Ons or Extensions so you'll want to check there and run the scanners I give below.
<br />
<br />Close the Browser window using whichever method is necessary, as it cannot escape the browser unless you download something from the page.  
<br />
<br />If you cannot close the browser window, right click the Task Bar or press Ctrl + Alt + Delete keys to open the Task Manager, choose Show Less Details, highlight the browser and choose End Task. 
<br />
<br />If this fails hold the power button to Shut Down.  If you do this Edge may reload the page when it starts back up, but it will also give you an option to Start Fresh to avoid opening the previous tabs.  
<br />
<br />Also in Edge, if you try to X out of the browser WIndow, it may present a dialogue box to end the session.  The webpage is allowed to put text in the box but cannot stop it from closing the Windows when you choose OK, so that is safe to do.  
<br />
<br />If you called the scammers and they installed anything on your PC, open Settings&gt;Apps &amp; Features, choose Sort by Date, uninstall anything on that date you didn't install yourself. Then run a full scan with Malwarebytes.   In MB settings tell it to search for rootkits. You can turn off the trial version later in it's Account Settings.
<br /><a href="http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti_malware/tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Clean up anything found.  If you are seriously infected with Trojans or Rootkits that show up again when you re-run the scan after cleaning, post back for further instructions.   
<br />
<br />Then check System files for damage with System File Checker from <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />
<br />If you paid them anything, notify your bank that you were scammed.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<p>Thank you. I haven't clicked on any of them. It was popping up every 2 to 3 minutes. I did get the full version of Malwarebytes and that took care of it. The free version did not. This is a recurrent problem with this app. Tell me it's not secure.&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you. I did that right after writing this. The free version didn't take care of it but the full version did. Before running the full version scan, those popup were happening every two to three minutes. VERY frustrating.&nbsp;

<h2>            I want to do a clean install, have all discs, but can&#39;t figure out the very first step. I&#39;ve searched the restore disc, clicking on pretty much everything trying to start the process, which I&#39;m sure will be easy once I get rolling.</h2>
                    This is an HP tower new in 2005. I want to do the clean install because the computer has slowed to a crawl and has way too much stuff. I want to put it in to duty running one special printer for which there is only an XP driver. I have all discs. I am
 stumped at what the initial step is, after which I am confident I can get through it myself.

            With most HPs you press the F11 key as the computer is starting up. There will be a message at the bottom left of your screen telling you what Function key to press to start System Recovery if it isn't F11. So press the correct Function key and in the
 HP System Recovery process choose Advanced to do a full destructive restore to factory condition. Please understand that everything you put on the computer will be gone afterwards, so back up your data first.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work because the factory restore image on the hard drive has been damaged and/or is missing, put Disc 1 of your recovery set into your optical drive. Restart the computer. If the machine doesn't boot from Disc 1, go into the BIOS and change
 the boot order to the CD drive first, hard drive second. There will be a message at the bottom left of your screen when you start the computer that says, "Press [some Function key] to enter Setup. Or there may be another message to press another Function key
 that gives you a temporary boot order menu. In any case, you want to set your computer to boot from the optical drive first and then the HP recovery process will start.

<br />
So why did you tack your question onto a 4-year-old thread that has nothing to do with your question?<br />
<br />
Assuming that you have some version of XP, you can get to Administrative Tools by doing one of the following:<br />
<br />
Go to Start &gt; Control Panel.<br />
If you are using the "Category View," click "Performance and Maintenance" and then click "Administrative Tools"<br />
If you are using the "Classic View," just click the icon for "Administrative Tools"<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Click Start<br />
There may be a link to "Administrative Tools" right on the Start Menu<br />
Or there may be a link to "Administrative Tools" after you click "All Programs"<br />
If neither of those links appears, right-click on the Start button and select Properties.<br />
Click the "Start Menu" tab.<br />
Click the "Customize" button next to the style of Start Menu that you want to use (Classic or XP).<br />
If you're using the XP Start Menu, click the Advanced tab on the "Customize Start Menu" screen<br />
Scroll down and select the option you want.<br />
OK your way out.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Open Windows Explorer<br />
Navigate to C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Administrative Tools<br />
<br />
*********************************************<br />
If the Administrative Tools folder (however you get there) is empty, see <a href="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/admintools.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windowsxp.mvps.org/admintools.htm</a><br />
<br />
*********************************************<br />
<br />
You can also always access each of the Administrative Tools directly, without going to the Administrative Tools folder.&nbsp; To do so, click Start, then click Run.&nbsp; Type one of the following into the "Open" box and click OK.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>For Event Viewer, type eventvwr.msc</li><li>For Services, type services.msc</li><li>For the Performance Monitor, type perfmon.msc</li><li>To access the Local Security Policy <b>if you have XP Pro</b>, type secpol.msc</li><li>To configure Component Services (COM+), type C:\WINDOWS\system32\Com\comexp.msc</li><li>To get to the Computer Management console, type compmgmt.msc&nbsp; (see Note below)</li><li>To Add, remove, or configures Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) data sources and drivers,type odbcad32.exe</li></ul>
<p>Note:&nbsp; You also can open several of these tools (and more) from the Computer Management console.&nbsp; You can open the Computer Management console either by running compmgmt.msc as above or by right-clicking "My Computer" and selecting "Manage."&nbsp; Two of the
 tools available in the Computer Management console but not generally in the Administrative Tools folder can also be accessed directly using Start &gt; Run.</p>
<ul>
<li>To open Device Manager, type devmgmt.msc in the "Open" box</li><li>To open Disk Manager, type diskmgmt.msc in the "Open" box<br />
</li></ul>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are facing this issue. Let me try and assist you with this issue.</p>
<p>1. Have you installed any new hardware recently?&nbsp; <br />
2. Have you updated the display driver or any other device driver? </p>
<p>3. What is the make and model of the PC?<br />
<br />
As the error description suggests, I would suggest you to first update the video card driver and check the issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to refer to the HP website to download and install the latest graphics card driver for Windows 8.1.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>First, download the latest graphics card driver from the manufacturer's website.<br />
</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After downloading it, follow the steps to uninstall the current version and then install the latest one:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Locate the folder which has the latest driver that you have downloaded.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Double Click on the setup file and follow the onscreen instructions.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Restart the computer and check if the issue still persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>For reference, you can refer to the link to troubleshoot display card issue on Windows 8.1:</span></span></span></p>

            quick search of the VEN_8086_DEV_8CB1 is usb3.0, probably motherboard chipset drivers need fixing.

            <p>Thanks,<br />
<br />
I only built the computer a couple of months ago so all of the hardware is new. All of the drivers are up to date, and I have uninstalled and reinstalled the graphics card drivers.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why you referred me to the HP website as I have no HP products on this computer.<br />
<br />
The main reason for posting this problem is because I'm very irritated that there is apparently a solution available for a particular problem, but when I try to view it I am told that I am not connected to the Internet, which is rubbish. It doesn't matter how
 many hours or days I wait as I still get the same unhelpful message every single time.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to refer you to the HP product, it was a confusion. </p>
<p>As suggested by 'Mike', you would probably need fixing the motherboard drivers. I understand that you have replaced the drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you still face the same issue?</p>

<h2>            windows 10 startup screen continuous refresh mode, unable to start</h2>
                    Hi. I have just updated my Win7 laptop to windows 10. Now I have&nbsp;the&nbsp;problem&nbsp;that takes a long time to come up and when the startup page finally&nbsp;appears it keeps refreshing continuously so I am unable to start anything, no programs or task bar or use the
 windows button to bring tiles up. Can anyone help with this issue? Much appreciated.

</p><p>Hi Fanthony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of the Windows 10 family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are facing issues with the Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to create a ISO file of Windows 10 and try to perform the below methods. Check if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a><span>
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">First, I would suggest you to remove all the external devices connected to the computer except keyboard and mouse and check if you are able to boot
 to the desktop.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If the issue still persist, then I would suggest you to create Windows 10 ISO and boot to Windows recovery mode and perform refresh PC and check if
 it helps.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. If you see a message asking you to “<strong><span>Press any key to boot from DVD</span></strong>,” do
 so.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. When you see the Install Windows page, tap or click on
<strong><span>Repair your computer </span>
</strong>to start the <strong><span>Windows Recovery Mode.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the Choose an option screen, tap or click on
<strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5. Click on
<strong><span>Advanced Options</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">6.&nbsp;Then on&nbsp;click on
<strong><span>Startup Repair</span></strong>.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Get back to us for further assistance on Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

            <p>I have the same issue on a HP m7480n. I made the Windows 10 ISO disk and tried Nyima's suggestion to no avail.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting was not helpful nor was the restore option... the only response that I got to the Choose target operating system is - Windows 10 (figures since this is after the update was downloaded and installed) this option is not supported on the &nbsp;operating
 system ypu've selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How ironic?! and maddening!&nbsp;&nbsp; Is a re-install and pray in order or just punt and re-install 8.1?&nbsp;

            <p>This is what I did to fix the Problem:</p>
<p>Turn off computer and restart</p>
<p>As soon as desktop loads, Click the windows button</p>
<p>Click Settings</p>
<p>Click Update and Security</p>
<p>Click Recovery</p>
<p>Click Reset the PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>this will reinstall windows. just make sure you select keep documents so you don't loose anything !
</p>
<p>problem solved !</p>
<p>
</p><p>* This uninstalls Apps, so any installed programs will have to be reinstalled ! Eg: Office, Adobe, etc.....</p>

<p>I really appreciated your post and I was hopeful when I got the notification.</p>
<p>Alas, this was a tactic I tried as well, &nbsp;Several times in fact, but the never ending loop continues and it does not respond to any mouse clicks at all. Ctrl-Alt-Del is the only response I get from the keyboard, too.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi there. I want to report that none of the suggestions have worked but finally I have been able to revert back to my previous Win7 install. Tried the windows button, tried the F4 F5 F6 F8, tried the system restore, tried in safe modes, always made sure
 no anti-virus software is running, checked my graphic card if supported. Now, why bother reinstall or with an iso if the system doesn't start or even if it does there is no guarantees won't happen again: sorry I am happy with win7. Seems that Microsoft has
 not learned the past twenty years of, let say misadventures: win-xp sp1,2,3, win7 updated at plenty of&nbsp;up to 27 every third Wednesday of the month, and not forgetting windows 8.1 and windows vista. I have updated another HP and an old Dell without any problems
 but after this experience have stopped doing upgrades to other machines until windows 10.1 (10.5?) is released. I tried the beta version multiple time and has issues that were not answered like locking of mouse or deletion of internet explorer without warning.</p>
<p>To get the system back, I used the shortcut of 'lock' and restart with the shift key pressed to get to troubleshooting option where I was able to restore the win7 os.</p>
<p>Thanks for your input JB and Brian.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Our environment: HP&nbsp;6500 e709n was tough to install wirelessly but we finally fought it through. This is on a Windows 7 laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We added a Windows 8 laptop with an HP 4620 printer. The result was that we had couldn't print (spooler errors etc) nor could we delete the printer from the control panel. We had Office Depot look at it and they couldn't figure out the "phantom printers"
 either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our solution was to do a clean install of Windows 8 on the new laptop. All problems disappeared. Yes, it was a hassle reinstalling some things like Norton but it was definitely worth the effort. All is AOK and we're happy. My only other comment is that these
 things should not be so&nbsp;difficult. Just because I know how to fly a plane doesn't mean that I have to know how to build one or to flap my arms and fly around the field before getting my license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>btw both printers spend too much time "preening noisily" before going into the ready state and the hinges on the back of the HP 6500 are pretty chintzy.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Denied access&#34; when trying to make changes using &#34;services.msc&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have an impossible malfunction with my computer. I have a second computer connected to my network and in the past I was able to access
</p>
<p>files from either computer according to the sharing setup. Recently when I open Windows Explorer in one computer I cannot find the networked
</p>
<p>computer but if I am on the networked computer number 2 I can see and access number 1.<br />
After a lot of research on the Internet I discovered that I might be having a problem with some of the settings in my main computer which is running
</p>
<p>Windows 7. I opened services.msc and in reviewing the list I found that Computer Browser, DNS Client and TCP/IP NetBIOS helper were all disabled in the StartUp Type column.<br />
When I click on these services and view properties and try and change the Startup Type to Automatic I get a yellow flag stating "Access
</p>
<p>Denied."<br />
I have administrative privleges (also confirmed by a second logon I created as a test) so I don't understand why I am not able to make
</p>
<p>changes to the Startup Type for these services.<br />
I also noticed that Application Identity, BitLocker Drive Enc, Encrypting File Syst, Human Interface Device Access, IKE and AuthIP Ipsec
</p>
<p>Keying, IPsec Policy Agent, KtmRm for Distributed Transaction, Windows Defender, Windows Driver Foundation, Windows Error
</p>
<p>Reporting Service were all disabled and I am denied access to change the startup property.<br />
I ran sfc/scannow and no problems showed up.<br />
I have a backup of my entire file system using Norton Ghost. I cannot use any System Restores as it will delete several programs that I
</p>
<p>recently installed.<br />
Sorry to be long winded but I would like any suggestions as to what to try next to get the Services menu to allow me to make changes to some
</p>
<p>of the services.<br />
Again I have a backup of my earlier files (don't know which ones to restore) and I also considered doing a Repair Install but I don't want any
</p>
<p>additional problems.<br />
Thank you in advance for your help. </p>

            I've done that several times and it doesn't help. The computer thinks it is still in the Eastern Time Zone. I'm in Central. I've also checked location and everything else I can think of. This is a fairly new problem!

            Method 1:
<br />
<br />Check the status of Windows time service.
<br />
<br />a. In the desktop window, Press windows key + R
<br />
<br />b. Type services.msc in run window.
<br />
<br />c. From the services window find 'windows time' and double click on it.
<br />
<br />d. If service status is stopped, click on start and press ok.
<br />
<br />Method 2:
<br />
<br />Check if the correct time is set in the BIOS from the device manual.
<br />
<br />If you are not comfortable accessing the BIOS, please contact the device manufacturer.
<br />
<br />If you still have issues, contact the computer manufacturer and get the CMOS battery check.
<br />
<br />Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause
<br />
<br />serious problems that may prevent your tablet from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.

            I found it difficult to get a refund from Microsoft. &nbsp;I wanted a refund for an app I purchased an hour before and they would not grant it. &nbsp;I told them the app did not work well on my computer and please refund it because I can not use the app because
 it freezes and cuts off. &nbsp;You would have thought I asked for $1000 back, not a simple $10. &nbsp;I am very dissatisfied with their product and service. &nbsp;For a company this big, I can not believe they are short sighted. This even upset my son because he ask me to
 get the game on my computer so I could play with him, but when it did not work, I told him I will just contact them to get the $10 back, no problem. &nbsp;Now he is upset because in his mind, he made me lose $10 and the time downloading and trying to get it to
 work. &nbsp;Nice going Microsoft, you made a little boy cry over $10 . &nbsp;

            I believe you are inadvertently clicking the <i>mouse scroll wheel</i>. On some mice, the wheel can be clicked as well as rotated and this usually has the effect of putting the mouse into
<i>pan</i>&nbsp;mode.<br />
<br />
I don't know the exact make and model of your mouse, but usually you can exit <i>
pan</i>&nbsp;mode by either left clicking the mouse in any blank area or clicking the mouse wheel again. Don't give up on
<i>pan</i>&nbsp;mode immediately. Once you become familiar with its operation, it can be a powerful navigation tool on large documents.

            PLease do not select that option. If you do it so, your unsaved items before Hybernating the system will be lost and please select the other option restart the system so it restarts the system and continues to work like earlier..........

<div>From Help</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Burn a CD or DVD</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If your computer includes a CD or DVD recorder, you can copy files to a </div>
<div>writeable disc. This process is called burning a disc. By default, Windows </div>
<div>burns discs in the Live File System format, but you can also choose to burn </div>
<div>discs in the Mastered format.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To burn a disc using the Live File System format</div>
<div>Insert a writeable CD or DVD into your computer's CD or DVD recorder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the dialog box that appears, click Burn files to data disc.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the Burn a Disc dialog box, type a name for this disc, and then click </div>
<div>Next.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It might take several minutes for the disc to be formatted in the default </div>
<div>Live File System format. When the formatting is complete, an empty disc </div>
<div>folder opens.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Open the folder that contains the files you want to burn, and then drag the </div>
<div>files into the empty disc folder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can copy files to the disc folder by dragging them to the disc icon or </div>
<div>to an open disc folder</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As you drag files into the disc folder, they are copied automatically to the</div>
<div>disc.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To burn a disc using the Mastered format</div>
<div>Choose the Mastered format when you need a highly compatible disc that will </div>
<div>play in computers with an older version of Windows or in media devices such </div>
<div>as CD and DVD players that can read digital music and video files. For more </div>
<div>information about choosing a disc format, see Which CD or DVD format should </div>
<div>I use?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Insert a writeable CD or DVD into your computer's CD or DVD recorder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the dialog box that appears, click Burn files to data disc.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the Burn a Disc dialog box, type a name for this disc, and then click </div>
<div>Show formatting options.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Click Mastered, and then click Next.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>An empty disc folder opens.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Open the folder that contains the files you want to burn, and then drag the </div>
<div>files into the empty disc folder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>On the toolbar, click Burn to disc.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The selected files are copied to the disc. When the disc burning is </div>
<div>complete, the disc burner tray will open and you can remove the disc. You </div>
<div>can now use the disc in another computer or media device. This type of disc </div>
<div>does not need to be closed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Tips</div>
<div>To burn a Mastered disc, you need free space on your hard disk equal to the </div>
<div>capacity of the disc. For a typical CD, this is about 650 megabytes (MB).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you select files to burn but decide not to copy the files to disc, you </div>
<div>can delete the temporary files to recover hard disk space. To delete the </div>
<div>files, open the disc folder, select the files, and then, on the toolbar, </div>
<div>click Delete temporary files.</div>

<h2>            How do I get my laptop-Dell B130-to load the start up menu in safe mode&#63;</h2>
                    I've done everything. I have the original CD in the drive. I can't get the CD to load, yet I hear it trying to read it. I've changed the BIOS setting to have it boot from CD/DVD drive, still nothing. I'm lost. The error message I get on the blue screen
 is "STOP 0000135 winserv not found" I've researched everywhere I can to try &amp; resolve this myself to keep from spending $100+ to get this remedied. I took my laptop-Inspiron 6000-to get it repaired &amp; they had to reimage the hard drive, because of a corrupt
 file that was loaded during one of the updates. Ugh! Just trying to get my husband's working again so he can have one, without having to buy another one. Other than this&nbsp;I just have to get another battery for it! ANY HELP IS GREATLY APPRECIATED!

            I intended too but I can't even access the internet on it to download the file...would it work if I saved on my external hard drive then opened it up? So frustrating!

                    Is there a way to purchase a 1 year subscription? I don't want the added hassle of renewing and making sure the account has the money at the time etc etc etc

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hello Meldince04,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you for posting here on the Xbox forums. At the moment , if you have never had gamepass ultimate, you can convert your current gold and gamepass time into ultimate gamepass without losing any time. To convert, you can buy the
 one month subscription. you will then get the confirmation that all of your time will convert.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This ratio is subject to change, so if you want one year of Ultimate Game Pass then you can get a 12 month gold subscription. afterwards, convert it into Ultimate Game Pass on your console. Note that you can stack up to 3 years of gold,
 and then convert it into 3 years of Ultimate Game Pass.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Parity, I have removed your link to avoid confusion. Meldince is asking for Game pass ultimate 12 month sub, not regular Game pass.</p>
