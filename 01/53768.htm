            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />  Type services.msc in Start Search
<br />
<br />Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Now install Hide Updates Tool from this link:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root.  
<br />
<br />Restart PC, turn back on Windows Update service,   Immediately open the Hide Updates tool to Search for Updates until it shows Version 1709 Feature Update, Hide the Update.
<br />
<br />Now you can wait until you're ready to manually run the Upgrade by installing Media Creation Tool to Upgrade Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I would first optimize the install with the steps here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Help with xbox live MTU - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> underseamedal1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help with xbox live MTU</h2>
                    
<p>A few months ago, I began to experience issues with my xbox live connection. I'd assume they had go away. I've owned this xbox for almost 3 years now and I have not had any issues with the connection until a few months ago. Upon attempting to connect to
 xbox live I received the error about the MTU. I went to the website and followed the support and learned that that error usually did not mean we didn't have a sufficient MTU. I went through the whole support on this topic and yet it did not help.</p>
<p>Due to this, whenever I attempt to connect to Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood or Black Ops multiplayer it tells me the server is offline most of the time(when it obviously is not) and I cannot play games that use multiplayer to the fullest. I have purchased
 18 months of xbox live and I do not want them to go to waste.</p>
<p>The odd thing is, when I try to connect through the connection tests, it fails to. But outside of the connection test I can connect to xbox live without any issues from signing into my gamertag. I'm not sure at all what this means.</p>
<p>It has been fluctuative, of course. Occasionally It may tell me my connection is fine and that I'm fine and dandy connected to xbox live but the errors soon return. I'd really like to get help with this issue because I want to use the xbox to the fullest.</p>
<p>Please note I have never had this issue up until a few months ago. My connection is wireless and on the xbox it says it has 4 full bars.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, one more question - How do we change our windows live ID from the website? Thank you.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>You already wrote, that you know that the MTU error doesn't necessarily mean you have really a MTU Problem. To troubleshoot the real problem, we need to find out, if the problem is your wireless connection in your home, or your
 WAN internetconnection "outside" (i.e. the responsibility of your provider). </p>
<p>So please, if possible, try to connect the Xbox with an ethernet cord instead of wirelessly. Try if the problem persists. If it is gone, see if you got any new wireless equipment like cordless phones, a microwave or neighbours
 with WLAN. Other equipment broadcasting in the 2.4GHz range can lead to problems and intermittent connection loss of your WLAN.
</p>
<p>If you also get MTU error messages when you are on a LAN cable, try to reboot your router. Unplug the power cord, wait 30 seconds, and plug it in again. As stupid as this sounds: A friend had a router, with a firmware error.
 If the router was running for a long time, a routing table or something like that wasn't cleared properly and "overflowed". So connecting to an address, present in that list worked flawlessly. But "new" pages wouldn't work.
</p>
<p>Restarting the router helped. Also check if there is a new firmware of your router.</p>
<p>[quote user="UnderseaMedal1"]...</p>
<p>Also, one more question - How do we change our windows live ID from the website? Thank you.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>As far as I know, the only way to change it is from within your console. You need to recover the Gamertag you have on the website, and change the Live ID there.</p>

<p>Since you're using a wireless setup, do you happen to have any 3rd party accessories? Examples here would be Turtle Beach brand headsets like the X31s that have a base station that plugs in via USB to the console.</p>

<h2>            Racers&#58; In-Car view or External &#40;behind the car&#41; view&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This is a hugely important factor in how good a racing game is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forza3 is a good example of a racer where the handling is brilliant in ALL camera views.</p>
<p>Sega Rally and SHIFT2 are good examples of racers where the handling from external views is AWFUL because the cars jump and jerk around, but when you switch to in-car or bonnet angles it suddenly comes alive.</p>
<p>MotoGP 10/11 is one of the few which has poor in-car(bike) views but good external view controls.</p>
<p>I think the views you have are make or break for a racer.</p>
<p>Is there one view you ALWAYS use regardless? Or are you able to mix it up as I do depending on how it feels??</p>

<p>I always have to have it in 3rd person in driving games, no idea why, just feels more natural that way. Of course it doesn't work so well irl as proven in the Rooster Teeth Video Game Car Immersion video but it still feels natural in games.</p>
<p>Only time I use First Person when driving is in a game like Battlefield so I can see the HUD of the Tank or whatever, proper racing games are always 3rd Person for me.</p>

<p>In car view only for me, also use the handlebar view on bikes in PGR4. The only time I use a 3rd person view is on some heavy rain races in F1 2010, mainly because I can't see a thing in cockpit view with the spray from other cars.</p>

<p>Depends on the game, F1 2010 i always use the "T cam", TDU 2 i use the bonnet cam but most other racing games i tend to use the furthest out view of the car/bike as possible.</p>

<p>Good mix so far then.....haven't you noticed any games where the 3rd person view feels bolted onto the game and the car reacts extremely badly to the road? I found this most noticeable in SHIFT 1 and 2 and TDU2.</p>

<p>I totally agree - always use the behind the car view. In car views make me feel ill to be honest.</p>
<p>With a rally game, i can set myself up for a corner far better when i use the behind car view as well.</p>

    <title>Trying to kill all the Skype Processes in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neil weicher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to kill all the Skype Processes in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Skype used to have a useful feature where you could select to have Skype <em>not</em> launch with Windows. Now that feature has been taken away and Skype
<em>always</em> starts with Windows.&nbsp; <em>I</em> want to choose when Skype is running. I have tried creating a CMD script that kills all the Skype processes I could find:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">taskkill.exe /f /im skype.exe<br />
taskkill.exe /f /im skypeapp.exe<br />
taskkill.exe /f /im SkypeBackgroundHost.exe<br />
taskkill.exe /f /im SkypeBridge.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>That seems to do it for a while, but like the walking dead, after a while the Skype processes start up again!&nbsp; How do I stop that so I can control when Skype is running?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft: please bring back the feature where we decide when to launch Skype.</p>
<p>

            Hi Neil
<br />
<br />This problem is specific to the Skype for Windows 10 App, you should uninstall that and run the Skype for Windows Application instead, it has the setting to stop Skype automatically starting with Windows
<br />
<br />That full Skype Desktop application is the bottom option on the drop down on this page:

<p><span>Can you please provide us&nbsp;the version of Windows Photo Gallery you are using? To know the version, launch the client, click on
<b>File</b> and select <b>About</b> <b>Photo</b> <b>Gallery</b>. Can you hear the sound of the video when playing it using a media player? Does the issue persist when using different video?</span></p>
<p><span>For now, please&nbsp;repair your&nbsp;Photo Gallery to rule&nbsp;out the possibility of corrupted program files in your client. Here are the
 steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Go to

</b>2. Under <b>Programs,</b> click <b>Uninstall a Program</b>.<br />
3. Locate<b> Windows Essential 2011</b>or <b>Windows Essentials 2012</b>&nbsp;and then click
<b>Uninstall/Change</b>.<br />
4. When a window appears, select <b>Repair all Windows Essentials programs</b>.<br />
5. Restart your computer after the repair.</span></p>
<p><span>Please inform us if the issue still persists.</span></p>

            Hi JosephLinhoss 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To diagnose it further, let me know when do you get this error? Do you get this error during Windows update?

            <p><em>* Merged </em></p>
<p><em>* Original title: Win 10</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>First let me start by saying this is the worst website I have ever used.&nbsp; Have spent three hour try to replay to a help email I got from Vijay_Verma.&nbsp; Typed a whole page and&nbsp; when I went to upload a few things lost the typed reply.&nbsp; Have trouble with live
 mail, and win 10 and Microsoft are terrible.&nbsp; Now having said that can anyone tell how to find replies from this person?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Uploaded some things for that person to look at, could not type anything!</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Ran sfc/scannow, found numerous integrity problems and fixed them.&nbsp; Have ran it again and still no problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; As Vijay_Verma suggested, tried running win 10 update trouble shooter.&nbsp; Run windows update-apply this fix-pending updates for this machine-apply this fix-resolving problems-one trouble shooting step to resolve WU issues is to delete and re download updates
 to your computer-would you like to try this step-apply fixed.&nbsp; Fixed all but one issue-re ran WU-went through all the steps and now shows all issues all resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Went into Task Manager-almost everything had stopped running-a lot of things had stopped running-went through everyone and restarted-by the time I finished most had stopped running-window defender and another anti virus I have would not start running
 again.&nbsp; Reran sfc/scannow and windows update trouble shooter-everything is fixed with these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; On shut down-get message-explorer.exe-application error-the instruction error at 0x00007FF8E038055C referred memory at 0x00007FF8A29E3EB0-the memory could not be read-click ok to terminate the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; How to remove Photo Add on-get message-couldn't install-will try shortly.&nbsp; Has been doing this for months and cannot get rid of it in notifcations</p>
<p>
</p><p>7.&nbsp; Have pinkish horizontal line about eight inches from right side of monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8.&nbsp; Have all types of issues with printing-can copy from the internet and prints fine-such as coupons-scan and save documents, pictures etc-when I try to print them colors are not correct-if tries to print in color have lines running through it.&nbsp; Have run
 printer trouble shooter-nothing is wrong-have run all cleaning and alignment of printing heads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9.&nbsp; Every time I type all this crap out and try to upload pictures and documents thinking that might help you all to resolve these issues, half will not upload or I loose all this and have to start over.&nbsp; Where can I save these drafts for further reference.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Keyboard won&#39;t type&#59; it just beeps</h2>
                    
<p>I was working on my computer (Windows XP) and must've held a key down too long.&nbsp; I got a brief error message--can't remember what it said--and now none of the keys works; I just get a beep when I press a key.&nbsp; Oddly, when I log off and move to my wife's
 side of the same computer (same keyboard, obviously) the keyboard works like normal.</p>
<p>What did I do?</p>

            It sounds like you enabled Sticky Keys. Go to Control Panel&gt;Accessibility Options and disable everything.

            If you press "Shift" key for Five (5) consecutive times then the sticky key gets activated. I also think it's due to Sticky Keys.<br />

<h2>            Voicemail - won&#39;t stay enabled</h2>
                    When I select forward calls to voicemail and push confirm everything seems OK. But when I navigate away from this screen "call forwarding and voicemail" is still shown as disabled. I have tried logging in and out again and trying this on the app, browser
 and my phone. Same problem with all of them and zero help from the Skype agent. Any suggestions?

            Hi InstaBram,
<br />
<br />I'm an independent advisor here to help.
<br />
<br />You should chat with a live Skype support agent from here:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/s...</a>
<br />
<br />Select either:
<br />
<br />Payments and purchases
<br />Account, Profile and sign in
<br />Privacy and security
<br />
<br /> Then click on chat.       
        </p>

            Thanks, but I already tried the live Skype agent. Unfortunately they are shockingly unhelpful and the last one rebooted my computer in a fit of aggression before logging off the remote access.

 the factory) Windows 7 looks at the motherboard and sees the special instructions and Self-Activates. (that's why you did not need to Activate your computer after you brought it home)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;COA SLP:<b> This is the Product key that you see on the sticker on the side (or bottom,[ or inside the battery compartment]) of your computer</b>. It is a valid product key, but should only be used in limited situations (such as if the OEM SLP key
 stops self-activating for whatever reason). The key must be activated by Phone. (Note: All manufacturers that use the OEM SLP system are required by contract to include a Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker, that has a COA SLP key, on the computer)</span></p>

            <p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just released that there are more applications not working and not just the IE. Reading other posts I guess the problem has to do with corrupted file:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Advanced.Theme-Dark_Scale-100.png"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this file?</p>
<p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank for replying us back with the above information.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>1.</strong> Sign out from the current user account, restart the&nbsp;PC and login to the
<br />
Admin account or the Microsoft Account to test if that helps with this <br />
issue.</div>
<div>Also, Install any pending Windows updates on the PC to check if that <br />
helps.<br />
Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix <br />
problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing <br />
experience.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;You can try logging into other user account (If any).&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>3.</strong> Lets perform a Clean boot and see if the issue persist.</div>
<div>&nbsp;
<p>A clean boot starts Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup <br />
programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a <br />
program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Refer the below given article to know, how to perform a clean boot in <br />
Windows:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Note :</strong><br />
Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in "How to reset the
<br />
computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" to reset <br />
computer as usual.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>Keep us posted with the status of the issue. We’ll be glad to assist if you <br />
need further assistance.</div>

<h2>            Connected... But Not Connected</h2>
                    
<p>So Xbox has been a bit weird with my account for the past week. I went to sign in my account, which was already on my hard drive, and it would tell me somewhere along the line of "Can't download this profile at this time". Thinking it was a little weird,
 I decided to see what would happen if I tried re-downloading the account. The same error would come up. I'd like to say it's my console, but it happened on every system I went on.</p>
<p>The problem is now currently resolved (I believe) and I can get on my account. I can join parties, shoot messages, complete downloads, and access the cloud; However, regardless of having a perfect connection test to my router, the internet, and Xbox Live,
 if I have the rare chance to at least have terrible connection to a game, I have no connection to any games.</p>
<p>Given that I have no errors connecting to any of the three requirements (as well as recently purchasing a gold account), I'm at a loss for how this problem could be fixed, or why I'm receiving this phantom connection.</p>

<p>yes i did create a new one. see my WLID used to be linked to 2 gamertags but i fixed that. i was able to link this gamertag to this new WLID that i am on right now but, the other WLID is still linked to my GT on the xbox. it is not recognized by xbox.com
 that this is so. I just want to switch it to a new one so i can take advantage of all the online(PC, winodws phone etc.) stuff that you can do.

<p>the one that i am on xbox.com with now is NOT the one i want. I thought it was impossible as well but it wasn't. I digress. The real problem here is that the GT on my Xbox doesn't have any association with xbox.com. And when i try to switch to a NEW WLID
 the error comes up. THAT'S the problem. &nbsp; </p>

<p>May I ask a question too?</p>
<p>When I was trying to log in at XboxLive.com I accidentally filled in my WindowsLive data... so a new XboxLive Account was set up. I didn’t want this and it is totally unused. But this unwanted Account is preventing my from connecting my real WLID with my
 real, used GT. My GT is currently connected with a WLID especially set up for this GT (when i was creating my GT i did not have a WLID and when i was creating my WLID i did not know about the possibility of connecting)</p>
<p>I am German and hope you can understand my bad English :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ah I just saw that this is the new created, unwanted GT.</p>
<p>&lt;-</p>
<p>Thanks for your support.</p>

            Which edition of Windows 7 came preinstalled on the Netbook?<br />
<br />
If its Windows 7 Starter, see the following instructions for reinstalling:<br />
<br />
Borrow a friends Genuine Windows 7 DVD disc if you know someone who has one.<br />
<br />
If you can't, download one of the following:<br />
Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bit<br />
http://msft-dnl.digitalrivercontent.net/msvista/pub/X15-65732/X15-65732.iso<br />
<br />
You are going to edit the contents of the .ISO file and remove the ei.cfg file. After editing burn it to a blank DVD disk or put it on a thumb drive. Boot from it, this will reveal all editions of Windows 7, select the Starter edition. More information in the
 following article about how to edit the ei.cfg file<br />
<br />
Ei.cfg Removal Utility Lets You Use Any Product Key<br />
http://lifehacker.com/5438005/eicfg-removal-utility-lets-you-use-any-product-key-with-your-windows-7-disc<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
we will edit the image and remove the ei.cfg file so we can reveal all editions of Windows 7 during the installation and select Windows 7 Starter. Lets take a look at doing it step by step.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After downloading the eicfg removal utility, you need to extract, since its in a .zip file. Just right click it and click Extract All.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Double click the eicfg_remover.exe file to launch it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Browse to where the Windows 7 Image (.ISO file) is stored, select it and click Open.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That’s it! the ei.cfg file is now removed. The next step now is to reinstall Windows 7 Starter. Because most Netbooks do not include a DVD drive, you will have to use a tool such as the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool (http://store.microsoft.com/Help/ISO-Tool)
<br />
This simple tool will help you convert the same image file into to a USB thumb drive. For installation purposes, you should get a thumb drive that’s at least 4 GBs in size to store the installation files. Browse to where the Windows 7 Image is stored, open
 it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Select the USB device where you want to have the backup stored to for installation.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Once the USB device has been identified, click the Begin copying button.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And that’s it, the next step now is to boot your Netbook from the thumb drive, make sure the thumb drive you will be installing Windows 7 from is plugged into the USB port. This might vary by manufacturer, but the usual one to try is F12, start your Netbook
 and press F12 repeatedly until a screen is displayed giving you the option to boot from a USB Memory device, select that and press Enter on your keyboard.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Windows 7 will boot as it normally does into the setup environment, the only difference this time is, you will be given a choice to select the edition of Windows 7 you want to reinstall. Carefully click through during the setup wizard.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Select Windows 7 Starter and proceed with the installation as normal. I suggest that you create a backup once the installation is complete.

<p>
</p><p>Have noticed the mail saved in various folders in W10 Mail App does not match with what have saved in the same folders when accessing Hotmail/Outlook account via the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have clicked sync button in W10 when folder is open to sync with web based Hotmail/Outlook without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can folders in W10 Mail App be made to contain mail saved in web based Hotmail/Outlook account?</p>
<p>

            <p>Krishna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No when running sync with a folder there have been no error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Noticed the absence of saved emails in various folders immediately after W10 was installed and started to work with W10 mail. In fact after 3 weeks of W10 Mail App not being functional and having the W10 Mail app become functional again because of Level
 2 technical support noticed that folders had less saved emails vs. the time when W10 Mail started to work. Baffling!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran the troubleshooter and noted the following message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problems Found: No rootcauses found and created logs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also went back to W10 Mail and ran sync with a few folders with no results as the folders did not match what I know exists when accessing Hotmail/Outlook via the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again baffling......is there something else?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I</span><span> appreciate your efforts towards trying to resolve the issue and
</span><span>I will certainly help you with this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue could be caused due to some incorrect settings, pending updates or due to an issue with the Mail app itself. If it is the Mail app, let’s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Make sure your computer is up to date:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1: </strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Please check your Windows updates (including optional updates).</p>

<p><strong><span><span><br />
</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue still persists, follow method 2.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Sync app licenses</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>If a license for an app is out of sync with the license installed on your PC, the app might stop working.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To sync your app licenses, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>On the Start screen, tap or click <strong>Store</strong> to open the Windows Store.

<strong>Settings</strong>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then click
<strong>Settings</strong>.) </span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Tap or click <strong>App updates</strong>. </span>
</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Tap or click <strong>Sync licenses</strong></span></span></li></ol>

<p>This is a homegroup? You can't use Windows XP on a homegroup. Change<br />
it to a workgroup.</p>

            <span>Problems sharing files between computers on a network are generally caused by 1) a misconfigured firewall or overlooked firewall (including a stateful firewall in a VPN); or 2) inadvertently running two firewalls such as the
 built-in Windows Firewall and a third-party firewall; and/or 3) not having identical user accounts and passwords on all Workgroup machines; 4) trying to create shares where the operating system does not permit it.<br />
<br />
In Windows 7, go to Control Panel&gt;All Control Panel Items&gt;Network and Sharing Center. Click on "Change advanced sharing settings".<strong>You don't want to use Homegroup unless you have all Windows 7 machines</strong> . The Windows 7 network type should be
 "Home" or "Work", not "Public". In the Advanced Sharing:<br />
<br />
Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">ON</span> network discovery<br />
Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">ON</span> file and printer sharing<br />
Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">ON</span> sharing in the Public folder sharing section<br />
Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">ON</span> password protected sharing<br />
<br />
A. Configure firewalls on all machines to allow the Local Area Network (LAN) traffic as trusted. With Windows Firewall, turning on Window's File and Printer Sharing as above will take care of this for you. In XP you can run the Network Setup Wizard or just
 enable File/Printer Sharing in the Windows XP Firewall's exceptions. If you aren't running a third-party firewall or have an antivirus/security program with its own firewall component, then you're fine.&nbsp; With third-party firewalls,&nbsp;I usually configure the
 LAN allowance with an IP range. Ex. would be 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.254. Obviously you would substitute your correct subnet. Refer to any third party security program's Help or user forums for how to properly configure its firewall. Do not run more than one
 firewall. <span style="font-weight: bold">DO NOT TURN OFF FIREWALLS; CONFIGURE THEM CORRECTLY.</span><br />
<br />
B. For ease of organization, put all computers in the same Workgroup. This is done from the System applet in Control Panel, Computer Name tab.<br />
<br />
C. Create matching user accounts and passwords on all machines. You do not need to be logged into the same account on all machines and the passwords assigned to each user account can be different; the accounts/passwords just need to exist and match on all machines.<span style="font-weight: bold">DO
 NOT NEGLECT TO CREATE PASSWORDS, EVEN IF ONLY SIMPLE ONES</span> . If you wish a machine to boot directly to the Desktop (into one particular user's account) for convenience, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).<br />

</span><span><br />
D. If one or more of the computers on your network is XP Pro or Media Center, turn off Simple File Sharing (Folder Options&gt;View tab).<br />
<br />
E. Create shares as desired. In Windows 7 I usually share out the user's Desktop and the Public directory.<br />
<br />
F. After you have file sharing working (and have tested this by exchanging a file between all machines), if you want to share a printer connected locally to one of your computers, share it out from that machine. Then go to the printer mftr.'s website and download
 the latest drivers for the correct operating system(s). Install them on the target machine(s). The printer should be seen during the installation routine. If it is not, install the drivers and then use the Add Printer Wizard. In some instances, certain printers
 need to be installed as Local printers but that is outside the scope of this response.<br />
