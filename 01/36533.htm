<h2>            my windows xp cd setup disc not working &#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    hello all :)<br />
<br />
my dad works in a hotel , and in there is an it manager. i asked him to give me the cd for windows xp setup. he gave me a fully licensed one with the product key on a sticker tag . the problem my pc won't boot from it. he gave me 3 others to try but same result.
 it came up that my rom drive is only for dvd discs. the second i boot from a windows 7 dvd or vista , it goes auto matically.<br />
<br />
<br />
if will tell me that your drivers won't work with windows xp , then i already tried it buring an iso to a dvd . and installing my drivers again , worked perfectly !!<br />
<br />
<br />
i just want to ask , if i download an iso image for windows xp , and used one of the product key the it manager has , would it from my right or not?<br />

            Sorry, there is no download of Windows XP available.&nbsp; Also, installing software that was&nbsp;taken from a company (a hotel) is not a very good idea since once the hotel discovers the software missing, it will likely be reported and the installation will soon
 become "non-genuine" and therefore non-functional.

            <p>It sounds as if either the disks aren't 'normal', or the CD &nbsp;laser in your DVD drive has died (there are two lasers in CD/DVD drives, and I know of no DVD drive that isn't also a CD drive)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can your PC play or recognise a normal audio CD?</p>
<p>what about other data CD's?</p>
<p>If the CD laser is broken, then you need to replace the drive.</p>

            <p>In that case your system needs attention</p>
<p>Put the XP CD in the player, and reboot the machine - make sure that the option is to boot from teh CD.</p>
<p>Coes that work?</p>
<p>If it does, then there's comething wrong with the drivers in windows.&nbsp; If it can't boot becuase it can't see the CD, then it's a problem with the drive.</p>

            <p>You said that it used to be able to read CDs - therefore it could be either a hardware problem or a software one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's the make and model of the drive?</p>
<p>You can use a thumb drive to re/install XP - but you need a functional CD reader to do it.</p>
<p>You can transfer the files to the HD - but you need a functional CD reader to to it.</p>
<p>You need to get the reader working, or replaced.</p>

<p>I'm using an Acer Aspire 5741 with a broadcom 802.11n network adapter, with a broadcom netlink gigabit ethernet<br />
I have bridged my ethernet port and wireless card together, and my laptop <br />
can access the internet just fine, but my xbox will not connect to the internet at all.<br />
I can hook it up to the router and get access just fine, any suggestions?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Build 17134.rs4 180410-1804 Installs Updates During Active Hours</h2>
                    <p>Good day support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not the first time this happens in my computer, that during the day (Active hours) I have programs running in the background, programs that take hours to render, programs that analyze data that take hours to produce a reconciliation document and all
 interrupted because of windows restarting the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I can't find all the right words to describe the frustration and the helplessness derived from Microsoft's actions, I can tell you this:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have gone thru the documentation to set Active hours</li><li>I have marked my connection metered</li><li>I am updated policies to prevent restarting the computer</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>And the computer reboots to finish installing&nbsp;updates, and not only this; I sometimes read "Windows is undoing changes due to failed updates."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows attempts to open all my previous programs. However, it cannot resume the work done from all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please assist in disabling updates for good?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be in control of my computer</li><li>Decide when I am installing updates</li><li>Choose if any security patches or hotfixes are installed or not</li><li>keep my programs from breaking because of untested updates</li><li>I do not need the latest and greatest, much less the shiniest windows, I want windows to work and let me work</li><li>if my computer is at risk and I can lose work, it is my responsibility, and it is my consequence if I fail to address updates, however, I want to control this.</li></ul>
<p>Can someone reach out and assist me with a definite solution?</p>

            Hi Francisco.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I am very sorry that you're experiencing this.  I think your voice needs to be heard by Microsoft.   If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. I will also track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />The latest supposed controls on Windows Update are detailed here, although I think you already know most of them and what you're experiencing is their utter failure:  <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-update-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-up...</a>
<br />
<br />But it's disturbing that neither Active Hours or Metered Connection is stopping the restarts.  This could go to the quality of the install.  In Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the install, the reason no tech enthusiast will even run a factory or Upgrade install because they'd expect endless issues.  For example there are no reported problems at all by those who do this gold standard  install  which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Short of that I would go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>My windows file is 26gb on a 50gb harddrive. Please help&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baronyx  say:</h3>
<h2>            My windows file is 26gb on a 50gb harddrive. Please help&#33;</h2>
                    Recently, whilst troubleshooting for a game I installed (redownloading DirectX files and things like that - not important) I noticed i've got far less space on my C: drive than i actually use. Upon further inspection i found that my windows file is taking
 up 26gb! On a disk only 49gb large!<br />
<br />
This is insane, and i need to reduce this. I have another drive (D:) that stores all my music and games and everything useful - even my user files are on there. But this C: drive is the only drive that most system programs will happily install to, so it needs
 to have a little more space! (Right now i have 1gb free).<br />
<br />
Please can anyone advise on how to reduce the size of this file? 25gb for a OS is absolutely ridiculous!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have tried running diskcleanup but it gave me ~150mb back - not really enough :(<br />
<br />
Any help would be massively appreciated. I can't use this machine while it's like this.<br />
<br />
Thanks - Baronyx

            <p>The reported size for the Windows directory is frequently inaccurate. See:</p>

<p>49GB is really too small. You can save some space by turning of hibernation if you can do without it and moving the pagefile to another volume.</p>

            Ah thanks, Turning off hibernate got me back 4gb. (I do kind of use it but for the space i'll have to just turn off my comp instead)<br />
<br />
I was given this PC, pre-set-up with a 50gb C: drive and a 650gb D: drive. I can only assume whoever set up the computer had no idea what they were doing there. I'm told its a partition - would it be beneficial to remove the partition and make it one drive?
 (I'm not sure what that would entail im just throwing out keywords to be honest)<br />
<br />
If the windows directory filesize IS inaccurate - it's affecting my whole PC. I literally have little else stored on my C drive, but for a few programs that refused to change installation locations.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My winsxs folder is also 12gb big. I'm told there are ways of reducing that, but i wouldn't know any of them.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is it possible to decrease this windows size? Or if it's lying about its size, can it let my PC know? Having free space thats just labelled as used is really no help :(

            <p>It looks like you've got 4GB of RAM. The paging file could be up to 12GB. So you could gain from moving the paging file to the D:/ volume.</p>
<p>The paging file settings can be found as described here:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-the-size-of-virtual-memory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-the-size-of-virtual-memory</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The built-in Windows partitioning tool is almost certainly not going to work in this situation, unless you can completely empty the D:/ partition. There are third party programs which might be able amalgamate the partitions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Used and Free Space shown on the drive properties are accurate. The size of folders shown by Explorer are not accurate for System Files. They can either be double counted for hard links or be omitted because of access permission issues. For example,
 file in System32 are hard linked to files in WinSxS so there is only one copy on disk but Explorer will count&nbsp;them twice when calculating the size of the Windows folder.</p>
<p>12GB is around average for WinSxS. It's not recommended to modify this folder. At least, it could&nbsp;affect the ability to apply updates. If you've not already done so, use the 'Clean up System Files'&nbsp;option in Disk Cleanup and delete any previous Windows installation
 and Service Pack backups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To dig down into what is&nbsp;using the space use<a href="http://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Treesize Free</a>. There may be applications using space in your AppData folder.&nbsp;</p>

            I use windirstat to check the file size - explorer gives me a completely different value for winSxS, but WDS says 12gb.<br />
<br />
As for moving the paging file - my computer already tells me that my Paging file is on the D drive i think. It lists "none" under C: and "system managed" under D:<br />
<br />
With that in mind surely i should have more room on my C drive :/

<h2>            Getting SP4, Book... disappointment</h2>
                    <p>Hello all, and to MS, I watched the Windows 10 Devices event live, and at the time I'd decided to buy a SP4. I did a little hands on at Bestbuy and love it even more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thoughts on Surface Book... SAD.</p>
<p>"We made a laptop"...</p>
<p>1) I'd love to carry ONE piece instead of TWO... Oh, wait, no no... THREE!! You made a LAPTOP, and still no PEN STORAGE, sorry but that's a no.</p>
<p>2) d/GPU at "Keyboard", great thought! It suppose to get hot...? With side blowing fans will the heat still coming up from the keyboard? Isn't the keyboard on any laptop one of the mean heat distribute sources... no? And you manage to put a "powerful" PC
 on top of a heat output? Bravo</p>
<p>3) I need to pull the screen off, flip it, clip it back in, and flat it out... when I want to type again, I will need to do the same thing all over again... seriously????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think MS needs learn it from Lenovo's yoga, many companies already did. That one piece is so great. You put more battery in it, d/GPU, maybe CPU in it, it will still be a pad, make it light and you've done it. Dig a hole in the base and stick that pen
 in there. Imagine, at the event you have this device and you talk about pen storage, you store the pen from the bottom and it goes up by itself using magnetic pull. I don't know about the others, but I'd go nuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think SP4 will be a great success, Book............................................</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you agree with me?</p>

    <title>Windows Vista timeout of internet connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john blunt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Vista timeout of internet connection</h2>
                    A problem has suddenly appeared in the past week after a year without snags in my access to hotmail, yahoo mail etc.<br />
If I try to attach a file it fails to load in hotmail, in yahoo i get a message saying it is taking longer than usual and then it says there is probably a connectivity problem.<br />
#Any messages where the text is more than a few lines also fail to send. I get a message saying there has been a timeout.<br />
This problem occurs with all mailo servers and using at least 3 different browsers on the computer which has been hit. It is not an ISP problem, since another computer with windows XP performs normally.<br />
I have tried using system restore&nbsp; tgo back to the date before the problem appeared but that makes no difference. i have switched off all spyware, vuirus proection etc but that seems not to help.<br />
The computer is an HP pavilion bought 15 months ago. The checking tool says the system is working perfectly.<br />
Might something have changed in the registry to cause these timeouts? i can't find where that might be so have not risked any changes.

<p>
<span>Hi John Blunt,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Vista answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>I have few steps here that might fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest that you boot the computer in Safe Mode with Networking and check if you are able to connect to the websites without any issues, follow the steps below to boot
 the computer in Safe Mode with Networking:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Restart your computer if it is powered on.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tap the F8 key continuously after your computer initially powers on.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Once you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.</span></p>
<p>
<span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Use the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.</span></p>
<p>
<span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select Safe Mode with Networking and press Enter.</span></p>
<p>
<span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You should see drivers loading, and then please wait.</span></p>
<p>
<span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You should then be at the Welcome Screen.</span></p>
<p>
<span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Refer the link to boot in Safe mode with networking:
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/323ef48f-7b93-4079-a48a-5c58eec904a11033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/323ef48f-7b93-4079-a48a-5c58eec904a11033.mspx</a></span></p>
<p>
<span>Once you are in Safe mode, now check if you can access the websites and able to attach the files. If you are able to access the websites, I recommend that you boot the computer
 in clean boot the i.e. disable non Microsoft services. The purpose of disabling non Microsoft services is to check if any of these services is causing the issue. Go to Step 2, follow the steps below to boot the computer in clean boot:</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>User Account Control permission, If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>5. Click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>6. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the issue is resolved check which third party is causing the problem, referring the link given below:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p>
<span>Note: Ensure to boot the computer in normal startup type, follow Step 7 in the above link.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the issue persists, go to Step 3</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>I would suggest that you reset the internet explorer settings on the computer, follow the steps in the given link:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213</span></a></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>If the issue still persists, go to Step 4.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 4:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>I recommend that you uninstall and reinstall the drivers for the network adapter, follow the steps below to uninstall the drivers for the network adapter:</span></p>
<p>
<span>Click Start&gt;&gt; type in Device Manager in the Start Search&gt;&gt; expand Network Adapters in the Device Manager window&gt;&gt; right click on the device&gt;&gt; click Properties&gt;&gt; click on the driver
 tab&gt;&gt; click uninstall&gt;&gt; Click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Now restart the computer which should automatically install the drivers for the network adapter. Now check if you are able to connect to the internet.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 5:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>If the above steps do not fix the issue, you may have to repair the network connection, refer the link:

            Thanks for this. I have done everything except Step 4 without success. The reason I did not do that is I get a warning message saying the driver files will be permanently deleted iof I do? is that OK? how will i connect to the network to get replacement
 drivers if the current ones are removed ( as you can see, I am not an expert in these issues.)

            <p>System Idle process is the "spare" time when other tasks are not demanding CPU activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A CPU always runs at 100%, it cannot do anything else. If everything else needs 5% of the CPU time, idle process is 95%</p>

            You delete a compressed file just the way you delete any other file, <span style="font-weight: bold">
BUT</span> ...<br />
<br />
you may not really want to delete those "compressed old files."&nbsp; By default, the Disk Cleanup tool in Windows XP will compress files that have not been used for 50 days.&nbsp; You may well want to keep files that you haven't accessed in the past two months.<br />
<br />
You can change the period that Disk Cleanup uses to determine if a file is "old" --&gt;

http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows/make-disk-cleanup-compress-olderor-newer-files-on-xp/</a><br />
<br />
However, many people (myself included) just disable the scan for "old files" because it makes Disk Cleanup run much faster:&nbsp; see, e.g., --&gt;
<a href="http://www.pctools.com/forum/showthread.php?49060-Disable-Compress-Old-Files-in-Disk-cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.pctools.com/forum/showthread.php?49060-Disable-Compress-Old-Files-in-Disk-cleanup</a>&nbsp; Or
<a href="http://www.kellys-korner-xp.com/xp_tweaks.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.kellys-korner-xp.com/xp_tweaks.htm</a> Line 48 right side (Note that there are two links, one to disable "compress old files" and one to re-enable it; these reg files also change the way Disk
 Cleanup treats temporary files -- by default, temporary files accessed within the past 7 days are not deleted; the first of Kelly's reg files changes this to 0 days and the "undo" file restores the 7 day default).

<h2>            Windows 7 is slow and unresponsive</h2>
                    <div>original title:&nbsp;Unresponsive, slow &nbsp;Win7</div>
Hi, &nbsp;<br />
<br />
i see many similar problems but do not see any solution relevant to my problem. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
All programs are opening VERY SLOW in win7, in fact i have anything between 11 - 25 sec delay when opening a file. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Case A - Excel&nbsp;<br />
I will have excel open and if i load a sheet via explorer, excel becomes "not responding" for 11 seconds &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Case 2 deactivating all programs under msconfig does not render any better response. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
creating another user account does not render a solution. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Somebody please advise. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
thanks in advance

<h2>            Windows defender</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with the security center. I noticed recently, that the defender real-time protection is grayed out (I can't turn it on) and also the security icon in task manager is showing, but when I point at it with a mouse it disappears (as in it crashes).
 I installed Malwarebytes at some point which put over 600 files into quarantine. Now I have another anti-virus working on my computer. Now, the updates give me an error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"There were some problems installing updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for information, this may help: (0x80070424)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also clicking on updating defender threat definition doesn't do anything.&nbsp;</p>

            Hello LukaszDziechciarczyk,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Please run Windows Update troubleshooter from Settings app &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot. See if it works. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, try this:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then. 
<br />
<br />To fix Windows Defender not working, try these suggestions:
<br />
<br />Run services.msc to open Services Manager. Ensure that the Windows Defender service is started and set to Automatic.
<br />
<br />You may need to re-register the following dll files and see if it helps you. Run each command in an elevated command prompt one after the other and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />regsvr32 wuaueng.dll
<br />regsvr32 wucltui.dll
<br />regsvr32 softpub.dll
<br />regsvr32 wintrust.dll
<br />regsvr32 initpki.dll
<br />regsvr32 wups.dll
<br />regsvr32 wuweb.dll
<br />regsvr32 atl.dll
<br />regsvr32 mssip32.dll
<br /> 
<br />Also run regedit command and navigate to the following key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender
<br />
<br />Here ensure that the value of these DWORDS is 0 : DisableAntiSpyware and DisableAntiVirus.
<br />
<br />Note that you can download Windows Defender update definitions manually:

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>the first line gives:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;net stop wuauserv</p>
<p>The service name is invalid.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 2185.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As for the defender: the startup is grayed out (maybe because of my other anti-virus?)</p>
<p>Also, this:&nbsp;<span>regsvr32 wuaueng.dll</span><span>&nbsp; gives error:</span></p>
<p>The module wuaueng.dll was loaded but the entry point DLLRegisterServer was not found. Mae sure wuaueng.dll is a valid dll or ocx file and then try again.</p>

            Hello my name is Bradford and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I would like to contribute, along with my colleagues, on resolving the issue. 
<br />
<br />From what you described, you still have a "Root-Kit" that is active on your system and giving the illusion that the anti-virus status is functional (cloaking its presence) which is a common trait among Root-Kit type infections. 
<br />
<br />I recommend, after noting the disclaimer, that you download and follow the instructions to use this free Root-kit removal software from Malware Antibytes. 
<br />
<br />This tool is NOT apart of Malware Antibytes Anti-virus on your computer and this tool, which is simplified for technician or consumer use, can remove the Root-kit which live at a layer below Windows and therefore have to be removed outside of the Windows GUI. 
<br />
<br />On the page, under the section marked "For Technicians" click "For Technicians" then underneath "Malwarebytes Anti-Rootkit" click "GET STARTED" (see the screenshot). 
<br />
<br />Download the file, follow the instructions to install and execute it. 
<br />

            Hi Lukasz,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />It looks like something has deleted Windows update service.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Try doing a repair install. A repair Install keeps everything and reinstalls Windows.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2016/06/how-to-do-repair-install-using-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2016/06/how-to-...</a>

<br />
<br />The best and the easiest way is to use first method in the first article.

</p>
<p>Still not working, I recommend you rollback to your previous version, since Apple might not have yet released updates that support the newer version of Windows 10, yet:</p>
<p>Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Control + Alt + Delete</p>
<p>Click Sign out</p>
<p>At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen</p>
<p>Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart</p>
<p>Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears</p>
<p>Click Troubleshoot</p>
<p>Click Advanced options</p>
<p>Click Go back to the previous version of Windows</p>
<p>Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:</p>

            <p>Thank you for your communication.&nbsp; Sorry I'm unclear - what I know about the problem is:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All we ever use the system for is my husband gets on the web.&nbsp; There are no files saved or anything on it.&nbsp; A couple months ago, it began starting to lock up - I mean the mouse click does nothing.&nbsp; If I click and wait - nothing.&nbsp; Then if I click another
 place - nothing.&nbsp; Can't even shut down.&nbsp; So, I hold the on/off until it goes off and start over.&nbsp; We had not made any changes prior to this last time it locked up on everything - everytime it booted up.&nbsp; There was a fix somewhere on the Microsoft website that
 ran, but I don't know if it worked.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would not mind just wiping everything off and starting over if we can do that, but I seem to be unable to get my hands on a download of Windows XP SP3 and the directions to do it.&nbsp; I paid for Malwarebytes and have run a ton of scans.&nbsp; At first there were
 lots of virus items in the log - Trojans and something else.&nbsp; The restore locks up too, so that won't help - even in safe mode.</p>

<h2>            People joining Skype meetings without a a Skype account</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I am CCIO for a Mental Health Trust in NW England. We are looking at options for video consultations. Does Skype have a solution that can enable those without a Skype account to join a meeting?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<br />I am sorry, in order for people to join a Skype video conversation, they must have Skype installed and have a Skype account . . .

</p><p>It&nbsp;is possible for them to join a conversation in Skype without a Skype account if you are using the&nbsp;consumer version of Skype (Personal Skype). In order to do so, you will have to create a new group first and share your Group link. You may follow the steps
 below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Create a group </li><li>Once created, click the group name</li><li>Select "Share link to join group", this will generate a unique link. </li><li>Select "Copy to clipboard"</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>The generated link if opened will&nbsp;direct the person to join your conversation</li><li>It&nbsp;is highly advisable to open it with a compatible browser to launch Skype for Web such as Chrome or Microsoft&nbsp;Edge.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Once a user opens the link with a compatible browser, it will show them to Join on Web or Download Skype. Click on Join on Web if they don't want to create a new Skype account. The next window will show the option to Join as Guest which they could join the
 conversation without having to create a Skype account. You can refer to the screenshots below:

</p><p>With regards if you are using Skype for Business, it would be best to post your question through the Skype for Business forum using this link for them to clarify if this is possible using the business version. You can use this link to post your question

    <title>Custom Program Jumplists not Regenerating on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b_david  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom Program Jumplists not Regenerating on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I recently had an issue with the jumplists on my Windows 8.1 installation. The issue was that some of my jumplists were corrupt, and others were apparently deleted. Because of how bad the problem was, I deleted all of the
 files responsible for the jumplists hoping that the next time I ran the program they would automatically regenerate. While the programs with the regular "Recent Files" jumplists (ie. Word, Publisher, Excel, Windows File Explorer) are regenerating beautifully,
 programs that have custom jumplists (ie. Outlook, Firefox, Google Chrome) are not regenerating at all. I was able to get some of my custom jumplists back thanks to the monthly backup that I take of my appdata folder, but some programs do not have their jumplists
 in place. How can I essentially "reset" the custom jumplists generation so that all of the programs that I have that had custom jumplists can regenerate them the next time I use them? I am specifically worried about all of the programs in the Office 2013 Suite
 that have custom jumplists (I know Outlook and Lync have them, maybe more?) as well as my installation of Firefox, Aurora (beta version of Firefox), Nightly (also beta version of Firefox), and Google Chrome; although I am most concerned with these programs,
 I want all of them to regenerate. I find jumplists to be extremely useful, and for the programs that have them, I can't live without them.</span>

            <p>I see that u had already created a thread yesterday in which u have provided a screenshot.</p>
<p>When do you see that error message? that is usually seen when some core Windows files are corrupt or missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you may insert the recovery disk and perform a repair install then check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>Check this link to create the disks:</p>

            Although I appreciate your answer, I have already tried this and it didn't work. Since making this post, I have managed to fix all of the custom jumplists that come with the Office 2013 Suite. I have also fixed the customized jumplists that come with Firefox,
 Nightly, and Aurora. Some other programs on my computer were missing their jumplist as well, but I was able to get them working again by copying the files from the CustomDestinations folder from my mom's laptop over into my folder. The only program that I
 am still having a hard time with is Google Chrome, and I will go to Google for help with that.

            Apparently there is a bug in newer versions of Google Chrome that cause it to not generate a new jumplist. It can update it if it's already there, but it can't make its own. To solve this, I installed Google Chrome Beta over top of my existing Chrome installation,
 opened Chrome so the jumplist would generate, and reinstalled the stable version of Chrome back on top of the Beta version. This solved the problem.
