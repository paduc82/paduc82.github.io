<h2>            XBOX SCRATCHED AND RUINED MY DISC&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><span>I bought a <strong>brand new</strong> Fable 3 game. Opened the box put it into the xbox to play and it started making these loud whirring sounds like it was REALLY running hard. Then I heard something that sounded like scratching.
 I opened the disc tray immediately and when I looked at the underside of my game there were circular scatches that ran around the entire disc. I tried cleaning it and putting it in again only to hear the same scratching sounds and the xbox tells me the disc
 is now unreadable. I did not move my xbox. There were no vibrations in the house. I did not change it from a vertical to horizontal position or vice versa. The thing just
<strong>ruined</strong> my game.</span></p>

<p>Hey, is it scratches or laser burn?</p>
<p>If scratches you can get the disk repaired at various different games stores e.g GameStop, Blockbuster etc.</p>
<p>If its laser burn, depending on the severity of it you can still play the disk if you can install the game to your xbox via another copy of the game (borrow from a friend or rent from a store).</p>
<p>Also, does the console do this to any other disks or was it just this one occurence?

<p>I wouldn't know the difference between the two. And I know I CAN get it repaired but that's just more money out of my pocket for something that shouln't have happened in the first place. And the console has made that sound before with other games but none
 of them ever came out looking like this one. </p>

<p>Hi there MobilizedList47,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Large circular scratches on a game disc are caused when the console is bumped or moved while in use. To avoid this being accidentally done in the future, you might want to consider horizontal placement of the console if you are not already doing so. You
 can also look here for an <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/disc-drive/disc-replacement-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
official replacement program</a> for all first party game discs. Thanks!</p>

<p>The same thing had happened to me also, I was playing BattleField 4 and my console was Horizontal and it had made a screeching rumbling type of sound. I opened the tray slot and the disk had came out in and awkward position. My xbox was not bumped or moved
 while i was playing the game but, like iNenjeh Pandeh had said Gamestop can fix the game disk by buffing it.</p>

<p>This also happened to me. I had a two in one game with Pure and Lego Batman. I put it in my Xbox, and it scratched both of them. The Xbox 360 original(White) and Elite(Black) have flaws with this. &nbsp;Although I have never experienced this on the Xbox 360 Slim
 or E. So if anyone thinks about buying a new 360, I suggest &nbsp;buying the Xbox 360 E or Slim, depending on how much you want to spend on the Xbox itself as well as the games if they get scratched.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail Not Showing Some Mail</h2>
                    Upon opening Windows 10 mail I receive my mail fine.&nbsp; When I reopen I see next to the "Junk" Folder the number 2.&nbsp; I assume I have two messages.&nbsp; I click on the folder and it reads nothing to see here.&nbsp; If at a later time I actually receive a junk mail
 and I read it and delete it the number will disappear.&nbsp; I see a number 1 next to "Drafts" Folder.&nbsp; I click on the folder and it reads nothing to see here.&nbsp; If I create a message to send then discard it the number 1 will disappear.&nbsp; I then close the mail program
 and reopen it and the number 1 reappears with the same issues.&nbsp; If I go into my live account, which this account is synced to, there are no messages or number next to the folders to coincide with the ones in Windows 10 Mail.&nbsp; What the heck is going on here!!!

</p><p>I don't see a Junk folder even though -when I go to Webmail for the same email account- there is in fact a Junk folder. But then I'm using POP/SMTP now and I have used IMAP for a short while using Win8 mail app that didn't support POP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I recommend to disable conversation sorting as it causes all kind of issues.</p>

            <p>I am using the latest version and think I am using IMAP. The account with the problem is a live.com account that I haved synced with Windows 10 Mail.&nbsp; I added the Junk Folder by clicking on the Folder where a list of folders appears.&nbsp; One can choose which
 folders show and which folders will not.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The Windows Login account (the account that is used for everything Microsoft) of course doesn't show any mail protocol. And it is very picky with what servers you got setup with too&nbsp;(the dreaded 0x8501001s error or just never finish).&nbsp;

<h2>            New Upload Studio makes extremely jerky videos</h2>
                    
<p>Before the update to Upload Studio there was no issue with image quality whatsoever, I've regularly edited and uploaded videos from the app. But since the new update came out and you can insert all those fancy effects (which are useful by the way), the end
 results are extremely jerky. <strong>Whereas the original Game DVR clips are smooth, what comes out of Upload Studio is stuttering all the time.</strong> The screen stutters as if the framerate was extremely bad. I've noticed this in both a Trials Fusion and
 a Destiny video so it's not game specific. These videos are barely enjoyable at all.</p>

<p>Yes, it was immediately noticable. I would like someone to clarify if Microsoft is aware of the problem and whether they are working on a fix. Until then we better upload the raw videos directly to YouTube. Which is a shame, considering all the cool new
 effects Upload Studio provides.</p>

<p>Having this problem too. I informed them on Twitter, support team didn't even know about it. It's ridiculous. It's a slideshow now I can't believe nobody noticed. Even uploading the raw unedited clips to One Drive, I'm still getting the same result. About
 15-20 fps by the look of it. Can't use it in that state. Wish more people would speak up on this!</p>

<p>But it's so noticable that I can't imagine most people wouldn't notice it. The first video I made with the new Upload Studio was from Trials Fusion, and I couldn't believe how jerky it was. Then I made a nice video from Destiny but it was the same. Even
 with slow camera movement the stuttering is clearly visible.</p>

<h2>            Can I run windows 10 backup only once a weeK&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I don't want to keep a flash drive in my computer all the time. Is there a way to run the Windows 10 backup program, say, only once a week? (As was my practice with Windows 7.)</p>
<p>Also, is it practical to keep the backup file somewhere other than in my home? Perhaps in the Cloud?</p>

            <p>Hi Grandpa Jim,</p>
<p>Yes, you can choose to run your backups once a week with both <strong>Backup &amp; Restore(Windows 7)</strong> and with
<strong>File History</strong>; for the former, just don't set a backup schedule and run it manually whenever you plug in the drive by clicking:
<strong>control panel / backup &amp; restore / back up now</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>For the latter, set the backups to "daily" and if it starts bugging you to connect your drive, just go to
<strong>settings / update &amp; security / backup</strong> and turn file history off.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To run that one manually, go back to the same spot and turn in back on, then click
<strong>more options</strong>, then <strong>back up now</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>And yes, it is an
<em>excellent </em>idea to keep a backup somewhere off-site like the cloud, a neighbor's house, your kid's house, or all of the above.&nbsp; Cheers to you.</p>

<p>Hi, if you sign into <a href="https://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://billing.microsoft.com</a> and look in the top right of the window what currency does it show there ? It may well be that your account region setting is incorrect. In the top right of the window it should in your case say GB Personal account, if it shows
 the wrong region then that indicates your account region is incorrect. You would then need to migrate the account to the correct region.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>There are some downsides to the migration so please check out this link.</p>

            Hi Suyog, from your screen capture, it looks like your Windows Licence is a business licence that requires regular re-arming. This can mean the system was originally owned by a company or it is a hacked version of Windows 10
<br /> 
<br />It may also mean that an error in the Windows 10 licencing has occurred, if that is the case, please try the method below:
<br />
<br />Restart (not shut down) your PC 3 or 4 times, this can often fix this issue . . . 
<br />
<br />If that does not fix this issue: 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 10 Product Key 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a> 
<br />
<br />Go to Settings - Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />Try entering that product key there to activate Windows 
<br />
<br />Otherwise, contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Choose a local Phone Number:

            Yes. To confirm if Windows came preinstalled with the computer, can you tell us the make and model of your PC?<br />Here it is quite common in India where I live that seller's tell you the Windows is preinstalled but in actual they install a counterfeit copy of Windows.

            Hi Suyog, generally when a Windows licence notifies that Windows will expire soon, it is a pirated copy of Windows.
<br />
<br />I would return that product back to the shop and get a full refund. This is not your fault and they must provide you with a refund . . .

 automatically goes to Sleep Mode. I have checked all the Power Options thoroughly by could not find any anomaly. Thus I concluded that it is a problem with Windows 10. Please tell me a solution to this problem. I rolled back my system from Windows 10 Home
 64 bit Operating System to Windows 7 Home Basic 64 bit Operating System and working smoothly.</div>

When I click on the link it asks me which webcam; how do I find which webcam is installed on my laptop? &nbsp;I can't use the video, when i try it appears to be recording and yet says that there is an error with the camera. &nbsp;I tried looking for an update but it
 says there are none (!) so I too thought about reinstalling
<div>Could you advise where to find the webcam number please</div>
<div>Thanks you</div>

    <title>What is runtime error 216 at 00405F66&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> that same random guy  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is runtime error 216 at 00405F66&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will be a rather short post as I don't have much to go on at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I booted up my laptop this morning, like usual; nothing strange happened, and after opening up a word document, the following message came up in a warning window: "runtime error at 00405F66".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of this moment, I'm not sure if it's because of something I did, or if it's just something Windows is doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently ran Windows Update and have since been "up-to-date". I checked, twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(<em>I will post my specs at the end of this message.</em>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, just yesterday I had a program that did not want to install correctly, for whatever reason, and I'm thinking that it's because of that. The specific thing I was trying to install was requested by my university. It's called "Blackboard Launcher".</p>
<p>
</p><p>After countless attempts to install it, I gave in and googled a work-around (<em>from their own site</em>), and succeeded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, while I was never able to completely install the Blackboard Launcher, I was able to play the desired video that was in the COLLAB format, which required me to install the launcher to view in the first place. That's what the instructions said, anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of yet, I have not seen the same error, however, having had an issue with the run-time 216 error before, I want to think it will eventually pop up again and I want a sure way to stop it without having to reload my whole computer from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The run-time error has not occurred until today and has not yet occurred again after the incident this morning (<em>opening word document</em>), and so now if the problem does occur again, I'd like to know what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last note:</p>
<p>I have not backed-up my registry or my system as of late—which is see now, is the easiest way to lose everything. The only thing I've backed up to date is my personal data (files: e.g. word, text, etc.). If I have to restart my laptop from scratch, I'll
 do it, but I'd like to make sure I'll still be able to load and install Windows 10
<strong>free</strong> of charge.</p>

</p><p>Regards,</p>

</p><p>T.S.R.G.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. - The reason the launcher could not install, in my opinion, was due to the fact that Windows was running Windows Update. The specific error message that was shown when failing to install the BB launcher was "BB Launcher could not install because another
 installation is already in progress. Complete that installation first"—or something along those lines. I had assumed then that the only thing that could be in the progress of "installing" was Windows Update. So, what I ended up doing was restarting my laptop.
 Lo and behold, it started the Update upon booting up, which tells me it was in fact doing something in the background, preventing me from installing the launcher. Anyway, don't know if it's relevant now but just wanted to make sure that you have all the information</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hello Nachappa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be happy to provide you with the requested information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Aside from the Windows Update, I do not recall making an unnecessary changes to any other program or anything of the operating system. As I mentioned in my initial post, I did not receive this problem until today and I'm assuming the reason it occurred
 was due to the multiple failed attempts to install (the BB launcher), which was caused by the Windows Update that had already been doing something in the background—which, as I also mentioned, was relevant and prevalent as when I rebooted after the first failure
 (to install the launcher), the splash screen for Windows was "configuring my files" for the update and continued to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I was using Firefox 41.0.2 (<em>this morning</em>), but have since upgraded to Firefox 42.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I did not get the error message from the browser, but rather from the installer which I had downloaded from the webpage I was on. As I mentioned before, there was a COLLAB file I was required to watch for one of my courses, and the website (Blackboard)
 as well as the instructions given by my university required me to download and install the application "Blackboard Launcher" which would allow me to watch the video. The workaround I mentioned before was on
<a href="http://discussions.blackboard.com/forums/p/60102/181182.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> page. I don't know how it's all involved or how each parts correlate to each other, but I'm going to assume they work with Java. The download page that I accessed while on the Blackboard website where I have an account with my university, activated
 some JavaScript (I think) that made me go through the process of downloading each file—the BB launcher &amp; COLLAB file—sequentially. The whole process regarding that is still unclear to me as the installation failed to complete. I ended up having to use the
 work around mentioned in the link provided above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. This did in fact occur after upgrading to Windows 10. My Sony Vaio came with Windows 8 preinstalled. I later upgraded to Windows 8.1, and then Windows 10. I've been running Windows 10 since July—more specifically, the day it was made available for everyone
 to download and install. So, I've had it for a while, I'd say. I let updates download and install automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. I have made sure that I am up to date with Updates for both Windows and my Laptop. Regarding drivers, I'm not so sure how I would do that. Are there specific drivers I am expected to check for? I never thought that was something I had to be in charge
 of as Sony has a Vaio Care feature that notifies me when I need certain updates—which I'm assuming covers that aspect. I'm up to date for both update utilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link didn't help much, I'm afraid. Not to sound upset as I understand you're struggling with this as much as I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, I can't give you much information as there isn't much to give.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside, I'd like it noted that I've had AVG running since I had this system, so I doubt there's a virus on my computer as I don't use my laptop to access any fishy sites. It's strictly for educational use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I rebooted my system twice today after the incident this morning (not including the Windows Update reboot) and have not seen the 216 error since. I even opened up my Word documents and the like and haven't had any issues. It appears that my system
 is running fine, but I'm still trying to understand why the error occurred this morning, and more importantly, why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your hard work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do next?</p>
<p>

    <title>&#39;Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media&#39; tray icon does not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ozflipper  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#39;Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media&#39; tray icon does not inform on successful ejection</h2>
                    <p>The green 'Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media' icon in the tray ejects my drives OK, but never informs about it. It's kind of annoying - one of those things that's worked for years not working now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in My Computer you can see that a device has been shut down (it disappears from the drives list) but without the feedback having to open it and check is annoying.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For ordinary flash drives, you can eject from My Computer, but for devices that emulate disks you can't - you have to use the tray icon, then you have to open or refresh My Computer to see if it was properly ejected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happens on Windows 10 Pro on both my Surface 3 and two laptops. Definitely a Windows 10 bug.</p>

            <p>Thanks, but that's not my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, I have the icon in the taskbar. But when I use it to eject something, I never get a response saying the device can be removed safely and the icon stays there forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do the eject from Explorer, then I get the "safe to remove" message and the Safely Remove Hardware icon goes away.,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I can only eject flash drives from Explorer, not removeable hard drives.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media' is a notification that the corresponding hardware has been unmounted and can be ejected. As the notification is self-explanatory that your hardware will not have any issue&nbsp;once ejected, there is no further notification
 stating safe removal.</p>

            I have a problem with this too, since upgrading to Windows 10 the Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media icon is still on my taskbar but when I click on it the options given are to "open &nbsp;devices and printers" or "...", the latter doesn't do anything,
 the former opens device manager. So how do I safely eject my SD card now?

<p>How can I do this?</p>
<p>I saw a registry change for ab earlier version of Windows, but that's ridiculous......</p>

<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps below and check.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the <span>Assign Drive Letter or Path</span> page, leave everything as it is for simplicity, and click
<span>Next</span>. (If you are an advanced user, you can choose a drive letter of your choice from the available
<span>Assign the following drive letter</span> drop-down list.)</li><li>On the <span>Format Partition</span> page, choose the settings of your preference. (If you are unsure what to choose, leave the default settings intact.)</li><li>Click <span>Next</span> to proceed.</li><li>On the <span>Completing the New Simple Volume Wizard</span> page, click <span>
Finish</span> to create a new partition in the hard disk drive.</li><li>Once the partition is created, you can start using it normally.</li><li><span>Note:</span> Windows 10 may prompt you to format the new partition after it has been created.</li><li>Hope this helps. Thank you. </li></ol>

            <p>This does not relate to my question. I was specifically referring to File Explorer and the way the drives are listed.</p>
<p>They are listed by the disk volume label first, then the drive letter. If the drive letter were first, it would sort the way I want.</p>
<p>So, how to change that order?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I had the same issue, and I've found the&nbsp;solution. <br />
<br />
First off, what you have is partly a known problem many people had, and partly your lack of familiarity with File Explorer, which has superseded Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unlike in Windows Explorer, in File Explorer, a double click on 'This PC' is needed to&nbsp;show all drives, so do that. To your relief, the drives under 'This PC' are sorted by drive letter.&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you will now also notice a problem: your File Explorer'&nbsp;navigation&nbsp;pane&nbsp;is showing every drive twice! Not everyone has that problem, but many do. To solve that, download&nbsp;a&nbsp;registry tweak

here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>BTW, if you prefer, like I do, to have the drive letter shown before the drive label, download this tiny utility:

            Hi,
<div>As I understand the problem, you are unable to send and receive the emails after making some changes to Username.</div>
<div><strong>Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps I may need a few more information to understand the issue better.</strong></div>
<div>1. How are you accessing the emails? Is it through Outlook?</div>
<div>2. Do you get any error message?</div>
<div>3. Are you able to open the emails through Comcast website?</div>

            <p>Hi Judy,</p>
<p>most ISPs come with a setup disk, if you have one run it.</p>
<p>If not, contact Comcast and have a tech walk you through your settings.</p>

How did you change the user names? Does Comcast know you did?<br />

    <title>Why does my current system restore point keep growing in size&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> budguinn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my current system restore point keep growing in size&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have had problems, as previously reported, with my restore points being deleted.&nbsp; As part of the problem I have been monitoring the restore points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a new restore point and checked the configuration button and this point was taking 27.3mb.&nbsp; The next morning...right now....this point has grown to 1.14gb.&nbsp; The machine has not been shut-down, restarted....only put to sleep for the night.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is it that a restore point that is giving a snap-shot in time of my system growing larger?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have allocated 380gb to the volume shadow copy/restore point.</p>
<p>I have run sfc/scannow twice with no problems indicated.</p>
<p>I have done all things recommended by support yet the problem persists....ie, the restore points are being deleted by Windows 10 or shutdown and then restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now, I find that the system is somehow, for some reason changing the physical size of the restore point.&nbsp; Which makes me distrust these restore points in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance for your help,</p>
<p>

            <p>JR,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is amazing.&nbsp; Your reply has nothing to do with my question.&nbsp; My drive is 2TB..who cares how much space I allot to the restore points.&nbsp; Did you even bother reading the purpose of the question?&nbsp; Why is a restore point..which is a snap shot in time, grow
 from 27mb to over 1.14gb?&nbsp; How can a restore point grow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>can you answer that question?</p>
<p>BTW, look at some of the answers to questions about loss of restore points.....many times it is recommended to be 20% allocated to the VSS.&nbsp; Well, 20% of a 2tb drive is around 373gb.&nbsp; This is Microsofts' recommendation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you ask me to clean up 'recent restore points'.....that is idiotic.....the point is that the system keeps deleting my restore points.&nbsp; ALL OF THEM....THEY ARE ALL GONE AFTER A SHUTDOWN!!!.....there is nothing left to clean up....Jeeeezz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I speaking a different language?</p>
<p>
</p><p>best regards,</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />My name is Roger W, an independent advisor trying to help
<br />
<br />1-Sometimes the best solution is the most obvious one. Many software and even hardware related issues can be easily fixed with this simple refresh. And some users have reported that after restarting their Android device or computer, they finally managed to solve the problem that their Android device was not detected by Windows 10. So it doesn’t hurt to try.
<br />
<br />
<br />2- Are you using the original cable of your phone? If not, this might be the culprit. Also, some USB cables are designed for charging only. That means you can not connect your Android phone to computer for file transfer with this kind of USB cable. So you’d better try a different USB cable.
<br />
<br />3- In order to manage Android files on your computer, you need to connect your Android phone as a media device (MTP).
<br />
<br />Go to “Settings” on your Android device -&gt; “Storage” -&gt; click the icon “More” -&gt; select “USB computer connection” -&gt; choose “Media device(MTP)” -&gt; connect your Android to computer again.
<br />
<br />Sometimes you have to switch between the various connection options several times before you find your Android phone on the computer.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Good Luck..

            Hello my name is Bradford and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I will try to resolve your problem with your Samsung Note not being detected. 
<br />For your device to be detected by Windows you need to install Samsung's utility named "Samsung Kies". 
<br />It will install not only the needed drivers for your Windows 10 to be able to communicate with your Note 3 but has is its own program that should help to make the recovery of your files much easier. 
<br />After noting the disclaimer at the bottom of the response please click on the link to be taken to Samsung Kies page, scroll towards the bottom of the page and click the download link that applies to the version of Android your Galaxy Note 3 is using. 
<br />Link:

            Hi Poornima,<br /> I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.<br /><br />Using a USB cable isn't reliable sometimes. You can use an app like Airdroid to transfer data from phone to PC. The catch is, both of need to be on the same network.

    <title>VMWare Workstation UI timed out error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markrichards29  say:</h3>
<h2>            VMWare Workstation UI timed out error</h2>
                    <p>I Have a HP Pavilion DV7 running Windows 7 64bit 4gb ram</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to install VMWare Workstation as part of a car communication software install, every time I get the same timed out error, I have downloaded from internet the same version, the latest version and still the same, so I am guessing the issue is with
 my machine, even though everything else runs perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no antivirus installed and I have tried turning off the firewall.....no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read all sorts online but it is all over my head as everything I try fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone that can post a resolution that is simple to follow and makes sense to a code dummy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
