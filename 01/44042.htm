<h2>            unable to install update</h2>
                    <p>In the information given on the page for platform updates, it says to go to Windows Update and check for updates. Windows Update says it can't check for updates because the service is not running. What service? How do I get it running?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; KB971644 platform update is what is needed to install a non-Windows program I want. Windows won't install it without the platform update. My question is how can find KB971644 and install it?</p>

<p>...Why is <strong>Kodi Jarvis 17.6</strong> telling me that KB971644 is necessary...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Hi caweclark:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In theory, running Kodi v17.x on a Vista SP2 computer shouldn't be a problem.&nbsp; Kodi's 13-May-2017 blog
<a href="https://kodi.tv/article/kodi-v18-goodbye-windows-vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>Kodi V18: Goodbye Windows Vista</em></a> states that "Y<em>ou can continue to use Kodi v17 as long as you want and it will continue to run without problems</em>" but also warns "<em>The only thing that might happen is that
<strong>certain add-ons might not get updates anymore and will start to degrade or stop working</strong>. The main part of Kodi however will never stop functioning and playing your local video files, music or live tv setup will simply keep working.</em>"<br />
<br />
You mentioned <strong>Jarvis 17.6</strong> in your original post, but when I went to their download page at
<a href="https://kodi.tv/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://kodi.tv/download</a> I was offered the 32-bit
<strong>Krypton v17.6</strong> installer (kodi-17.6-Krypton-x86.exe) and not an older Jarvis v16.x installer.&nbsp; Click the Start button on your Windows desktop, type dxdiag in the search box and launch
<strong>dxdiag.exe</strong>. Confirm that the DirectX Version on the System tab is
<strong>DirectX 11</strong> (the article <em><a href="https://kodianalysis.com/kodi-jarvis-vs-krypton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Kodi Jarvis vs Kodi Krypton Version – Should You Upgrade?</a></em> notes that newer Krypton v17.x versions use DirectX 11
 rather than DirectX 9) and confirm that the Display tab reports there are no obvious problems with your
<strong>graphics</strong>.&nbsp; The <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971512/description-of-the-windows-graphics-imaging-and-xps-library" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB971512</a></strong> (<em>Windows Graphics, Imaging, and XPS Library</em>)
 update bundled inside the KB971644 platform update included improved support for DirectX and graphics hardware acceleration so I wouldn't be too surprised to learn your problems have something to do with DirectX or your graphics drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Kodi installation error must be a common problem for Vista SP2 users since googling "Kodi KB971644 Vista" returns multiple threads in the Kodi support forum at
<a href="https://forum.kodi.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forum.kodi.tv/</a>.&nbsp; I took a quick look through some of those Kodi threads in their
<a href="https://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=59" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows support board</a> and the only workaround I saw was michael_corban's 11-Sep-2017 suggestion in post # 37 of
<em><a href="https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=311337&amp;pid=2645251#pid2645251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Kodi 17.1 Installation problem with KB971644 Vista x86</a></em> to run the installer in
<strong>Win XP SP2 compatibility mode</strong>.&nbsp; I'm not familiar with any of the Kodi products so if Volume Z doesn't have any further suggestions and your
<strong>Vista SP2 OS and graphics card drivers</strong> are patched with the latest updates your best option might be to register in the Kodi forum and post your question there.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I lost my emails when WLM purged and took&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">everything</span> out of my linked AOL account Inbox. It didn't place my these messages&nbsp;into a trash/deleted folder, they weren't in my old mails/spam/junk mail&nbsp;-- just vanished.
 I had irreplaceable info I needed and it took me a few days and many hours to figure out how to fix the problem.</p>
<p>Windows 7 doesn't have much "help" when it comes to the fix for this. They neglected to include important&nbsp;information that would be helpful to a user who is having an issue like this. It's so frustrating to waste all your&nbsp;time and efforts, not to mention
 the panic and stress involved with the whole process! Windows does not list&nbsp;in their help directory to recover lost/deleted emails... It only lists lost files, which you have to figure out on&nbsp;your own means "emails" as well. It would be simple to add the word
 email so it comes up&nbsp;in a help search, but for some reason they&nbsp;skipped&nbsp;doing that.&nbsp;Sorry for the vent but the "help" files should be more helpful! I know the info is a long read, but it should help you&nbsp;find your missing messages and restore them, so it's
 worth it! I don't know your expertise so I'll try to be as specific as possible if you're new to computers. (especially doing self-help)</p>
<p>Here's what to try -- If you have the Libraries folder on your desktop, click this folder to open it. If you don't have it, click on Start menu, and to the right you will see the "computer" button.</p>
<p>Start out by selecting your OS(C:) folder.</p>
<p><strong>Hint#1:</strong> Print out these directions to make it easier to go thru, be sure to shut down all running programs/browsers/music, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Hint #2</strong>: before clicking on any more folders you may want to check your settings because the AppData folder you need to access is considered a "hidden folder" you&nbsp;can check this by going onto the top menu: select&nbsp; &nbsp;Tools &gt; Folder Options
 &gt; View Tab &gt; Hidden files &amp; folders:&nbsp; Select&nbsp; Show hidden files, folders, and drives&gt; Apply &gt; Ok&nbsp; ) Once you have done this proceed by clicking on&nbsp; the following folders...</p>
<p><strong>C drive</strong> &gt; <strong>Users</strong> &gt;<strong>Owner</strong> **mine says owner though yours may have your personalized name, this says whose account/username you want to get into) then:</p>
<p><strong>AppData</strong> &gt; <strong>Local</strong>&nbsp;&gt; <strong>Microsoft</strong> &gt;<strong>Windows Live Mail</strong></p>
<p><strong>Right click</strong> on the folder that matches your missing email account&nbsp;(AOL, Gmail, etc.)</p>
<p>You can verify the messages you want recovered by clicking on that specific folder (mine says AOL, then inside has all of the my AOL&nbsp;folders listed; I&nbsp;opened my Inbox) You should now see a list of&nbsp;little open message envelopes&nbsp;in that folder. You can select
 one to open, and verify that these are the messages you want to recover. (I checked out several messages to be sure)&nbsp;Once you've verified the&nbsp;folder(s) you need to recover,<strong>go back</strong>&nbsp;using the blue back arrow on the upper left-hand corner so
 you return to the previous screen with the individual folders listed.</p>
<p>From this&nbsp;list of folders, pick the one you want to recover (in my case AOL Inbox).&nbsp;&nbsp;When you right click you will get&nbsp;a&nbsp;list of options&nbsp;- the one you need says "<strong>restore to previous version</strong>". Click this option to select it.</p>
<p>It opens up yet another folder that shows your restore points, it takes a moment to load them all up. (I had about 5 different ones to choose from)&nbsp;My emails were fine 2 days ago, so I went to a restore point that was&nbsp;3 days prior just to ensure all emails
 I needed were included. Once you <strong>select your restore point</strong>, it only takes a moment for windows to run the "restore" operation.</p>
<p>After it the program&nbsp;ran though, the messages I restored didn't&nbsp;magically appear in my AOL inbox.&nbsp;The wait was&nbsp;at least 10-15 minutes.&nbsp;With hundreds of messages to restore, I had to let the system&nbsp; re-download each message. Be patient, it takes a little
 time!</p>
<p>I found that windows did not place the lost messages back into my AOL Inbox. It put them in the<strong>Storage Folder</strong>, located bottom left corner, when you have windows live mail opened. You will see it says "<strong>recovered items</strong>". The
 inbox folder I recovered was titled something odd with AOL in the middle of it.</p>
<p>Next step, (almost there!) I had to go in and "<strong>select all</strong>" messsages from the top menu, and<strong>right click</strong> to get the menu option to "<strong>move folder</strong>" and select to have&nbsp;them moved back into the proper folder. This
 only took a few minutes.&nbsp;After it reloaded the&nbsp;messages it quickly allowed me to read/save/delete again.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Warning message though:&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; The problem I&nbsp;found now is whenever I delete messages (recovered or new), they do NOT go into the delete folder for AOL they just disappear. So be sure if you delete something, you
 need to know that you may not be able to recover it&nbsp;again. I haven't found the fix for this yet, but I'm going to try.</p>
<p>To ensure you don't lose emails, be sure you back them up on an external drive, or partitioned drive, occassionally or frequently if you can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had mine saved to an external hard drive and an old hard drive, but was unable to import them from either without errors. I now have a back up "archived" folder that will keep my message safe from accidents like this, so long as I keep it up-to-date and
 continue to add any&nbsp;new"important" messages I need saved indefinately.</p>
<p>Good luck with your "recovery" post here if you&nbsp; need more help/assistance, I will try my best to give additional help!</p>

            It would sure be helpful to the rest of us who are experiencing the same issue if you would include the Microsoft Diagnostic tool download redirect in this message. I have followed your instructions so far, however, I'm not optimistic and would like to
 be able to access this either within the next ten minutes or have it available for future use and I'm sure that others would also. Thank you otherwise for the tips.<br />

<h2>            Please Help&#33; PSFTP via Scheduled task with no password as different user</h2>
                    <p>On a Windows Server 2012 R2, I have created a script to SFTP some files to a remote system. This works perfectly when run from command line or Windows Explorer. When I run the script via Task Scheduler, the script fails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I enabled logging and found out it is failing because it was prompting for a password, and should not be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created the script, the priv &amp; pub keys and created the task as the administrator of the box, but I pass a different user to the remote site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Through research I found out that I needed to create the user on the server, connect once to the remote site as that user and save the fingerprint. I also had to add the user to the local policy to run batch files. Then I set the task to run as this user.
 After all of this, when the script is run via Task Scheduler it still prompts for a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop the Task Scheduler from prompting for a password?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the redacted output:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking up host "abcd-sftp.abcd.net"<br />

    <title>How to have Windows 8 Remember Folder Views - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to have Windows 8 Remember Folder Views</h2>
                    I find the behavior of the file views in Windows 8 to be very confusing.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I do know that there are certain kinds of templates, for the various Libraries, and that these are independent of each other.<br />
<br />
However, what I'm trying to find out is the following: <br />
<br />
Is there a way to set different views for different individual folders, and then have Windows 8 remember that view for that specific folder?
<br />
<br />
This operating system makes me feel like a total idiot. <br />

            I click on "Documents" where all files and folder are displayed as a list.&nbsp; I have always displayed this folder as a list, and I never want to see it another way.
<br />
<br />
There are a number of files in Documents, one of them is named Cards.&nbsp; I go into Cards.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I switch to View and select "Large Icons."&nbsp; These are pictures, so I would like this folder to remember to display itself as "Large Icons" always in the future.
<br />
<br />
If I hit an arrow button to go back into Documents, everything is displayed as "Large Icons."&nbsp; I don't like that, it's disorienting.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Let's say I don't hit the arrow button, and I don't go back into Documents.&nbsp; Instead, after selecting "Large Icons" in Cards, I just tap the red "X" and get out of it.&nbsp; If I go back into it later, it is now not showing the contents as Large Icons, it has gone
 back to list view.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I'm very sorry I confused you earlier.&nbsp; I know you said to be brief, but since you did not understand my OP, I thought I would cite an example.&nbsp; Again, generally speaking, I would like for Windows 8 to remember the views I set for the individual folders, so
 that when I return to that specific folder, it has the view that I set for it previously.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
What I'm describing seems to me like very basic behavior.&nbsp; I don't know why the OS would be designed to do anything else other than what I've described.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if perhaps I unchecked a certain box somewhere over the past month or so.

            I went into File Explorer, View, Options, "change folder and search options," and then View.<br />
<br />
At this point, I see that "Apply to Folders" is greyed out, and "Reset Folders" is not greyed out.<br />
<br />
Just as an experiment, I went to my main Documents folder and tried the same thing. After selecting View, Options, "change folder and search options," and then View, I see that both "Apply to Folders" and "Reset Folders" are greyed out.<br />
<br />
I do appreciate your trying to help me, but I'm wondering if we're on the same page.&nbsp; I'm not interested in applying one view to all of my folders of a certain type.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is basically not possible to set different view for diffenet folders. If you want to change the column width of different folders, then you can follow these steps.</p>

</span></span></span><font><b><span>Move and hover</span></b><span> the pointer over the border line to the right of the column name (ex: Date modified)
 on the column bar that you want to change the width of until it turns into a cross with double horizontal arrows.</span></font></font></p>
<p>

</span></span></span><span><font><span>&nbsp;</span>When finished, you might also would like to change the order of any added columns to what you want as well.</font></span></font></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>The folder column width is specific to the location of the folder. So, you will have to manually change the column width

            I don't have any further questions, but I'd like to write just a little "for the record."
<br />
<br />
There is a computer in my home with XP on it, and just to make sure, I booted it up and confirmed that XP will keep track of the view which a user selects for each individual folder.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, quite by accident, I discovered that Windows 8 appears to allow and remember different&nbsp; views for individual folders, but you just can't do it if you use the libraries and "documents" locations.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you maintain a folder or folders on the desktop, and there are sub folders in these folders, Windows 8 will allow and remember individual views for these folders and sub folders.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
On the desktop, if you change the view of a subfolder, when you go "up" to the next folder, it will not suddenly and annoyingly change the view of the main folder you are now looking at to the same view which you selected for the sub folder.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Once again, for myself, I find myself concluding that Windows 8 is just really, really strange.&nbsp;

    <title>CANNOT DELETE AUTOSHAPES ARROWS ON WORKSHEET - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            CANNOT DELETE AUTOSHAPES ARROWS ON WORKSHEET</h2>
                    I use Excel 2003 at my workplace. There are old inserted autoshape arrows that I wish to delete. When I&nbsp;select the arrow I want to delete and the circles appear at the ends of each arrow, I click delete, but they are still there and the circles go away.
 I have tried everything I know, but I can't get rid of them. I have done it in the past with no problem on other spreadsheets. Is it possible that there is some kind of security or lock on my spreadsheet that won't let me delete them? I do not share this spreadsheet.

<h3> dhs-usc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 setup error - &#34;There was a problem starting Setup.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have seen this error thread several times over the past few years, and all the other threads are now locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, it is almost June 2019, and I just got the "Windows 10 setup error - There was a problem starting Setup..." error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the other threads say to delete the folders on the C:\ drives, which I did.&nbsp; I also rebooted several times, and I also ran Windows update on my current 1809 64 bit build.&nbsp; None of these things worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What fixed this in the end for me was moving the MediaCreationTool1903.exe file to a folder off the root of one of my drives.&nbsp; Previously I was running it from my Downloads folder, which was somewhere like c:\Users\David\Downloads\Windows10ISO folder.&nbsp; I
 guess that folder was "too deep" and moving and running the file from a directory closer to the root did the trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure how many others have the problem, but so far here are the steps to try:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Reboot</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Update Windows all the way</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Delete folders in the root of your C: drive that start with a ~ or a $Windows.xxx</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Make sure you copy the file to somewhere close to the root, like c:\temp</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF none of those work, good luck, I am not sure what else to try at that point.</p>

<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Here are some additional things you can consider if the upgrade is failing:
<br />
<br />We are aware of reports from users experiencing problems installing the latest Feature Update, version 1903 which is in the process of rolling out.
<br />
<br />A couple issues we are aware of that might block the upgrade include the following:
<br />
<br />- You need to ensure you have 10 to 16 GBs of free space.
<br />- If there is a SD card installed, uninstall it or disable it.
<br />- Disconnect any usb drives.

            <p>&nbsp;Most backup programs don't work in Safe Mode as it appears you have discovered.&nbsp; However copy and paste DOES work, so you can click Start -&gt; Computer, then highlight the folders you want to back up, right-click, then click on your external hard drive or
 flash drive and click paste.&nbsp; It's a little tedious, but it sure beats losing your music, photos, and any other data you might have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

    <title>USB 3.0 flashdrive write protection error&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arde mendoza  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB 3.0 flashdrive write protection error&#63;</h2>
                    Okay, so, a couple of months ago I bought a new flashdrive, a Lexar 3.0 Flashdrive with 32 GBs. Yesterday, I was copying a file onto my flashdrive, then it stopped mid-way with an error message. The error message:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b40abcae-9fc3-47c8-a936-378b8f52e781" /><br />
<br />
I started to get a little worried, so, as usual, I looked online for help. Apparently, other people have had the same problem. I've tried every method I could find, from using the Command Prompt to editing the Windows registry. Still, none of them still worked!
 My last choice was to format the flashdrive. So, I began trying to format it. Then, a familiar message box popped up: "The disk is write protected." (As seen above). I was confused; why is my flashdrive write protected?? I looked everywhere for some sort of
 help. I couldn't find anything.<br />
<br />
<b>Other notes:<br />
</b>- The error isn't coming from my PC. I tried using my sister's laptop to format it, and it gave me the same error message.<br />
- My flashdrive doesn't have a write-protect option. <i>(It might, but I might not be aware of it.)<br />
</i>- I have tried various other programs to try and format it.<br />
- There are no viruses on my flashdrive or PC.<br />
- There are about 20 GBs left on the flashdrive, so it isn't full.
<div>- I have already attempted using the registry.<br />
<br />
I hope someone can help me, because I really don't want to waste my money on another flashdrive that will just end up giving me the same error.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you again!</div>

            <p>The following is from the best source of info I've found for USB thumbdrive problems:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; <a href="http://www.uwe-sieber.de/usbtrouble_e.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.uwe-sieber.de/usbtrouble_e.html</a>&nbsp;&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>USB DRIVE appears to be Write Protected:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.<br />
</strong>Check out if the USB drive has a small swich for write protection. </p>
<p><b>2.</b><br />
Windows can write protect USB drives too. Check out the registry under<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\StorageDevicePolicies.<br />
The value 'WriteProtect' should be absent or set to '0'. </p>
<p><b>3.</b><br />
Flash memory has a limited lifetime of about 100000 guaranteed write cycles. Most flash cells life much longer but cells that become defective must be replaced by reserve cells (bad block management). The flash controller manages this in the background. When
 all reserve cells are consumed then the flash controller rejects all write accesses. Then you can read your data and bring the device the recycling.<br />
This can happen even the drive was never even nearly completely filled because the flash controller spreads write accesses over all physical blocks to ensure that all cells are weared out equally (wear levelling).<br />
Unfortunately USB flash drives have no standard mechanism for reading their current health state as known from harddrives. So, always expect a USB flash drive to die at any time...
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I think so.&nbsp; #3 says that there are a certain amount of reserved cells that replace normal cells once they are detected as "bad" and that once all the reserve cells are exhausted, the drive reverts to a permanent read-only state.&nbsp; That certainly fits in
 with your symptoms.&nbsp; It would be nice if there were a program to verify that condition, though.</p>

<h2>            Cannot connect external SATA hard drive via USB</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a IOMAX IDE/SATA to USB adapter which has been working perfectly with a XP based system - very useful to copy data from virused PCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have now updated from XP to Win7 64bit Ultimate and I cannot connect any external HDD. From Disk management, the drive is shown as
<strong>Unknown</strong> and <strong>Not Initialised</strong>, and the system is asking me to decide if i need
<strong>MBR or ?GPT? format</strong>. Given that the HDD is a valid Vista system I do not want to initialise it, just copy the personal data and check it for viruses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I am getting this error in the Event Viewer - <span>The ASDiskUnlocker service has reported an invalid current state 11.</span></p>

            It seems that your IOMAX IDE/SATA to USB adapteris not Windows 7 compatible.&nbsp; I know that there are IDE / SATA to USB adapters that work in Windows 7.<br />

<p>I got a similar error like this today not the same however. &nbsp;It kept coming up with it every time I tried to download the second part of the update. &nbsp;I just left it for a while though on the "would you like to update" pop up and then pressed yes after a
 third time and then it worked for some strange reason. &nbsp;So I would advice leaving it a while on that pop-up and then trying. &nbsp;I dunno why it is doing this maybe the xbox is having to have a moment to connect the internet instead of straight away.</p>

You need to restore the system to factory defaults.&nbsp; Sure, no one (almost) WANTS to do that - but the damage done by the one trojan and probably the friends it brought to the party is not something you want to stick around.</p>
<p>You could Safe Mode, MSCONFIG and uncheck it and boot back into normal mode.</p>
<p>Then do this:</p>
<p><strong><u>Check for malware:</u></strong></p>
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes (FREE)</a></li><li><a href="http://superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SuperAntiSpyware (FREE)</a></li></ul>
<p><br />
Removing everything they find. Rebooting when needed. (You can uninstall one or both when done.)</p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
eSet Online Scanner</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then backup your stuff, verify you have all the installation media, serial numbers and product keys you need and restore that system to factory defaults.&nbsp; Update the drivers, install you antivirus, update Windows, install your applications and restore your
 personal data.</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately, Skype Connect is a different feature and product that has nothing to do with group calling. So we can arrange to transfer your question to the best message board here in the Skype Community on Microsoft answers, please post back with the following

 influence since in the other games it was similar and the achievement gave it to me immediately.</span><br />

<h2>            Window7&#58; Webcam Viewer Like in XP</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Dell E6400 with a intergrated webcam that has the built in facial rec tech. When i upgraded to Windows7 everything went fine and the web cam works perfectly with all "3rd Party" software that i had to install just to use it.</p>
<p>In Windows XP if you went to Start &gt; &gt; My Computer &gt; &gt; Double Click On the Camera ICON you would get a webcam preview which enabled you to see the live image and take a picture or adjust the brightness or contrast on the fly. And this feature was there after
 a fresh in stall of XP with the Dell Factory Drivers (inf files) with out the need of thrid party software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span>My question: So what happened to this ability in Windows 7 or does it exist in some shape or form that i just cannot find by simply going into the explorer?<br />
</span><br />

<p><span><span>What 3 party software’s that you installed for your webcam to work?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try downloading the latest drivers from Dell’s website selecting the appropriate model and Operating System and see if that helps
 to get back the feature to change the settings for the webcam.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Do you use a wired or a wireless Internet connection?</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Does the issue occur only while watching videos or even when browsing the internet?</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Do you have any security software installed on the computer?</p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>First, temporarily <b>disable security software</b> and check if the Internet Connection drops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>NOTE: </b>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, I’d suggest you to boot into<b> safe mode with networking</b> and check if you’re able to browse the internet normally without any issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Safe mode with networking starts Windows in safe mode and includes the network drivers and services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <b>Advanced Boot Options</b> screen lets you start Windows in advanced troubleshooting modes. You can access the menu by turning on your computer and pressing the
<b>F8 key</b> before Windows starts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the link below for more details: </p>
<p><b>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the <b>"Safe mode with Networking"</b> option from the available options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you’re able to browse the internet and watch online videos without any problems in safe mode with networking. And we shall proceed with further troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to go through the steps mentioned in the link and check.</p>

<h2>            How do I reinstall Windows 7 without the disk&#63;</h2>
                    <p><em>Dell Laptop Windows 7</em></p>
<p>I purchased a laptop with Windows 7 on it last year. I am now having probelms with it and need to completely wipe out my hard drive and since my computer didnt come with a disc for Windows 7, how can I get it back on my computer after I wipe it off? Can
 I create a disc from my computer? If so, how? I have already created a repair disc windows 7 64-bit but I am not sure if that will install the windows 7 operating system after the computer is stripped. :-/ Please help!</p>
<p>Oh and the reason I need to wipe the computer clean is because I can't download/install anything! Not even an attachment in an email.. I dont get a warning or an error message it just doesnt load..

            <blockquote>I know I didnt have any disks that came with my computer.. but I'd hate to delete everything and then not have it where it is built into the computer.. is there anyway to find out if its built in?</blockquote>
<p><br />
When you re-install an operating system, the programs that come with the system will be all&nbsp;there. I believe that is what you meant by " built in ".</p>
<p>What you will lose are all the files you have created and all the 3rd party programs you have downloaded and installed in the past.&nbsp; That, you'll have to re-do them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call your computer manufcaturer...</p>
<p>1. Ask to speak to a technician. Ask the person to teach you how to access to your Recovery Partition ( if you have one, most computer do&nbsp;) and also how to use the partition to restore your system. They are the people who created the partition. They know
 how to use it.</p>
<p>2. At the same time, ask for a set of Recovery disks. The charge is minimal and money well spent. The set will save your computer when it crashes or in a situation like you are facing now.</p>
