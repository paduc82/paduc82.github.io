<h2>            Windows Camera - Not opening</h2>
                    Yesterday morning, I tried going into Windows Camera, but there wasn't an icon and the window immediately closed out. I contacted Microsoft Support, and they got me a troubleshooter to fix the issue. After about 2 or 3 troubleshooting, Windows Camera was
 fixed. That was a moment of relief. But it was temporarily, I thought that issue was fixed permanently. But it wasn't because I tried going into Windows Camera again today, and it's doing the same thing it was doing yesterday. I run the troubleshooter again,
 but this time it's not fixing it. What is going on? Why is it doing this?&nbsp;How can it be fixed permanently and never have to frustrate us users again?

            Hello SarahPatterson3
<br />Please try these steps 
<br />-Check for an outdated webcam driver
<br />Select the Start  button, type Device Manager, and then select Device Manager from the search results.
<br />Find your webcam under Imaging devices or Sound, video and game controllers.
<br />Press and hold (or right-click) the name of your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />Select the Driver tab, select the Driver Details button, and look for a file name that includes stream.sys. If it’s there, your webcam was designed before Windows 7 and you'll have to replace it with a newer webcam.
<br />If you don't find a file name that includes stream.sys, try rolling back your webcam driver.
<br />-Roll back your webcam driver
<br />In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />Select the Driver tab, select Roll Back Driver, and then choose Yes. (Note that some drivers don’t provide a rollback option.)
<br />After the rollback is complete, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
<br />If rolling back didn’t work or isn’t available, uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes.
<br />-Uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes
<br />In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />Select the Driver tab, select Uninstall &gt; Delete the driver software for this device, and then select OK.
<br />In Device Manager, on the Action menu, select Scan for hardware changes. Wait for it to scan and reinstall updated drivers, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
<br />If your webcam still doesn’t work, try looking for help on the webcam manufacturer’s website.
<br />
<br />I hope it helps       
        </p>

            Thanks, both of you. But neither of those options worked. It turns out that the troubleshooter worked, I just had to give it some time.

    <title>Read Only Attribute in Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Read Only Attribute in Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Good day people!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there are many more posts to this issue but I have tried all the solutions in them and nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently upgraded my PC from Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 10. I have recently come to regret this decision as Windows 10 really appears to be a much bigger issue that it's worth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the things I'm confronting at this point is this annoying Read Only Attribute. I have some folders that I definitely need not be Read Only. I alter the setting in the Properties tab, hit apply, close the Properties tab and when I open it, the Read
 Only Attribute is squared again. I have tried altering the security tab to allow full control to everyone, I have tried setting the Read Only Attribute through Command Prompt... Nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any more insight into this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be more than happy even if no files and folders are set to Read Only on my PC at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi Alexandru,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may experience any of the following symptoms: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You cannot view or change the Read-only or System attributes of a folder by using the
<strong>Properties</strong> dialog box for the folder. For example, you may experience the following symptoms:
<ul>
<li>When you view the <strong>General</strong> tab of a folder's <strong>Properties</strong> dialog box, the
<strong>Read-only</strong> check box is not available, and there is no check box to change the System attribute.
</li><li>You click to clear or click to select the <strong>Read-only</strong> check box on the
<strong>General</strong> tab of a folder's <strong>Properties</strong> dialog box. When you click
<strong>OK</strong> or <strong>Apply</strong>, you receive the following message:
<div>Confirm Attribute Changes<br />
You have chosen to make the following attribute changes:<br />
unset read-only<br />
Do you want to apply this change to this folder only, or do you want to apply it to all subfolders and files as well?</div>
If you click <strong>Apply changes to this folder only</strong>, the Read-only attribute is changed for all the files in the folder. However, the Read-only attribute is not changed for the folder, its subfolders, or any files in its subfolders. If you click
<strong>Apply changes to this folder, subfolders, and files</strong>, the Read-only attribute is changed for all files in the folder and all files in the subfolders. However, the Read-only attribute is not changed for the folder or its subfolders.</li></ul>
</li><li>Some programs may display error messages when you try to save files to a folder that uses the Read-only or System attribute. As a result, these programs may not be able to save files to the folder.</li></ul>
<p>To work around this problem, use the <span>Attrib</span> command at a command prompt (Cmd.exe) to view or to remove the Read-only or the System attributes of folders. To view or to remove the Read-only or the System attributes of folders
<span>Warning</span> If you remove the Read-only or System attribute from a folder, it may appear as a ordinary folder and some customizations may be lost. For example, Windows customizes the Fonts folder and provides a special folder view that permits you
 to hide variations, such as bold and italic. It also permits you to change the folder's view settings in ways that are specific to fonts. If you remove the Read-only and System attributes of the Fonts folder, these customized view settings are not available.
 For folders that you have customized by using the <strong>Customize</strong> tab of the folder's
<strong>Properties</strong> dialog box, the folder icon and other other customizations may be lost when you remove the Read-only attribute.
<br />
<br />
If a program cannot save files to a folder with the Read-only attribute, such as My Documents, change the Read-only attribute to System by using the Attrib command at a command prompt.<br />
<br />
<span>Note</span> If the <strong><span>Run</span></strong> command is not listed on the
<strong><span>Start</span></strong>&nbsp;menu, do the following: Click <strong><span>Start</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, click <strong><span>Accessories</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Run</span></strong>.<br />
<br />
To remove the Read-only attribute and to set the System attribute, use the following command:
</p>
<div><span>attrib -r +s drive:\&lt;path&gt;\&lt;foldername&gt;</span></div>
For example, to remove the Read-only attribute and to set the System attribute for the C:\Test folder, use the following command:
<div><span>attrib -r +s c:\test</span></div>
Be aware that some programs may not operate correctly with folders for which the System attribute and the Read-only attribute are set. Therefore, use the following command to remove these attributes:
<div><span>attrib -r -s c:\test</span></div>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please post in case you have any further issues, we will be glad to help you further.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>YES,!!!!</p>
<p>I am trying to save a photograph that I have been altering for the past 2 hours :( I do not want to take the chance of losing all of my tedious work by minimizing my Paintshop Pro App to see if I can use this complicated method above to try and fix this
 annoying bug...I NEED this photo saved!! Can someone at MS please write a fix immediately, that we can press on 1 button to either remove this "read only" glitch or at least give us the option of choosing if we want it for our entire system, or just the file
 at hand... My assumption that most of us are&nbsp;NOT programmers and find it very disturbing to run into problems such as this one which stops us dead&nbsp;in our tracks, &nbsp;when trying to accomplish a necessary step in our lives using our computers which should not
 force us to also become programming experts :( --- I need a phone call at - xxx-xxx-7827 ASAP as this situation MUST be rectified. We spend thousands of dollars on your company's products, so to constantly have these issues pop up and keep us from accomplishing
 our tasks at hand is beyond perplexing... :( :( :( </p>

</p><p><strong><span>Issue</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I am constantly having to run the troubleshooter for the Network Adapter for Wi Fi because the Wi Fi connection keeps dropping. &nbsp;When that happens, I notice that my system isn’t picking up or listing any other Wi Fi access points in my area.&nbsp; Which
 is at about 8 others right now, until after the Network adapter resets.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span>After troubleshooting message reads:<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Problem with wireless adapter or access point</strong>. And then it is reset every time until it drops again, usually within a half an hour.&nbsp; Even during this posting I've had to reset it 3
 times, about 45 min. so far. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;I have been running Windows 10 on this laptop for almost a year with no issues. &nbsp;In fact, I have never experienced this issue before. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, I began noticing this issue immediately after I had connected my new Android phone to this laptop (2<sup>nd</sup> time ever connected this phone to this machine).&nbsp; When I did I realized that the computer may not have been done with the booting
 process. Don’t know if that means anything.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>What I have tried</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Looked over as much of the previous issues others have reported in the past, however I have not found anything associated with Win 10 OS that has been helpful. &nbsp;I even ran the commands to reset the TCP/IP settings listed here in this posting:</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for replying Gerry. &nbsp;Interesting turn of events. &nbsp;I attached an ethernet cable and gained access to the internet that way. &nbsp;The computer decided to run thae latest update from the other day again. &nbsp;The Windows Module installer ran for about 30
 min. after update. &nbsp;I now have Wi Fi again. &nbsp;I am waiting to see if I lose connection again. If I do not respond after this it means that it is fixed. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi EdwinSchiff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank for reaching out to us! We appreciate your question and hope we can help you fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest you try shutting down the Surface completely and then unplugging the printer from the Surface (assuming your printer is connected directly to the device).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If, on the other hand, your printer is connected to&nbsp;another device, like a laptop or desktop, we recommend you unplug it&nbsp;from&nbsp;the correspondent device after shutting down the Surface, and then plug it back and restart the Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your printer is wirelessly connected, then, as <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7f5e4a8c-d7c3-4042-ae28-eb0a30260cf5" title="James Vinyard">
James Vinyard</a> suggested, the best solution would be uninstalling it and installing it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope this information is useful. Please keep us posted! We are always here to help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

    <title>Windows Media Player Has Trouble Playing Offline Files After Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> technostud  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player Has Trouble Playing Offline Files After Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>For well over a decade, I have used Windows Media Player to play offline cached files with no problem.&nbsp; Now, following a Windows Update on 3 separate laptops , there are problems.&nbsp; Let me explain:</p>
<ol>
<li>My data is stored on a Windows Server 2012 R2 computer.</li><li>I take files offline with 3 different laptops that connect to that server.&nbsp; This way, the files stay in sync with the server using the Offline Files feature.&nbsp; 2 laptops run Windows 10 Pro, 1 laptop runs Windows 8.1 Pro.</li><li>Earlier in October 2018, I installed standard Windows Updates on my laptops, and ever since then, Windows Media Player has problems playing offline files.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the first time Windows Media Player attempts to play a file, it errors out.&nbsp; When I attempt to play that same file again, it plays.&nbsp; It's like the first time Windows Media Player tries to access an offline file, the offline cache doesn't
 respond fast enough.&nbsp; Then, the second time I try to play, it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have playlists that have songs stored locally and songs stored in the offline files cache.&nbsp; Songs stored locally will always play perfectly.&nbsp; Songs stored in the offline files cache fail the first time, and need to be chosen again to play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

<p>Thanks for confirming what I should do.&nbsp; I had a hunch which Windows Update caused the problem, and I was right.&nbsp; The first thing that I did was uninstall the following Windows Update, and my problem was immediately solved.&nbsp; I feel like this should be reported
 to Microsoft, because it does not seem that they know about the problem.&nbsp; What is the best way to communicate this to them?&nbsp; I have now been able to reproduce the problem on 3 different computers running Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (1709), and Windows 10 (1803).&nbsp;
 The problem Windows Update is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>WINDOWS 8.1:&nbsp; 2018-10 Security Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems (KB4462926)</p>
<p>WINDOWS 10 (1709):&nbsp; Security Update for Microsoft Windows (KB4462918)</p>
<p>WINDOWS 10 (1803):&nbsp; Security Update for Microsoft Windows (KB4462919)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How will I know when it's safe to install Windows Updates again?&nbsp; It's scary going without Security Updates, but Windows Media Player is a mission critical tool for my business, so I can't endure this problem.<br />

<h2>            Pen tablet bus enumerator error.</h2>
                    At this point I have tried absolutely everything. I just got a new tablet the ugee 1910b. How to attempted to install uninstall and reinstall the drivers, restart my computer numerous times, and just about everything in the book and online and on YouTube.
 I think I came to the final thing that's actually stopping me from being able to use my drawing tablet. The pen tablet bus enumerator driver in device manager. That's the only thing with an error on it and I wouldn't know how to go about getting the error
 off. What do I do?

==================================================<br />
Two things you could try first...<br />
<br />
In Movie Maker...go to...Tools / Options / Compatibility <br />
tab...uncheck all filters . OK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try to save.<br />
<br />
Also it may be worth a try to save as DV-AVI instead <br />
of WMV.<br />
<br />
Windows XP Movie Maker 2.1.....<br />
To save as a DV-AVI movie file...<br />
<br />
Type...Ctrl+P (or go to...File / Save Movie File)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to open the Save Movie Wizard /<br />
Choose...My Computer /<br />
Next /<br />
Enter a Name and a Save Location /<br />
Next /<br />
Show More Choices /<br />
Other Settings /<br />
Open the drop window and choose...DV-AVI /<br />
Next /<br />
Wait while the movie is saved /<br />
Finish...<br />
<br />
Still not luck...read on...<br />
<br />
The error you quote usually indicates that your source <br />
files have compatibility issues.<br />
<br />
Three possible causes for the failure to save:<br />
(More info on saving pasted at the end of this message)<br />
<br />
1) Incompatible source files...(possibly...MPG or MP3).<br />
<br />
Solution...convert to compatible formats...<br />
Video&nbsp; =&nbsp; WMV<br />
Audio&nbsp; =&nbsp; WMA<br />
<br />
Many formats are reportedly compatible with<br />
Movie Maker but the most reliable choices are:<br />
<br />
Photos -&nbsp; bmp, jpg<br />
Video -&nbsp; wmv<br />
Audio -&nbsp; wma, wav, wmv<br />
<br />
2) Corrupt source files...the only fix for this would be to <br />
remove source files from the project one at a time and <br />
try to save each time until the problem file is discovered.<br />
<br />
3) Project is too large or complex for system resources.<br />
Create several smaller projects...saving each one as WMV. <br />
Then re-import the collected WMV files / drag all to timeline <br />
and Save the final movie.<br />
<br />
The following older article offers some info.<br />

===========================================<br />
I have no experience with a converter named "converterlite" <br />
but would suspect a different converter may produce a more <br />
satisfactory result.<br />
<br />
Personally, I've had good results using the freeware FreeMake<br />
Video Converter and FreeMaker Audio Converter.<br />
<br />
If you decide to try these programs...convert the Original <br />
versions of the files and not the already converted versions.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

    <title>Surface Pro &#43; Dockingstation External Monitor issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theogiers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro &#43; Dockingstation External Monitor issues</h2>
                    <p>Hey!</p>
<p>I recently got the surface pro (2017) with i5 and 256 gb. I also bought the surface dock to connect an old monitor (Samsung SyncMaster 193P with 10280 x 1024) as a second one.
</p>
<p>I've got the microsoft MiniDP to VGA Adapter and after connecting the monitor to the dock and the dock to my surface i come to this problem:</p>
<p>The second monitor gets a signal, but i can't change the resolution above 640 x 480. This resolution is the biggest there is from the given options and its the one Windows tells me is best.
</p>
<p>When i duplicate the screen, i can set the resolution (then for both displays at once) to the resolution of the external monitor and that looks great(But then the Resolution on the surface is off, so thats not an option). When i extend the screen, the option
 i want to use, i can only set the resolution to 640 x 480. There is nothing above that in the options. When i choose only second monitor my surface screen turns off, and the second screen works, but again just with 640 x 480.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i've done so far: </p>
<p>tried a different monitor from a friend with the same results </p>
<p>Updated Windows, manually updated the Surface dock, update and installed drivers for the monitors and spent an hour on the support line (there is no microsoft store in Germany) but nothing helped. Really getting frustrated here, this is not what you expect
 when you such an expensive device. </p>
<p>Any help is very appreciated, thank you. </p>

    <title>Restoring backed up files from thumb drive with windows7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dupedinoregon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restoring backed up files from thumb drive with windows7</h2>
                    I installed updates, and when I restarted my computer, Windows was unable to start. I was sent to system restore, made the back up for my file on a thumb drive. I then restored my computer with system restore. Now I am unable to figure out how to restore
 my files from my back up. I have walked through the tutorial, but everything I have read tells me to go to back up and restore, once there it tells me to insert the drive and hit refresh, nothing shows up. I can see the files on the thumb drive, and was able
 to copy them to the computer, but have no clue how to restore them to the correct programs.

<p><span>Hi dupedinoregon,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you referring to the “<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System Recovery Options</a>” in the diagnostics mode of Windows?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 option did you use to backup files here?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 kind of files are these (Documents, Pictures or other)?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you perform a&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">system restore</a> or a factory restore?</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you have all the programs installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: &nbsp;</span></strong><span>You mentioned that you were able to copy files
 to the computer but not able to open them. If this was just a system restore then you can try the following.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the file and select “Open with”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 “Choose default program”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 the application from the program options provided.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 you do not see the application then, click “Browse” to select it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Also see:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-which-programs-Windows-uses-by-default" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change which programs Windows uses by default</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If this was a factory restore then Windows
 7 is now a new installation without any programs installed except for the ones that with factory. In this case you need to reinstall the applications you installed later.</span></p>

<h2>            SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED</h2>
                    <p>I have now done a complete format and reinstall of Windows 10 3 times. I initially was having a Motherboard problem, and after replacing that part and re imaging, I'm receiving the above BSOD. I had initially tried a 'restore' leaving my user profile intact,
 but when the above BSOD eventually came back (within a week or two) I decided to format the drive and start completely from scratch. It's now been a few weeks, and it's back again. I was on the PC last night, gaming, no issues, no new driver installs, didn't
 get prompted for Windows updates or anything else unusual. I tried to boot up this morning and I'm getting the BSOD again. Safe Mode will not boot, Startup Repair won't work, System Restore won't work; nothing will get me into Windows for even a few minutes
 to try any local troubleshooting in the environment. Through the recovery environment I was able to get to the minidump files using command prompt, and I've uploaded them here:</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>A stop error, better known as a Blue Screen of Death (also known as a blue screen or BSoD) is an error screen displayed on a Windows computer system after a fatal system error, also known as a system crash: when the operating system reaches a condition where
 it can no longer operate safely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help resolve the issue, we suggest performing the methods below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot blue screen errors</a></strong></p>
<p>This article provides a step-by-step troubleshooting steps on resolving blue screen display issues.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Run a System File Checker</a></strong></p>

            <p>I already looked through that Method 1 post. With the computer being completely bricked (safe mode won't work) I can't do any troubleshooting inside of Windows such as updating drivers, removing them from startup list, etc. I had already physically removed
 all extra hardware but that did not solve the problem, and I can't just never use any of my peripherals again for fear of any one of them being at fault...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm unable to run SFC from the recovery environment (it errors out after reaching 100% of the intial check, saying it can't proceed further) and since I can't get into actual Windows, even in safe mode, the recovery environment is the only place for me to
 run it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reinstalled Windows because I can't be without my machine, but I'm hoping the minidump files I posted can point to some particular driver/software as the cause, so I can avoid installing that in the future. This has happened multiple times and I've
 exhausted all troubleshooting I can think of with no idea of the root cause. It would be so much easier if I could actually get into Safe Mode when this happens, but unfortunately I can't.</p>

<p>Yes; booting with the installation media did not make any of the recovery tools function any better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files were not screenshots; they were minidump files, in ZIP format, per instructions I found on another thread for troubleshooting this kind of issue. I was hoping these minidump files would allow someone with more experience interpreting those to help
 me pinpoint the root cause of this recurring issue, so that I'm not stuck in an infinite loop of reimaging my computer, as I can't trace down the driver or device causing the problem...</p>

            Thank you for your reply<br />
<br />
I already tried all these steps but to no avail, still I am not able to change the settings. I can get and install updates by manually checking for updates. I want to set it to Automatically download and Install updates. I also tried Tweaking.com Windows Repair
 All tool that also did not worked.<br />
<br />
<b><br />
EDIT:</b><br />
<br />
Greetings............<br />
<br />
I managed to resolve the issue. I opened <b>Registry Editor</b> with <b>Administrator Rights</b> navigated to following reg key<br />
<code><font><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU</strong></font></code>. and deleted all the keys inside
<b>AU</b> folder.<br />
Restarted the computer and now I am able to change the Windows Update Settings.<br />
<br />
This issue is now resolved.<br />

I could not find an&nbsp;e = 2.71828183 key on the windows calculator.<br />
I used&nbsp;Google's built-in calculator function.<br />

<h3> dawnie18  say:</h3>
<h2>            Importing photos from iphone 5s to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Having recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 I had previously been able to connect my IPhone to the PC, see it as an external hard drive and copy all my photos over.&nbsp; Now I have Windows 10, I can still see the IPhone as an external hard drive but
 cannot import, cut or copy my photos over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have some success at the start&nbsp;and have copied some photos over as jpg's but I couldn't associated a program with them to open .&nbsp; I had&nbsp;to do this individually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I try to view the photos on the iphone/external drive they are numbered in this format on checking the properties the type is a File Folder and if I try to open them Photo Gallery IMG_0311.jpg, I get the message "We can't open this file".&nbsp; If I
 try to drag and drop or cut/copy from iphone/external drive &nbsp;I get the following message box</p>
<p>Error copying or file or folder </p>
<p>"The Paramater is incorrect "</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got any advice</p>

            Now this is why people want to throw their iPhones/computers against the wall. Tech support folks basically blaming the customer for not knowing what they're doing. This problem is because Microsoft and Apple are in a continuous feud, and we the people
 are paying the price. Really? An iPhone update will solve this problem? C'mon.

                    <p>I didn't use Skype for a bit (maybe a few weeks). <br />
When I tried to login, my password was not recognised. I reset it, got a new version of skype automatically installed and now I lost all my contacts that I manually added, who are not on Skype, all my settings are gone and it says that I never purchased any
 credits. I should have had there at least $10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is happening and how can I reinstate all of the above???&nbsp;</p>
