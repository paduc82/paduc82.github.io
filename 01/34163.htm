    <title>Issues joining Minecraft world - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jack&#39;s mom_81  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues joining  Minecraft world</h2>
                    <p>My son and his cousin were using Xbox 360 to play Minecraft online together - they could both join one another's worlds. Here's what changed last night:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My son (and his cousin) both got the Xbox One S Minecraft Bundle.</p>
<p>2. My son has been using my account for the Xbox live account because we couldn't get a child account to work. But he decided last night that he wanted to change my gamertag since he's the one using it, so we changed my gamertag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. They went to play together this morning on the new Xbox One S. My son's cousin could join him in a new world, but he can't join her world. Her gets the invite, it spins and then says "Cannot join world" with no further explanation.</p>
<p>4. They went back to their Xbox 360s and now my son can't join his cousin there either (when he could just fine a few days ago).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This made me think that maybe the problem was changing the gamertag. His cousin unfriended and added him as a friend again, but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She checked her NAT settings and they are pretty restricted, so maybe that's the issue, but they didn't change in a few days time, so why did it work before, but suddenly won't now?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice is greatly appreciated!&nbsp;</p>
<p />

<h2>            Skype for Business works on Mobile but not on Laptop</h2>
                    I can log in to S4B on my Phone (iOS) no problem at all, but when I try on my W10 laptop, it cannot validate my credentials and will not allow me to log in. It claims my account does not exist, yet I know it does. Any help?

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings. May I know if you can successfully log in Skype for Business (SFB) before?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, I suggest you can try following steps yo see it it helps:</p>
<p>1. In the SFB sign in window, click the button "Delete my sign-in info", then exit SFB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Go to&nbsp;%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync and delete all SIP folders, then try sign in SFB again and check the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, to confirm whether this issue is related to your account or the SFB client in your PC, could you please check if you can successfully sign in your account in a different PC?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us us the results and provide following information if the issue persists, which will help us narrow down this issue and assist you better:</p>
<p>1. A screenshoot of the complete error message.</p>
<p>2. A screenshoot of your SFB client version. You can click on the "▼" button and select Help &gt; About Skype for Business.</p>
<p>3. If convenience, please connect to a different network to see if there is any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>

            There are no Skype HDMI settings that you can configure from within the application itself. These settings should be configured on the devices used for transmission.
<br />
<br />Another thing, since support for Skype on TV has long been discontinued, there is no guarantee a guarantee that the full functionality of Skype will work even with an HDMI transmission from a supported device.

<h3> chucklestyle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game freezes &#42;constantly&#42; in Act III</h2>
                    
<p>I successfully made it through normal with two characters with no problem:</p>
<p>Witch Doctor</p>
<p>Wizard (Hardcore)</p>
<p>and have been trucking my Witch Doctor through Nightmare mode.</p>

<p>As soon as I hit Act III, the game hard locks almost constantly, to the point where it is unplayable. &nbsp;I hardlocked 5 times within 10 minutes trying to raise the catapaults, and then once I finally got lucky enough to pass that mission, the game locks up
 constantly when I attempt the next one. &nbsp;I've tried clearing my cache and re-installing the game to the HD (I always install a game to the HD before I play it) and have no other ideas. &nbsp;The game installed to the HD fine both times and the disc is pristine,
 plus I have made it through Act III previously both solo and with friends. &nbsp;Anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>Sounds like a corrupt save file to me. Try clearing your cache, uninstalling the game from hdd(do not reinstall) and copy your cloud save to the console itself.</p>
<p>Doing this will give you the least amount of monkey wrenches in the way. If you can get act III to load then you know it was either the install or the cloud saves.</p>
<p>Edit: If however nothing works then the save itself is probably borked and you will most likely have to start over.</p>
<p>You may also try going into someone else's game and seeing if you can pass act 3 in their game</p>

<p>So I found a workaround: I used quest select to backtrack to Act II and re-killed Belial, then advanced to Act III as normal and had no problems afterwards, was able to go all the way from the beginning of Act III up to slaying Ghom with no hangups. &nbsp;I can
 only assume it didn't like something in my save file and re-doing the end of Act II fixed it.</p>

<p>This has happened to me once in probably 5 or more times running the catapault quest. &nbsp;I don't have the game installed. &nbsp;I was playing solo on my Wizard in Nightmare mode. &nbsp;I had just gotten to a catapault and was about to start destroying it and the monsters
 started rolling in. &nbsp;It was absolute chaos on my screen. &nbsp;At this point the game froze and my party chat started skipping. &nbsp;I opened the disc tray and was sent back to the dashboard and party chat went back to normal.</p>
<p>This is probably just a bug in the game and you're unlucky to have hit it more than once. &nbsp;I'm not too worried about it. &nbsp;I'll just make sure that I save my character from now on before running this quest.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth file received but never save</h2>
                    <p>So I sent 40 over files via Bluetooth to my laptop (windows 10) but towards the end, there was 1 file that was not sent through. So the bluetooth receiver showed unable to receive file and etc...So I closed the window and tried to send again. It worked but
 I realised the other 40 files were missing...But on my phone it states "40 files were successfully sent"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to ask, if my laptop received the file but if I didn't click save location and just close, it'll be gone? Or is there a way to retrieve it aside from re-sending?<br />

<p>Hi Carrisa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>try to send the files again and when this came up after you click on <strong>Receive files</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cb9af14-4158-4a21-8126-b71863524b43" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cb9af14-4158-4a21-8126-b71863524b43" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>take down note of the path folder that you see indicated in the location bar and look for that folder path&nbsp;on your file explorer. If the files are not there that means your PC did not successfully received the files due to sending got interrupted half way
 thru as what you have mentioned.</p>

                    <p>My Windows Update is shaky at the best of times, but I recently managed to successfully install a backlog of several updates that were failing. There is just one left:</p>
<p>

</p><p>The update fails. The error information is:</p>

<p>I have tried every troubleshooting procedure I can find nothing makes this one stick. Any suggestions would be welcome.<br />

<br />
The issue might be due to the bad sectors on the hard drive. I would suggest you to run the check disk and see if that helps.<br />

<p>Hi Piet,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First make sure that the computer is up to date. The computer should have the latest operating system updates, audio and video drivers, and software application updates to make connecting to a Skype for Business Online meeting a
 successful experience. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>1. Check whether the Skype for Business version is the latest. See&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn788954?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for Business downloads and updates</a>.</p>
<p>2. <span>Run Windows Update, and then verify that all optional hardware updates are installed. Specifically, make sure that video, audio, and network drivers are up to date.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If the computer is up to date and meets all minimum system requirements, clear any cached credentials or certificates from previous logons:</p>
<span>
<p>1. Verify that the user has the correct certificates in Certificate Manager. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>a. Open Windows Certificate Manager. To do this, click <strong>
Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type <span>
certmgr.msc</span>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>b. Expand <strong>Personal</strong>, and then expand <strong>
Certificates</strong>.</p>
<p>c. Sort by the <strong>IssuedBy</strong> column, and then look for a certificate that is issued by Communications Server.</p>
<p>d. Verify that the certificate is present and that it isn't expired.</p>
<p>e. Delete the certificate, and then try to sign in to Skype for Business Online. If you can't sign in to Skype for Business Online, go to step 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Remove the user’s Skype for Business Online credentials from the Windows Credential Manager. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>a. Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>
Control Panel</strong>, and then click <strong>Credential Manager</strong>.</p>
<p>b. Locate the set of credentials that are used to connect to Skype for Business Online.</p>
<p>c. Expand the set of credentials, and then click <strong>Remove from Vault</strong>.</p>
<p>d. Try to sign in to Skype for Business Online, and then type the new set of credentials.</p>
Skype for Business Online falls back to "anonymous join" if it can't authenticate. As long as anonymous participants aren't explicitly blocked from joining the meeting, they should always be able to join the meeting.</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>If all above with no avail, I'd like to collect the following info to further look into the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>1. The screenshot of the error code.</span></p>
<p><span>2. How many users doe the problem affect?</span></p>
<p><span>3. If you switch another PC, can you reproduce the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>4. Have your organization deployed a Skype for Business server?</span></p>
<p><span>5. The current Skype for Business version. Please go to
<strong>Help&gt; About Skype for Business</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Lance</span></p>
<p>

<p>On the 360 you could delete any game from you games played history if you hadn't unlocked any achievements on that game.</p>
<p>At the moment you can't do that on the xbox one,probably because the achievement system works differently on the xbox one.</p>

<h2>            Multiple caller video</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I don't understand why they had to change this, but... I have the newest skype version and now, when we have a video meeting, not more than 4 people "fit" in the screen and I can't add more, I can just switch persons. I don't like that! At
 all! I want to see all of my colleagues at once. Does anybody know if this is possible?</p>

            I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report,then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            Hi Mariah.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What downloaded files?   Are you referring to your User folders like Documents, Pictures, Music, etc, or just the Downloads folder?  
<br />
<br />What happened just before this occurred that might have caused it?
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />OneDrive introduced some features that remove files from the hard drive and store them only in the cloud if Files On Demand is chosen in OneDrive Settings:  <a href="https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/05/11/introducing-onedrive-files-on-demand-and-additional-features-making-it-easier-to-access-and-share-files/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/05/11/intro...</a>
<br />
<br />Also if the new Folder Protection is chosen in OneDrive Settings &gt; AutoSave Tab, then Documents, Desktop and Pictures folders will be moved into the OneDrive folder.  See Folder Protection details here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />Strangely, recent Updates have set these on by default and even caused file losses that resulting in withdrawing the October Version 1809 Upgrade.  So I would check closely those OneDrive Settings, your OneDrive folder, the PC Recycle Bin,  and also check the Onedrive Online Recycle Bin.
<br />
<br />Some Updates can also cause Windows 10 to start into a temporary profile which should be obvious because you don't recognize anything, in which case files should still be in your old Profile at C:\Users.  
<br />
<br />Finally sometimes if an Update fails it will archive files in C:\windows.old.  
<br />
<br />So look in all of those places, starting with OneDrive online files and online Recycle Bin.  Right click OneDrive cloud icon in System tray to "View Online."
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

 failed. I know that the Microsoft product works since it can connect to my Surface Pro 3. I also know that I can connect to the adapter with an older model like the S4, so I was wondering if anyone else is having this issue with the S5 and if anyone was able
 to successfully connect and how. I am aware that an MHL adapter would do the trick but I am trying to specifically use the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter. Any help is appreciated, thanks!<br />

            I'm having the same issue. &nbsp;It's interesting because I'm reading comments on the Internet that claim it's because the Galaxy will only connect with a Samsung TV. &nbsp;But I have an ActionTek wireless display adapter and it works perfectly with my S5.

            I should also mention the Microsoft adapter works fine with my wife's S4. &nbsp;I'm running Android 5.0 on the S5.

<p>I've had about 3 errors on my laptop this past month, and I wanted to see if I could get some assistance. The most recent crash was a BAD_POOL_CALLER&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;driver tcpipreg.sys, caused by address tcpipreg.sys+53e92, crash address ntoskrnl.exe+14e8a0.
 I live abroad and I do use a vpn, and I've thought that that they may be causing it. I have the dump file as a txt file if you would like to me to show it to you. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!</p>
