<h2>            how to play .flv extensions on widows media player on windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Sorry, I know there are a couple of answers on this....but all seem to be inconclusive as to if Windows Media player for Windows 8 CAN play .flv extensions.&nbsp; There were some solutions, but they either involved downloading possible dangerous files or using
 another player...both not a good option.</p>
<p>So....</p>
<p>Is there a safe Microsoft solution?&nbsp; I.e. is there a MS approved codex to get these to play...yes or no.</p>
<p>thanks</p>

    <title>Windows 10 constant scroll to the right - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mac0422  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 constant scroll to the right</h2>
                    <p>I have a desktop with Windows 10 Home 1809 installed and is constantly scrolls to the right. This causes an auto scroll down appearance in most windows, such as the programs menu, setting (when is more than one screen of content) but it can be distinguished
 as a right scroll when The Edge window is reduced in size from right to left. &nbsp;Also the date on the login screen scrolls in a loop from bottom to top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have loaded all Windows updates, driver update, bios update, done a windows reset and finally a complete repartion, format and a fresh install of windows with a a just produced usb install media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is present with or without a keyboard and mouse install. I have also swapped out the key board and mouse independently with other known good devices. I have delete the mouse and keyboard device and rebooted allowing rediscovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing works, I can’t get the scrolling to stop.</p>

            Hi Mac.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Choose a Screen Resolution that precludes the rightward scrolling, at Settings &gt; System &gt; Display.
<br />
<br />3) Try adjusting the Scaling in the same location if necessary to preclude the scrolling.  Start with 125%, log off to check proportionality.  If not satisfactory try a custom Scaling like 117%.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Sure, you can place the videos in OneDrive, right click to get a Share link and paste it back here.  
<br />
<br />When did it last work correctly?  What has changed since then?  Is there a System Restore point to roll back to before then?  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Change the batteries if wireless, try another USB port, reset mouse from button on bottom if available.
<br />
<br />Try the mouse in another PC to isolate if it's the mouse or Windows causing this.
<br />
<br />Try another mouse in this PC to confirm if Windows is the problem.
<br />
<br />Access the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Mouse, then Driver tab. First try Update this Driver &gt; Automatically, then Roll Back if available. If not choose Uninstall button, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Is there mouse software installed in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features? Uninstall it to see if the problem stops. This is unneeded bloatware.
<br />
<br />Adjust the mouse settings in Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Mouse, checking all settings including the Additonal Mouse Options box - check Settings on all tabs.
<br />
<br />Report back all results for possible other things to try.
<br />
<br />To check if Windows is causing this you can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki</a>...
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m</a>...
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Replace Photos in Movie Maker</h2>
                    When using photos and making music &nbsp;with text videos to upload to youtube can I change the photo after I finish the video and music because i find a better photo. &nbsp;I make music with text videos of our church band and upload them to Youtube. &nbsp;I try to find
 photos to go with the music subject and many times a finish a music, text, video and find a better photo. I can insert new photo to end of video and move everything to the end and remove the beginning, but it is a lot of work, is there an easier way. I believe
 it is movie maker 2012

            <p>When you choose 'Add videos and photos' it will place the photo before the currently selected photo. So if you want to replace a photo, click on it first. &nbsp;Then import the photo you want to replace it. Delete the original and change the duration and effects
 to match the one you removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, if it ends up at the end because you didn't select a photo first, then drag it from the end and put it into the spot where you want it. &nbsp;It isn't necessary to drag everything else later.</p>

<p><strong>I have successfully installed an Oki C3200 printer to an Airport Express unit. The printer is listed in the Windows Control Panel.&nbsp;The printer is connected via USB to the Airport Express (AE) unit. I have&nbsp;installed the printer using Bonjour for Windows.
 The printer is identified&nbsp;by the Bonjour software as being connected to the AE unit.&nbsp;I followed a port re-assignment procedure as recommended on an Apple&nbsp;discussion forum, but still have an error printing.&nbsp;When I try to print an error message "Could not connect
 printer to LPR port" appears with options "Retry" or "Cancel". Retry does not fix error.&nbsp;On checking the port assignment via "Printer properties-ports-configure-port settings", I notice the protocol is set to&nbsp;"RAW' not "LPR".&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Hey there! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are running into this issue with connecting to your Mobile Hotspot. I understand that you can't power cycle your network hardware being that you are on your mobile device but have you tried turning off the phone for a while and then powering
 it back on to see if that works? </p>
<p>Connecting to a Hotspot will work sometimes but it is not the most reliable source of network. If the issue persists and you have no way to connect to any other network I would advise reaching out to your carrier to see if there is anything that they can
 advise to you as far as troubleshooting the Hotspot. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. </p>

<p>I also suggest creating a standard user account for yourself (if you have not done so already)&nbsp;and your son and use that for day to day use. Only use the existing admin account for maintenance tasks, etc.<strong>
<u>Do not</u> set up your son as an admin user.</strong></p>

<p>Personally my wife and I always run as standard users on each of our respective Win 7 computers. I only login to either computer as an admin user for maintenance, etc tasks.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that a teenager probably has access to other computers some of which
<br />
will not have effective controls. And the methods to bypass ineffective controls are passed
<br />
around by their peer group.<br />

You mean you downloaded the driver from Epson?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try using the the Add Printer wizard in the Control Panel, Printers. In the wizard select EPSON under Manufacturer. If you don't see your printer in the list, click on the
<strong>Windows Update</strong> button. It will take several minutes (about 20) be patient, Windows will update the list. You should see some hard disk activity during the update.</p>
<p><br />
If that would not work, try running the System File Checker:</p>
<p>Use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7<br />

            it's not that Print to PDF isn't installed necessarily, it's that you gave directions without finding out first which app the OP was using. In the Snipping Tool the ellipsis you directed him to click on doesn't exist.&nbsp;

<h2>            WIndows 10 blue screen driver_irql_not_less_or_equal problem &#40;include dump file, Driver view, sysinfo&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi I had this frustrating blue screen problem in my desktop. The driver_irql_not_less_or_equal blue screen does not happen always when I boot computer but it happens about a week or biweekly. It usually happen few minutes after I booted on the computer.
 I cleaned the os and reinstall it but the same problem happen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At 8/29/16,&nbsp;driver_irql_not_less_or_equal netio.sys appeared (two time. very short gap between each blue screen. Both netio.sys). I heard this will probably related to network driver so I went to my motherboard's website and download most recent network
 driver for my motherboard. (No idea if this netio.sys problem is solved or not..)</p>
<p>
</p><p>At 9/11/16, the blue screen appear and it simply said "driver_irql_not_less_or_equal" . (had a same problem in 8/20/16 which also just displays&nbsp;"driver_irql_not_less_or_equal". I uploaded this too just in case if there are any similarity with blue screen
 problem 8/20/16 to blue screen problem 9/11/16)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer shows up blue screen whenever I play a game or just use web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Elite Controller Stick Height Adjustment</h2>
                    
<p>I have been researching and can't find an answer on this.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I want to use the convex stick heads on the shortest sticks. Is that possible? I can't seem to find a way to switch the heads.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sorry if this is in the wrong place, and thanks for any answers!</p>

<div>Just a thought--have you checked to be sure you have the correct time</div>
<div>zone selected? Perhaps you are off by 12 time zones.</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 stuck in Automatic Repair loop</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>my laptop has been stuck in an automatic repair loop for a few weeks now. It won't let me reset my pc, and I've tried running the bootrec, but after it says it has successfully scanned 0 Windows installations. I've tried going back to a previous build, but
 that also doesn't work. It is getting very frustrating trying to deal with this, especially since I work mainly from my computer. I need help on how to fix this problem.&nbsp;<br />

            IME the Asus P5 series of motherboards may have some memory issues when using the AUTO setting in the BIOS.&nbsp; Please visit the Hynix website and get the timings/settings/voltages for your RAM - then set it manually in the BIOS (DO NOT use the Auto setting).<br />
<br />
Please run this free memory test:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.carrona.org/memdiag.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.carrona.org/memdiag.html</a><br />
<br />
Many, many older drivers on your system.&nbsp; Please visit the Asus website and update ALL drivers there.&nbsp; In particular, please ensure that you update the ATK0110 ACPI Utility driver.&nbsp; Yours dates from 2004 and is a known cause of BSOD's on Asus systems.&nbsp; If unable
 to locate the driver, please post back.<br />
<br />
Also, your BIOS dates from 2006, I'd suggest checking for BIOS updates.&nbsp; If you should choose to update your BIOS, please understand that it is not forgiving of any mistakes and can possibly damage your motherboard.&nbsp; Also, if updating your BIOS, update no more
 than 3 versions at a time (just to be safe).<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Defrag problems are often related to disk corruption.<br />
<br />
Inside Windows - Regular or Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot).<br />
<br />
Run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />

For even better and more efficient checking :<br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Windows 7<br />
disk - if you do not have a&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friend's (it needs to be same 32<br />

If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.<br />
<br />
If you need to make repair disks - these help repair Windows not re-install.<br />

                    Internet on my dell laptop running windows 7 just stops working after 10~15 minutes I open browser (IE8/Chrome). I go to options and click for troubleshoot, it says there is no problem with internet connection (as it appears in the tray as well)

            <p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing your experience on the new Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand the drivers are not working as expected in the new operating system. The issue might arise due to drivers' incompatibility with Windows 10. In the first place, I would suggest you to refer to the following wiki article by Andre Da Costa
 to install drivers in Windows 10.</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">How to: Install and Update drivers in Windows 10</a></strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, then I would suggest you to download the Intel driver for Windows 7 and install it in compatibility mode for Windows 10 as detailed below.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Right click on the downloaded driver file.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong><span>Properties</span></strong> and&nbsp;then select <strong>
<span>Compatibility</span></strong> tab.</span></li><li><span>Tick mark the option <strong><span>Run this program in Compatibility mode for:</span></strong> and then select

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing your experience on the new Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand the drivers are not working as expected in the new operating system. The issue might arise due to drivers' incompatibility with Windows 10. In the first place, I would suggest you to refer to the following wiki article by Andre Da Costa
 to install drivers in Windows 10.</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">How to: Install and Update drivers in Windows 10</a></strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, then I would suggest you to download the Intel driver for Windows 7 and install it in compatibility mode for Windows 10 as detailed below.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Right click on the downloaded driver file.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong><span>Properties</span></strong> and&nbsp;then select <strong>
<span>Compatibility</span></strong> tab.</span></li><li><span>Tick mark the option <strong><span>Run this program in Compatibility mode for:</span></strong> and then select
<strong><span>Windows&nbsp;7</span></strong> from the drop down menu.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click <strong><span>OK</span></strong> and install the driver.</span></li></ol>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

<p>I tried doing that, it didn't seem to work for me. Although, I found a new installation file that fixed the problem. Thank you for the feedback.

<h2>            Flickering task bar on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: taskbar</p>
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have my taskbar on top and i have it set on auto-hide</p>
<p>While its appearing/retracting it is flickering so furiously it should have an epilepsy warning. Is there a way to fix it or is this just part of the win.10 features and should i get used to it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Unable to back up to my 2TB WD external hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffcardillo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to back up to my 2TB WD external hard drive</h2>
                    <p>I had set up my Windows 7 PC, less than 2 years old, to backup every month at the end of the month.&nbsp; Much to my shock, it never did.&nbsp; The drive, which shows up on My Computer, does not show up on the Back up Wizard, and it says I am not able to set up an
 image on it, thus I can't use it for backup.&nbsp; I have reformatted the drive twice, so I know it is working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After talking with 2 Microsoft techs, where the first one had me disable all of my programs because I was receiving the error message 0x80780040, I tried to back up again, and nearly stayed up all night to make sure it worked.&nbsp; It went to 48% and said it
 could not finish, because of the same error message as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2nd tech asked me to only select certain files from my PC to back up, which I did last evening.&nbsp; When I went to bed at midnight, it was at 46%, and so I hoped maybe this time it would work.&nbsp; When I checked my PC this morning, it stopped again, this time
 with the error message 0x81000001.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I give up.&nbsp; I've had PCs for over 10 years, and even built my first one, so I am not a total computer illiterate.&nbsp; A back up should not, and never has in the past, been a major problem at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have spent 5 hours today, manually copying files I want to be sure are kept, to my WD hard drive.&nbsp; That is the only way it will work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read other posts of folks who have had similar issues, and tried those fixes, but nothing has helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for letting me vent...:)</p>
