<h2>            Startup Repair reports Failed system file integrity check &#38; repair, &#58; failed Error Code 0x490. This after a &#58;</h2>
                    I recently purchased the program SeamlessMaker from Hypatiasoft.. It's a program for making seamless tiles. I had tried before I bought, there were a couple of glitches but it seemed to do what I wanted so I paid up.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Immediately after purchase, but prior to keying in serial no, I got the message:&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Cannot load program (or something similar) &nbsp;as framework.dll, corevideo.dll and CoreAudioToolbox.dll is missing from your system,Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem. (each message comes up separately)</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><br />
</span></div>
<div>I installed .netframework 4.5 after this happened, it loaded once without asking for framework, but next time framework was again added to the list</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The program loaded however, but now it does not.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to restore but it failed and I had to run startup repair which also failed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I ran through the loop a couple of times. This morning it failed to load at all for the first time. I then found another program which had behaved perfectly was not working well so I tried to sytem
 reset again. Again it failed, and ran startup repair which also failed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Log for the startup repair reports all well except this:</div>
<div>&nbsp;Root cause found.</div>
<div>Unspecified changes to system configuration might have caused this problem</div>
<div><br />

<div>I'm running Win 7 Home Premium, Service Pack 1</div>
<div>Intel Core i7-2675QM cpu @220ghz 2.2Ghz</div>
<div>8gb RAM</div>
<div>64-bit operating system</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't have the windows install disk for this pc though, or if I do I don't know what I've done with it</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be much appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can use it, it boots up OK but I am concerned at the above error and would like to know how to fix it in case it impacts other programs</div>

<div>thank you</div>

            I seem to have received a reply to this via email but cannot see it on my pc however hard I try, nor can I vote thanks for it!
<div>anyway,&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hello! I tried what you suggested, thank you, and it has reported integrity check as 100% OK! I only had 2 files and one folder in the temp folder, none of which were new. In the meantime I have uninstalled and reinstalled QuickTime according to instructions
 on another site.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Either way this all seems to work now, so thank you for your speedy reply and help, it is much appreciated</div>

<p>I suspect you have had an encounter with a spammer and had a lucky escape. I reached this conclusion by the absence of a message compared to the number of recorded replies. Removing temporary files is a ploy to persuade you to link to a third party support
 site when their removal does not solve the problem. Fortunately you found a solution without help from the third party site.</p>
<p><br />

<p>The Moderators have been trying to stop this spammer for a number of days.</p>

            Thanks Gerry, very helpful. Do you want the details of the email I received? Any help I can give you to track him down, let me know.
<div><br />
<div>For other people's reference, the audio and video dll's are related to Quicktime - not sure about framework. Removing Quicktime via control panel&gt;programs and all other Apple software, then going to quicktime.com and downloading latest version and reinstalling
 solved the problem for me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The program that was malfunctioning is now working fine; I had to make apologies to the programmer for blaming his software!</div>
<div><br />
<div>best wishes</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 taskbar preview drops down before you can click on opened task. Also File Explorer problems burning file to disk.</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10. This has been driving me crazy. To the point of reverting back to Windows 7. I also dislike File Explorer. I tried for over an hour to burn a file to disk. It would not budge from the file ready to burn window. Oh and how
 the opened browser's, files, and apps disappear by merely moving your mouse! Good luck using Cortana. Move your mouse wrong and BOOM your question disappears along with Cortana. Grrr. Can anyone shed some light on these pesky problems please, and thank you.
 Or it's out with the new and in with the old. Ha!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Windows Defender has no real time protection. Group Policy problem.&nbsp;Error code:&nbsp;0x800704ec.

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am glad to assist you on this.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Initially, I suggest you to&nbsp;update all the Windows updates. To get the free upgrade of Windows 10, we need to install the KB3035583. Once you install the KB article, you will get "Get Windows 10" app on your system. Click on the app and follow
 the instructions.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer the link : </span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3035583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3035583</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Also, we can download ISO and media creation tool of Windows 10&nbsp;and can&nbsp;install on PC.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the link below to download Windows 10 ISO:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this helps. If you face any issues with Windows, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

</p><p>If you downloaded the Windows 10 ISO image, Burn it to Disk Then<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Run Setup while you are in Windows</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This will cause it to run as an update and it shouldn't ask you for a product key.</p>

</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Make sure your current version is activated before you begin.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you try to Boot from the Burned Disk, which you can if you want to do a clean install, It won't use your key and it won't act as an upgrade.</p>

<h2>            Random Blue Screens</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lately I've been getting random MEMORY_MANAGEMENT BSODs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run sfc/scannow with no errors, chkdsk with no errors, and 2 extended passes with the memory check tool, also no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These BSODs seem to happen randomly every few days, and they're very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link to my 2 latest BSODs minidumps:</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We've analyzed the dump file you've sent. It appears that there's some corruption in your computer's RAM. Since SFC and Chkdsk did not detect any errors, it is most likely a hardware issue. We suggest that you have your computer's RAM checked out to see
 if needs to be replaced or if it can be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you need further assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: </strong>Here's the fix:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on Windows Start &gt; Right click on Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; enter the following line and press enter:</p>
<p>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your computer afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this re-registers the Xbox store-apps in Windows, which are used by the Xbox beta app. You may have removed one or two in the past (I did). Who knew it'd come in handy one day :p</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Alternatively</strong>: As long as you're logged into Windows 10 with the same e-mail address as to which your game pass subscription is linked, you can use the Microsoft store app in Windows. Just search for the desired game, and if it's in the
 xbox game pass pc game list, it will be listed as 'owned' and you can install it. Note that special editions are often
<strong>not </strong>included in the subscription. </p>

            Hi CrAzYbOnE1 5, HP Support does have a habit of doing this . . .
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Updates will in general look after your device drivers . ..

    <title>Skype for Business not connecting to specific numbers &#40;726 area - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rj vanderwerf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Business not connecting to specific numbers &#40;726 area code issue&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My company is running Skype for Business as part of Office 365 with domestic calling plans. We are running into the issue of users seemingly&nbsp;not able to call numbers in a specific area code (726) for part of&nbsp;San Antonio, Texas. All we get is a diagnostic
 announcement service message. This appears to be a newer area code&nbsp;released in the last year or so and seems to be in&nbsp;limited use. The numbers are reachable via a normal cellular or land line. People with these numbers can call employees at my company though.&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue
 is happening both on WIN10 laptops and via the Skype for Business app on a mobile phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this time the only way to set up a call with people from this area code is to setup a Skype meeting and have them dial in (or they call us directly).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would someone be able to confirm if this is indeed an area code issue or something else going on?</p>

<p>Hi RJ Vanderwerf,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you met an error when you are trying to use Skype for Business to call numbers in a specific area code 726.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find out the root cause, could you please capture a screen shot of the&nbsp;<span><strong><em>diagnostic announcement service message&nbsp;</em></strong>for analysis? Since you mentioned that '</span><em>This appears to be a newer
 area code released in the last year or so and seems to be in limited use.&nbsp;</em>' , it will be appreciated if you can share the related link or article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide the current version of Skype for Business. You can get it through
<strong>Help &gt; About</strong> <strong>Skype for Business</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, please let us know if there is any special environment deployed. Like a local Skype for Business server or Skype for Business hybrid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Lance</p>
        </p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message was an audio message stating the call could not be completed and to recheck the number for area and country code. So I can't offer a screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wikipedia states the 726 area code went into effect in October 2017:</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_codes_210_and_726</p>
<p>"The new code, 726, was announced in August 2016, and went into effect in October 2017.<sup><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">"</span></sup></p>
<p>Here is a local news page on the new area code:</p>
<p>https://www.kens5.com/article/money/consumer/if-your-area-code-is-210-big-changes-are-in-store/273-425170658</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently using Skype for Business 2016 MSO (16.0.8431.2110) 32-bit. But its also happening on the up to date mobile app on an iPhone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently our Office365 setup is entirely in cloud. We do not host any on-prem Skype or Exchange servers.</p>

<p>Hi RJ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the detailed information. As I know we have not receive related issue about Skype for Business could not call area code 726 as it has been changed one year long. May I know could you call the&nbsp;<span>specific area
 code (726) by phone?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If not, this is not an issue for Skype for Business and I suggest you contact related department to check the correct area code.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If it could be called by phone, may I know which Skype for Business add-on license did you purchase, Audio conferencing/Phone System/Calling plan?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<p>Yes, the numbers beginning with area code (726) can be reached via any regular landline or cellphone. The issue only seems to occur while using Skype for business either on a laptop or the mobile app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently our add-on licenses purchased are Phone System / Domestic Calling Plan / Audio Conferencing.</p>
<p>If it helps we also have Office 365 Enterprise E3 and Enterprise Mobility + Security E3.</p>

<p>Here is a more specific example.&nbsp; This individual is selling a vehicle via the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://offerup.com/item/detail/462248066/</p>
<p>
+1 726 777 1595
</p><p>When we dial this area code,726, we get a message stating:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Diagnostic Announcement Service (is what shows on the display)</p>
<p>(Female Robotic voice)</p>
<p>"We couldn't complete the call, check that you are using the correct area code for your country.&nbsp; If the problems continues please contact your admin."</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are fully hosted in Office 365 with Skype for Business.&nbsp; WE do block international calling via the Skype PBX features.&nbsp; It looks to me like the area code 726 was not added to route calls correctly on the PBX backed for Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to give you a working 726 number so you can dial from your skype phone to verify.&nbsp; If we call from mobile devices (AT&amp;T/Verizon) the calls go though with no issues.&nbsp; This is related to Skype for Business hosted via O365.</p>

<p>Hi Matthew144,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for confirming this on your end. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I am getting the same issue with this number you offered. As mentioned the 726 area code seems to work with normal phone lines (ATT/VZ)...just not with Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does seem like a routing issue that Microsoft needs to update with the newer area code.</p>

<p>After 2 scrim matches and had trouble getting a team, OGC have decided to open recruitment again.</p>
<p>This year we are running 4 leagues: Hardcore SND, Half-Life SND, Core 4v4 and Hardcore 4v4.</p>
<p>We are a bunch of mature guys who tend to be active on XBL and have a laugh but we are competitive.
</p>
<p>Our rosters have been shaken over the last few days and looking to add guys to the rosters and have more people active on XBL.</p>
<p>All we ask is the following:</p>
<p>- Aged 16 or over ( Exceptions made)</p>
<p>- Active on XBL and active 3-4 times a week on the clan website</p>
<p>- Not trialing for anyone else or have another Gamertag</p>
<p>- Respectful to other gamers in publics and clan matches</p>
<p>- No rage quitting if you cant get a kill</p>
<p>- No equipment which make you win or gain kills EG. Lag switch</p>
<p>If your interested, post below or message OGC Buzzy on XBL or pop over to the clan site which is www.theogc.tk</p>
<p>We play on the clan leagues on www.thewgl.co.uk which is the UK's largest and oldest clan gaming leagues which run more than CoD leagues.
</p>
<p>Thanks, Ox C4MP3Rz xO (HCSND Captain) </p>
<p>P.S if your interested, you will have to join www.thewgl.co.uk aswell has the OGC clan site.</p>

 you are interested!</p>

            How are you attempting to update the BIOS? I suggest visiting the support site of whoever makes your computer and downloading all of the updated BIOS software that way.&nbsp;

            <p><strong>Yes, it is safe I have used it in the past, it does contain some advertising, but other than that it is safe.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>My opinion, if you want a great free and very fast video converter try the new version 4 of Format Factory available
<a href="http://www.pcfreetime.com/formatfactory/index.php?language=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a> . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip: during the installation, click 'Click Here' on the left and the right so as not to take the bundled ByteFence and Chromium Browser</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a multi core processor, it is optimized to use it and can multiple videos simultaneously.</p>
<p>It can also convert audio, image and many more file types, quicker than most software out there</p>

            Hi menesms... you will need to do a repair upgrade.
<br />Sounds like you might have some deep windows corruption.
<br />This will not wipe data or applications but I suggest you back up your files just in case.
<br />See link by Andre on how to do a repair upgrade.

<p>Tout dépend des jeux, sur COD BO II par exemple, il est possible de mettre en muet tous les joueurs d'un coup depuis le salon, sur d'autres jeux tu devras sélectionner le ou les joueurs un par un, puis depuis la carte du joueur sélectionner muet.</p>

<h2>            Is there support for 1080i on the Xbox one &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My primary tv is a little older but, it does have a HDMI port. The problem is, the tv only supports 480i/p and 1080i. No 720p or 1080p.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I plug in my brand new Xbox one that just came in to the TV and I get sound but, no picture...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is my only option for right now for gaming is this tv (I plan to upgrade later next year when 4K tvs drop in price a little)....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I screwed ? Or will the update (that I cant see) take care of it ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to run 1080i or I can't use the Xbox one...</p>

Top Line System Requirements:
<ul>

<p>720p or higher HDMI-compatible TV. To receive live TV via broadcast or cable, supported receiver device (television tuner or cable/satellite set top box) with HDMI output and HDMI cable required (all sold separately).</p>

<p>It's a older Mitsubishi... I checked the specs. It supports 480i/p and 1080i, No 720p...
</p>
<p>$60 4K cable(it's a 20' cable) running to the TV, I tried the cable with the 360 before connecting it. It does not show a picture, only sound with the Xbox one (if it was not making the handshake, I would not get sound).</p>

<p>720p and 1080p only ? Really ? Does MS know how many tvs they will be blacklisting because of that ?</p>
<p>So, is my only option to return the xbox one ? &nbsp;Crap the PS4 supports 1080i...but, I wanted a Xbox one....</p>
<p>WIsh I knew this before spending $600+ on this whole setup... I saw 720p or higher and by that means 1080i and 1080i...</p>

<p>I have the exact same issue. &nbsp;This is what I got: &nbsp;"Hi David , I was able to check on your concern, so far the version for Xbox One right now is not supporting &nbsp;interlaced resolutions. However ,no need to worry here because we have bring this one up to our
 Microsoft engineers to find a way that our Xbox One will be supporting &nbsp;interlaced resolutions. I am confident here that our Xbox one could support &nbsp;interlaced resolutions sooner or later."</p>

<p>To answer the question of "Does MS know how many TVs they will be blacklisting"; the answer is roughly 11 in the entire US of A.</p>
<p>Not a joke. </p>

<p>HAHA. &nbsp;These were the biggest selling HDTVs in 2004-2006. &nbsp;There were about 3 million sold each of those years in the USA alone and that is a conservative estimate. &nbsp;Where's the rationale behind 11? &nbsp;People are just starting to upgrade to newer ones now,
 but why upgrade when they still work and look great? &nbsp;Look at craigslist- I just checked and there were about 15% that fall into the category that is 480i/p and 1080i with no 720p. &nbsp;It is a pain that there is no 720p, but there are more than 11. &nbsp;Perhaps there
 as many as 15 or more.</p>
