<h2>            Windows Update stuck on 8&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased HP laptop with windows 10. The windows update feature is stuck on 8%. Tried to start the services through command prompt but no success. Used windows update diagnostic tool but it is giving report as "Service Registration is missing or corrupt".</p>
<p>Then tried to stop and restart the update service via "services.msc" it is now showing Windows Update Status- Stopping. It has stuck in here. Also tried rebooting but no change. Need help.</p>

    <title>How do I keep my file attributes when extracting from WinRAR - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I keep my file attributes when extracting from WinRAR</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using WinRAR to distribute a .NET App online. However I've noticed some strange behaviour, or rather unknown behaviour with WinRAR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The .exe file that I am distributing always has the "Run as Administrator" flag ticked before distribution. However I've realised that after extracting the file from an Archive, it loses it's Run as Admin property which causes functionality problems with
 the App. This is because the App needs these permission to Read/Write to files etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to ensure that this doesn't happen. I'm not sure where to turn. Either to a .NET forum for a code-like solution or here for a Windows solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks :)</p>

    <title>Skype hack and password recovery - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype hack and password recovery</h2>
                    <p>My Skype account was hacked a few days ago. I haven't used the account in a few years so when I saw some activity through my email, I was concerned. &nbsp;I watched as the person changed my email address to their email address - through notifications to my email.
 I immediately tried to recover my password but no success. I was supposed to receive information within 24 hours but nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I noticed that my Skype account charged my PayPal account. So now I'm concerned again. Luckily, I was able to stop the transaction and cancel any future transactions with that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to recover the account (again) through Skype again but still no luck. So I went through Microsoft chat - because there's no option to call for support for Skype. The chat went well and the person was cordial, but he wanted me to use the same account
 recovery page. This time I did receive a response and they said that they can not verify my identity.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What kind of security is this with Microsoft? I reported the suspicious activity immediately. The new email address that was added has a .ru email address. My original email address is the SAME as my Skype account - yet, I can't get access to the account
 anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're reading this, please don't forget to set up two-factor authentication for Skype and any other account - especially Microsoft accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea how to deal with this? I don't care about using Skype anymore, I can always create a new one if anyone cares to contact me via Skype. However, I don't like that some random person has access to all of my contacts and I have no way
 of being able to recover it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p><br />

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f798f2f1-cfec-46e5-b1c7-1456117eca78" title="JD31_266">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to us. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand&nbsp;how upsetting this is to you. However, we&nbsp;only have the <strong>
<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Account recovery process</a></strong> to regain access to one's Skype profile. Please understand that it is fully automated and is the only wat to lift the restriction.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It uses the <strong>very same information that the account owner has encoded when the account was created</strong>. Thus, providing the same answers will definitely allow one to retrieve and access it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest for you to revisit your answers and resubmit the form. There is <strong>
no limit as to how many times you can fill out the form (2 times per day). </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For additional information, here are<strong> some tips that might help improve your chances of successfully</strong> using the Account Recovery form to regain access to your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">1. The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer you previously used to access the account.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">2. Also it is much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">3. You don't need to fill out the whole form; just the fields that you know apply to your account.
<br />
</p>

<p>This is fine and I will do this. However, I don't have additional answers to the questions for the recovery process other than the ones I provided. I have no additional information that could be helpful because it would not be my information. I provided
 my actual information for an account that I created over 10 years ago. </p>
<ul>
<li>Your automated system asked for a list of common numbers used by the account - I provided a list of common numbers that I called with the account.
</li><li>Your automated system asked for the original email. I provided the email that I used originally to set up the account - the one that notified me that it was changed by someone else and then locked me out.
</li><li>Your automated system asked for a current transaction and a credit card used with the account. &nbsp;I used PayPal to purchase Skype credits - therefore I don't have a credit card to add - so I don't see much use.</li></ul>
<p>The first claim I made was <strong>seconds</strong> after a new unauthorized email address was added to the account. An email address from a different country and a completely different name than my user name. The user name in question is exactly the same
 as the email address that I used to set up the account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A human being from Microsoft that has access to this information would be able to see this fraudulent activity and understand there is a security issue. At this point, I'd be happy with a suspension of the account. But your answer is to just:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"We suggest for you to revisit your answers and resubmit the form. There is&nbsp;</span><span>no limit as to how many times you can fill out the form (2 times per day)."</span></p>
<p>That sounds to me like anyone - with easy to obtain information - can keep hitting the recovery page for any Skype account and eventually recover a password. That doesn't sound very safe to me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the actual suggestion that I'm supposed to follow when fraudulent activity happens within the Microsoft company?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p><em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e96b-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that registry key, in the right window, is there, under "Name", either an<em> UpperFilters</em> or
<em>LowerFilters</em> value?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, for each of the UpperFilters and/or LowerFilters value, what is listed under "Data"?</p>

<h2>            I hate everything about windows 10</h2>
                    Why would anyone think this is an improvement!! I startrted with ms-dos in 1986 and the " improvements" along the way were an advancement in the system. Windows 10 tries to convert you to a windows phone format. I hate everything about it. I had icons
 setup on my desktop so i could easily access frequently used websites for tax payments and such, Where the f--k are they now. I needed to buy a new laptop with f---king Windows 10 installed and it is a worthless piece of s--it to me now. I have only used it
 10 times since i bought it i January. I don't fu--ing want apps I want to be able to easily access the websites I frequently need from my desktop, Bill Gates I hate you, Steve Balmer, I hate you anyone at Microsfoft who Thought this was a good idea I hate
 you!!

<h2>            Sony VAIO touchpad not working after upgrading Windows 7.</h2>
                    I have a week old Sony VAIO laptop. The windows 7 started upgrading itself last night when I was shutting down the system and my cursor doesnt move after a few minutes of switching on. Please help me. I had a naive attitude towards all this and I regret
 it now.<br />

 to power supply and connect mouse and see if it works. </p>
<p>If not, you could try Windows recovery option:</p>

<p>I have had this problems for over a week. I have connected my xbox 360 Elite to my router by wire, it coonects to the router but it can not get any internet access. I can log on to my Xbox Live account but there is no internet access. I have resett my router
 settings and xbox settings, i have tried wireless, but it just gives me the error message: 80151909</p>

<p>My mac adress is listed as allowed on the router, and NAT is open. The router works with phones and PC wired and wireless.</p>
<p>The last router update was 2 weeks before it stoped working, so it should not be the problem.</p>

<p>Did you actually use an XP PC to post your thread? Microsoft stopped supporting XP in 2014 so you can't update it in the same way that you would update later products such as Win10.</p>
<p>And I also recall that if you have XP you cannot install Internet Explorer later than IE7 (I think) so many sites will deny you access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The effects of it no longer being supported are shown in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10736/windows-what-does-it-mean-if-not-supported" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
&gt;this article.&lt;</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I know two highly-trained computer experts who still use XP. They won't tell me how they keep them secure - I still have an old top-of-the-range XP desktop that I can no longer use.</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It depends on the hardware requirements of later operating systems and also&nbsp;whether the computer/laptop manufacturer supports and supplies drivers for the later operating systems as to whether it is possible or feasible to upgrade or not.</p>
<p>

            Switch the headset on or off<br />
<br />
Press and hold the power key for 2 seconds.<br />
When switched on, the headset beeps, and a green indicator light flashes once. The<br />
headset tries to connect to a paired mobile device.<br />
If the headset is not connected to a device within 30 minutes, it switches off.<br />
When switched off, the headset beeps, and a red indicator light flashes once.<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Pair and connect the headset<br />
<br />
With pairing, you can control which devices are allowed to connect to your headset.<br />
Before using the headset, you must pair and connect it to a compatible device.<br />
1 Switch the headset off and the compatible device on.<br />
2 If you have never paired the headset with a device, or you have emptied the paired<br />
devices list, switch the headset on. If you have previously paired your headset with<br />
another device, press and hold the power key for 5 seconds. The headset enters<br />
pairing mode, and the green indicator light starts to flash quickly.<br />
3 Within 3 minutes, activate Bluetooth on the device, and set it to search for Bluetooth<br />
devices. For details, see the user guide of the device.<br />
4 Select the headset from the list of found devices.<br />
5 If required, enter the passcode 0000.<br />
You can pair your headset with 8 compatible devices, but you can only connect it to a<br />
maximum of 2 devices at the same time.<br />
With some mobile devices, you may need to make the connection separately after<br />
pairing.<br />
Connect the headset to the last used device manually<br />
Press and hold the call key for 2 seconds, if no other device is connected, or go to the<br />
Bluetooth menu of the device.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
The following is an example when connecting a phone but the same principle applies when connecting the device through Windows 7:<br />
<br />
<p>After selecting Bluetooth, select the ‘On’ menu and Bluetooth will be turned on. Again, this will vary according to the brand phone/model or device you are connecting. For instance, if you are connecting a Bluetooth mouse, this will require that you attach
 a USB Bluetooth dongle to your computer and peer it with the mouse during the installation wizard.
<em>Always consult the documentation that came with your product.</em></p>
<p>On the computer, especially laptops, turning on Bluetooth is a simple process that involves switching the identified latch on the laptop chassis&nbsp; until a Blue light or indicator that Bluetooth is turned on. Consult your computers documentation if you are
 unable to find the Bluetooth latch, some manufacturers place it at the front or side of the laptop chassis, others might be software controlled requiring that you turn it on from within Windows using a bundled utility.</p>

<p><em>Devices and Printers</em></p>
<p>The Windows Team has made setting up devices in Windows 7 very easy, the new Devices and Printers window located on the Start menu offers quick and centralized access to all your devices. Once your phone is on and Bluetooth is enabled, in Devices and Printers,
 click <strong>Add Device </strong>on the&nbsp; command bar. This will begin the Add Device wizard. Your Bluetooth device should immediately be recognized by its name and model number. Click Next, the next window will generate a unique ID that you will use to enter
 on your phone to confirm and connect the device to your computer.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/AddDevice.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f09%2fAddDevice_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Once this is done, the wizard will configure the device and prepare it for use with your Windows 7 PC. Windows will automatically install any necessary drivers for added functionality. To verify that your Bluetooth is ready for use, we will now check in
 the Devices and Printers window.</p>

            It seems that for most Bluetooth headsets you will need a Bluetooth radio / receiver / dongle that will support A2DP Bluetooth protocol.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your computer uses the Microsoft's built-in Bluetooth system, you might not be able to use the headset.&nbsp; I need
 to change to a Bluetooth that uses the Toshiba Bluetooth and my own Nokia headset is working.<br />

<h2>            How do I keep my favorite playlists visible all the time for double-click-plays-it&#63;</h2>
                    What I mean is in WMP version 10, the Playlists are listed in the upper left screen, and the ones I play the most seem to stay there all the time for the most part.&nbsp; And I mean every day (there are four, which are part of my relaxation scheme at the end
 of the day).&nbsp; However, sometimes when I have to re-sync my MP3 player or phone, those vanish and it lists the first six or seven playlists I have made appear up there alphabetically, causing me to have to go open Playlists, hunt for my favorites, open them,
 and tell them play-all to play the list.<br />
<br />
It's <span style="font-style: italic">much </span>easier when my favorite playlists are up in that corner so all I have to do is double-click on the name of the one I want, and it plays, ta-da!&nbsp; Short of constantly picking my favorite playlists and playing them
 using the long way until a threshold number is reached and they reappear up there again, is there another way to get them back up there so I don't have to hunt for them so much?

            <p>It is working fine, actually.&nbsp; I just want to know how to keep my favorite playlists in view on the list of "recently played" playlists in the upper left corner under the heading "Playlists" all the time.&nbsp; If there is no trigger and I just have to keep selecting
 those playlists until they appear up there again, that's&nbsp;fine.&nbsp; I was just wanting to know if anyone out there who knows more about the program than me could tell me a faster way than to just keep selecting the favorite playlists until they appear up there
 for the much faster "double-click-the-playlist-name-and-it-plays-automatically" ability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is no other way that anyone knows of, then my question will be moot.&nbsp; I was just hoping there was a faster way than that.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>This is only partly correct as struggling to find others players can also be due to a few other reasons. For instance you should check your NAT type within your consoles networks settings. It should be 'open'. If it's not, you need to add the ports that are listed here within your internet routers settings:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/network-ports-used-xbox-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/network-ports-used-xbox-live</a></p>
