    <title>Windows 10 Mail&#58; Advanced mail settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregorymarkovitz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail&#58; Advanced mail settings</h2>
                    <p>I cannot receive or send emails because of the way that the Win 10 Mail app automatically sets up the accounts.</p>
<p>Why is there no way choose the ports, the authentication type, and other manual settings?</p>
<p>If I am going to use the Win 10 Mail app I am going to need to manually set the following options and i don't see any way to do that in the advanced settings of Win 10 Mail. These settings are not my idea or preference. My ISP requires them--no advanced
 settings, no mail.</p>
<p>A. incoming-POP</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. clear text authentication</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. use of port 995</p>
<p>B. Outgoing-SMTP</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. requires authentication</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. use of port 465</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can these advanced settings be made in windows 10 Mail or must I use another mail client?</p>
<p>If this is a deficiency in the design of Mail app, do you foresee a patch? Can you please let the developers know about it?</p>
<p>If there is some way to get Verizon mail with the W10 Mail app, can you tell me how?</p>
<p>

<div>then took my working Windows 10 drive and cloned it to my other two drive's,

<div>I am satisfied with this solution. It achieved what I wanted 3 identical</div>

            <p>I too had a similar problem with Windows 10&nbsp;and following the suggestion of Billion Debbarma, above, did a
<strong>Clean Boot </strong>(via Windows -X, Command Prompt, and msconfig). I then selected&nbsp;the Services tab in the
<strong>System Configuration Box&nbsp;</strong>and spent about a week switching on&nbsp;and off services and rebooting.&nbsp;I finally was able to isolate the "<strong>Windows Management Instrumentation</strong>" service as&nbsp;the cause for my
<strong>File Explorer</strong> (not to be confused with Edge or IE) not to work with regards to seeing the files on my secondary drives on my desktop. The primary&nbsp;drive "C" was never a problem, just additional&nbsp;drives that had been added. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is how will leaving "Windows Management Instrumentation" service off effect my computers operation and/or security? Or is there another workaround? Hope this helps.

<h2>            HP Photosmart 5514 Printer Ink Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am running low on my color inks, and just ran out of black. I put in a new HP black cartridge and set my printer options so that it would print only in black ink. I've done this many times before with no trouble. I printed a test sheet and all that showed
 up was a little bit of color (!) on the Windows logo, and no black at all. Then I attempted to print a document, again setting to just black ink, A sheet of paper went through the printer, but nothing printed at all. What next? Thanks for your suggestions.</p>

            <strong>Added information to previous post:</strong> I had successfully printed three pages in black right before I ran out. I removed the new black cartridge twice and reinstalled it. I turned the printer on and off twice. I unplugged the printer from
 my laptop and reconnected it. And I tested the ink...it is fresh and wet, and not outdated.

            <p>Hi, Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I put the printer through a couple of cleaning cycles with no luck. Then I found a video on YouTube explaining how to clean the little screens that the ink goes through to get to the paper. I was very hopeful about that, however, &nbsp;after I completed that
 procedure, I printed a print quality report, all the colors came through but no black. When I tested a document that was mostly plain black text but had a little bit of color, the color came through and the black came through as very light gray you can't really
 read it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The black was printing fine until the previous Cartridge of ink totally ran out. When I put the new cartridge in, it didn't work. And when I opened up the second cartridge and installed it, still no black, only very light gray. This does not seem like a
 printer software issue so I have not reinstall the printer software. I thought I would just check in with you one more time before doing that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I had you buy a second cartridge- they're not inexpensive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This really sounded to me like a hardware problem, but there's nothing else to try in that area, so downloading and installing the latest software from HP for your printer and OS might be the solution.</p>

<h2>            Win 10 &#34; what a loser &#34;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Last evening win 10 decided it needed to "upgrade " so I was without a laptop for the entire evening ! What world do you clowns at micro **** live in ? I use my computers for my business , a computer down for eight hours for " upgrade " .</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thankfully I have three laptops one of which runs Win 8.1 Pro , you guys remember 8.1 , you know the OS that just keeps working without your meddling !
</p>
<p>&nbsp;The new computer with that spiffy win 10 will now be relegated to the kids to play games or what ever else they do that won't cost me money .</p>
<p>&nbsp; Hmmmm I keep thinking " maybe an Apple might be in my future " ..... you know when you drop support for win 8.1 .... I hear Apple needs very little upgrading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe , Not Very Happy !</p>

<h2>            Sea of thieves won&#39;t start on my brand new Xbox one digital</h2>
                    I just pirchased an xbox one digital edition,loaded sea of thieves on it, and the game goes no further than the sea of thieves splash screen. I have performes a hard reset. That did not work. I removed my profile, hard reset, and loaded my profile again.
 That did not work. I uninstalled the game, reinstalled it, and that did not work. I have checked for game and system updates. No updates exist. Should I simply return the console and cut my losses, or is there aomething else that I should do?&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span>Try performing a hard reset EXACTLY like this. Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.<span>&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;I performed the steps that you outlined. I held the power button for 8 seconds, until it powered off. I then unplgged the xbox for 5 minutes. Plugged the xbox back in and powered on. I am still stuck at the sea of thieves&nbsp; opening graphic.</p>

The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note these
 sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.</p>

            <p>Hi Ratandeep</p>
<p>Further to you Method 2 solution,I am still encountering problems.</p>
<p>When I unchecked the Proxy box in the LAN settings, everything is OK for a few minutes, then I lose the connection.</p>
<p>I then have to go back to the LAN setting to find that the proxy box is ticked.</p>
<p>It also is checked whenever I restart or close and then reopen my Laptop.</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong??</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you get any error message?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What happens when you try to boot in normal mode?</p>
<p><br />
<b>Method 1</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows XP may default to Safe Mode at every startup. Even if you select the option
<i>Start Windows Normally</i>, it still boots into Safe Mode. IOW, you cannot get out of Safe mode.
</p>
<p>This happens if the /safeboot switch is added in the Boot.ini file.
<b>/Safeboot </b>parameter<b> </b>forces a start in safe mode by using the specified parameters. The available parameters are:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>minimal</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>network</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>safeboot:minimal(alternateshell)</p>
<p>For more information on Boot.ini switches, see
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/Windows/XP/all/reskit/en-us/Default.asp?url=/resources/documentation/Windows/XP/all/reskit/en-us/prmc_str_masc.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reviewing and Correcting
 Boot.ini Settings on x86-based Systems</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>RESOLUTION</b></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click Start, Run and type <i>MSCONFIG</i></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Select the <i>Boot.ini</i> tab</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If you have dual-boot setup, select the appropriate entry under
<b><i>[operating systems]</i></b></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the Boot Options section at the bottom, uncheck
<b>/SA<u>F</u>EBOOT </b>option</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click OK</p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restart Windows</p>
<p>The /safeboot entry will now be removed from the Boot.ini file.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If above method is not the cause, then It seems that Service Pack 3 is not installed correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> You may try to perform system restore from safe mode which will restore back the computer to the point when it was working fine.</p>

<p>(2017-08 Security Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB4034664)</p>
<p>(Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool x64 - August 2017 (KB890830)</p>
<p>but lucky me I have an image backup ,so I was able to recover&nbsp;<br />
after run the image recovery, everything went back to normal&nbsp;<br />
now there are rumors about microsoft trying to kill windows 7&nbsp;through the windows updates&nbsp;</p>
<p>so what I suppose to do now?</p>
<p>keep my windows 7 updates on with the risk that microsoft is screwing everything up&nbsp;</p>
<p>in order to push me to re-install windows 10</p>
<p>or just disable the windows 7 updates with the risk to have security issues in the future?</p>
<p>why microsoft is acting like they own things are not belong to them?</p>
<p>microsoft didn't pay for my computer , I did</p>
<p>microsoft doesn't pay for the maintenance of my computer , I do</p>
<p>microsoft doesn't pay for my internet connection, I do</p>
<p>so can you please back the hell off?&nbsp;</p>
<p>unbelievable...!!!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;yes I have noticed that</p>
<p>and that is why I just did a fresh windows 7 installation&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I'm not going back to windows 10 </p>
<p>EVEN if microsoft pay me to do so</p>
<p>and I tell you more</p>
<p>I'm trying to figure it out to how run my two favorite games without a microsoft OS</p>
<p>( World of Warcraft &amp; Company of Heroes 2 )&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steam Linux OS lookz it may become good in the near future</p>
<p>for now I stay with windows 7&nbsp;</p>
<p>then when microsoft drop the support for windows 7&nbsp;</p>
<p>I probably drop them with their dictatorship attitude once for all</p>
<p>even if I have to quit play one of both my favorite games</p>
<p>I will because microsoft didn't buy me a computer , I did</p>
<p>because microsoft doesn't pay for the maintenance of my computer, I do</p>
<p>because microsoft doesn't pay for my internet access, I do</p>
<p>you know why all this is happening?</p>
<p>because the people are a bunch of sheep&nbsp;</p>
<p>who are willing to tolerate tyranny &amp; dictatorship just because something is given to them for free &nbsp;</p>
<p>at least the Europeans are trying to protect their privacy&nbsp;</p>
<p>here in US the sheep people just don't care </p>
<p>then you see them around talking about freedom &amp; democracy</p>
<p>what a bunch of brainless...!!!</p>

<p>A.nother User left the building, sadly.<br />
</p>
<p>The main concern is how to reinstall Windows 7 from scratch and apply its service pack and further updates, without being offered/forced the Windows 10 upgrade.<br />
This should and must be possible without hiding any of the security updates.</p>
<p>

<p>Then perhaps that concern is moot, the Windows 10 free upgrade offer having expired a year ago?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates they would want to hide are not for GWX but for improvements that would allow moving to a newer Windows version should they wish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could probably recommend how to get through your Linux problem and with what flavor/distro but that's extremely off topic. This is a Microsoft products place of course.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time I connect to it, it randomly disconnects. It happens at my place and my grandparents. I have used my grandparents laptop yet it doesn't disconnect randomly. So I'm wondering is it a problem with my laptop&nbsp;or windows 8? It's really annoying and
 frustrating.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>The frequent disconnection for the network connection could be due to issues with the driver for the network adapter installed on the computer. It could also happen if the settings to disable the network under network adapter
 has been enabled.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Please assist me to collect few information regarding the issue:</font></font></font></p>

</span></span><font><font>Is it a wired or a wireless network connection?</font></font></font></p>

</span></span><font><font>Did you make any changes to the network settings prior to this issue?</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>First of all, I would suggest you to check if the following setting has been set to disable connectivity frequently:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that you are logged-in as an administrator to make these changes.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Press <strong>Windows and X</strong> key together and select Device Manager.</font></font></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Check for the issue. If it still persists, let’s move ahead with further steps.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Since, it is an issue with the network connection on the laptop; I would suggest you to run automated network troubleshooter in context of this issue.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>You can follow the methods:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Method 1:</strong></font></font></font></p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you want to stop the Windows 10 upgrade.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will certainly help you with this.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Try to uninstall the two updates which is responsible for windows 10 upgrade
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click Start, type: cmd then right click cmd and click Run as administrator)<br />
2. Click Command Prompt (Admin)<br />
3. At the command prompt, enter the following commands:<br />
wusa /uninstall /kb:3035583<br />
wusa /uninstall /kb:2952664<br />
4. Exit the command prompt.<br />
5. Terminate the GWX.exe process using Task Manager. Moreover rename the GWXUXWorker.exe and GWX.exe to .old as suffix from directory location:- Windows\System32\GWX, if getting any issues while renaming then give the system permission's to respective files
 and then try to rename it again. OR you can delete the entire directory folder.<br />
6. Reboot the computer. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Please follow the below steps to hide an update.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open the Control Panel (icons view), and click/tap on the Windows Update icon.
<br />
2. After Windows Updates or you check for updates, click/tap on the update(s) is available link.
<br />
3. Right click or press and hold on a listed Windows Update that you want to hide, then click/tap on Hide Update.
<br />
4. If prompted by UAC, then click/tap on Yes or enter the administrator's password.<br />
5. You will now notice that the now hidden Windows Update is grayed out. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to hide another Windows Update. When done, click/tap on OK.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also refer&nbsp;the suggestion by Arun BJ from the following link and check if it helps.

<p>Could you please tell me how to fix this or even whats going on?</p>

<p>It's got me stumped.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Help </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duey</p>

</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Latest edit and update: OK all is good now, going here https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/features&nbsp; and using the update assistant was what fixed my problem I guess I was right in my reply to Gil deG; that is that I was not "chosen" for the update right
 now OK so I will be leaving this in the next few days in the hope that this will help someone else that is in the same situation as I was<span><a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fanswers.microsoft.com%2Fthreadauth%2F308c7009-a872-411f-b9a5-a4891245e572%2Fmessages%2F0e0016b6-8758-470b-b2a8-a491994950d4&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cduey%40live.com.au%7Ccd88f880509c414a6f9d08d52dd3a97b%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636465309458569893&amp;sdata=VlFcHYoyChb2W7W9%2FqRYF6Hg00ygVJZ%2B%2BByGglBkWyY%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>.</span></span></a></span></p>

<p>Hi Duey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information that you've provided, it seems that you've already done most of the troubleshooting steps to fix the update. With that, we suggest that you perform a clean boot on your computer. Clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. Kindly
 refer to the article below.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Gil deG,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, I read some where else last night, not quite sure but will retrace my steps to see if I can link it in an edit to this post.</p>
<p>The person whom tried these steps had exactly the same result I did when I used ms config to eliminate 3rd party software conflicts just so as to eliminate the pain of a reboot or a reset, well I ended up doing a reboot as per the request of the update did
 nothing still asked me to reboot, as for reset well that's where I used ms config to mock reboot and reset please refer to my original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I realise what the problem may be is that I don't understand the what this update is about yet, I'm on the thinking side that this is a creator or developers or windows insider update this is why I it wont on reboot install the update as it does
 say :- </p>
Windows 10 Fall Creators Update
<p>Which I am neither of these types of computer enthusiasts. I don't know i think i need to look further into this update to get an idea of what is really going on here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry one more thing I would like to add is that this is my gaming PC don't know if that makes any difference because as I said I don't know enough about this update I have read most of the posts about it I guess I just don't understand enough but for me
 I need stats on the actual update Like whats it for? Why is this needed?&nbsp; Is it an important security update? If so can it be patched? Unfortunately I have unanswered questions. But once again thank you for your reply.</p>

            <p>I'm not positive, but I suspect that HPLaserJetService.exe monitors the status of your printer's toner supply so it can remind you to buy more HP toner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you install the printer driver by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connecting the printer to your computer and allowing Windows 7 to install the driver automatically</li><li>Downloading and running the "Full software and Drivers" or "Complete Solution" package from the HP support page</li><li>Downloading and running the "Basic driver" package from the HP support page</li><li>Running the software from a CD that came with the printer</li></ol>
<p>If you elect to uninstall and reinstall the printer (see last paragraph below), options 2 and 4 are likely to reinstall HPLaserJetService.exe while options 1 and 3 likely will not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download (free) Autoruns from <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7?sort=lastreplydate&amp;dir=desc&amp;tab=Threads&amp;status=&amp;mod=&amp;modAge=&amp;advFil=&amp;postedAfter=&amp;postedBefore=&amp;threadType=All&amp;tm=1426273705649">

<p>
</p><p>When the Autoruns scan completes, click the "Logon" tab, find the line that includes HPLaserJetService.exe and UNcheck the box.&nbsp; This will prevent the service from starting and you shouldn't get any more errors from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really want to have the service run but not throw the occasional error, I suggest that you look in or post to the HP forum:&nbsp;
<a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/LaserJet-Printing/bd-p/Install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/LaserJet-Printing/bd-p/Install</a></p>
<p>

<h2>            How to stop the blanket screen of &#34;Get Updates&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 Enterprise on several large displays machines without keyboards and mice, and regularly the screens have the windows "Get Updates" covering the display applications.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/138f6aa9-5428-403e-8a98-f644e1085156" /></p>
<p>How can I turn this overlay screen off on our display computers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jamey.</p>

    <title>Video Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hayleyarts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video Screen</h2>
                    <p>I am using the latest version of Skype on my MacBook pro with macOS Sierra. I have been using Skype for years with no problem, but now I cannot see any video. The person I video call can see me just fine, but my video screen is black - I cannot see their
 video or mine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it is not a problem with my webcam because they can see me, and I can use FaceTime. My internet connection is fine because our call was not cutting out. I went into preferences and ensured that "Allow Video and Screen Sharing" option is sent to contacts
 because that is the only advice that I could find on the existing Skype community. Are there any suggestions or existing help pages that I can refer to to solve this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Why won&#39;t my wifi connect after sleep mode&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I close the lid on my laptop and open again my wifi will not connect unless I restart. I recently installed windows 8 and that is when the problem ensued. My laptop is a hp envy 15-3247nr with all windows 8 drivers installed and updated including bios.
 It doesn't matter what I try, my wifi option stays grayed out even with airplane mode off. The f12 key stays orange and will not light up until I restart&nbsp;my laptop once or twice.&nbsp;Please help.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(all drivers are updated and in working order, and yes, the power settings of the network adapter have been changed to not save power)

            <p>Yes, I did try the intel driver uptate utility and there was one for network drivers and windows 8 but when I tried to install it, an error message would come up saying that I didn't have the supported operating system so it could not install.</p>
<p>And yes, I went into the bios and set all my settings to default settings and after that point it began to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what I did specifically was roll back my network driver to a previous version, then I went into my bios and changed my network adapter setting to the opposite of what they were (enabled or disabled to the opposite), restarted my computer (didn't fix my computer),
 so then I went back into bios and reset all settings to default settings and after that point is when my wifi began to connect without having to restart my computer and so far so good.
