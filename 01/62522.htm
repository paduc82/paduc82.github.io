    <title>Windows Installer Service wont install 64 bit applications - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikeneo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Installer Service wont install 64 bit applications</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I have been trying to get an application installed for two days now and keep getting the error 1719 saying that the windows installer service is unavailable, call your admin people ... bla bla bla.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything Google has to offer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>All three methods in https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2642495</p>
<p>Unregistered and re-registered multiple times, both 32 bit and 64 bit versions of msiexec.exe just like is says to do here http://www.howtogeek.com/184374/how-to-fix-the-windows-installer-service-could-not-be-accessed-error-in-windows-7/</p>
<p>and here http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2006/07/20/673408.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run sfc /scannnow multiple times</p>
<p>I have rebooted multiple times</p>
<p>I have tried to boot to the install cd to do a repair</p>
<p>I have made sure that HKLM\System\Current Control Set\Services\MSISERVER\WOW64 is set to 0, even removed it once to see if that would help</p>
<p>
</p><p>I basically feel like I have been placing my head against a brick wall in an aggressive manner repeatedly for two days</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess that is not completely true at the beginning I couldn't install any applications but during my journey I was able to get the 32 bit stuff fixed and I am able to install 32 bit apps. I know this because when I was able to get an application installed
 it showed up in the Program Files (x86) folder. Unfortunately that 32 bit app was not the one I need on my system. I have tested the install media on another system, borrowed from a friend, and it works fine ... and no he wont let me trade my broke system
 for his.</p>

            Well, no replies. I guess the answer is to reinstall. That's what I wound up doing so day and a half gone but now I can install my applications.

</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Windows Explorer</strong> &gt; Go to <strong>This PC</strong> &gt; Open your device drive.</li><li>Copy your pictures then paste it to your preferred location.</li><li>Open <strong>Photos app</strong> &gt; Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; Under <strong>
Sources</strong>, Select <strong>Add a folder</strong> and choose the folder where you saved your pictures.</li></ol>

            They all import fine and show up as being imported, then they disappear after a few minutes as the app is trying to make it's own "story folders".&nbsp; It's the display in the photo app that removes them.&nbsp; I can manually find them in file explorer with no
 problem.&nbsp; The app is already pointing towards the appropriate folder location.

<p>Since the issue is only occurring in the Photos app, we recommend that you run the Windows apps troubleshooter. Click this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>If the issue still occurs after running the Windows apps troubleshooter, run the System File Checker. System File Check
<span>is&nbsp;a utility available in Windows 10 that checks for system file corruption. If the issue isn't resolved by performing the SFC, kindly use DISM. DISM is used to troubleshoot errors that SFC can't resolve.</span></p>

            This is perfectly normal.&nbsp; An "album" is only a selection of your best pictures.&nbsp; You must look at the "folder" view to see them all.

<p>Did both of the command lines in the system file checker...&nbsp; Found a problem with the "Store" program, repaired and everything worked.&nbsp; Unfortunately the photo disappearing is still happening.&nbsp; I tried connecting my Windows 10 Lumia phone, using the windows
 photo app, and re-downloaded the pictures, they appeared, closed the app and opened it, they were still there.&nbsp; Opened an individual view of each, went back and they all disappeared again!</p>

<h2>            Xbox One randomly&#8203; turns on even in Energy Saving Mode.</h2>
                    <p>I turned off Instant On and don't have automatic updates enabled but my Xbox One turns on randomly quite a bit. I looked online as to why this could be happening and didn't find much except power strips and external HD's perhaps being the issue. It's no longer plugged in to a power strip. It's plugged in directly to the wall outlet and it still turned on. I do have the&nbsp;WD My Book desktop 4TB external hard drive attached to it and it does have it's own power source. It's light is always on blinking. Could this be the issue? I can turn it off on the power strip it's on whenever my XB1 is off to see if that works. Has anyone else had this problem or heard anything about this issue? I saw some option that says something about when Xbox is off, turn off storage but that's checked as well.&nbsp;<br /></p>

            <p>I talked to a guy from MS who had my go through a few steps and do a hard reset. I also started turning off by external HD power strip and it still turned on. The only last thing it seems to be is the power supply. I guess I have to contact MS again to swap out a new one.</p>

    <title>IISAPI extensions handler mapping vulnerability - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonmercado  say:</h3>
<h2>            IISAPI extensions handler mapping vulnerability</h2>
                    <p>Hi, a security scan on one of my web servers running IIS 7 resulted in a finding that it has the mapping handler vulnerability, i.e. it is enumerating the path of my website directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>HTTP GET request to https://[ip address]/scripts/non-existant-script-name.idq</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>70: &lt;/div&gt;&nbsp;<br />
71: &lt;div id="details-right"&gt;&nbsp;<br />
72: &lt;table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;&nbsp;<br />
73: &lt;tr class="alt"&gt;&lt;th&gt;Requested URL&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://[ip address]...<br />
74: ... Path&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>[...]\scripts\non-existant-script-name.idq</strong></span>&lt;/td&gt;...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have applied the fix to all of the installed and enabled extensions (Invoke handler if request is mapped to: File). However, a re-scan results in the same findings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else that I missed or need to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p />

<h2>            How do I remove LavasoftTcpService64.dll&#63;</h2>
                    The Ad-Aware Web Companion was installed without my permission, I uninstalled it through control panel but this .dll file was left and I cannot delete it anyhow. I tried software crushing, unregistering (which says entry point not found). I couldn't even
 find the service it is on. How should I remove it?

            This doesn't work because I think it doesn't qualify as a malware except the fact that it is open in virtually every service on my laptop. I need to delete this .DLL file in a non-malware fashion.

            <p>Thanks I found this helpful I have been relying on Windows Defender without issue until I tried to install the Adobe CC suite on this machine. The Adware not to be confused with Ad-Aware was lurking in my machine without any issues until it prevented me
 from launch Dreamweaver. I took a look with Adobe and we tried to disable the offending dll LavasoftTcpService64.dll by decorating it with OLD like this LavasoftTcpService64old.dll and this LavasoftTcpService64.dll_old but that only causes issues with internet
 services in the immediate. Dreamweaver ran but only partially as new service connections to the TCP IP were not being setup. This gave me hybrid access to the internet for awhile making me think the issue was fixed but upon restart the computer updated something
 with the TCP and then the entire wireless internet crashed. I did not that wired internet would function but I don't have a desk I can use and nothing close enough to the router.<br />
<br />
As we speak I'm running malware bites because whatever this is is only partially installed leaving behind a few ruminate Dynamic Link&nbsp;Libraries and&nbsp;an&nbsp;ini file called &nbsp;LavasoftTcpServiceOff.ini and a Lavasoft&nbsp;folder with a&nbsp;sub folder called Web Companion with
 a frequently asked questions internet shortcut link. Also who knows how many registry keys it left behind.<br />
</p>
<p>I'm glad the new universal app model is set up to have a better system for registry entries and when we remove programs like Lavasoft products that they will have there own application store and not all be in HKEYLOCALMACHINE were removal in the past was
 difficult. I'm hoping for the best with this adware removal tool.</p>

            <p>Well malware bites found some malware objects but I scanned through the locations of all of them. Primarily in the App Data folder that's hidden in the user folders. not surprising since I often have to reinstall my dev machine to get the libraries talking
 right. I often carry over stuff in that folder I don't intend to since I've been backing up the user folder since like 2010. There were very few registry keys I removed them as well.<br />
<br />
What missing from this picture is that the offending DLL the primary topic of this thread&nbsp;was not found&nbsp;by Malware Bites. I am afraid to just remove it because this TCP Services DLL has been causing wireless internet issues when disabled.<br />
<br />
I'll try the other remover see if that does anything. I'm doubtful about the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/reset-internet-explorer-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

That's mainly it there are some other files it found around the browsers I just installed so I could test my web development in multiple browsers but other than that it was pretty clean. I don't want to show the whole log file. So that I don't endanger my local
 file structure to potential hackers looking for an in on my machine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>LavasoftTCPService64.dll is still in my machine at the system 32 level but that copy is not causing an issue with my Adobe software. I think that these other copies must have been the culprit because the unwanted bad behaviors disappeared.</p>

            I came across this thread due to the same issue with Dreamweaver and that pesky .dll. I also tried renaming it, which caused issues with internet settings. I'm not quite clear on what you found as a solution. Did you follow Bruce Hagen's advice?

            <p>Usually dll errors at Startup are due to a program starting or trying to start with Windows that generates them.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is another reason not to let anything start with WIndows that you don't know and want running then and there - all others are freeloaders
 on your system resources and many are only there to spy on you.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t enter debit card number on making online purchase</h2>
                    <p>Original title:- Can't enter debit card number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo R500. Since upgrading to Windows 10 I am unable to enter my card number when making an on-line purchase. I am able to enter the first 5 digits of the number and then the computer starts substituting random alphabetic characters for the numbers.
 I tried using the on-screen keyboard, but this does the same thing. &nbsp;I've tried different drivers, but no luck yet. Any ideas?</p>

<div>You may have issues with the USB/Parallel printer cable that you have.&nbsp; I had this combination (mine was&nbsp;a Belkin brand,) except I had the BJC-85 and with XP, Vista and Win 7. I was never able to reliably get the printer to work with
 the laptops with Vista.&nbsp; Worked flawlessly on XP.&nbsp; Once I got it to work on Vista but could never depend on getting a page out of the printer and always had to plug into the exact same port each time.&nbsp; Never got the cable to work on Win 7.&nbsp; Sorry I could not
 help.</div>

<p>Hi 66912,</p>
<p>I suggest disabling your security software temporarily to see if you are able to print.</p>
<p>You might also try removing the "unknown&nbsp;device" from the Device Manager and then restart the computer.</p>

<div>Chris, (I am the original responder, not the OP)&nbsp;the unknown device is the USB to Parallel cable that was plugged into the computer to enable the OP to print to the Parallel or infrared only interface on the BJC-80 from Canon.&nbsp; Whenever
 this cable is plugged into my Win 7 laptop or when I plug it into a port on my Vista systems I will also get the unknown device (unless I plug it into the correct port on the Vista system.)&nbsp; For some reason the later OSs from Microsoft doesn't play well with
 the USB to Parallel cable.&nbsp; To get it to work you actually need to go into the printer ports and create a new printer port for the cable, which was automatically done in XP but not in Vista or Win 7.&nbsp; Unfortunately I don't remember how I got the cable I have
 to work in the Vista laptop I have and none of the cable manufacturers are any help&nbsp;in configuring the products.&nbsp; No special drivers are supplied with the cables.</div>

<p>Hi LVTravel,</p>
<p>Thank you&nbsp;for the information.</p>
<p>Losing the settings when plugging the&nbsp;device&nbsp;into a different USB port is likely due to the hardware profile initially setup during the installation of the printer.</p>
<p>I think this has less to do with Windows handling the USB to parallel cable (though I know it could be) as much as the profile mapping hardware resources to the printer.</p>
<p>Just a thought.</p>

<h2>            Trouble downloading from Market&#47;Changing Gamertag</h2>
                    
<p>I have gone in and 'allowed' control for my son to download or purchase M content from the martketplace and when he tries he still gets the error that he does not have permission. The system won't even allow him to change his gamertag - lack of permission
 as well. I am frustrated as all the help I can find says i have done what is needed and it still won.t work. Now I have transferred all the points to his account for the purchaes and can't get them back. Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>HOWEVER</p>
<p>if he is trying to download demos *thats NOT PURCHASES* but advertising</p>
<p>due to advertising laws you must be over 18 to view trailers or demos regardless of parental settings</p>

</p><p>You've typed "reagent" in the command prompt, but it should be <strong>RE</strong><strong>agentC.exe</strong> and also needs to be run from an elevated command prompt which you can access by right clicking the Start button and go to "Command Prompt (Admin)".</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Wont Activate after upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Today I had used the&nbsp;MediaCreationToolx64 to upgrade my PC from Windows 8.1 Home to Windows 10 Home, and had the problem of the system not upgrading with the Error code: 0xC004C003 I have attempted to revert back to Windows 8.1 and then reinstall Windows
 10 but that did not work in my case.</p>

<p>I do not know if Windows will assign everyone a new product key, or will send everybody and email it. Any help is much appreciated thank you.</p>

            you can try what worked for me "open msconfig disable all 3rd party services and enable windows update and your network (lan or wan) and click okay it'l ask for restart select ok and restart and then run windows control panel and update and security and
 try to activate (my error code was blank) then run msconfig again and enable every service. Hope it works for you cause i spent 5 hours on the phone the rep said it was a windows glitch.

            <p>Not sure what method you used to revert back to Windows 8.1, but you should consider a fresh installation of the OS using your original copy of the disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have one, you could be in for a bit of a delay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to activate Windows 8 and 8.1 by phone. If this option is not available, then possibly your activation key has been erased somehow from the bios. Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 keys come embedded in the bios these days if you're not given the
 activation key in-hand. If this happens, you'll have to buy another activation keyâ€”which can be purchased from any distributor for fairly cheap (from places like etsy).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you get Windows 8.1 back up and running, take Media Creation Tool and put it into the Recycle Bin. Download the Windows 10 ISO you need directly from Microsoft, then use the method provided in the link below to upgrade your system.</p>

            Windows 8 key and windows 7 keys don't work for windows 10 when you upgrade it should automatically use your windows 7/8 key to create a 10 key it did for me and if it ask for key during upgrade skip it

<p>I recommend turning it off. Overscan is mainly used for bigger TVs like 45"(ish)+</p>
<p>On my Xbox, I have overscan turned off and everything is fine.</p>

    <title>Static Sounds Coming From My Surface Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ravena bliss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Static Sounds Coming From My Surface Pro</h2>
                    Hello there. I have bought a Microsoft Surface Laptop/tablet about two years ago. It went well for a long time but recently, I have put it up with a lot and the sound just went..out. Its strange, whenever I was on youtube or sites requiring sounds, nothing
 would show up. So I tried fixing the problem myself and looked up a tutorial on youtube on how to fix this (on a different device). I followed the instruction and I ended up disabling a feature. After that, a static sounding noise came up and I've not been
 able to get it to stop. I looked up numerous posts and I even tried getting the fan inside fix. But it seems to be something wrong with the sound itself. Yes I tried restarting it, yes I turned it off, it just doesn't work. Any possible solutions?

            Internet is working with cables, wireless will not engage, details on page say there are some bad protocalls --do not know how to fix.&nbsp; Have had a problem like this for several weeks, at first the computer could fix itself when I followed it's instructions,
 but&nbsp;now it tells me that it cannot fix whatever is wrong. Am assuming that this is a result of the last windows 10 update since the computer (Dell)&nbsp; works fine and the modem is operational also.

dism</a>, then run sfc (might need to run it multiple times) till it reports no integrity violations. If dism complains about source not found or similar you'll need to point it at Win10 Setup media such as a USB or DVD or even a mounted ISO. But that's for
 later. First see what dism says.

            <p>The DISM did clear the errors detected and running sfc showed no new errors, BUT the upgrade failed.</p>
<p>so I ran the Windows Update Service to repair any issues there, the same with the Background intelligent transfer service and the Crytographic Service.</p>
<p>Then I deleted my antivirus and rebooted to ensure things were applied.</p>
<p>I then tried Windows 10 Upgrade assistant only to get another failure with error 0x80240031</p>
<p>I rechecked all services and connectivity including checking system health.</p>
<p>I tried windows update under settings update &amp; security getting another failure with error 0x80004005.</p>
<p>My system seems to vary back and forth between those two last errors and I can't get the update to work.</p>
<p>Any other ideas?</p>

            If your data is all backed up then select the Custom install option in Win10 Setup, delete all the existing partitions and install in the newly unallocated space. When it asks you for the key just skip it and if your copy of Win10 was activated earlier
 it'll get reactivated automatically once it checks online after installation.

<h2>            Skype credit gone</h2>
                    After MSFT updated Skype, the credit in my account disappeared. &nbsp;Because I used the same email I had for Skype to open the MSFT account (which I did not want to do to begin with, but could not find another option to access Skype after the update), now
 I cannot log into the original Skype account with that email/pssw combination. &nbsp;Does anybody know a way around this? &nbsp;Otherwise, how can I have MSFT place that credit back into the account?

<p>Que onda esponja, jaja creo que sabes quien soy, pues fijate que me paso lo mismo, jugue bien en la maÃ±ana a guardi y todo normal, pero en la tarde salio solo locar e interconeccion, segun microsoft es una falla con los DLC, y que ya son varios los que se
 quejan, Un amigo dijo que era por los que pasaron los licensias el seasson pass que no creo que sea por eso ya que las licensias son algo legal en xbox live, espero que se solucione esto pronto, ):</p>
