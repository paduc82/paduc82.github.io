    <title>How do I remove tiles from the Start Menu&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I remove tiles from the Start Menu&#63;</h2>
                    Just installed a brand new purchased copy of Windows 10 (not Insider type copy), so you would think everything would work as it should. But for some reason it will not let me remove tiles from the Start menu. Specifically tiles that have a down arrow that
 says something about a new app is on the way. Well it's been installed for three days now. I want to get rid of a lot of the "garbage apps" that are on the Start menu, but evidently Microsoft doesn't want you to make changes to it. Any ides/suggestions? Come
 on Microsoft don't become another Big Brother like Apple that wants to tell me how I want to use my own PC.

            Photos would not be the appropriate app for this, you should use the classic Windows Live Movie Maker software which would give you the option to add another instance of the track on the time line. Photos Storyboard does not offer this.

<p>Hi Andre</p>
<p>Thank you for your quick response, I'm sorry yes it is under Movie Maker software, but I couldn't find it under list provided.</p>
<p>I tried extending it under End point, but it only goes to 218.31s, that is what the guy from Microsoft did for me, which he was great and very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Andre, What do you mean add another instance of the track on the time line?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The guy did this for me and I don't know how to extend the music, like I mention above it only goes to 218.31s whatever that means. I tried to raise the numbers but it doesn't go any higher.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please, how do I extend the music?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>THANK YOU.....</strong></p>

<h2>            Changed Gmail password and BOOM, Windows 8 Mail App won&#39;t sync</h2>
                    <p>I am tearing my hair out, for the same reason others have gone bald before me.&nbsp; This is a simple matter, but there appears to be no simple solution; in fact, none I can find and understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed my Gmail password and suddenly, my Windows 8 mail app will not sync.&nbsp; I have gone round and round, searching for a place to change the password locally/on my Surface, but nada.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, it's worse than that, but the pain is lost in translation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any guidance, y'all?</p>
<p>

The pool is already corrupt at the time of the current request.<br />
This may or may not be due to the caller.<br />
The internal pool links must be walked to figure out a possible cause of<br />
the problem, and then special pool applied to the suspect tags or the driver<br />
verifier to a suspect driver.<br />

<strong>BCCode: 19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000019</strong><br />
<br />
That could be drivers&nbsp;although antivirus/antispyware/security programs and other hardware<br />
are also probable causes. Updating the major drivers and BIOS&nbsp;would be the best plan of<br />
attack. If needed also try uninstalling your antivirus/security as a test.<br />

<strong>Bug Check 0x19: BAD_POOL_HEADER<br />
<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The BAD_POOL_HEADER bug check has a value of 0x00000019. This indicates that a pool header is corrupt.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code <br />
</strong><br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p><br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p><br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>

<br />
You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can analyze it.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (BIOS and major drivers)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set VIEW
<br />
to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names. (Also update
<br />
the BIOS and&nbsp;chipset drivers.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows&nbsp;7 (updating drivers manually using the
<br />
methods above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device
<br />
makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in
<br />
Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers
<br />
which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE
<br />
it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<h2>            Windows updates are not available when I check for updates</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Since mid July, I am not getting windows update for my vista home premium 32 bit laptop eventhough my setting&nbsp;is automatic to check updates and download them. I get no errors and when&nbsp;I click "check for updates" it starts checking but finally says "no important
 updates available". Is it because there is no updates since July 15 or is there something wrong with my system to check updates? Please advise. Thanks.</p>

    <title>Problem with wireless adaptor at access point - Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boomer108  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with wireless adaptor at access point - Windows 7</h2>
                    I have recently purchased a new HP Notebook with Windows 7 and have been unable to connect to the Internet via my wireless router (Netgear).&nbsp; Despite numerous attempts to fix it, it keeps coming up with "Problem with wireless adaptor at access point".&nbsp;
 I have another Dell Notebook running at home using Vista and I have no such issues.&nbsp; I have copied the settings in my HP to match the Dell and still no luck.&nbsp; I get the feeling this is a common Windows 7 issue from what I have read.&nbsp; Any quick easy fixes availble?&nbsp;
 Thanks&nbsp; John

            Hi Betty, 
<br />
<br />These calls are infuriating, I agree. Unfornately, they will never stop, and the numbers will keep getting spoofed. Hopefully as technology rolls on our telephone providers will be able to block such calls, but right now they will keep coming. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if I can be of more assistance!

            you are correct in thinking they are scammers,
<br />it has become a very common scam over the last couple of years and they may pretend to be any reputable it company (windows, Norton, broadband supplier, telephone supplier etc)
<br />
<br />microsoft will not call you unless you have previously arranged it for a specific issue.
<br />
<br />the best thing you could do is hang up the phone. do not allow access to your computer or give them any details.
<br />
<br />you can report the scam here
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4054905/avoid-and-report-microsoft-technical-support-scams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/405490...</a>
<br />
<br />you may be able to get your telecoms supplier to block the number, however the scammers use different numbers and they are likely spoofed.

            First, when you say "Do *you* have ..." you apparently think you are addressing Microsoft here. You are not.
<span>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Not to give you a hard time, but you should note that t</span>his isn't Microsoft you're addressing here; t</span><span>his is a peer support forum. We are
 all just users of this version of Windows here, helping each other if and when we can. We are not Microsoft employees (not even those of us with "Microsoft MVP" behind our names; that's an honorary title for having provided consistently helpful advice) except
 for an occasional Microsoft contractor or employee.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Second, note that Microsoft *never* makes such calls. The calls were
</span></p>
<div><span>scams, and&nbsp; with various names and phone numbers, scams that has become very common lately.
<br />
</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>See&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/08/virus-scams-social-engineering-victims.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/08/virus-scams-social-engineering-victims.html</a></div>
<div>and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/176605/tell-your-relatives-no-microsoft-wont-call-you-about-your-computer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/176605/tell-your-relatives-no-microsoft-wont-call-you-about-your-computer/</a></div>
<div>and&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1); text-decoration-line: underline">http://www.howtogeek.com/180514/the-%e2%80%9ctech-support%e2%80%9d-scammers-called-htg-so-we-had-fun-with-them/</span></span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>Besides their getting money from you for doing nothing of any value,&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>if you let them into your computer, who knows what they did there or what confidential information they stole.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>So if you did, I highly recommend that you do both of the following immediately:</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>1. Do a clean reinstallation of Windows.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>2. *After* reinstalling Windows, change all of your passwords, especially any for banks or other&nbsp;</span><span>financial sites.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>Since they *might* have installed a key logger, simply changing your passwords without first reinstalling Windows may not be good enough.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And for the future, you should never let *anyone* take control of your computer unless it's someone you know and trust implicitly, both with regard to his honesty and technical skills.</div>

            <div>Hi Janine,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. &nbsp;<br />
We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble this has caused.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better:<br />
<br />
1. Did you install all the pending updates on your system? <br />
2. Did you make any changes on the system, prior to this issue? <br />
3. Are you facing this issue on the Microsoft account or a local account?<br />
4.&nbsp; Is the issue specific to this app?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to sign out from the current user account, restart the system and login to the either administrator account or the Microsoft account to check, if that helps.<br />
<br />
Also, I suggest you to install any pending updates on the system to check, if that helps.&nbsp; Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue occurs due to the conflict between any third party applications or due to some corrupt Windows store components on your system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hello! Sorry you are having this issue. Hopefully we can fix it.
<br />
<br />First make sure your windows is updated to the latest update possible. 
<br />
<br />Settings &gt; update &amp; Security &gt; &gt; update there 
<br />
<br />Second. Check the task bar action center for a night light button. 
<br /> 
<br />Click the bottom right "chat box" looking part of the task bar and look for night light option. 
<br />
<br />If it still does not work, there are 3rd party programs that work as a night light like windows.       
        </p>

<h2>            System Configuration Settings</h2>
                    <p>In the Windows10 system configuration utility (msconfig), you have the option to select three different startup processes; "Normal", "Diagnostic" &amp; "Selective". For some reason, no matter what I select, apply, it&nbsp;reverts back to the Selective startup choice
 when I exit &amp; reboot. The selective startup hangs when booting up. The "Normal" startup boots with no issues and is the one I what to use, but as I said it reverts back to "Selective"... My other computers stay on the startup selection that I select with no
 problems. Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>
<p>

</p><p>To get back to normal, I had to...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) Click into the "Load system services" <em>twice </em>to put a check into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This enabled all services at the Services tab. <em><strong>However</strong>,
</em>upon clicking "Apply" at the General tab,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the action was undone. That is, the check mark disappeared, &amp; it was back in a diagnostic state -</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the services again disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) Go to the Service tab, &amp; click the "Apply" button there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then the check mark in the General tab was&nbsp;retained. All services remained activated. A reboot got</p>

<h2>            intermittent hesitation and hanging</h2>
                    I have noticed that my windows 10 desktop has been hesitating or hanging up more lately. When it does it, nothing will work.&nbsp; If I wait awhile, eventually it seems to correct itself.&nbsp; It's almost like it's looking for something or scanning something and
 everything else takes a back seat until it's done!&nbsp; I am not sure what events are causing it....there are a few that show up as "Information".......but there's a couple that keep occuring that definitely show up as an "Error".&nbsp; I am not sure which is making
 my computer hang up, but would love to find out how to fix it.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94c9f54a-8d69-4adc-ab36-79aff8e5ee71?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94c9f54a-8d69-4adc-ab36-79aff8e5ee71?upload=true" /></a>

    <title>windows 10 network speed test ap - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimj03  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 network speed test ap</h2>
                    <p>I've done all the recommended tests and refreshing mention in the many post regarding the issue, I also note that any time a firewall is mentioned as possible causing the issue there is never an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So without suggesting I refresh(yet again) or suggesting a corruption in my wifi connection, why do't we address the issue at hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would it say service not available if the computer connects to the internet without any issue and the computer is not indicating any possible corruption or virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this app on my windows phone no issue , I've used other means to test my network speed, again without an issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why is it that is app is not working, is it that is will not work with a virus software running or that it will not function on windows 10, or is that you need to add an exception to you firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you</p>

<p>nope didn't work, i did that first, i don't usually waste time with these blogs without first trying the basics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All you ever get from tech support is uninstall and reinstall, before you even suggest it i did a clean boot between the process.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>at the first launch, I did experiment an issue ...</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc72a98c-037b-45e4-9b45-ab8edbc2ccbe" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I read those lines, here, on this page, and asked myself simply : "Maybe I just have to wait some seconds as it is said ?!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I retry now ?! So, I tried ... </p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5 times ... At the fifth one, IT started well ...</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53437390-26ee-452e-8169-4ca335960753" /></p>
<p>and finished very well ! as network allows me to say that, somewhat weel, regarding a Home speed here ...</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa2f6157-5135-4ea8-98b5-d260307e00b9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Did it 3 times, with same approach ... JUST INSIST some secands and I'm sure you'll connect ... Maybe a queue Issue, IT's a research tool, maybe we can be somewhat patient ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Very Cordially, </p>
<p>
</p><p>A VERY INTERRESTING TOOL to enhance Admin's and Techies ToolBoxes ... I just imagine how a Market edition&nbsp;could be integrating some Site Monitoring tool Inside ?! if one day there is one :) ... Amine.</p>

    <title>Unmountable boot volume can&#39;t start pc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evankeitu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unmountable boot volume can&#39;t start pc</h2>
                    <p>Hello, Three days ago I logged onto my computer and saw that there was an update, so I clicked restart and update. However, instead of going into the normal update screen, it gave me the message "Your pcran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just
 collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you (0% Complete) If you'd like to know more you can look on the Internet or the error Unmountable boot volume" for a second then the screen went to "Diagnosing your PC" and then to "Preparing automatic
 repair" then after that it went to a black screen where I can only love the mouse around. It has been like this for three days. I have no ability to go in to safe mode because shift+f8 does nothing. I have no installation disk and I would not be opposed to
 wiping my computer entirely. Please respond ASAP. Thank you</p>

            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are facing issue with scanner in Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely help you with this.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the methods.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps from the link.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Let’s test the issue in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</p>
<p>c) Click the
<b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</p>
<p>d) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</p>
<p>e) On the
<b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</p>
<p>f) On the
<b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the<b> Task Manager window
</b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></p>
<p>g) Click
<b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: Enable half of the services<br />
a. </b>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the <b>Service</b> list.<br />
d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</b>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</p>
<p><b>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
<br />
</b>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</p>
<p><b>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</b>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing
 the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</p>
<p><b>Step 6: Resolve the problem<br />
</b>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem
 item.</p>
<p><b>Step 7:</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</p>
<p>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</p>
<p>c) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click <b>
‘OK’</b>.</p>
<p>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>‘Restart’</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Download the scanner drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right-click on the driver and click on properties.</p>
<p>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click on the ‘compatibility’ tab and check the box "Run this program in compatibility mode for” and select Windows 7 operating system from the drop down.</p>
<p>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click on ‘Apply’ and click ‘OK’ and run the file to install it.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 blue screen bad system config by changing memory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mut1994  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 blue screen bad system config by changing memory</h2>
                    I was trying to adjust the ram my computer used in the boot tab of system configuration and clicked a check box that said max memory. Now my computer gives me a blue screen on startup and even system restore does not work. I have tried chkdisk/f/r/C: command
 in command prompt but it said no problems found. Is there a way to uncheck that box using the advanced options window? Or is there something else i can do? Thank you.

            <p>MU,</p>
<p>Yes, this is strange.&nbsp; You tried to up your RAM a bit, and instead it started knocking out your drivers.&nbsp; Yes, it is possible to download and restore/reinstall individual drivers like msconfig, but given all your other issues, it sounds like you may have
 more going on than just a missing driver.&nbsp; If that's gone from the registry, who knows what else you're missing?&nbsp; And with your blue screens, failed system restores, error messages, etc., it sounds to me like a reset may be the way to go.&nbsp; Full disclosure:
 I'M A TOTAL NEWBIE&nbsp;at this stuff, and just kind of dumb as well, but in my opinion, a reset is probably the shortest distance between where you are now and "all fixed".&nbsp; Whatever you do, don't start downloading MS drivers off third-party sites, because you'll
 just be downloading more problems along with them.&nbsp; If you've got&nbsp;a good way to back up your stuff (external hard drives are worth their weight in gold), a reset is actually no&nbsp;big deal.&nbsp; I just did a "remove everything" reset about three weeks ago to get
 rid of a few little kinks, it fixed all my issues and gave me about 30GBs of my hard drive&nbsp;back.&nbsp; But if you want to try a couple more fixes first, from admin command line, type
<strong>sfc /scannow </strong>and hit return, and just let it run, it takes a while.&nbsp; It'll look for missing or fragmented software and attempt to repair any problems it finds.&nbsp; When that's done and it gives you a report, then again from the admin command line
 type <strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth </strong>and hit enter, and let that run, too.&nbsp; When it's done, it'll give you another report.&nbsp; Maybe/hopefully that will repair enough to get you up and running so that you can get to some of the system
 troubleshooters and run those.&nbsp; If not, the only other newbie advice I've got is to run&nbsp;the reset.&nbsp; Like I said, I just did it and it was pretty easy; I was nervous for about five minutes, and two hours later I was really pleased with the results.&nbsp; JUST BACK
 YOUR STUFF UP FIRST! Can't emphasize that enough.&nbsp; Let me know how it goes, and if you do run a reset and&nbsp;want&nbsp;help or advice, hit me back.&nbsp; Good Luck, and sorry I couldn't help out more.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Mgenuine,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p><span>Apart from the issue, how are you doing today?</span></p>
<p><span>You have an issue with missing files in the User account on Windows 8.
</span><span>This can be really frustrating for you and I appreciate the efforts that you have put in. Let us work together as a team and try to get this issue fixed.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us start with few questions-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you able to access and view files on other user accounts on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is this issue limited to the User Account files?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any other changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>I would like more information regarding the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1-</span></p>
<p><span>You need to make sure that the folders in the User Account are not hidden.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the steps-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open the User Account folder and click on the “View” tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now, select “Options” and then “change folder and search options”.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the “view” tab and then place a dot next to “Show hidden files and folders”.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on “Apply” and then “Ok”.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Make sure you undo the changes after performing the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2-</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>I would have you perform a System Restore to undo the changes made on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the article-</span></p>
<p><span>How to restore, refresh, or reset your PC</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a></span></p>
<p>Note: Performing a System Restore will undo any changes made on your computer earlier. You may also lose unsaved information as well. Proceed at your own risk.</p>
<p>Check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><span>Do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be happy to help. We, at Microsoft strive towards excellence.</span></p>
