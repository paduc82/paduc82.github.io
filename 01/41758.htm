<h2>            Why is not a single aspect of your verification code system for password recovery working&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have tried numerous times to get the code sent to my phone, my emails address and getting you to call me. Nada - and nothing in my junk email either.</p>
<p>You signed me out of my Skype according to the message I got the other day as I didn't have the most up to date software. When I attempted to enter my password I was told it wasn't valid. When I requested the code be sent to my phone nothing arrived, likewise
 with my email address. And the option for you to call me isn't possible at this time. I have been trying for two days. Pretty shonky service and rather frustrating to say the least. Worked better when it wasn't owned by Microsoft.</p>

    <title>System Cache vs Programs and Paging Size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Cache vs Programs and Paging Size</h2>
                    
<p><em>Start</em> &gt; right click <em>My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; Advanced tab &gt; Settings</em> button under&nbsp;<em>Performance &gt; Advanced</em> tab &gt; under&nbsp;<em>Memory Usage</em>, should it be set to&nbsp;<em>Programs</em> or&nbsp;
<em>System Cache</em>?</p>
<p>Also, on that same tab, under <em>Virtual Memory &gt; Settings</em>, it says 1136 MB. If I go to&nbsp;<em>Change</em>, it shows 29082 MB available and it is checked&nbsp;
<em>System Managed Size</em>. Below, it says<em>Total Paging Size For All Drives, Minimum Allowed 2 MB, Recommended 1135 MB, Currently Allocated 1136 MB.</em></p>
<p>Is this also a good setup for good performance? I worry, as I am always trying to improve the performance of my tablet and maybe I made these settings at some time and shouldn't have done something. OK, I'm a fiddler and sometimes I worry that I may have
 fiddled too much and I am always looking to improve my tablet's performance.</p>
<p>I know that just now I tried changing the setting on that first item that I mentioned over to<em>System Cache</em> and my tablet seemed to hate it. Suddenly, my IE was acting badly, which I noticed right away&nbsp;when I tried to come to this site. It was slow
 and displayed things badly and my login was very slow. So I put that setting back to&nbsp;<em>Programs</em>.</p>

    <title>Date Display issue in Downlaods Folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hadoken4ever  say:</h3>
<h2>            Date Display issue in Downlaods Folder</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I started noticing that date for some of the files I'm downloading has been displaying the incorrect date. Instead of 2018-07-24 it's showing 2036-02-01. Thing is, if I move these files out of the download folder and into any other (even into a
 sub folder within the download folder) the day starts displaying correctly. Even when in the downloads folder, when I access the file properties the created date, modified date and accessed date all display correctly. I've already done some checks to confirm
 the system clock is correct and done a full virus scan. Can anyone figure out why this is happening and how to correct it?</p>

            Hi H4E.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is the folder synched?  See here for one solution:  <a href="http://www.rawinfopages.com/tips/2015/05/is-windows-showing-the-wrong-date-for-files-in-explorer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.rawinfopages.com/tips/2015/05/is-win...</a>
<br />
<br />Date may also be wrong in the router:  <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-3062604/folders-show-wrong-date-created-date-modified.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-3062604/fo...</a>
<br />
<br />I'd also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First let me thank you for your fast response! I hadn't expected that I'd hear anything that quickly. Of course that leads to the second thing: apologizing for my delayed response. I did get your response a few days ago, but I've had an extremely busy week.
 It's not really a good excuse, but I hope you understand. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the assistance you've offered, it did help me to realign my displays correctly, but I was still unsure as to why the "Date" display had changed in the first place. Using the information you gave me as a reference, I did my own research as to why this
 change had occurred. Thankfully I found the answer: The "Date" display had switched from displaying the "File Created Date" to the "Media Created Date" after the most recent windows update (something I neglected to mention in my original post). This is also
 why not all of the files I have changed - some of them have assigned "Media Created Dates" and other do not. Not entirely sure why, but I read enough about this during my research to know that this issue is not at all uncommon.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did check in to tools that could modify the "Media Created Date" but turned up nothing so after considering I just decided to leave it. Everything is now displaying correctly again, and I've confirmed what the source of the problem is, so I now consider
 the issue resolved. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your help.</p>

            Hi there Max, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />See if Compatibility Mode allows the program to run on Windows 10:
<br />- Right-click on the program, and then select Properties.
<br />- Go to the Compatibility tab.
<br />- Check the box for Run this program in compatibility mode for.
<br />- Click the drop-down menu, and then select older versions of Windows. Whichever works.
<br />- Click Apply, and then OK.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, you could try Hallmark Card Studio 2017 which may suit your needs:

            <p>Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I corrected a problem in Windows 10 (upgraded from Windows 7 Ultimate)&nbsp;with Windows Mobile Device Center 6.1 connecting to a Windows Mobile 6.5 Professional mobile device (Ashtech Mobile Mapper 100 GPS Receiver).&nbsp; Connection worked on my Windows 10 laptop
 (upgraded from Windows 8.1), but not on my desktop.&nbsp; Microsoft support hacked on it for 1 hour to no avail.&nbsp; On the laptop with the device plugged into USG, under Network Adaptors appeared "Microsoft Windows Mobile Remote Adaptor", and under Portable Devices
 appeared "Ohanapecosh MobileMapper 100 One", which is the name of my device; On the desktop, on the Device Manager Control Panel appeared "Microsoft Windows Mobile Remote Adaptor #2", but no Portable Devices appeared at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reference the procedure here: </p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/931937</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Troubleshooting Tips - Device will not connect, I followed steps 1, 2, 3, &amp; 5. (I did not follow step 4 because no Mobile Device node appeared in my Device Manager&nbsp;Control Panel).&nbsp; The problem is describe there as a driver not installed successfully.&nbsp;
 Now </p>
<p>
</p><p>After following the procedure, on the&nbsp;desktop computer&nbsp;that formerly failing, I saw under Portable Devices appeared "Ohanapecosh MobileMapper 100 One", and it connected correctly with Windows Mobile Device Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Derek</p>

            Have tried the options offered but WMDC is still not working. If I try to run it the WMDC icon opens on the screen and asks to wait until the WMDC starts, but then the icon disappears without further comments.

<h2>            NTAyMjEwZG.exe, ODk3MzAyNjdjN.exe, ZDfhMzAyMTUzNzE1MG.exe should I delete this files&#63; They appeared after 2 days I got a Trojan on my pc</h2>
                    <p>I got a Trojan on my pc on June, 25th, I tried to get rid of it with windows defender, but on the task manager I see this file in specific&nbsp;NTAyMjEwZG.exe activated, I didn't know it but I was suspicious so I went to where it's located Windows (C:)\Program
 Files\OGY3MDc3NzQ2N , then I found suspicious the name of the folder, try to look it up but didn't find anything, and there are files from the 2017, not sure if they are safe or not, but anyways, when I got the location of the .exe that was running on my pc,
 I found more weird named files! Created only 3 days after it got infected, as I'm not sure of deleting them, I've been stopping the task but it starts again on its own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh and just now, I realized that there are files that are in the "exclusions" section of windows defender that I did not added as an exclusion, I have 2 clear things I know I put in exclsions myself, now I found A LOT that I have no idea how they got there
 and a few of them are them files I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>My question is, can I really get rid of them? Delete them? I still have a lot of doubt bc I think the Trojan might have changed the name of something important just to make me delete them from my pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I have a .zip file from the 2017 too but on the downloads folder named ProcessExplorer.exe, it certainly wasn't there before, what do I do with it? How do I know if it is safe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to attach photos of both of my problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps: my pc is on Spanish so I'm translating everything almost literally, sorry for that, I just want all the help I can have.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f16605f-eb7e-4ae7-9287-2db7b6461e6e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f16605f-eb7e-4ae7-9287-2db7b6461e6e?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5283f13-e6a8-49f3-94c7-b26dad5c9d49?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5283f13-e6a8-49f3-94c7-b26dad5c9d49?upload=true" /></a>another

            Hi Poly.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Download, install and run full scans with Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner: 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>.  Clean up anything they find, restart PC and then run both scans again until they come up clean.
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />Next check System Files for damage.  Run this tool up to 3 separate times to repair any damaged System Files:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />
<br />If files cannot be repaired run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Ruby,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You may be facing this issue if the basic input/output system (BIOS) does not detect the hard disk or if the hard disk is damaged. To resolve the issue, we suggest that you perform a startup repair using Windows 10 installation disk by following the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Insert the Windows installation disc in the disc drive or connect USB media and then start the computer.<br />
2. Press a key when the message <em>Press any key to boot</em> from CD or DVD appears.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
If your PC does not detect the media automatically<br />
<br />
3. During the restart process, read the screen for any instructions that explain how to interrupt normal startup and enter the basic input/output system (BIOS) setup utility. Most PCs use the F2, F10, ESC, or DEL key to begin the BIOS Setup.<br />
4. Look for a tab in the BIOS Setup Utility that is labeled <em>Boot Order</em>,<em> Boot Options</em>, or
<em>Boot</em>. Following the directions on the screen, use the arrow keys to go to the
<em>Boot Order</em>, then press <em>Enter</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
5. Locate the CD, DVD, or USB flash drive (this might be called Removable Device) in the Boot list. Following the directions on the screen, use the arrow keys to move the drive up so that it appears first in the Boot list. Press
<em>Enter</em>. The boot order sequence is now changed to boot from the CD, DVD, or USB flash drive.<br />
6. Press <em>F10 </em>to save your changes and to exit the BIOS Setup Utility. Select
<em>Yes </em>in the confirmation window. The PC will <em>restart</em>. Allow the PC to restart normally. The scan will take a few minutes and remove any malware that may be infecting your computer.<br />
7. Select a language, a time, a currency, a keyboard or another input method, and then click
<em>Next</em>.<br />
8. Click <em>Repair your computer</em>.<br />
9. Click the operating system that you want to repair and then click <em>Next</em>.<br />
10. On the <em>Choose an option</em> screen, select <em>Troubleshoot</em>. Select
<em>Advanced </em><em>options </em>from the window and click on <em>Startup </em>
<em>repair </em><em>option</em>.<br />
<br />
Note: If the issue persists, we suggest that you contact the manufacturer of your computer's hard disk. The manufacturer may have a utility that you can use to perform a more detailed scan for damaged areas of the hard disk and help verify the correct BIOS
 settings. <br />
<br />
Update us with the result.

</p><p><span>Screen sharing works best if both of the users are using the latest version of the Skype application available for their devices.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Ok... so 1st of all, we're both using the latest version, I'm on a PC and he's on a laptop (if that's what you asked me), we're both using Windows 7, and I have Internet from RCS&amp;RDS and he has Internet from Digi. (Sorry for my bad english, english is not

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The screenshot you provided shows an either an Internet connection between the two of you or one is using an outdated Skype version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Skype mainly depends on the strength of your bandwidth, the application balances out the distribution of the quality in a call. If Skype detects a weak connection in either one of the users, the call quality,
<em>especially in screen sharing which uses a lot of bandwidth</em>, might not be optimal. Please try the following steps below to reset your Skype settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sign out and quit Skype. <strong>Make sure that it is not running in the background.
</strong></li><li>Launch Run command by pressing Windows + R keys at the same time. </li><li>On the Run dialog box, type in<strong> %appdata%\Skype</strong></li><li>This will open your Skype folder. Locate a file named <strong>shared.xml </strong>
or shared if your file extensions are hidden then delete it.</li><li>Next, locate a folder named after your Skype name and double click on it.&nbsp;</li><li>Delete a file named <strong>config.xml </strong>or config.&nbsp;</li><li>Exit and rename your entire Skype folder to Skype_Old.</li><li>Re-launch the Skype application.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Ask your contact to do the same and let us know what happens after.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Product Key</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My acer desktop comes with win 8 pre-installed.</p>
<p>It was upgraded to win 10 thru win updates.</p>
<p>Recently my acer desktop motherboard fails and acer no longer support.</p>
<p>I sent my desktop to a 3rd party vendor for repair.</p>
<p>They changed the motherboard and formatted everything for me.</p>
<p>Win 10 was installed for me and I need to activate it before i can use the full version.</p>
<p>Right now, i can't find any win 8.1 product key as acer claimed that it was embedded in their system and they can't do anything.</p>
<p>They suggested to me to call Microsoft for help.</p>
<p>Therefore, i wonder where can i get the product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The acer model that i have is Aspire XC600</p>
<p>SNID: 33101335430&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mfg date: 2013/-7/31</p>
<p>Serial No: DTSLJSG0033310342A3000</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above are all the information that i can find on my desktop casing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help as i already paid for win 8 in my acer and now i need the key to activate win 10 after reformatting.</p>

            The OEM license gets tied to the motherboard. If motherboard changes, then this is considered a hardware change. 
<br />
<br />For hardware change, you can transfer license to a new hardware only if it was a retail license not OEM license. Since, you had OEM license, hence you can not transfer, hence activate.
<br />
<br />However, you can use below methods to retrieve existing keys and see whether it allows you to activate or not
<br />
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />Copy the below line and paste into Powershell &gt; Enter
<br />wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey
<br />Make a note of your product key
<br />
<br />Windows Key+I to open Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key and Enter this product key
<br />
<br />You can also Use third party tools to retrieve keys
<br />A. Download and run OemKey from <a href="https://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a>
<br />OR
<br />B. Download and run Showkeyplus from <a href="https://github.com/Superfly-Inc/ShowKeyPlus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://github.com/Superfly-Inc/ShowKeyPlus</a>

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this: 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends) 
<br />Contact Microsoft at <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>  through chat support. They would take control of your PC and activate(might need a proof of purchase) 
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

    <title>WIN10 file explorer - how to remove multiple items from pinned list - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john-errington  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIN10 file explorer - how to remove multiple items from pinned list</h2>
                    <p>While moving files I had selected the whole contents of a directory. </p>
<p>Then I accidentally clicked which has resulted in over 100 files being added to my explorer quick access pinned list.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>However unlike the explorer window I can find no way to select multiple items for removal from that list.</p>
<p>Is there any way to do this - or a utility I can use to manage pinned lists (and maybe recent items lists?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: as a test I added a new folder named rumpelstiltz to the pinned list. </p>
<p>A search showed that string is NOT present except as a folder name.</p>
<p>A search of the registry found ONE key</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\BagMRU\2\0, 22, 62 00 31 00 00 00 00 00 0B 4B 2A 2A 10 00 52 55 4D 50 45 4C 7E 31 00 00 4A 00 09 00 04 00 EF BE 0B 4B 2A 2A 0B 4B 2A 2A 2E 00 00 00 21 CF 01 00 00 00 1B 00
 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 4D 65 56 00 72 00 75 00 6D 00 70 00 65 00 6C 00 73 00 74 00 69 00 6C 00 74 00 7A 00 00 00 18 00 00 00
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered in this thread</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://superuser.com/questions/1051440/where-are-the-win-10-quick-access-settings-stored</p>
<p>
</p><p>that they are held in a file, and the name of the pinned item is plain text - but the rest of the block of data around it is gobbledegook.</p>
<p>
</p><pre><code>%appdata%\microsoft\windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations\f01b4d95cf55d32a.automaticDestinations-ms</code></pre>
<p>So there is no obvious way to manipulate it.</p>

<h2>            Windows and Ubuntu dual boot - Windows 7 UEFI&#47;GPT install problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone<br />
<br />
I have a problem here with my dual boot installation that is driving me insane!<br />
<br />
I bought my laptop with windows 8 installed, that I upgraded to Win10, and installed as dual boot Ubuntu 16.04. I don't really like win10, but I would still like to have a windows OS installed. So, I deleted the data on the WinOS partition, and tried to install
 a fresh copy of Win7 64bit. This is where the problem lies. I created a bootable USB with WintoUSB, and if I try to run it from the UEFI, tells me
<br />
<br />
<em>Windows Failed to Start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. To fix the problem:<br />
</em><br />
<em>1. Insert your Windows Installation disc and restart your computer.</em><br />
<br />
<em>2. Choose your language settings, and then click "Next"</em><br />
<br />
<em>3. Click "Repair your computer"</em><br />
<em>If you do not have this disc, contact your system administrator or computer manufacturer for assistance.</em><br />
<em>File: \EFI\Boot\BCD</em><br />
<br />
<em>Status: 0xc000000d</em><br />
<em>Info: The Boot Configuration Data for your PC is missing or contains errors.<br />
</em><br />
I googled millions of pages already, all of them tell me to disable Secure Boot (It's disabled) and Enable Legacy Mode. My board doesn't have this option, only the option to disable UEFI. When I do disable UEFI boot, it runs BIOS and launches the USB boot,
 but then, when I want to select the partition to install:<em><br />
<br />
Windows cannot be installed to this disk, the selected disk is of the GPT partition style.<br />
<br />
</em>Is there any other way I can install Win7 on my machine without having to format the whole disk and lose my Ubuntu setup? Because, if it comes to that, I'd rather just stick with Ubuntu....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all</p>

            I tried running a win7 machine with VMWare for Ubuntu. For the amount of RAM I need to run Corel or illustrator, it's sluggish, and crashes a lot. Doing the opposite and running Ubuntu virtually is not an option. I would have to dismantle my whole Ubuntu
 setup, that's what I'm trying to avoid. Format the drive and install win7 on non-UEFI mode. For that I rather install them in dual-boot.

<br />If that does not work.
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers at the bottom
<br />If you see a yellow exclamation, right click it then click update driver.

<h2>            Remove Open File Location from Context Menu</h2>
                    Is there any way to remove the Open File Location option from the Context Menu when right-clicking a shortcut? &nbsp;This will help prevent students from accessing the C drive. &nbsp;I have already hidden the C drive via Group Policy, however right-clicking a shortcut
 and selecting Open File Location still allows them to gain access to the C drive. &nbsp;As a work around I have disabled the ability to display the Context Menu all&nbsp;together when right-clicking via Group Policy. &nbsp;But I would prefer to just simply remove the Open
 File Location option.

            Have you manually ran Windows Update and ensure that all updates have been installed?&nbsp; The upgrade option in the Store is cued on all updates being installed.<br />
<br />
Chances are you did, but run the Windows Update manually and on the left side of the panel, click on "View update history" and check to see if any updates failed.<br />
<br />
Also, when you do that, make sure that nothing is attached to the tablet except the keyboard.&nbsp; Other devices can interfere.<br />
<br />
If you performed all the above, the last ditch option is to perform a REFRESH and reinstall all updates via Windows Update through the Control Panel and not the option in the Charms Bar menu.<br />
<br />
If you do that and the updates are all installed and everything is good, click on the Store and see if the upgrade option appears.&nbsp; It will be right there on the first screen.&nbsp; If it is NOT there, contact Microsoft Technical Support and send the tablet back
 for replacement.&nbsp; There will most likely be a mechanical defect in the unit.<br />

<p>Hi Dustin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are denied from access when changing a setting in Windows, it could mean that you do not have administrator privileges to change or access the settings. Kindly log in to your computer as an administrator to change the setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If logging in as an administrator does not help, kindly check if User Account Control is enabled. User Account Control is in place to make sure programs don't do any damage to your system. Here's how to check User Account Control:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Start </strong>button, then type <strong>User Account Control</strong>, and open the option to change
<strong>User Account Control </strong>settings.</li><li>Set it to your preferred option, then change the settings in <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the above steps doesn't help, do not hesitate to post back to us.</p>
        </p>

<p>We appreciate the feedback, Dustin. There might be an application or process that is restricting you from changing the settings. May we know if there are any third-party antivirus or security programs installed on your computer? If there are, kindly disable
 them temporarily as these programs may cause conflicts within the security of the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Antivirus software can help you protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldnt disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it, you should re-enable it as
 soon as youre done. If youre connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>:Changing the priority in Task Manager can sometimes do more harm than good, as it may not leave enough resources for other processes that is required to run the system. Change these settings at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to an update from you.</p>
