<p>
</p><p>Same problem. &nbsp;The only difference being is it only occurs for me if I try to update my AMD 7970 drivers -- and the DirectX features become "Unavailable", with seemingly no way of enabling them without reverting to the old driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read a lot of posts about this and similar issues, some dating back as far as a decade! &nbsp;Surely
<em>someone</em> knows something about this?! &nbsp;=/</p>

            <p>My specs are:</p>
<p><strong>Alienware R4 gaming laptop</strong></p>
<p><strong>Intel i7 3840QM (16GB)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Intel HD 4000 Switchable Graphics (driver 9.3.0.0)</strong></p>
<p><strong>AMD Radeon HD 7970M (2GB) (9.3.0.0)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Windows 7 Ultimate SP1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue may have been present for some time, but I only recently thought to update my video drivers. &nbsp;Upon updating, the Catalyst Control Centre may become inactive (as if it were not installed) or crash upon opening the application, or even work as normal.
 &nbsp;The monitor reverts to a 'DirectX-less' configuration (can be seen from resolution change). &nbsp;Dxdiag.exe detects DirectX features DirectDraw, Direct3D AGP Texture Acceleration all "unavailable". &nbsp;Most video game applications no longer function (as they require
 these DirectX components to run). &nbsp;Attempting to re-install DirectX reveals it is already installed (quoted as "DirectX 11" in the dxdiag window).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue may have just cropped up, also (not sure if it's directly related to the attempted driver update) -- after the most recent critical Windows update, the video driver and Catalyst suite were seemingly removed. &nbsp;That is, upon restarting the PC
 and the Windows update being configured, it was as if no video driver was ever installed. &nbsp;To rectify this, I had to System Restore to before said Windows update. &nbsp;I first attempt to install the latest AMD drivers, but the installation process wasn't successful
 (some "Windows installer" crashed without an error code -- the driver seemingly installed, but upon restart was revealed to have failed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that now the driver is becoming somewhat dated and some applications (games) are becoming incompatible. &nbsp;Hence the unsuccessful attempts at driver updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the links proffered:</p>
<p>Changing the settings in Appearance and Personalization &gt; Display &gt; Screen Resolution &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Trouble Shoot is not possible because said button is greyed out / unavailable.</p>
<p>(<strong>NB:</strong> I tried to update the Intel HD 4000 driver and it failed because, according to the Intel website, said discrete graphics solution may have been configured by and locked out by the manufacturer.)</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>With laptops , both AMD, and Intel&nbsp; graphics (Nvidia too), drivers should be downloaded from
</p>
<p>the mfg's site.</p>
<p>This is because many laptops have 'custom' built graphics that require their own modified driver version.</p>
<p>- Never use Windows Updates for graphics drivers on a gaming machine (laptop or PC).
</p>
<p>(The graphics driver updates are found in the '<em>optional'</em> updates section and should be disallowed.
</p>
<p>Most 'Optional' updates should be installed only if you <em>know</em> you need them).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, laptop mfg's&nbsp; very often provide only limited driver support, even with high end models, and when a laptop does not work with drivers downloaded from AMD you are very often stuck with
</p>
<p>the latest the laptop mfg provides.</p>
<p>(Laptops are several steps above PC on the built in obsolescence, future e-waste scale).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quote from the AMD download page -</p>
<p><span><em>" If you experience difficulty while using the AMD Catalyst Mobility driver(s), we recommend reverting to the driver provided by your notebook vendor. Please contact your notebook vendor for their most recent graphics drivers.</em></span><em>"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- However, with a very few exceptions, games shouldn't be incompatible due to not having the
</p>
<p>most recent graphics driver.</p>
<p>Which games are you suspecting are incompatible ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Various games do get optimisations in the drivers. These may provide some extra fps with AA, or other</p>
<p>settings, and in some games they may advertise 15% improvement overall (Not always true, and more often with newer series card).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In some cases a driver update can fix a serious bug in a game, but most bugs are in the game, so waiting for a patch for the game is more often the fix for a poor running game.</p>
<p>(Assassins Creed Unity, BF3/4, FC3/4... the list is long)</p>
<p>But in none of the above should using an older driver make a game incompatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find out just what each driver does improve on in the Release Notes found on the download page. (Mostly Xfire and CAP updates. Similarly Nvidia's driver updates are more about SLI and the GeForce 'experience' (Nvidia's version of CAP files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, if a driver,&nbsp; or using too powerful a gpu, leads to incompatibility it's far more likely to be
</p>
<p>with older games, eg.- I have several games (older, or low spec games) that run on my GTX560ti that
</p>
<p>I have to use Intel HD4000 graphics with on my machine running a GTX770.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply and you're probably right; about the vendor's drivers being the only ones compatible with the card I have and the part about the games being at fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After posting, I decided to go to the Dell forums and happened upon a thread created only two weeks ago regarding the very same problem for the very same graphics card --
<strong>inability to upgrade graphics drivers for 7970M</strong>. &nbsp;The only driver that works (there's only one available and it's from late 2012 / early 2013) is that which Dell provide on their website. &nbsp;There are a number of posts there with others who have
 encountered the same problem I have and how it's hampering their game performance / compatibility. (<em>Dragon Age Inquisition</em> and
<em>Far Cry 4</em> were are among the games cited).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my part, the impetus for upgrading the driver came from a recent, lower profile game release,&nbsp;<em>Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris</em>, which was crashing (sans error) on start-up and which some other AMD users encountering the same problems had
 solved by updating their drivers. &nbsp;This game was only released this week, so it may get patch... dunno. &nbsp;Another games which I was suspicious of of being affected by driver issues were
<em>Dead Rising 3</em> (low FPS / low (~30%) GPU usage) and the last two <em>Naruto Ultimate Ninja</em> games (running in 'slow motion' / GPU not being utilised). &nbsp;Neither of these games are so 'special' that I'm going to run out and by a PC to play them, but
 it's irksome that hardware that for all intents and purposes should run the games cannot, seemingly for lack of mere software updates. &nbsp;Of course, the first thing developers will tell the consumer to do is "update your drivers". &nbsp;But in the past I've dismissed
 this as simply hand-balling responsibility to the end user. &nbsp;Seems, in certain cases, they were right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for using the discrete chipset for some games, I in fact do -- <em>King of Fighter XIII</em> crashes on start-up with the dedicated GPU assigned but runs fine on the integrated chip. &nbsp;However, if a game is taxing on the hardware (like,&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising
 3</em>), the Intel chip won't do. &nbsp;In the case of the aforementioned Lara Croft game, it does not crash
<em>immediately</em> when running on the HD 4000, but hangs at the splash screen then eventually stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the ball looks to be in the vendor's court, as to whether they deem it worthwhile to provide a driver update for their naïve customers. &nbsp;I guess the more people complain, the more likely something might be forthcoming (<strong>not</strong> holding my
 breath). &nbsp;Although cognisant of the fact that laptop gaming PC's have their graphics card clock speeds throttled etc (I don't need to run everything with Ultra settings), I was still somewhat wet-behind-the-ears with respect to the restrictions imposed on
 laptop <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">software updates</span>. &nbsp;This really puts into perspective how 'gimped' graphics solutions must be for the luxury of portability and will make me think twice before paying top dollar for such devices in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said that, to flog <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>gaming laptops</strong></span> touted as the best available, at a pretty penny, and then neglect to provide simple, regular video driver updates - at least for the few years the graphics
 cards are still reasonably viable for gaming - is dumbfounding. &nbsp;My next such purchase will only happen if it comes with a veritable signed guarantee that driver support
<strong><em>will</em></strong> come for an acceptable time into the future after purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Caveat emptor. &nbsp;&gt;_&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PS:</strong></p>
<p>The issue regarding the most recent Windows update 'uninstalling' the graphics driver is still pending. &nbsp;I'm still running on the system restored set-up and will let Windows update overnight and see what eventuates.&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It truly is a sad and sorry state of affairs. Bad enough laptop hardware is most often not upgradable,<br />
</p>
<p>but to not provide drivers for a given series gpu for even half the time period as do AMD and Nvidia,
</p>
<p>is a rude grab for full machine upgrade money.<br />
</p>
<p>I am surprise that DELL don't have updated drivers for your card. The HD7000 series is still only
<br />
</p>
<p>one generation back, after all. <br />
</p>
<p>AMD still provide drivers for as far back as the Radeon 9000 series from '02/'4, and Nvidia as
<br />
</p>
<p>far back as the 7000 series from around '04/'05. <br />
Yes, laptop mfg's do have a lot to answer for with this <em>"gaming laptop"</em> marketing strategy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you were not having problems when using the latest DELL drivers with 'older' games, and if<br />
</p>
<p>the gpu use percentage goes up after installing the latest DELL driver, as it should with system intensive games, that would add credence to the newer games requiring a newer driver to run well,
</p>
<p>but you may still be able to find fixes and tweaks to cover most problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I've seen in common with both Nvidia and AMD - their forums have many posts with
</p>
<p>each new driver that, among other things, declare it the worst driver, and gpu killer ever.
</p>
<p>Not saying newer drivers definitely won't fix your problems, but it's important to look beyond
</p>
<p>the drivers, new or old.</p>
- I see the thread at the top of one of the AMD forums atm is -
<p><em>" Dragon Age Inquisition plays in slow motion after Omega update " (HD7800)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Apparently Dead Rising 3 has a 30fps cap out of the box (a new trend that came with the new consoles and their frame rate of 30, and all the FMV they like to throw in these days), but there is a tweak that allows for higher frame rates.<br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dsogaming.com/pc-performance-analyses/dead-rising-3-pc-performance-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">THIS</a>&nbsp; - &nbsp; article goes into detail about some of the performance issues, and has the frame rate unlock<br />
</p>
<p>instructions.<br />
</p>
<p>- Console ports are also demanding more VRAM than previously, which is starting to become a</p>
<p>problem if wanting to use ultra textures in some games, eg.- Watch Dogs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Lowering game settings too far can be counterproductive if the gpu use is low, as low settings direct
</p>
<p>more processing more toward the cpu. </p>

            <p><span><em>- Apparently Dead Rising 3 has a 30fps cap out of the box&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p>Yeah. &nbsp;I'm aware of the 30fps cap. &nbsp;But my issue was a 15-20fps stutter fest and the GPU not being utilised above ~30% (the fans hardly kicked in -- checked it with MSI Afterburner). &nbsp;The GPU clearly wasn't being used the way it should have been and this,
 in retrospect, was likely due to driver incompatibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Not switching from the Intel HD to AMD gpu, or only using a small percentage of the AMD gpu ?</span></p>
<p>No. &nbsp;Naruto was using the AMD GPU, but ran like molasses. &nbsp;And I don't mean frame rate stutter as with
<em>Dead Rising 3</em>, but actual <strong>smooth&nbsp;slow motion</strong>; perhaps 30% slower than it should run. &nbsp;And again the GPU was hardly doing any work. &nbsp;This problem was also reported by other people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the resolutions / graphical settings; I'm not a graphics hoe, so I don't max games out. &nbsp;In fact, I'm happy to run in med-high with a screen resolution level below the monitor's default (from 1920x1080 to 1600x900), as long as the games run smoothly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to try contact Dell when I can be bothered and see if they'll respond. &nbsp;It seems utterly remiss for them to abandon a video card so soon and with so few driver updates (there's only one, solitary driver option for the 7970M in their download section).
 &nbsp;With their new Alienware consoles coming out, one would think they'd want to present a good image, not scare people away with half-ăssed after-purchase support...</p>

<h2>            &#40;KB2633874&#41; update for .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 for Vista</h2>
                    I tried installing the above mentioned update, but it keeps failing to install. I get a Error Code: "8007041D".<br />
<br />
I looked in my control panel under programs for this [.NET Framework 2.0 ] and don't see it listed. So I am presuming that maybe it won't update, because there is no program to update? I'm not even sure if I need this update or .NET Framework 2.0?
<br />
<br />
I have other .NET Framework programs 3.5 SP1 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile listed in Programs as installed. But I don't see anything designated as a .NET Framework for SP2? So maybe that's why the update is not updating, as it has nothing to update?<br />
<br />
Any help or thoughts appreciated, thanks, Bill<br />

            Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
I tried methods 1, 3, and 4, to no avail. As to method 2, I have not tried that yet, but I read the link to it.<br />
<br />
Before I go there, can you answer my question as to whether not having the program [NET Framework 2.0] listed on my computer, makes the available update...uninstallable? In other words, there's nothing available, no program, to update? Or the program it wants
 to update, is not there to update. So we spin wheels. Does this sound probable?<br />
<br />
I also went to the download site and found 8 different NET Framework 2.0 SP2 programs listed. I have a 32 bit OS, which I presume means x86. Could you recommend which one I should use?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>.NET Framework application is required for applications and games. If you have .NET Framework version 2.0, only then the update recognizes it and tries to install. Be default,
 Vista has .Net Framework version 3.5 SP1 installed in the Computer.</p>
<p>You need to install 32-bit(x86) version of the updates as you’re having a 32-bit Computer.</p>
<p>Try the suggestions as provided in my previous response and let us know for further assistance if required.</p>
<p>Additional to my previous suggestions, you can scan your computer from
<b>Microsoft Safety Scanner</b>, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. Viruses are also known to cause issues with Windows updates.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with
 your existing antivirus software.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</b></a></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft
 Safety Scanner again.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>

            Thanks again for you replies.<br />
<br />
I am downloading the scanner [14 mins.] mentioned as I type. Is it any different than the M.S.E. virus scanner? Which I have on my machine.<br />
<br />
I downloaded .NET Framework 2.0 SP2, but it wouldn't install. I got a pop-up with a red X, telling me I needed to install .NET Framework 1.0 SP1. Which also wouldn't install and I got the same red X with a note telling me that the program is not supported on
 my machine.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your replies, but I've asked this question in my other two posts with no answer to my question, which again is:&nbsp;
<br />
Thanks again, Bill.<br />

            I also ran the scanner a few times, the short one and the longer scan, both came back clean.<br />
<br />
I also did a registry search for NET Framework 2.0 SP 1 &amp; 2, and neither showed up. So back to my bolded/underlined question above.<br />

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Optional Update Intel Graphics Driver dated 12-24 hangs to black screen .. unable to restore .. unable to repair</h2>
                    HP ENVY 15t-j quad core i5 .. 4600 .. windows &nbsp;8.1.
<div><b>After accepting an OPTIONAL UPDATE offered by Microsoft Update for an Intel Graphics Driver (dated 12-24) and clicking install, I turned around to be productive while waiting for the install/reboot to happen. &nbsp;Ten minutes later, I turned back around
 to see a black screen. &nbsp;Power light was ON, but nothing was happening. I waited another ten minutes, then stepped on the power button to shut it down. &nbsp;Upon pressing the power button again, the system seemed to try to boot, but did not make it to windows screen.
 &nbsp;Display was dark blue, then went totally black. &nbsp;Flashing fingerprint scanner &nbsp;prompted me to attempt to scan my finger. &nbsp;White light on finger scanner turned amber .. still nothing happening. &nbsp;</b></div>

            I went down this same path with an new HP Envy TS 15.
<div><br />
<div>Windows 8.1 was running fine and then I installed an optional driver update.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I could not do a restore point recover and a recovery reported the "Disk Locked". I tried command mode and was not able to identify with diskpart what was locked. In the end I reinstalled Windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The update to Windows 8.1 kept failing into a black screen. Some have got it to work by disabling wifi immediately after it says that it has completed downloading, but before it says it is preparing. I believe that updates are being applied during the
 install prep and this is allowing kb2903939 to be loaded (see below).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I got to 8.1 by using a windows 8.1 disk.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It appears to be a conflict between update kb2903939 and the graphic driver. If I'm in 8.1 and install 2903939 I immediately get a black screen - note everything appears to keep working as the box hibernates and restarts, but all with a black screen. If
 I then safe boot (power on and off multiple times) and remove kb2903939 then all is well.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The first time through though it took a L2 Windows tech to get the system recovered.</div>

            <div>TS15 was the model I had trouble with.</div>
<div><br />
After an hour with L1 support, who was following a totally mindless "trouble shooting" script, I was instructed to run a complete (4 hour) diagnostic, and was told that HP would call me back in four hours to check on my progress. &nbsp;<u><b>They did NOT call me
 as promised</b></u>. The full diagnostic showed no problems, and the phone NEVER rang, so after another hour of waiting for the phone to ring, I called HP back, gave them the open ticket number, and asked them why they did not call. &nbsp;I was told that they did
 call, but I did not answer. NOT TRUE, phone never rang, CLID showed no inbound calls. &nbsp;After verifying the phone numbers were correct, and after another 10 minute of fumbling around, I was told (confidentially)
<b><u>NEVER INSTALL 8.1. &nbsp;</u></b>&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I was then passed along to a "hardware supervisor", who had the authority to help me by sending a restore image on thumb drive. &nbsp;He made me repeat everything before "authorizing" the shipment of the restore image , and despite the model number and serial
 number being provided (thrice), he still tried to send me a DVD image. &nbsp;It took me several attempts to get him to understand that this TS15 had no optical drive. &nbsp;The image on thumb drive was to be shipped via Fed-Ex Priority 1, but it actually took two days
 to arrive.&nbsp;
<div>
<div><br />
<div>The restore image was installed and fixed the problem by returning the machine to its pristine, as purchased state,
<u><b>but the restore process instructions did NOT match the actual process.</b></u> &nbsp;Anyway, I got it running again, set up WiFi, turned off the 8.1 auto update, re-installed Norton, rolled back IE to version 10, re-installed Chrome, uninstalled some bloat
 ware, re-installed HP printer drivers and verified functionality. &nbsp;Then created a NEW restore point, and a NEW recovery USB drive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That (hopefully) will be the last time that I fall for a Microsoft "OPTIONAL" update. &nbsp;Hopefully, I will ignore Microsoft's optional update, and consult HP directly for more information regarding the update before pressing the GO button.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Live and learn. &nbsp;Thanks for you detailed reply.</div>

            Possibly for security reasons (users copying product codes . . . etc.), however since we do not need to know out product key in Windows 10 due to&nbsp;<span>a digital entitlement being stored on the

<h2>            renaming favorite&#8217;s folder in file explorer in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Renaming Favorites in Windows 10&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>My question is: <br />
How can I rename favorites in the windows 10 file explorer?<br />
And why on earth would the Microsoft Windows Developers be so unbelievably stupid and kill the feature of renaming the favorites in the file explorer? Seriously I can't wrap my head around this. It's as you completely ignored what users need or used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the favorite feature extensively, as many other users did as well. But now in Windows 10 you changed the logic.<br />
I have at least 15 Folders somewhere that are named 2016 and containt relevant information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>e.g.</p>
<p>Topic1\2015</p>
<p>Topic1\2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>Topic2\2015</p>
<p>Topic2\2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>and the list goes on for very long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I add now the "quick access" in the file explorer, it shows: 2016 , 2016 , 2016 , 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for completely screwing up the favorites functionality in Windows 10. I garantuee that this feature will be fixed within the next 2 years, therefor I can only applaud to so much lack in thinking ahead of what happens with your new logic
 you implemented regarding the quick access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>Lars</p>

            <p>Hi Pavan_N,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking time to answer. However I do not see that this generic answer is covering the problem I am talking about.<br />
<br />
Sorry for not being specific enough:<br />
I am talking about the Quickaccess Section within the Fileexplorer. <br />
So if you open the file explorer in the default you will see in the top left section the Quick Access for Folders/Links like "Desktop" ; "Downloads" ; "Documents" &amp; some more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Description of the problem in detail:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I browse through a network drive or my own computer drive, I can open a specific folder and then add this location to my quick access so it appears among the previously mentioned Quick Access Shortcuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7 and in Windows 8 these self-made quick access short cuts could be renamed as wished.<br />
However in Windows 10 it is not possible to rename these.<br />
<br />
Could you please explain to me why you would remove this feature?<br />
<br />
Thanks and best regards</p>
<p>Lars</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply! This is very helpful, at least I do not feel left alone with the problem anymore, I can see a lot of people complain about this shift in logic with the "pinned" items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I can't even give feedback they way you showed me, as my organization (company) is managing the data privacy aspect and therefor I can't change the option to allow my feedback to be sent to Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I can garantuee that MS Windows will change their logic in the next (hopefully) months so that you can rename pinned items. Anything else is just useless **** good for a big portion of users, but never for all, as renamable pinned down shortcuts
 are.</p>
<p>

            <p>Lars,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes. Including the ability to set a "friendly" name for the Pinned items would be very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Favorites links are stored in a shortcut file. But Quick Access does not use the .lnk file format, but stores the Pinned items listing in a single .AutomaticDestinations-ms file. The file structure for .AutomaticDestinations-ms is explained here:

<p>I'm trying to update from Windows 8 to 8.1.&nbsp; I've made sure all drivers were updated prior to updating.&nbsp; None of my drives are encrypted.&nbsp;The installation seems to go fine until I restart.&nbsp; I get the message that 8.1 could not be installed with the error
 code 0xC1900101-0xc0000017.&nbsp; It allows me to restart with Windows 8, but no update to 8.1 &nbsp;I've tried to update three times and get the same message each time.&nbsp; Does anyone know if Microsoft is actively addressing this problem?</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you've redeemed&nbsp;the bonus content for Halo: Reach and it showed up and was installed no problem but you're not able to use the Elite Officer armor in your multiplayer play?
 I recommend you visit the <a href="http://halo.bungie.net/projects/reach/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Halo Reach Community </a>and see if this is something that is known about or if there is any work around to get the content to show up in game. Are you able to play all of the multiplayer map packs that also came with the upgraded edition of Halo: Reach?? Let
 us know with a&nbsp; reply.</p>

 worked for them but it hasnt for me.

            <p>Things don't really work like that,</p>
<p>You can look at these links and if you want to Copy and Paste files into email messages or in forums like this you can use the same process,</p>
<p>But the files will have to be uploaded to skydrive or another file sharing site,</p>
<p><span>Refer to this thread on how to make a public folder and submit screen shot here,<br />

<h3> backfire101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Regediting in windows 7</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have been trying to delete some registry files through regedit (also tried shortcut, launch as admin) but everytime i try to either delete the entire file, or adjust its value i get the following errors:<br />
<br />
upon trying to delete:<br />
"Unable to delete all specified values"<br />
<br />
upon trying to delete its value:<br />
"Cannot edit &lt;filenamehere&gt;: Error writing value's new contents."<br />
<br />
I did not encounter these problems with my previous computer, running xp.<br />
Any ideas on how to get this sorted out?<br />
<br />
May i note these registryfiles are of not vital for windows to run.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.

<h3> mark3947387  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows won&#39;t start on SSD with virtualization enabled</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop running Windows 10 Home (Version&nbsp;10.0.15063 Build 15063) on an HDD.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of weeks ago I added an NVME SSD in a second bay and installed Windows 10 Home to that drive/partition, so I have a dual boot.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I upgraded the Product Key of the SSD partition to Windows 10 Education with the idea that my wife can use this partition to run VMs.&nbsp; The upgrade worked. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After enabling the Virtualization in the BIOS settings, the Windows 10 on the SSD fails to boot, referring me to the following log file : X:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt .&nbsp; Note that the "X:" drive for the failing Windows SSD instance is the
 same as the "C:" drive for the working Windows HDD instance.&nbsp; So I'm able to access this log file when I boot up to the instance of windows installed on the HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;SrtTrail.txt contains several successful entries but ends with this one:</p>
<p>------------------------------------------</p>
<div>Root cause found: <br />
---------------------------<br />
Boot critical file e:\efi\microsoft\boot\resources\custom\bootres.dll is corrupt.</div>
<div>
<p>Repair action: File repair<br />
Result: Failed. Error code =&nbsp; 0x2<br />
Time taken = 1906 ms</p>
<p>------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I disable virtualization in the BIOS the SSD instance of windows will boot and work fine (though the HyperV service won't start).&nbsp; If I enable virtualization the SSD instance of windows won't boot.&nbsp; The HDD instance of windows works either way.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - BIOS Version/Date "AMI F.17, 3/29/2018" on an HP ENVY x360 Convertible 15-bq1xx<br />
</p>
<p>I'm running in UEFI mode fi that matters.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: The failure to boot left some automatic updates hung.&nbsp; I disabled virtualization in the BIOS and ran windows update until everything was updated on the SSD version.&nbsp; The SSD is now&nbsp;Version&nbsp;10.0.17134 Build 17134.&nbsp; Again, the HDD Windows 10 will always
 boot.&nbsp; The SSD Windows 10 will only boot if I disable Virtualization in the BIOS.</p>

<p>X: drive is a RAM disk, created during Windows install, or if you boot from Windows install media. So it is not the same as your HDD Windows partition and will vanish if you restart before checking the log file referred to. It has a similar folder structure
 to the usual C: drive, as it is running Windows PE, or Windows RE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some changes that may be a factor between build 15063 and 17134. You might consider upgrading your HDD Windows to 17134 or wait a week or more and then upgrade both installs to version 1809 of Windows 10 (once they resolve the current issues with
 that version and it becomes available again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are any corrupt files on your system partition, you should be able to fix these by running:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bcdboot C:\Windows /v&nbsp;</strong>(/v just shows you some details while it runs)</p>
<p>
</p><p>and</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bootsect /nt60 SYS /force</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would do this while running Windows from the 17134 SSD, so that you are using a more recent version of Windows files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it may be worth checking if there is another BIOS update from HP, although your BIOS date is very recent.</p>

            If there are any corrupt files on either of your Windows partitions, you could try fixing it by running
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> from an Administrator Command Prompt.&nbsp; If errors are found but not repaired by sfc, there is a DISM command that might fix things.

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I encountered a similar problem after configuring the Windows Update service to run in its own svchost process via "sc config wuauserv type= own" (which I did for troubleshooting purposes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fix was simply to revert back to the default configuration:</p>
<p>"sc config wuauserv type= share".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem then went away following a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that&nbsp;wuauserv needs to interact with other services within the same svchost process (e.g. Background Intelligent Transfer Service).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jacob</p>
<p>

    <title>No speakers or headphones are plugged in. Problem on Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> snowydevo  say:</h3>
<h2>            No speakers or headphones are plugged in. Problem on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Recently, my computer started to get this problem where any form of audio—even external speakers—doesn't make any sounds. I only have one playback device shown:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a865f77c-010b-4d7b-92fb-b1004a9e21a1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a865f77c-010b-4d7b-92fb-b1004a9e21a1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>And yes, disabled devices and disconnected devices are shown. The programs I remember that might have something to do with the audio was AMD High Definition Audio Device and Conexant HD Audio. Since there's only one device, Conexant HD Audio is nowhere to
 be seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took a look around and saw the events for the device. The latest event saying "Device install required". I don't know what that means, but I assume that I have to install some other driver.</p>
<p>I almost never use the speaker so I doubt that the internal speaker is the problem. I always use earphones. Right now, when I use the earphones, it tends to not work too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the list of "solutions" that I have tried to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reinstall the audio drivers</li><li>Disabling the driver, restart, then enable back</li><li>Used CMD and entered various kinds of codes</li><li>Tried to update it, or roll back the update</li><li>Reinstall Windows 10</li><li>Factory Reset Windows 10</li></ul>
<p>Here is a list of things I did before that might've led to the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>I updated my graphics device</li><li>I unplugged my earphones the moment of shutdown</li><li>I carry my computer around my backpack (don't worry, I have a case)</li></ul>

<p>The OS build is 16299.248. The audio device seems to be working:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c63dea3-3797-4d97-838c-96bb62a870d5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c63dea3-3797-4d97-838c-96bb62a870d5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>For the rollback and update, I meant the driver update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the solution you referred to, it seems that it didn't have any effect. The playback device is still saying it's unplugged. Keep in mind, I'm a laptop user. There might be a possibility that the speakers are damaged. Even if they were damaged, the
 headphone jacks should still work regardless.</p>

<p>Thank you for letting me know. Upon researching, the AMD High Definition Device is only required audio when using an HDMI connection to an external display. It would be be best if you can also send us a screenshot of the devices listed on Sound, Video and
 Game Controllers in Device Manager. Meanwhile, check if there is a driver called IDT High Definition Audio Codec in your computer's Device Manager. If there is, try to uninstall it and reboot your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Skype account compromised, weird calls to Tunisia. Help&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielgothacked  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype account compromised, weird calls to Tunisia. Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So today I received 3 automatic emails from Skype:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e20e7698-c09f-43e4-81fb-a3b41cf5165c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e20e7698-c09f-43e4-81fb-a3b41cf5165c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I have not logged into Skype for a few weeks at least. I went to check out my account and it appeared that the account was restricted and needed to be recovered. So I proceeded to recover the account and looked into the Call history and Billing
 information and found that someone logged into my account and updated the details and made some weird phone calls all 2 minutes long to Tunisia (My name is Daniel and not Amy).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f31e6d2-f9d6-4149-bb93-9f489e970fc1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f31e6d2-f9d6-4149-bb93-9f489e970fc1?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e87382d6-0604-4f92-a976-971946c41034?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e87382d6-0604-4f92-a976-971946c41034?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It looked like they also uploaded a credit card onto the account as well and added Skype Credit of $25, which resulted in the emails being sent. I really want some further clarification into this. I have already spoken with a support person and they were
 only able to help me recover my account and tell me details about my account that I already know. Please if someone can tell me more about this so I can get some closure and confidence to ever use Skype again....</p>

            Hi Danielgothacked 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />If you are able to login to your account, the best way to protect your account in future is to change your password to a complex one containing big and small case letters, special characters and numbers with at least 10 characters. 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<h2>            Forza Horizon 3 download doesnt work</h2>
                    <p>I have been the last 4 days trying to download the game from the Windows Store. First when i already had 14G it got reseted i dont know why. Then after dowloading again around 8 Gigas it changed the total download size from 54G to the 106,2G that still tells
 me that i have to dowload. Most times that i start the download after have paused it, it says its downloading but doesnt do anything, it just says that its downloading and nothing more. The other times it finally wants to download it goes to pulls going up
 to 8 mbps and down to less than 1 mbps if it doesnt stops download.</p>

<h2>            Lenovo G500&#59; Slow boot &#38; It doesn&#39;t shut down complete.</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys, you have no idea how much stressed I am due to this issue with my laptop. I need your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched on Google tons of times, read a lot of threads on Lenovo forums, Microsoft, Toms Hardware and a lot of sites but I couldn't find a working solution.&nbsp;In most cases, most threads are left inactive without being solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My&nbsp;laptop has two issues;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When&nbsp;I shut down my laptop,&nbsp;the screen go off but the two&nbsp;white lights in front of the laptop remain on and the DVD&nbsp;rom opens as well, not sure if the fan is still on or not but most people said the fan remains on too in their threads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have to press the power button for 10 seconds to shut down the laptop completely after shutting it down before to turn these lights off and every other part of the laptop. It didn't happen before, its just happening all of a sudden and I hate it, I can't
 do this every time, I'm worried if the battery will die if I ever forget to press the button and leave my laptop after shutting down, where as it is still on with the blank screen only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When I turn my laptop ON using the power button, it boots extremely slow. You know that loading circle during the boot screen? It circles and then laptop comes to home screen. Sometimes that circle doesn't appear, its stuck at the starting message saying
 Lenovo and it won't boot. I've to turn it on and off 5-6 times&nbsp;to make it work, and finally that loading circle appears and laptop starts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have factory reset my laptop but that didn't help. I used an air blower to clean the dust from keyboard, fan, usb slots and&nbsp;everywhere but that didn't help either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is&nbsp;still new, I take care of it. I clean it, I don't use it roughly. I've asked solution for these issues on Lenovo forums, and other third party computer technician websites such as Tom's Hardware and etc but I&nbsp;wasn't even given a reply, can you
 imagine? I don't expect that from the Microsoft Community, so please help me.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Burning&#47;ripping cd&#39;s having problems with codecs on Media Player</h2>
                    <p>I had Windows 7 and had the problem before but now having Windows 10 and not many burner/rippers are compatible with Windows 10 I'm having to fix my Media Player to use it. It kept coming up saying "Windows Media Player cannot rip one or more of the tracks
 from the cd". It said that there was a problem in the codecs. After going through the prompts to try and fix the problem it said to go into "tools" and locate various things and I don't have a tools tab in my media player.</p>
<p>The media player was working fine then one day I went to rip a music disc and it started coming up with the message above. I haven't been able to use it for a year now and since downloaded MusicBee and was using it, but now the problem is MusicBee isn't
 compatible with Windows 10 and can no longer use that as much as I liked that over the Media player!!!
</p>
<p>So, anyone have any options for me?? I hope so!!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance everyone!!!!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Kerry,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community Forums!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to follow the below methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1:-</strong></span></p>
<p><span>You might be able to complete the rip by turning on error correction.</span></p>
<p><span>&gt; In Windows Media Player -&gt;press Alt tab -&gt;Click on Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Devices, click the CD burner, choose&gt; Advanced, and set the error correction to On.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:-</strong></span></p>
<p><span>There are two ways to change rip settings while in the Player Library. You can insert a CD into your CD drive and click
<span><strong>Rip settings</strong></span>, or you can click the <span><strong>Rip Music</strong></span> tab in the
<span><strong>Options</strong></span> dialog box. The Rip Music tab in the Options dialog box offers additional options that aren't available on the Rip settings menu.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To rip music from a CD, do the following:<br />
<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>For best results, make sure that you are connected to the Internet before you begin.</span></p>
<p><span>When your computer is connected to the Internet, the Player attempts to retrieve media information about the tracks being ripped from an online database. The Player then adds the information to the files during ripping.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that you can rip a CD when your computer isn't connected to the Internet. However, the Player won't be able to identify the name of the CD, the artist who created it, or the names of the songs until you go online.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Insert an audio CD into the CD drive.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>(Optional) If you want to select a different format (for example, MP3 instead of WMA) or bit rate (for example, 192 Kbps instead of 128 Kbps) for the files created during ripping, in the Player Library,
 click the <span><strong>Rip settings</strong></span> menu, and then click <span>
<strong>Format</strong></span> or <span><strong>Audio Quality</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>(Optional) If you don't want to rip every song, in the Player Library, clear the check boxes next to the songs you don't want to rip.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click the <span><strong>Rip CD</strong></span> button in Now Playing mode or
<span><strong>Rip CD</strong></span> in the Player Library to begin ripping.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope the information helps. Feel free to write to us for further assistance and we’ll be happy to help you.</span></p>
