<h2>            Print Screen not working&#59; Windows 8.1 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually use the print screen option at work and have found that it is no longer working; I usually press the Alt+PrtScn button. I am not interested in using the snipping tool or pasting into paint (or other programs); I want it to continue to print immediately
 after pressing the keys. This issue is across all of the computers at my work; I have tried shutting them all down and restarting and have gotten no further.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this not a function that is still able to be completed on windows 8.1 Pro? I haven't found anything useful online or on the message boards.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboards at work do not have physical F lock buttons either. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get this feature back in working order? Are there any settings that can be checked that I may be unaware of?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            My Contacts Groups are empty now</h2>
                    <p>Hi!<br />
<br />
Recently I noticed that my Contacts Groups in&nbsp;the Skype for&nbsp;Business&nbsp;app on my desktop have lost all members (except for my Favorites). However, my contacts
<em>do</em> show up in the web-based Outlook sidebar.<br />
<br />
I initially thought it was a fluke- maybe something having to do with the latest update- so yesterday I readded all my department contacts back to their respective groups. When I started the app up today, they were gone again. What should I do?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn’t work, I’d like to collect some detailed information as below for further investigation:</p>

<h2>            Microsoft USB TV Tuner Issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I'm having issues with the usb tv tuner.. all i get is a black screen when trying to watch any channels.</p>
<p>Process used so far &amp; fault finding</p>
<p>1. Everything is plugged in as it should be including coax aerial cable.</p>
<p>2. Have run the channel store and it picks up 145 channels</p>
<p>3. One guide shows all channels and also small pictures of what programs currently playing</p>
<p>4. When selecting a channel through One Guide screen goes black.</p>
<p>5. In settings removed HDMI tv connection and just had USB tuner</p>
<p>6. Changed Coax Arial Cable</p>
<p>7. Rebooted Xbox several times</p>
<p>8. Sometimes get the "Cannot find your tv please plug in your HDMI"</p>
<p>Is there a patch fix for this? or is it the tuner thats knackered?</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated</p>
<p>TP</p>

<h2>            USB 2.0 freezes computer</h2>
                    
<p>USB 2.0 devices hanging computer; USB 1 is&nbsp;OK.<br />
Fugitsu Siemens Amilo A1630 - 5 yrs old.</p>
<p>I'm having USB problems since I reformatted and re-installed Windows XP Home a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; Whenever I plug in&nbsp;any USB 2 device or hub, the computer just hangs.&nbsp; No blue screen or anything, just a total freeze.</p>
<p>USB 1 devices are all detected and work fine and if I use a USB 1 hub the USB 2 devices work.</p>
<p>There don't seem to be any new SiS 7001 drivers around, and I have updated all the other drivers that I can find.</p>
<p>If the device is plugged in during startup the boot just freezes.</p>
<p>I think this must be a dodgy file on my Fujitsu Siemens OEM XP disk as I get the same problem when booting from there on a clean install. I have tried slipstreaming this with SP3 - but this hasn't solved the problem either.</p>
<p>I've also tried making a BartPE boot disk but&nbsp;&nbsp;I had exactly the same problem - so it must be dragging the dodgy file from the i386 folder.</p>
<p>Can anyone think of any files within the i386 folder that might be causing this - or any other ideas about how to solve this?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Gary.</p>

<p>Is the system running a bit slow in general?&nbsp; Do programs open quickly?&nbsp; Can you browse the web without problems?&nbsp; Is anything else taking a long time (like startup or shutdown or absolutely anything)?</p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If that doesn't work, let's try a bit of maintenance:</span></span></span></p>
<span><span><span>
<div>
<p><span>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster software (or whatever it calls
 itself) no matter what it says (scans will tell you you have thousands of errors just to get you to download and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Most do nothing of value and some can do great harm (to the point where you need to do a clean install to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Vista keeps the registry clean on its own quite well and doesn’t need any help.<br />
<br />
To improve your speed and&nbsp;space, do Disk Cleanup using: </span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</span></a><span>.
 Delete as much as you feel comfortable doing – nothing deleted there will harm your system in any way. This includes deleting the Temporary Internet Files.&nbsp; If you want to keep this from building, go to Tools / Internet Options / Advanced and check the box
 Empty Temporary Internet Files Folder whenever browser is closed and then that folder will always stay empty (except when you're using the program).<br />
<br />
Also do an Optimization: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</span></a><span>.
 Do all of the options.</span></span></p>
<p><span>System Restore can take up to 15% of your partition's space but that can be reduced.&nbsp; It's a trade-off.&nbsp; The less space you allocate, the fewer restore points
 you will be able to retain - but many people reduce this to save some space while leaving enough to save 3-4 restore points at least (which is usually enough - until you need them).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76227-system-restore-disk-space.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76227-system-restore-disk-space.html</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup.&nbsp; That will probably be the majority of items there -
 if not most of them (some are needed like the AV program and Windows Defender but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient).&nbsp; This will free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster
 (though perhaps not so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup).<span>&nbsp;</span>When I did this on my system I removed over 90% of the entries and suffered no ill effects
 – to the contrary, I noticed startup was quicker, reponse times when working were better and I could open more programs at the same time and still have no problems, and shutdown was also faster.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Better still, download Autoruns<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</span></a><span>
 which is much superior to msconfig and click on the Everything tab and do what was suggested above (though here you can’t delete everything as with the start menu in msconfig because there are some very important files and services included which MUST not
 be deleted or it can cause serious harm to the system).<br />
<br />
You can accomplish some of these tasks (and more that aren't entirely related) by using</span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a><span>&nbsp;(which
 also searches for malware).&nbsp; I do this on a monthly basis just as a part of normal maintenance and I suggest you do the same (except for the registry cleaner – no not even Microsoft’s own product is entirely safe and the product has been removed from the paying
 marked for reasons unknown though it’s still available here for now but probably not for long).&nbsp; Make sure you select a full scan - it will take a few hours (mine can take around 5-6) but can work in the background so start it when it has enough time to complete.<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources).&nbsp; Windows Defender is a good AS program.&nbsp; The new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></a><span>&nbsp;is
 an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well.&nbsp; If you're using MSE, you don't really need Defender (but you would with any other AV program).&nbsp; I
 would also suggest downloading</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and running it monthly to catch anything that MSE/Defender might miss.<br />
<br />
If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast and clean a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>=======================================================================================================================</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't help, then download Process Explorer<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx</a>&nbsp;and
 let's see what's going on with your RAM and your memory to see if anything is eating up too much of it.&nbsp; If so, we may have found the cause and should be able to identify a solution.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.</span></span></p>

    <title>Mixer Tab - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> major angry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mixer Tab</h2>
                    <p>Seriously its about time that Microsoft allowed users the option to disable/hide this tab.&nbsp; Im not interested in Mixer and I feel that the Mixer tab does not help the performance of the dashboard which I feel is a slow laggy mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I game on the Xbox One X.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            If the suggestion to remove entire tabs makes it to an Idea Drive I will vote for sure. I had the Insider oopsie a while back where you could remove tabs. All I had was Home and Store and the entire UI was so much faster. Sadly this will never happen as
 it all makes money for MS.

            Hi Manjunath,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your reply.<br />
<br />
The "Internet Connection Troubleshooter" couldn't identify the problem.<br />
<br />
I have no problem in accessing internet from my web browser or other applications.<br />
<br />
When I select "Switch to Microsoft Account" in "change PC Settings", I will be asked for current password and microsoft account, Once I provide these information after a while it reports "Sorry, we couldn't connect to Microsoft services right now. If the problem
 persists, search for "network problems" on the Start screen".<br />
<br />
Even If I try to add a new Microsoft account / create a new microsoft account I face the same problem.<br />
<br />
As mentione, earlier I had registered my hotmail account, and later I switched to a local account.<br />
<br />
Now If I try to re-register the same account _or_ register a new account I am facing this problem.<br />
<br />
Any Windows app like Store, Mail, Messenger is blocked to due to this, If I add my old account back I will be able to use the apps.<br />
<br />
Please help me resolve this issue.<br />

            <p>I was having the same problem the last two weeks trying to setup an new account on my laptop for my son.&nbsp; Kept getting the message when trying to create an account that the laptop was not able to connect to Microsoft Services.&nbsp; In my case, the solution was
 to uninstall IE and then reinstall it.&nbsp; That resolved the problem and I can create new accounts on the machine again.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was on Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Below is a pointer to removing and re-installing IE.</p>

<h2>            Not able to download Brain Challenge game</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a game called&nbsp;<span> Brain Challenge, two weeks ago. It is still not available to download on my Xbox; it is a digital game so
</span><span>normally it should be available for download right away.
</span></p>
<p><span>I have an Xbox One;
</span><span>Brain Challenge is a 360 game but on the Microsoft site it said that it has backward compatibility with One.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I have already spent several hours trying to resolve this with Microsoft support; I tried live chat but they were not able to help me; I also asked Support to call me but they didn't.&nbsp; Very frustrating!</p>
<p>Can anybody help?</p>

<p>Hi! Looks like this game isn't playable on Xbox One as only a certain list of Xbox 360 games is available to play on Xbox One. See this link in order to find out which titles are supported:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xbox.com/xbox-one/backward-compatibility/available-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.xbox.com/xbox-one/backward-compatibility/available-games</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Nevermind! Just noticed that I'm wrong and this game is indeed supported. Did you try performing a hard reset?:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards you should be able to see and install the game.</p>

    <title>Awake From Hibernation Mode Using Keyboard Keys or Mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mloballer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Awake From Hibernation Mode Using Keyboard Keys or Mouse</h2>
                    So, I just got a new laptop, it seems in my settings, that windows by default will go into hibernate mode after 180 minutes, which is fine, however I am using my laptop as a desktop machine mainly, and it's inside&nbsp;a small compartment, and the only way
 to wake it is to try and barely open the lid and hit the power button. Is there any way to wake up from hibernation with the keyboard an mouse? Or should I turn hibernation off? (which I hear can ruin battery life). Let me know if you have any solutions, thanks.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot wake the computer from Hibernation Mode using the Keyboard or Mouse as you wake it from Sleep Mode because Sleep mode is a power saving state that is similar to pausing a DVD movie. All actions on the computer are stopped, any open documents and
 applications are put in memory while the computer goes into a low-power state. The computer technically stays on, but only uses a bit of power and you can quickly resume normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whereas, Hibernate Mode is very similar to sleep, but instead of saving your open documents and running applications to your RAM, it saves them to your hard disk. This allows your computer to turn off entirely, which means once your computer is in Hibernate
 mode, it uses zero power. Once the computer is powered back on, it will resume everything where you left off. So, you need to press the power button in order to wakeup your computer from hibernation mode as your computer is turned off; however, in Sleep Mode,
 your computer is power on so you are able to wake up your computer by pressing any keyboard button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

            Well from what I read online, it's not possible to wake a computer from hibernation on a laptop, my friend claims and I heard you can do it on a desktop machine. I am thinking of just turning off the hibernation, and leaving it only in sleep mode, this
 will not make the battery last as long, but at least I won't have the annoyance of having to turn it on and off all the time.

<p>thats what i mean btw&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>my issue is i&nbsp;<em>dont</em> want it to wake up from hibernate on mouse movements or keyboard, just from the powerbutton
</p>
<p>
</p><p>though from what i understand your friend seems to know make hibernate act more like sleep so they should know how to also undo this? basically my request for you to ask them to type the answer here&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>though in theory if it works for me to make it not wake up from hibernate (needs to wake up from sleep still) then logically there should be a way to&nbsp;<em>allow</em> it to wake your laptop up&nbsp;</p>

            Why not disable Hibernation instead? Open Settings, Power settings, Additional power settings on the right under Related settings. Then select Change plan settings, Change Advanced plan settings --bear with me MS doesn't make this easy--scroll down to
 Sleep and set Hibernation to NEVER. Save it. You can always use Hibernation by selecting manually&nbsp; if you add it the the Shutdown menu.&nbsp;

<h2>            Can&#39;t add clip to upload studio.</h2>
                    <p>I recently&nbsp;pieced together a bunch of clips and uploaded it with the intent of adding music. After I uploaded the base video to my Xbox and live, it won't let me add the clip back to upload studio.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>If I go the the clip directly and click edit, it opens the studio then says that something went wrong. That clip won't work. Pick a different one and try again.</p><p><br /></p><p>Then if I &nbsp;start from scratch in studio and go to add clip, it doesn't even show up. I made new clips and new creations to try to push it through but they are all available and the one I want still isn't.</p><p><br /></p><p>I can share it, and watch it. Upload studio just won't accept it again.</p><p><br /></p><p>Any fixes or wait for microsft?</p><p><br /></p>

<br />
6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span></p>

                    When I want to use my built in webcam ( Asus K52JB ) with some Metro Style Apps ( like Camera ... ) it doesn't recognize it but when I use some desktop apps its all Ok. I tried everything! I installed the latest driver from Asus , used Device Manager and
 nothing. When windows&nbsp;automatically search for driver , camera works but its upside down ( it works with Metro Apps but upsidedown ). Does anyone have a solution?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft Community. As I understand, you are facing issues with Camera app. I understand that it must be frustrating, but
 rest assured, we are here to help fix the issue and guide you in the right direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check if there are any updates for the Camera app and install them. To check for updates, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press <b>Windows key + W</b> on the keyboard.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type “<b>Check for updates</b>” without quotes.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>Check for updates</b> from the left pane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>Run the troubleshooter suggested by
<b>Steven</b> from the link and check if it helps:</p>
<p><b>Some or all of my Metro style apps fail to run</b>.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-winapps/some-or-all-of-my-metro-style-apps-fail-to-run/e89549cc-a369-4cf4-97f7-53040f6e037a">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-winapps/some-or-all-of-my-metro-style-apps-fail-to-run/e89549cc-a369-4cf4-97f7-53040f6e037a</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3</b>:</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to uninstall and re-install the camera software and drivers which came with the hardware. You may also try to install the drivers in compatibility
 mode:</p>

<p>b. Click on
<b>Properties</b>.</p>
<p>c. Click on
<b>Compatibility</b> tab.</p>
<p>d. Put a check mark on
<b>Run this program in compatibility mode for</b>.</p>
<p>e. Select
<b>Windows 7</b>.</p>
<p>f. Put a check mark on
<b>Run this program as an administrator</b> under <b>Privilege</b>
<b>Level</b>.</p>

            <p>A few days ago I re-installed Windows 8 from scratch; formatted the active partition and installed the OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 will install a generic driver for the webcam. This one worked in the Camera App, but the video image was flipped (upside down) however which I wasn't able to correct.</p>

            <p>I have this problem as well on a Fujitsu Stylistic Q550 tablet with&nbsp;both front- and rear-facing cameras. The default Windows drivers are dated 2006. The two camera's are listed in the device manager as "FJ Camera" (rear-facing) and "FJ Webcam" (front facing).
 Both of them are mirrored left to right, which is to be expected on a webcam, but the rear-facing camera's image is upside down while the front-facing camera's image is correct. I need a way to not only flip the rear-facing camera vertically, but also horizontally
 because this camera doesn't need to be mirrored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The default driver's work on both the Windows 8 Skype app and the Skype desktop application, but in the Fujitsu desktop utility made for Windows 7, the camera is only available if I update&nbsp;to the the Windows 7 drivers (version 5.2.x.x&nbsp;from Sonix). Updating
 the drivers makes the camera no longer available in Windows 8 apps, but the rear-facing camera is still flipped with the updated drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to get updated drivers directly from Sonix because Fujitsu only has Windows 7 drivers available for this tablet.&nbsp;Since the camera's are listed as "FJ Camera" and "FJ Webcam," I'm not sure which product on Sonix's website would correspond to these
 camera's, but that may not matter. I've looked through their product listings and don't see any with updated Windows 8 drivers anyway.</p>

            <blockquote>When I want to use my built in webcam ( Asus K52JB ) with some Metro Style Apps ( like Camera ... ) it doesn't recognize it but when I use some desktop apps its all Ok. I tried everything! I installed the latest driver from
 Asus , used Device Manager and nothing. When windows&nbsp;automatically search for driver , camera works but its upside down ( it works with Metro Apps but upsidedown ). Does anyone have a solution?
</blockquote>
<p><br />
I am also&nbsp; user of Windows 8 now for a month, I have the same Asus K52JB Laptop as mentioned above, the same problem with the Camera Metro App, but Skype works good with the Desktop App,&nbsp;now after looking for the Solution to the problem for almost a month,
 I figured maybe because the Camera is 480p &amp; Windows&nbsp;8 is Built for a touchscreen tablet with a webcam with 720p, Microsoft &amp; the webcam manufacturer may never find the solution for the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also just out of curiosity I tried to install the Webcam driver using the PID of the Device from the Device manager Menu, if we could install the Camera driver before Windows Directly installing the generic Driver then the registry editor show the Flip DWORD
 string with a value of 1, which is how the image is Flipped when it is observed by us or during a Skype call by the other person to whom we are chatting using Skype.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this is just a possible solution, if the windows 8 support team or anybody&nbsp;else finds a correct solution to the Asus K52JB webcam Please post it in one the Forums
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PC info:</p>

<br />
Four different bugchecks attached, all faulting memory corruption (could be a physical memory hardware issue or simply a device driver bug causing corruption).<br />
<br />
<b>CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION (109)</b><br />
<br />
This bugcheck is generated when the kernel detects that critical kernel code or<br />
<br />
1) A driver has inadvertently or deliberately modified critical kernel code<br />
&nbsp;or data. See http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/kernel/64bitPatching.mspx<br />
<br />
2) A developer attempted to set a normal kernel breakpoint using a kernel<br />
&nbsp;debugger that was not attached when the system was booted. Normal breakpoints,<br />
&nbsp;"bp", can only be set if the debugger is attached at boot time. Hardware<br />
&nbsp;breakpoints, "ba", can be set at any time.<br />
<br />
3) A hardware corruption occurred, e.g. failing RAM holding kernel code or data.<br />
<br />
<b>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (50)</b><br />
<br />
This indicates that invalid system memory has been referenced. <br />
<br />
Usual causes are a bug in a device driver, hardware related memory issues, corrupt NTFS volume, anti-virus software.<br />
<b><br />
IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (a)</b><br />
<br />
A kernel-mode driver or process attempted to access a protected memory location it does not have permission for, or a kernel interrupt request level (IRQL) attempted to access a memory address that is too high.
<br />
<br />
This bugcheck usually occurs when a driver uses an incorrect memory address. Other possible causes of this error include: bug in a device driver, system service, the BIOS, an old Anti-virus program or backup tool, or possibly memory issues.<br />
<br />
<b>KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (1e)</b><br />
<br />
This error typically indicates low disk space, a bug in a device driver or the system BIOS.<br />
<b><i><br />
I recommend the following</i></b>:<br />
<br />
Remove Norton with the removal tool~ <a href="https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/kb20080710133834EN_EndUserProfile_en_us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/kb20080710133834EN_EndUserProfile_en_us</a><br />
<br />
<b>If after removing Norton you're still crashing, please enable Driver Verifier~<br />
<br />
</b><br />
<p><font color="#ff0000"><u><b>Driver Verifier:</b></u></font></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>What is Driver Verifier?</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot
 driver issues. Windows kernel-mode components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver by flagging it and causing your system to BSOD.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point</p>
<p>Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point"
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"</p>
<p>2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"</p>
<p>3. Check the following boxes -</p>
<p>- Special Pool</p>
<p>- Pool Tracking</p>
<p>- Force IRQL Checking</p>
<p>- Deadlock Detection</p>
<p>- Security Checks (Windows 7)</p>
<p>- Concurrentcy Stress Test (Windows 8)</p>
<p>- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)</p>
<p>- Miscellaneous Checks</p>
<p>4. Select - "Select driver names from a list"</p>
<p>5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.</p>
<p>6. Check EVERY box that is <b>NOT</b> provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.</p>
<p>7. Click on Finish.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Restart.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.</p>
<p>- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated
 above, that will cause / force a BSOD.</p>
<p>If this happens, do [b]not[/b] panic, do the following:</p>
<p>- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.</p>
<p>- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.</p>
<p>- Choose the restore point you created earlier.</p>
<p>If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:</p>
<p>- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.</p>
<p>- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Restart and boot into normal Windows.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 36-48 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>They will be located in C:\Windows\Minidump</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Getting error code&#58; 0X81000037 while backing up my Windows 7 hard drive.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title: </strong><em>Error code: 0X81000037</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've never had a successful back up of my hard drive in Windows 7 and after 3 years I think it's time to figure out why. I get the error code 0X81000037.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Windows back up failed while trying to read from the shadow copy on one of the volumes being backed up. Please check in the event logs for any relevant errors.</p>
<p>When I entered the code into the MS site it gave me instructions on how to locate my junctions from the command prompt:
</p>
<p>DIR /AL /S</p>
<p>Then it gives me instructions on how to delete a mounted volume reparse point but there are 2 things wrong with that.
</p>
<p>1. They don't tell you how to figure out which junction to delete and</p>
<p>2. They don't tell you how to get to the "Mounted Volume Sample Properties" window that you're supposed to do this in.</p>
<p>Here's the URL see for yourself.&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/973455#bookmark-workaroundissue12</p>
<p>The event log said, "If the source or destination volume is on a disk (of course it's on a disk what else would it be on? My C: drive that I'm backing up is my internal drive and my G: drive I'm backing up is an external 500 GB WD.) run CHKDSK/R and retry
 the operation."</p>
<p>Anyway I'm going to run CHKDSK/R on both drives and hopefully by then someone will post a reply as to where I can find this mystery "Mounted Volume Sample Properties" window that the incomplete directions are talking about and maybe a clue as to which junction
 I'm supposed to delete.</p>

            <p>Yes - if you happen to have a WD drive their software is pretty reliable and usable and it is free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those that don't, here is what seems to be a good alternative:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you want a truly refreshing image backup experience consider at least the free version of Macrium Reflect:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.macrium.com/reflectfree.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.macrium.com/reflectfree.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Think about what you are going to do someday if your hard drives crashes or your system will not boot and you have to rely on the Microsoft backup/restore program and the help you might get from these Microsoft engaged alleged "experts" (not the same as
 the community volunteers who are the real experts).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then imagine the process of recovering your files or your entire system using software and tools from a company that actually specializes in backup/restore or using&nbsp; the tools that come from Microsoft.&nbsp; Which company do you think knows more about how things
 like backup/restore and system recovery should work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Imagine the support you will get from a company that actually specializes in backup/recovery software and that is all they do all day long.&nbsp; You've already seen the kind of support you get from Microsoft...&nbsp; No success, didn't work, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course you will get more features in the paid of Macrium version but even the free version is superior to anything Microsoft has to offer (backup/restore is not their business).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install and test drive the free version.&nbsp; If you don't like it, uninstall it.</p>
<p>Vroom! </p>

<h2>            Why are DLC achievements included in the normal game&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want Saints Row:&nbsp;The Third, but don't really care for the DLC's. But if I don't spend 4x the amount of money, then I'll get all of the possible achievements and it'll only say 60% or so. I'm a pretty big achievement hunter, so I'm torn.</p>

            <p>it's how it's always been on ps and Xbox it will separate the percentages when you click on the game into the main game and the subsequent dlc but from the main page it will as you say show 60% overall or something like that</p>

            <p>Ah, I remember when I used to 100% a game on the Xbox 360. Then they would add new DLC achievements and it would remove the game from my 100% completion list. That always annoyed me. Especially if I didn't want to buy the DLC.</p>

            <p>You would have to use a 3rd party site like trueachievements.com if you wanted to track game completions by base game vs game with DLC.&nbsp; In Xbox live land it only counts completions if you also finish all the DLC&nbsp;specific achievements in addition to main game... probably why i'll never finish 100% GTA&nbsp;IV... DLC... yuck</p>

            <p>I totally understand this. I am all about the % completion of achievements. Some of these back compat games have convinced me to buy DLC&nbsp;because of this, others haven't. Once that game gets lower and lower in my profile, I tend to think about it less.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 PC won&#39;t boot up into safe mode with networking, only - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgebeaumont  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 PC won&#39;t boot up into safe mode with networking, only normal safe mode.</h2>
                    My PC has been running quite slow as of recent and it's almost impossible to get through a virus scan without the virus scanner freezing and crashing. The only way I can run it is in safe mode with networking because the scanner needs a network to run.
 However everytime I try to boot my PC into safe mode with networking by pressing f5 it just goes straight into normal safe mode... I then tried the msconfig way and checked the box with networking underneath the boot up in safe mode. Yet again it still boots
 up into normal safe mode so I can't access the network in order to run the virus scanner. It's weird because the network works on Normal mode but my PC point blank refuses to enter safe mode with networking.

<p>Hello Coolma,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post. &nbsp;Since you have no start menu, your computer is likely in reduced functionality. &nbsp;If your version of Vista Ultimate is an OEM (preinstalled from the system manufacturer), it would be best for you to contact your system manufacturer
 in this regard.</p>
<p>You can also try the method below for phone activation:</p>
<p>Log into Vista, (you mentioned that you don't have a start button). &nbsp;Hit Ctrl + Alt + Delete &gt; Select 'Start Task Manager'<br />
Click 'File' &gt; Click 'New Task'<br />
Type <strong>explorer.exe</strong>&nbsp;and press [Enter]<br />
<em>This should return your start button<br />
<span><span><span>1. Click Start, then in the Search box type:&nbsp; slui.exe 4</span></span></span><span><span><br />
</span><span><span>2. Press Enter on your Keyboard</span></span><span><br />
</span><span><span>3. Select your Country.</span></span><span><br />
</span><span><span>4. Select the Phone Activation option, then call and hold for a real person.</span></span></span></em></p>
<p>If you version is either Full or Upgrade retail and the above information didn't resolve your issue, then try the following:</p>
<p><span>When you login to Vista, a window with several options will be available, select the option to open your Internet browser.<br />
<span><span>Type:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;into
 the browser address bar.<br />
A window will come up prompting to “Run” or “Save”, select “Run”<br />
When the MGA Diagnostic Tool starts running click the “Continue” button, when the diagnostics is complete click the “Copy” button.<br />
<span><span>Paste
 the report into a thread in the appropriate&nbsp;</span><a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/genuine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Windows
 Genuine Advantage</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;forum.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Please, in the future, delete all the above verbiage when asking a<br />
question. It has nothing to do with your question. And ask your<br />
questions in the body of the message, not in the title. The title<br />
should be used only for a brief description of what the question is<br />
about.</p>
<p>Are you running any of the following?</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Essentials<br />
AVG<br />
Norton<br />
McAfee</p>
<p>If so, they turn off Windows Defender because Defender does the same<br />
things they do. You don't want to have both running, since doing so<br />
will slow down your computer and create the potential for problems as<br />
they interfere with each other.</p>

<p>Along with Ken's very valid points, I just want to confirm that Windows Defender will not show an icon. &nbsp;This is because it is integrated into the Action Center, which already has an icon -- it's the one that looks like a flag.</p>
<p>However, if you install <a href="http://microsoft.com/security_essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Security Essentials</a> (and I highly recommended that you do so if you don't already have an AntiVirus program), Windows Defender will be automatically disabled because
 MSE provides the same protection (and receives updates from the same source). &nbsp;However, MSE provides that added security of AntiVirus (Windows Defender does not protect against viruses). &nbsp;In addition, MSE also integrates into the Action Center - and can be
 configured to show its own icon in the Taskbar at your preference.</p>
