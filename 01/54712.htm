<h2>            prepaid cards not working</h2>
                    
<p>Since Christmas I have been calling in to customer support because my son has a 142 worth of prepaid dollars on his account and we keep getting the error to contact our financial institue. But first of all the cards that are listed are find and he has 142
 worth of funds available. I have still not heard back from anyone and half the people that I talk to there say they have not heard of this error and that someone will email me back yet I have heard nothing. I have filed an online bbb complaint which I suggest
 that everyone should be doing. it is insane we all have funds that we have avilable &nbsp;an unable to use and the company is basically holding our money hostage. The one rep there sent me a code for a free years worth of gold membership and a free game for xbox
 one. I told her I dont need free stuff I just want my son to be able to use the money he got fro Christmas. There is no idea when this will be resolved and I have had several of my complaints escalated and still have heard nothing also the company has not
 even ackknowledged the issue by putting anything on the website so something needs to be done. Tomorrow I will be on the phone blowing up the phone lines to the corporate office until they get tired of me and get me some answers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My son has had many pre paid cards entered in on his accounts and he isn't getting credit for them and when we try again they say they have been used. &nbsp;But they do not show up in his account. &nbsp;He has like $200.00 we have lost. &nbsp;Isn't there a way you guys
 on your end can receive the codes from me and tell me where the heck they went. &nbsp;This is frustrating when anything to do with xbox is not cheap. &nbsp;Please Help</p>

<p>Op did you but the same region prepaid cards like us for us or Canada for us ?</p>
<p>If you purchased us currency and have an canadian account that would be why</p>
<p>Currency is region locked</p>
<p>You would have to have the same region account as the currency FYI</p>
<p>You may consider checking commerce.Microsoft.com to see your account region and the region of the currency</p>
<p>Creditcards may not be always used by all etailers especially prepaid cards like Walmart ones etc because they don't support renewable payment or online transactions</p>
<p>Usually the type of card is the culprit</p>

<h2>            Intel Graphics Media Accelerator Driver for Mobile Update</h2>
                    I have the Windows 7 RC, and when i updated the video drivers (per the request of Windows Update) everything went screwy. During the intallation, the screen randomly switched between 1280x800 and 800x600. After I rebooted, I get random switches between
 the Win 7 gui and Aero Basic (what you get when your computer can't really run Vista). Any help would be great, as this gets very annoying. Computer Specs are as follows

<p>Hi, go to Intel and get the drivers manually. Also turn off Driver updates as they are always old since MS is<br />
far behind certifying drivers.<br />

            Thanks for your reply. The driver used to be installed because I could use the internet fine, but then it stopped working. So should I just take my laptop into a store and get them to fix it or can I download the ethernet driver online from the PC makers
 website.&nbsp;

<div>I'm sorry, but I'm not very tech savvy so if you could explain it in lamest term that would be great.</div>

    <title>Strange Red Lines on Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pobsuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange Red Lines on Screen</h2>
                    
<p>I did a search and could not find anything on this, so apologies if someone has already asked about this.<br />
<br />
I have an ACER Aspire 5630, Intel Core 2 T5500 @ 1.66GHz 1.67GHz running MS Vista Home Premium 32-bit.<br />
<br />
A couple of weeks ago I notice that I was getting strange red lines appearing randomly on my desktop. They would appear on the taskbar, on pictures I was viewing both in IE and in picture viewers, and also occasionally when I was turning my laptop off I would
 get a full screen of them for a second. I have searching the net and found conflicting reports so I am now confused. Has anyone come across this before? Is this a software issues, hardware issue or OS problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any and all help.</p>

<p>Hello PobsUK,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I would see if there is an updated driver/software for your video card and chipset. Go to Acer.com under support, download your drivers from there only. If this updated driver doesn't fix&nbsp;it, then&nbsp;it is&nbsp;a hardware issue. Hope this helps you. Let us know either
 way. Make it a great day!<br />

    <title>Finalize a CD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aftershock911  say:</h3>
<h2>            Finalize a CD</h2>
                    OK i understand when you add files to a CD windows does not FINALIZE the the disc, it will close the session.
<br />
This is not what I want!!!<br />
I want to FINALIZE a disk after I write MP3 files to it, so that no more data can be added later.
<br />
These discs will beused in a BOSE Auto CD player and MUST be finalized not just closed.
<br />
Please can anyone explain how to do this on vista home premium??<br />

            Is it possible that you creating a Data CD (for the purpose of adding more files than you can on a Music CD) and<br />
is it also&nbsp;possible that your CD Player is not compatible with MP3 files (many are not)?<br />
<br />
Maybe the following article will help you to create a Music CD that will play in your CD Player.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Desktop System Hangs after Resuming from Sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m-hop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Desktop System Hangs after Resuming from Sleep</h2>
                    <p>Background:&nbsp; I build and maintain my own PCs, including the one with the issue, and have worked on PCs&nbsp;&nbsp;as a hobby for over 20 years (not sure why now!).&nbsp; The&nbsp;desktop system worked flawlessly under Win 7, 8 and 10 until recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was getting mysterious
 and intermitent disk read errors when booting to my Windows boot SSD. (Samsung EVO 540Gb) &nbsp; Afer much sluething (hours)&nbsp;I found the issue.&nbsp; The Corsair 750D case housing the drives has 4&nbsp;slide in drive adapters and they&nbsp;have&nbsp;an issue with SSDs.&nbsp; The SSD attached
 to the Corsair&nbsp; drive adapter&nbsp;cradle did not appear to sit properly in the Corsair docking port (there is a separate &nbsp;backplane the drives attach to) and as&nbsp; a result was getting these intermittent disk read errors and&nbsp;unable to boot as a result.&nbsp; The slide
 in cradles have no issue with platter drives.&nbsp; I had to run Checkdisk to&nbsp;repair the&nbsp;disk.&nbsp; &nbsp;AS a result of this case issue, &nbsp;I&nbsp;switched this SSD boot drive directly to another separate&nbsp;Gigabyte GSATA2 controller on the board and it resolved the disk&nbsp;read issues
 and system always boots into Win 10 with no issues.&nbsp; BTW, Gigabyte EX58-UD5 board.&nbsp; Latest Bios and runnng ACHI.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue:&nbsp; After switching the SSD hard drive with a platter drive and moving the SSD to a different controller I started to have this issue.&nbsp; After&nbsp;moving mouse and system&nbsp;resuming from sleep, the system hangs or screen is black.&nbsp; I do get the Win sign on
 screen but both the mouse and keyboard stop functioning and only a hard reset works. I notice that the internet symbol on the sign in screen may occasssionally have an error symbol when the system hangs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Diagnotics to date:</p>
<p>I am running and updated to the very latest build version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>Updated to latest ATI&nbsp;video drivers.</p>
<p>Changed various power schemes including leaving disks on.&nbsp; Also ran power diagnostics with no results.</p>
<p>Ran System file checker (SFC)&nbsp;and no issue.</p>
<p>Checkdisk is fine.</p>
<p>Checked that mouse and keyboard drivers are fine.&nbsp; Also checked that they can turn on system in device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, the system worked flawlessly until I had to move the SSD boot drive to a different controller.&nbsp; The system functions fine now with the exception of the sleep issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I run a diagnostics to determine the offending driver or device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>More Info.:&nbsp; Running Acronis True Image 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried just about every&nbsp;thread available on this topic and other forums.&nbsp; Any suggestions are welcome.</p>
<p>

            Hello,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sorry for the inconvenience caused, I will assist you with this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since you have tried all the troubleshooting steps for black screen problem and system hangs, you have also mentioned that the SSD was working fine when using with different controller, From your description it seems that the Controller of the Corsair
 750D is not working properly, Just to confirm it is the controller you may connect the SSD directly to the motherboard through the SATA cable and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the information helps. Do reply if you need further assistance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion and I did move it back to the other controller and it works again, including sleep mode!&nbsp; For how long I am not sure.&nbsp; The issue is unexplained in a sense that it works great, but is subject to connectivity issues. I am thinking
 of buying another case from Corsair that doesn't rely upon a intermediate backplane to plug in the drives and instead plugs them directly into the board via SATA cables.</p>
<p>

    <title>Samsung Settings for Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lucasvin92  say:</h3>
<h2>            Samsung Settings for Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My Samsung Ativ Book 6 came with Windows 8 but I've now decided to make a fresh Windows 8.1 install.</div>
<div>Samsung tells its users to use the SW Update software to install the drivers for my notebook model. It did installed all the drivers I needed with SW Update.</div>
<div>However, it didn't installed "Samsung Settings", wich I was using in Windows 8. It's the software the notebook needs to properly answer to the Fn keys. Without it, I can't change the screen brightness, light up the keyboard backlight, etc.</div>
<div>I can't find any link or button in SW Update to install Samsung Settings. Is there Samsung Settings for Win 8.1 at all? If there is, I really need it. Samsung support didn't helped me about that when I asked, I'm somewhat disappointed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help is apreciated.</div>
                </div>

            <p>I'm not sure if this will work for you... Your Mileage May Vary, but...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just upgraded to Windows 10, and had the same issue, I was unable to install Samsung Easy Settings on my Series 7 laptop, so no Fn+Keys working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Technical Explanation:</p>
<p>So what I have been able to determine is that the only reason it won't run in Win10 (and probably 8/8.1 as well) is that the digital signature was revoked by Samsung. Huh??? Windows won't run it&nbsp;because the signature is invalid. The solution was to strip
 the signature from the .exe file, and then it ran!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how I ended up working around it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Download the Easy Settings app from Samsung (It came in a .zip file for me) and extract it</p>
<p>2. Download FileUnsigner (<a href="http://www.fluxbytes.com/software-releases/fileunsigner-v1-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.fluxbytes.com/software-releases/fileunsigner-v1-0/</a> - or Google it... with Bing!) and extract the executable</p>
<p>3. Drag the setup.exe from the Easy Settings folder onto FileUnsigner.exe. You should see a message saying success.</p>
<p>4. Windows UAC will now NOT complain, but guess what... Windows 10 now says Easy Settings is incompatible and will still refuse to run it!</p>
<p>5. Rename setup.exe to anything else (setup2.exe worked for me)</p>
<p>6. Run setup2.exe, install as usual.</p>
<p>7. When Setup is complete, browse to the install location (C:\Program Files (x86)\Samsung\Easy Settings for me)</p>
<p>8. Move ControlCenter.exe to your desktop (or anywhere you have write-permission)</p>
<p>9. Remove invalid signature from ControlCenter.exe by dragging that onto FileUnsigner.exe</p>
<p>10. Move ControlCenter.exe back to the install directory</p>
<p>11. Right-click ControlCenter.exe, go to Compatibility, and set compatibility mode for Windows 7</p>
<p>12. Run ControlCenter.exe. You should have a working Easy Settings app and working Fn+Keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: You may need to enable sideloading of&nbsp;apps for this to work. I had already done that, so I don't know if it affects the process or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, Samsung will get their act together soon so we can have a working, properly signed settings app for our shiny laptops, without having to jump through all these hoops...</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT (2015-12):</p>
<p>Windows 10, version 1511 has been released, and is actively removing Samsung's Easy Settings during the upgrade. I found that i could reinstall it afterwards just by renaming the installer .exe from Setup.exe to SomethingElse.exe, and it installed just fine.
 However, Nothing Worked™ and i had to do more digging. So far i have some of the hotkeys back to working, but no Easy Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Samsung is adamant that this laptop doesn't support Win10, and MS is adamant that everything runs Win10. My attempts to contact Samsung just result in replies that drivers dont work in 10, and links to newer laptops that are officially supported.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm so fed up with their lack of interest that I'm currently reverse engineering their hotkey program to make one that works, and so far what I've found is that they are just too lazy to change a few things and recompile it to work in 10. All to try to sell
 me an "upgrade" to a perfectly good laptop.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am looking for a wildcard to search folder names which start with numeric value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried [1-9]* &nbsp; but it lists all folders that has number in its name. &nbsp;But my requirement is to list only the folders start with number.</p>

            <p>We don't have that exactly, but we have the two periods symbol for "search from x to y" where x and y&nbsp;are text of any kind.&nbsp; Try:</p>
<p>type:"file folder" name:0..a -name:=a</p>
<p>
</p><p>By specifying 0..a, we capture all filenames that start with 9, because the character "a" is what is considered immediately greater than 9 by Windows 7 Search.&nbsp; To remove matching filenames "a", the minus name:=a is used.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We're currently working to resolve the issue as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the meantime, continue using your local account. Logging in with your local Windows account will still make your system secure. You can access other Microsoft Online assets such Outlook.com, One Drive, etc. You may try to reattach your Microsoft Account
 as a connected account at a later time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your patience and understanding on this matter. Feel free to post back if you have any concerns.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

    <title>Xbox Slim Ring of Death - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Slim Ring of Death</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>Bin noch neu hier und hätte mal eine Frage. Meine Xbox 360 Slim hat vor einiger Zeit seinen Geist aufgegeben. Ich habe gespielt und plötzlich wurde der Ring der Xbox rot und das Bild war weg. Bis heute ist das so, wenn ich sie einschalte, kommt kein Bild
 und der Ring is rot. Nun habe ich gelesen, dass die Slim eine Schutzvorkehrung gegen das überhitzen hat, welches in Form von einer Warnung an der Spieler und Ausschalten der Konsole besteht. Das ganze war bei mir jedoch nicht der Fall, ich wurde nicht gewarnt
 oder sonstiges. Das ganze ist zu meinem Glück auch noch 1 Monat nach dem Ende der Garantie passiert. Ich habe heute den Kundendienst angerufen und wollte für meine fehlerhafte( keine Schutzvorkehrung) Xbox entschädigt werden. Lieder schien das dieser Dame
 nicht so selbstverständlich, wie man annehmen sollte, wenn ich ein Gerät mit einem solchen Defekt kaufe möchte ich auch dementsprechend entschädigt werden. Mir wurde lediglich eine Reparatur von ca. 100 € angeboten und klargestellt, dass ich diesen Vorfall
 nicht beweisen könnte, nur weil ich mich beim spielen nicht filme. Man sagte mir ich habe die Warnung einfach ignoriert xD. Wie sollte ich mit dieser ABZOCKE umgehen? Hat jemand eine Idee?</p>

            <p>Puh.....gute Frage....die dir keiner wirklich beantworten sollte oder kann....weil es schon in den rechtlichen Bereich reingeht.</p>
<p>Am besten versuchst du es bei einem anderen Supporter nochmals und hoffst bei diesem auf mehr Kulanz.</p>
<p>Aber mehr als Kulanz - also dem freundlichen Entgegenkommen von Microsoft - kannst du nicht machen, da du nachweisen müsstest, das die Warnung wirklich kam und du diese nicht ignoriert hast.</p>
<p>Dafür bräuchtest du einen Anwalt, einen Gutachter und und und.....</p>
<p>Wenn Microsoft dir nicht entgegenkommen will.....dann kannst du nur die Konsole als Bastelgegenstand versuchen zu verkaufen und dir eine neue kaufen (in meinen Augen).</p>

<p>Danke für die Antwort</p>
<p>Ja das hab ich mir auch schon gedacht, aber wie muss so ein Fall aussehen, indem ich dass sicher beweisen kann und wie realistisch ist es, dass ich mich z.B. immer beim spielen filme oder sonstiges.
</p>
<p>Aber ich werde es zunächst vermutlich erst per Anruf beim Support versuchen. </p>

<p>[quote user="Michi 12345678"] Ich habe gespielt und plötzlich wurde der Ring der Xbox rot und das Bild war weg.[/quote]</p>
<p>Wie genau war der Ring rot? Die Xbox hat verschiedene Ring-Codes. Welche der 4 Segmente haben geblinkt (oder hast Du ein E Modell was keinen Ring of Light mehr hat)? Und gibt es ein Blink-Muster? Beispielsweise 3 mal blinken, kurze Pause 2 mal blinken, kurze
 Pause, 3 mal blinken?</p>
<p>[quote user="Michi 12345678"] Nun habe ich gelesen, dass die Slim eine Schutzvorkehrung gegen das überhitzen hat, welches in Form von einer Warnung an der Spieler und Ausschalten der Konsole besteht.[/quote]</p>
<p>Richtig. Wenn es der Konsole wirklich zu warm sein sollte, blinken 2 Segmente auf dem Ring of Light rot, und ein Bildschirmhinweis gibt an, dass Du die Konsole im Moment nicht verwenden kannst, bis sie abgekühlt ist.
</p>
<p>[quote user="Michi 12345678"]Das ganze ist zu meinem Glück auch noch 1 Monat nach dem Ende der Garantie passiert.[/quote]</p>
<p>Dann hast Du aber Glück, dass Du zwei Jahre gesetzliche Gewährleistung hast. Microsoft gibt Dir eine einjährige FREIWILLIGE Garantie. Und diese Garantiebedinungen kann Microsoft sich so zurechtlegen wie es ihnen passt.</p>
<p>Du als Kunde hast aber gegenüber DEM VERKÄUFER (also dem Geschäft wo Du die Konsole gekauft hast) zwei Jahre gesetzliche Gewährleistung. Und die ist gesetzlich geregelt und kann vom Geschäft nicht verhandelt werden (nicht so wie die Garantie bei Microsoft).</p>
<p>Wende Dich also an das Geschäft, dass die Dir Deine Konsole reparieren/ersetzen.

<p>Danke für die Nachrichten! &nbsp;Es lief folgendermaßen:</p>
<p>1. Es war so: habe gespielt --&gt; bild weg und der Ring, als auch der punkt in der Mitte war rot.</p>
<p>jetzt ist es so: wenn ich die Konsole einschalte, ist der Ring und der Punkt grün, aber nur für 1-2 Sekunden, dann wird er rot, das Netzteil ist grün wie ich grad festgestellt habe( dachte es wäre auch</p>
<p>rot)</p>
<p>2. Hab meine Xbox bei amazon gekauft und ich meinte, dass die Garantie, die Amazon mir gegeben hat erloschen ist. Gekauft habe ich sie an Weihnachten 2012. Kaputt gegangen ist sie Januar 2015 :(</p>

    <title>Wrong language files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> immasecrettoyou  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong language files</h2>
                    Hey guys... So I bought Dishonored today on the online marketplace and downloaded it. I own my XBox for about a year now and set it to German (my first language) at first. But because I want my games english (better voice acting etc.), I set it to English
 about a month ago. Dishonored was ready, I started it - and it's french. There's no way to change the ingame language. Apparently, the game files are overwritten with the french game files. Reinstalling didn't help. Does anybody know what I can do to enjoy
 my game in English or German (preferrably English)?

<p>Hey there ImmaSecret,<br />
<br />
Apologies for the delayed response. Sorry to hear you're having issues with Dishonored.<br />
<br />
The language of the games you download is determined by the account region that you're set to rather than the language of your console.<br />
<br />
We're currently experiencing a <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Marketplace outage</a> that is making some content not show up or not download for some people so I cannot find that game on the Marketplace right now to double check.<br />
<br />
There are a couple questions that will help us narrow down where the error may have occurred:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>What is your account region set to? </li><li>What is your physical location? </li><li>Have you downloaded games in English before? </li><li>When you search in Dishonored, do you see any language packs? </li><li>Many multi-lingual countries include different language packs to patch in the dialogue in that language.
</li></ol>
<p><br />
<br />
Please let us know and we'll go from there.</p>

    <title>XBox 360 Slim Clean Disk Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yoshib1  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox 360 Slim Clean Disk Error</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>Recently I've notice that I get the clean disk error alot now when playing brand new games. I've only had this console for about 6 months. It does it with almost every game. I am going to take it back to the shop and have it exchanged or returned to Microsoft
 but before I do can anyone tell me if there is a way to fix it?&nbsp;If not then can anyone tell me a way to backup my saved games on the HDD because I really don't fancy playing them from the beginning again? Also can I use a standard lens cleaner in the Xbox
 or does it have to be Xbox specific if there is one?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>also you can save your game saves to xbox cloud storage if you have xbox live gold.</p>
<p>Set up cloud storage for saved games</p>
<p>To use cloud storage for your saved games, you need:</p>
<p>xbox live gold</p>
<p>A console connected to Xbox LIVE</p>
<p>514 megabytes (MB) of storage space on your console (local cache)</p>
<p>Step 1: Turn on Cloud Saved Games (for a console)</p>
<p>From the Xbox Dashboard, go to Settings, and then select System.</p>

            You shouldn't assume that everyone here will know what "JW Library" refers to, or what posts you might have already seen.&nbsp; After looking it up, I assume you're referring to
<strong><a href="https://www.jw.org/en/online-help/jw-library/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a></strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you look at the app's page in the Windows Store, you'll see that the developer is aware of the problem and has suggested a few solutions.&nbsp;

    <title>My skype account was BLOCKED - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> victoria affalliance  say:</h3>
<h2>            My skype account was BLOCKED</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello, </p>
<p>My account v*******@a************.n** was BLOCKED. I did not do anything that violated your rules. Please help me.</p>
<p>I contacted support several times, they did not manage to tell me the exact reason.
</p>
<p>I got the email from Anjanette - from Microsoft Online Safety team, with such text - Microsoft disabled access to the account due to a serious violation of the Microsoft Services Agreement.
</p>
<p>Also i filled the recovery form several times, I filled out all the fields with the info that only i can have and only i have access to. Although i filled all the necessary information in recovery forms, i was still blocked.
</p>
<p>And my account is blocked till now.</p>
<p>How is it possible that it is not enough to unblock me ? </p>
<p>I want to verify that i am the owner of the account and i want to retrieve the access to my account. And nobody else did not use my account, cause I’m the only one user and I used the same device to log into skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The support guy told me that your system blocks me , but i do not understand why?
</p>
<p>And nobody explains me it. </p>
<p>I was suggested to create a new account, but who can guarantee me that my skype id will not be blocked again without REASON.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want <span>&nbsp;</span>face the same problem again, who from your team can explain me and tell in details
<span>&nbsp;</span>what is going on and for what particular reason i was blocked ?</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>what is going on and for what particular reason i was blocked ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope I can rely on you. </p>
<p>I tried to be loyal, but it not fair that I’m blocked without explanation. </p>
<p>Please share me the full and detailed info why I was blocked, what particular actions were considered as violation, are there any guarantees that I won’t be blocked again, please explain it to me.
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Please provide me the examples of my actions that your system considered as violation of your rules?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Please help me to solve this issue, in order not to face it again. </p>
<p>Best regards, </p>
<p>Victoria </p>
