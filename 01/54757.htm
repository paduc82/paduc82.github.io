<h2>            HP support assistant is not working most of the day</h2>
                    <strong>I have an HP Pavilion g7 with Windows 8. I tried to use the HP Support Assistant and it is not working. I get the message "HP Support Assistant has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the
 problem and notify you if a solution is found".&nbsp; Can someone help me as to what this means? Do I have to wait this long to get a message or have it work.? It has been about six hours or so already and I am concerned that something serious is wrong. One more
 thing .... do I have to leave the computer on? I would appreciate any help with this. Thanks in advance.</strong>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Since it is an HP Program check with HP Support, their on-line documentation, diagnostics,<br />
and ask in their forums about any known issues.<br />

<h3> alfredoqw  say:</h3>
<h2>            I don&#39;t want to update windows 10, how do I avoid the option to turn off&#63;</h2>
                    My problem is that a few days ago Windows 10 forced me to update it because the update message did not stop and it did not let me do anything, so I ended up accepting the update.<br />
After doing this the start became very slow, it took a long time to turn on and every time an application opened it was also slow to open, among other problems of instability that the update brought me.<br />
How did I know what the update was? Because this started to happen right after I updated the computer, and because just today I restored the system to a point before the update and as if by magic the computer stopped being slow and I could work with it all
 day. But now I want to turn it off and again he wants to force me to update to that unstable version that gave me so many problems. It does not give me the option to just turn off the computer, it only gives me the option to update and turn off. And I know
 it's only a matter of time before the system starts to bother me again with constant updates.<br />
I know I can only turn off the computer directly from the shutdown button, but that will damage the PC in a short time. So it is not an option.<br />
In short, I do not want the update that Windows 10 wants to force me again, there must be a method to deactivate the updates as in previous versions of windows, but it seems that in Windows 10 either did not include that option or hid it very well.<br />
Is there a method in which I can permanently disable the updates and only update when I am sure that the update in question will be stable? and when I decide that I want to update? as in previous versions of windows?

            Hi Alfredo,
<br />For a possible solution to your problem please read this article. There are methods for you to better manage Windows updates, even to prevent them.

            There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<h2>            Drivers for Surface Go</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a Surface Go from the store, and I wanted to format it and install it using USB.&nbsp;<br />
Installation went fine, but I'm now currently stuck without the drivers needed. (E.g. Wi-fi).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot find the drivers anywhere on the net. Can someone please provide me with information as to where I can get them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This page is the closest I've come, but it does not provide drivers for the Go model.</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023482/surface-download-drivers-and-firmware-for-surface</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply need a zip file with the drivers included so I can extract and install from device manager. The drivers for the other surface models does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
I went to look up device and vendor ID, and found out it was a Qualcomm Atheros device. Went to their driver download page and located the correct one. Downloaded the zip, extracted and installed. Problem solved.</p>

            Thanks, Barb.&nbsp;<br />
However as the Surface Go comes in a Windows S mode, msi installations won't work until you're out of the mode. For some reason I do not get that option, but as I got the network working I no longer need to add the rest of the drivers. Windows update took care
 of the rest :)

<p>I have no bonus points added to the score when solving a normal Klondike game. In the settings, the timer is turned on and the scoring is&nbsp;Standard. Soltire Collection's Help states that bonus points is 700,000 divided by the total game in seconds. It was
 also&nbsp;a behaviour of&nbsp;Solitaire in older&nbsp;Windows versions. Just to note - this is not about daily challenges.</p>

<h2>            One Missing Folder &#40;File&#41; on External HDD Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a file missing from my External HDD.</p>
<p>It does not show up when the others do.</p>
<p>When it is searched for it is found but it say it is 'unavailable'.</p>
<p>Then when i try and play a file in the folder with VLC play i get '(Bad file Descriptor)'<br />
</p>
<p>All the data is there, its just this first folder that seem to have got corrupted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the recent past i did set it up for sharing so could access it down stairs on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone through all the obvious i think to try and find it, like</p>
<p>
</p><p>'view' then 'show hidden folders'</p>
<p>and&nbsp;</p>
<p>a the usual searches on the internet, that usually take me to a file recovery software, but there not deleted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data is there its just the very first folder that seem to have gone wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can help!</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Kiran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file I cannot open is properly called a 'Folder' I guess. Just a normal yellow one that are everywhere in Windows.</p>
<p>Just ran the 'bad sectors'check and there's nothing wrong with the HDD itself no bad sectors found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's no longer visible on the external hard disc, &nbsp;but when I have run a recovery software on it, all the files that are in the folder are still there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you think I should do next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Simon</p>

            <p>They are thumbnail files that are paired with .avi video files of the same name.</p>
<p>They usually are created by a camera taking videos. They also contain information about the camera taking the picture.</p>
<p>The thumbnail&nbsp;can be opened by any program that can open a jpeg file. You ususally will have to specify that program. An alternative is to rename the extention as .jpeg.</p>

<h2>            This week&#39;s releases</h2>
                    
<p>Anyone getting any?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Dungeon Siege 3</p>
<p>- Child Of Eden</p>
<p>- Alice: Madness Returns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think I am getting any, as I want F3AR 3 and Shadows of the Damned next week. Still haven't started RF Armageddon and Dirt 3, really, too
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-10.gif" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alice looks interesting, though, and Child of Eden will be a $30 buy from the UK in a month or two. Man, there are so many games coming out atm, but I think July is pretty quiet.</p>

<p>Dungeon Siege 3 is horrible.. Child of Eden is just as bad.. but compared to other kinect titles, it looks amazing. Still bad though. Alice is great, on PC. very difficult.. confusing at parts. but fun.</p>
<p>Fear 3 looks wrong.. I don't like how they seemed to have added zombies. Shadows of the damned on the other hands.. is just amazing. a mix of Resident evil, no more heroes and a bit of dante's inferno. Never thought i'd like it this much.</p>

<p>I'm interested in <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/video/preview-hd-dungeon-siege/713962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Dungeon Siege III</a> as i like a good stat based multiplayer hack n slash. I've got $250 worth of credit to spend at Game so unless DS3 rates poorly i'll probably end up getting it. Mind you i've also got to finish (even start) Dirt 3 as well as LA Noire.
 I suppose i have holidays for a reason <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-2.gif" /></p>

    <title>Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit Product Key - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit Product Key</h2>
                    May I ask where can I purchase genuine Windows 7 Ultimate Product Keys? I've looked everywhere from Amazon to Best Buy, I still couldn't find trustable ones. Can anyone suggest where to purchase a genuine one? And no, I don't want to use Windows 8 nor
 10.

            <p>Product keys are not sold separately and are only available as part of a package.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a specific reason you need Windows 7 Ultimate edition? </p>
<span>
<p>You could even purchase a much cheaper edition if you wish such as Home Premium, since it will be for home use.</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Because Windows 7 is in limited stock because Microsoft ended sales in October 2013, this has created demand because of its scarcity. This means retail boxed copies demand a premium, while OEM System Builder copies remain affordable.</p>
</span>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Full version (Retail):</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrade version (Retail):</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>OEM System Builder version:</p>
<span>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
</span><span><span>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>There is nothing wrong with using it too, especially since all future releases of Windows will be full versions anyway.
</p>
</span></span>
<p>
</p><p>You can find OEM System Builder software from dozens of online merchants. The current price for OEM Windows 7 Professional at

<h2>            Skype for iOS stuck on &#34;Connecting&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have an iOS Skype app (version 8.2.0.49163) that is not able to call certain people in my contacts. When I try to make the call, the call gets stuck at "Connecting," never gets to "Ringing," and fails after 2-3 dial tones. For these people, I am able to
 sign in to another device and call them, so it's not a problem on their end. The strange thing is, this phone can Skype call other contacts perfectly fine. My iOS is up to date on version 10.3.3. I don't have any apps installed that could interfere with this
 app. Can you please help me figure out what is the issue? Thanks.<br />

    <title>Microsoft points - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a cynical gamer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft points</h2>
                    

<p>Well here is the problem, I wanted to buy a gamerpic on xboxlive so I found one that was 80 microsoft points. I tried to buy it but I only had 79 points. Seriously how does this happen there probably is something i can buy for 79 or maybe even 60 points
 but I would have to search for an hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I think there shoul be an option in a new update for the xbox marketplace later on where you can buy a certain amount of points, Or maybe even an option to search up items that cost so many points. I may sound like a cheapskate but to me it sounds like
 a good idea.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Corrupt Windows 7 user profile following forced shut down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iain mcguinness  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupt Windows 7 user profile following forced shut down</h2>
                    I have a HP Pavilion g6 notebook, running Windows 7 Home Premium (Service Pack 1). The machine is only five months old.<br />
<br />
After a power failure, I tried logging back on. I noticed the message, 'Preparing your desktop...' which I don't recall having ever seen before. When the desktop finally appeared, I noticed that my wallpaper was changed, and the taskbar icons had disappeared.<br />
<br />
On further use, I realised that few of my personalisation settings remained, in terms of appearance and interaction. Programs, such as Windows Live Mail, are acting as though they're being used for the first time, and my settings are largely gone. My defaults
 for programs are gone. It seems that my profile has been corrupted, and the machine is running a little more sluggishly than before.<br />
<br />
There are only two accounts on the computer. Mine (Administrator) and Guest (which is disabled).<br />
<br />
I tried restarting. This time, I was asked to run a check of the hard disk, which I did. It did several things, although I can't find a log of this on my computer. Further restarts, and logging on and off, didn't have any effect.<br />
<br />
As per the advice given at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135, I tried performing a clean boot, but the profile is still corrupt.<br />
<br />
I then checked the Event Viewer log. I can post the results, if this will be helpful.<br />
<br />
I also tried to use System Restore, but none of the restore points are there from before this happened. However, System Restore was definitely in operation up until this point.<br />
<br />
Folder options aren't saving, nor are the settings when I try to personalise the desktop to get back the 'Computer' and 'Network' icons. In fact, changing any of these settings have no effect at all. Icons won't pin to the taskbar (the option is greyed out).
 I can't make new folders by right-clicking (there are no options under 'New'). The Recycle Bin doesn't show when it's got something in it (it still appears empty). So, actually, trying to get everything back the way I like it is seeming impossible!<br />
<br />
I've tried several other suggestions that I've found online, but nothing has worked.<br />
<br />
Could someone please help me to restore my profile? If you need further information, I'll be happy to provide it.<br />

 </blockquote> <p>I have my own thread which no one is responding to. I'm having the same issue, the xbox is the ONLY thing having connection issues which tells me it's not my damn internet, same as everyone else who's having trouble. No I can't just pick up my tv and xbox to plug it into my wireless router. This is not an issue on my end as I've power cycled, opened the ports, disabled ALL router firewalls (which is utterly ridiculous) and still can't stay connected to internet or live. There are now too many people with this issue for it to be on our end, don't know what Microsoft did, but ever since the April update I can't stay connected. It would be really nice to hear some other suggestions than power cycle.</p>
