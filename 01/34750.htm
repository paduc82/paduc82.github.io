    <title>Skype 8 chat history incomplete - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype 8 chat history incomplete</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10. Skype 8 latest version. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem: Pieces of my chat history are missing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not whole months or days. Just pieces. I can see the conversation logs immediately before and after, but the actual bits of the conversation that I need are not there. Skype online does not go back far enough apparently (would need to go back to August and
 no matter how hard I scroll, it stops early September) and Skype 8 uses cloud to store history which means I can't export it and check it that way. Checking via mac or pc or mobile yields the same result.</p>
<p>
Why would only specific parts of the history be missing? Is there anything I can do to get them?</p>

            Your conversations are saved on your hard drive for a period of time, which you can specify in your history settings. The last 30 days of your conversation history are also stored in the cloud, so you can access it when you're signed in to Skype on any device.
<br />
<br />In Skype for Windows 10, there is no option to configure the conversation History Setting, unlike in Skype for Windows Desktop that you can keep your conversation set to forever.

<p>Where would it be stored on the hard drive? If Cloud only saves 30 days but my August conversations do still load (albeit with pieces randomly missing) I assume then that the complete logs are somewhere on my computer. I navigated to the main.db to view
 via online tools, but its logs stopped at the same point as when using the "export Skype 7 conversation" option in skype--which is to say, it stops short of where the problem starts. My googling gave the impression that the conversations for Skype 8 were no
 longer stored on the computer, but if that isn't true, that's great; I just don't know where to look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case this is useful info, I also use skype on a Macbook Pro (High Sierra OS). If Skype for Windows 10 is a lost cause, is there's a solution on the Mac version?</p>

            Another downside of the NEW Skype. You're never sure if the entire history is in the cloud.

            The conversation history on the classic Skype will not be carried over to the new Skype, you can only view the recent messages in the new Skype. This means that the old conversation history is saved in the classic Skype's folder specifically in the main.db.
<br />
<br />As long as this file is still saved on your device, you should still be able to recover the old messages. Install the classic Skype and sign in to your account, make sure that you're accessing the correct account and check if you will be able to access the old messages.

<p>Thank you for the relevant answer. However, I would not have deleted these particular parts, and neither would this particular contact. We have been collaborating on a writing project for a while, writing pieces of a story and sharing them through Skype.
 In addition to neither of us having reason to delete, I have since found several instances of finding posts (either she or I made) where I know for a fact we made edits to the text after the initial post, and the changes were reverted back to the original,
 unedited version. Spelling/Grammar errors; changed wording; added or removed sentences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either Skype's cloud is deleting and changing messages on its own, or somehow my access to the cloud for my account is messing up. Thoughts?</p>

            Accessing my old history from Skype 7 is not my problem. The problem is when I access my most recent history by scrolling up/loading it in client (Skype 8), I am finding specific pieces of conversation missing that should not be missing.

<p>After reading through, this sounds like it just reads/prints your database file, which only has Skype 7 conversations on it.</p>

<h2>            My company went out of business. They gave me the computer they were using with an XP disc but I have no activation key</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
So I have this old comp that was given to me by my company when the company went under (an R and D place that lost funding). It appears to be a generic PC cobbled together from difference pieces, some being aftermarket. It has a windows vista sticker on it
 but xp pro installed. I was given an xp pro disc. However when I use a key finder to get the license key and try to use it with the disc, it says it's invalid so I'm thinking they gave me the wrong disc.<br />
<br />
Is there anything I can do? Maybe download and install vista? (shudders at the thought)<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would try and help you but be informed that Microsoft has a policy of one license per machine. If the computers were running on volume licensing key then you
 will not be able to activate Windows. Typically the license will limit the key to a fixed number of installations which must only be within the licensee's organization.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may find some detailed information on volume licensing on this
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/existing-customers/product-activation-faq.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a>. To find detailed information on single user license agreement,
 go through the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/en/us/IntellectualProperty/UseTerms/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a> and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to help.</p>

            Hi Alexandre.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to remove freeloaders starting with Windows.  
<br />
<br />Then Steps 7 and 11 to check system file integrity.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can trace the Startup following this tutorial:  <a href="http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/140247-trace-windows-7-bootshutdownhibernatestandbyresume-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/140247-trace-wi...</a>

<p>Thanks for your help and pointers; here again, I proceeded with all steps but there are still 4 DCOM servers timing out at boot time</p>
<ul>
<li>The server {21F282D1-A881-49E1-9A3A-26E44E39B86C} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.</li><li>The server {4991D34B-80A1-4291-83B6-3328366B9097} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.</li><li>The server {784E29F4-5EBE-4279-9948-1E8FE941646D} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.</li></ul>

<p>Generally dcom errors can be ignored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I get the same ones as you and cant find any issues regarding the computer / windows 10 functioning.</p>
<p>For me it mostly started since the fall update, before that i never had such or so many dcom errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes i've gotten 120 when i closed, all the same one.</p>
<p>That one has now disappeared since the latest or perhaps the one before, cumulative patch. (im now on build .371)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now fairly convinced its due to all those or certain patches and updates.</p>
<p>Reinstalling windows, scanning (which they Always advice here yet i've literally never seen anyone find anything wrong incl. yours truly), is all pointless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is a fault in windows 10 and shoddy updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT! my computer remains remarkably stable so i dont complain too often.</p>
<p>Save for a desktop windows manager problem that every once in a while has to reset resulting in a black screen for a split second, Always when i open edge or browse to a certain news website for some reason. (like once in a few months and funny enough when
 i looked up the GUID at the start of this topic as i have that one too now, so no big deal but again started since fall update)</p>

<h2>            Vista black screen w&#47; cursor</h2>
                    
<div>Greetings! <br />
<br />
I have been having problems with a VGN-AR630E Sony Vaio laptop running Windows Vista. Currently when I boot it up, I get a bunch of parentheses "(" all over the screen. After that, it shows me the "Microsoft Corporation" loading bar at the bottom of the screen.
 It appears to be booting fine, but that is where it goes to a black screen and stays there. If I boot into safe mode I get the same thing, only I have a moveable cursor on the screen and nothing else. (I can press shift 5 times to get the sticky keys window
 to appear but no other keys work.) This is as far as it gets regardless of trying to boot into safe mode or normal mode.<br />
<br />
Here is what I have tried so far:<br />
<br />
I put in a Windows Vista cd and boot to it in order to run Startup Repair, System Restore, Windows Complete PC Restore, Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool, or Command Prompt.<br />
<br />
None of these have worked for me so far. However, I had this problem before and going to the command prompt and running a CHKDSK /r /f worked like a charm. This time it did not work. System Restore, Startup Repair both finish running and it still will not boot
 properly. <br />
<br />
I am at a loss here. If anyone has any ideas on what I could try it would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks in advance :)</div>
<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Check with Sony Support or a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a Best Buy or other<br />
Big Box Stores).<br />

<br />
Saving any needed data and re-installing Windows Vista might be the best option though here<br />
are&nbsp;a few others.</p>
<p>You can save your files by putting the drive in another computer as&nbsp;2nd drive (best)&nbsp;or an External<br />
USB drive case and then backing them up to removable media such as CD, DVD, or other USB drives.&nbsp;<br />
Of course a real computer shop or your System maker can help recover the files.<br />
<br />
Or you could use an Ubuntu boot CD to back up the data.<br />
<br />
Use Ubuntu Live CD to Backup Files from Your Dead Windows Computer <br />

<p>Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver - then Right Click<br />
on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.</p>
<p>A method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode) is to CTRL +<br />
ALT + DEL - Task Manager and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications&nbsp;Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe. Safe Mode is reached by<br />
repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up. CTRL + SHIFT + ESC also starts Task Manager.<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.</p>

<p>Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss basis.<br />
That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just adds to the<br />
difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect. You can try a<br />
google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these cover a wide<br />
field of efforts.</p>
<p>Here is a video of one fix.</p>

<p>Do you have a Vista Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the disks your<br />
system maker will sell them cheap. Or try from Safe Mode if you can get there.</p>

<p>If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.</p>
<p>You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data) or a repair installation<br />
(hopefully saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or three.</p>
<p>You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own<br />
Product Key.</p>
<p>In-Place Upgrade<br />

<p>If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have to<br />
reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions. You will<br />
need to know your Product Code.</p>
<p>This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a Vista DVD<br />

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Vista boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - do not type parenthesis<br />
or BOLD)</p>
<p>c:</p>
<p>cd\</p>
<p>cd c:\Windows\System32\winevt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (there is a space between cd and C: )</p>
<p>ren Logs LogsOLD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (there are spaces between ren and Logs and Logsold)</p>
<p>REBOOT to Windows</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Auto logon and pin request. If skip this step, Windows logs on a restrictd access account.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Auto logon and pin request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my computer set to auto logon which normally works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Twice this week it has been disturbed by a blue screen which is advertising the wonders of having a PIN instead of a password and which gives me no option to say no. All I have is a choice to skip this step but what that does is logs me in on a restricted
 access account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shutting down solves nothing, it just does same thing on next start. Restarting makes it go away but I would prefer to be able to stop it altogether as its annoying</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the auto logon option work with pins? If so, I may set one. I don't need the added security it provides, no one else ever uses my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this?</p>

</p><p>It appears at start and gives two choices, skip this or PIN Me. I don't want a PIN so I choose skip this and it loads me to a the default desktop wallpaper and into a restricted account where I cannot look at files and change settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might just take auto logon off until I can work out why this page randomly appears at start up. As I said, it only started this week, I had used function perfectly fine for months prior to this.</p>

            If your computer wasn't built for Windows 10 at the factory, it might actually be a good idea to try turning off the fast startup. It's not universally compatible.

            <p>You wouldn't be throwing away access to all your current files LOL. &nbsp;You simply open the C:\users folder and drag them to the new account. &nbsp;Takes about 3 seconds versus 30 minutes for a clean install, and since you can create a test account just to try it,
 it's easy to at least try first.</p>

            <p>Okay, that sort of works though I just made a local account as until I am ready to delete my old user I can't match it to my email account. Will have to see how to make it an admin later as currently any changes i make need my other password to approve.
 &nbsp;But then that is a nice security feature on top of UAC... perhaps excessive.</p>

                    I had windows 8.1 on my computer than upgraded to 10 when I got the notification that my free upgrade was ready. After upgrading I realize my favorite steam game is not compatible with Windows 10 at the moment.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Is it possible to go back to Windows 8.1, then upgrade once again to Windows 10 at a later date and still not have to pay for Windows 10?</span>

<p>Not helpful at all. It's shame how Microsoft Support Engineers cannot give a direct response to any query asked. The question was just not answered!</p>
<p>Dear Arul_D, the question was, whether one can downgrade from windows 10 &amp; then upgrade back to Windows 10 for free. Please answer the question ASAP.</p>

            <p>I feel the same way and was wondering the same question!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to WIN10 from WIN7 And my built in Mic stopped working when i upgraded it to WIN10, so that takes a big part of having the win10 cortena feature out of use for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using it for about 45min I liked the UI much Better than win8(god that was aweful) I never saw anyone who updated to 8.1 so i dont know how much better that was. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like the overall feel of WIN10, but it has a LOT of privacy issues i DO NOT LIKE about it, after reading up on it, its like they wanna know every single thing you are doing on WIN10 and u have to go through a lot of setting to get them Half way turned
 off and After turning them off I have been told its still doing things kinda behind the curtain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they can get my Mic working on an update I guess i will upgrade back, But not Positive. I have a HP ELITEBOOK8440P , so im considering maybe just leaving this in win7 and getting a desktop all in 1 levevo with win10... &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I do hope those of us who have upgraded then rolled back will be able to have the choice to go back to win 10 after the deadline for the free upgrades. I mean i dont see why not, I have updated it, I looked and a new activation key was where it should
 have been .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont remember ever even reserving a free copy, I just noticed when i clickd on the win10 icon in the right bottom corner it said it was ready for install. &nbsp;so i gave it a try.. &nbsp;More than HALF the app's in the start menu area i dnt use and removed. To
 bad they dont&nbsp;integrate PS4 into this instead of just the XBone, cause they r worthless..IMO&nbsp;</p>

 not show up on my windows phone. However if I have Cortana add the event from my phone no problem. I can keep going not once has Cortana helped me with keeping on time with my appointments. Its like hit or miss. I feel like I'm not doing something right? Everything
 is turned on and allowed as far as Cortana goes. Maybe its yahoo?

            I'm in Tennessee. Cortana doesn't track any email from windows phone 950 or surface 3. The sync issue is only with the surface. Whenever I add Cortana events to surface calender it will only show up on the surface and not my Lumia 950

            Yes I just flew from AZ to TN and once again Cortana didn't work like I thought she would.&nbsp; ended up forwarding the confirmation email of the flight to my wife. She uses a galaxy s7 and worked fine. I do think having a yahoo email may be the issue?

<h2>            Auto-Connect to Xbox Live not working...&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>It's a problem I've noticed since I downloaded the newest Xbox Dashboard Interface, and I'm at my wits end. I have no problem with it after I sign in manually, it's just that in the 4 years I've had an Xbox 360, I never had this issue. Even when I upgraded
 to a 360-S back in 2010, still no problem. It wasn't until last November when this new Dashboard came out that the problems started. What can I do? Here are my specs:</p>
<p>United States/ VA</p>
<p>Motorola SB 5120</p>
<p>Belkin F5D8236-4 v.3</p>
<p>Wireless connection, internal wifi</p>
<p>I've tried clearing system cache, and restoring the network settings to factory defaults</p>
<p>UPnP setting is unknown</p>
<p>No NAT Errors</p>

<p>Okay... may have spoken a little too soon. Tried my xbox today, and it still won't auto-sign in to Xbox Live. I don't need to run the connection test anymore, it seems, because it logged me in within 15 seconds of me hitting the "Connect to Xbox Live" option,
 but still, my problem remains pretty much the same. My 360 will not auto-connect to Live, and for the life of me, I can't figure out why.</p>

<p>Not really, it depends on your house and what other wireless devices you have and your neighborus, its a cause of experimenting really.</p>
<p>You could also download inSSIDer (or similar) to look at what other wireless networks are in your area, the idea being you should change your channel so its not clashing with other networks in your area that are close by</p>

<h2>            Win 7 Pro &#40;in domain&#41; stuck on public network &#40;not clickable&#41;</h2>
                    Out of 50 computers in a domain right now, I have one that is misbehaving and stuck in unidentified network (public) and gives me an IP address of 169.x.x.x.x. &nbsp;And - the public network is NOT clickable to change it to work or home.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried another on the same Ethernet cable. &nbsp;That other computer gets a DHCP address immediately.</div>
<div>The problem computer - tried another cable. &nbsp;Not fixed</div>
<div>So I ruled out the Ethernet cable.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've reset the TCP Stack. &nbsp;Tired DHCP and even a static IP. &nbsp;Went to secpol.msc and to network list manager policies and changed things around. &nbsp;I've restored the computer to an earlier date (like a week before). &nbsp;I've removed the NIC card and drivers
 and re-installed. &nbsp;I've logged into the computer as another user and tried. &nbsp;Tried this from MS: &nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2578723/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2578723/en-us</a>&nbsp;and that didn't help. &nbsp;Nothing has worked.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm pretty much out of ideas here. &nbsp;Any suggestions? &nbsp;There was a power outage at my client office the other night for about 10 minutes and this is the computer that was affected. &nbsp;User comes into work, logs on - notices can't start any client/server app,
 then notices no network connection (the public) and here I am troubleshooting and exhausted all my troubleshooting steps.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions on this? &nbsp;Iv'e read countless message boards and amazingly, nobody has a solution. &nbsp;Just odd that this computer that has been in production for like 3 years - today, goes nuts and decides to change to public. &nbsp;First time ever for this computer.</div>

            Solved it. &nbsp;It was the Ethernet cable. &nbsp;I should have tried that first - but of course, I tried that last. &nbsp;Once I put a new cable in - instantly connected and no more issue.

<h2>            On-screen keyboard pops up when Cover is connected</h2>
                    <p>I'm on a Surface Pro 2 with all updates installed and up to date. Every time I click a text field, the on-screen keyboard pops up even though the keyboard cover is attached. Additionally, the keyboard cover is recognized as attached, as I am typing my response
 on it now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The experience is jarring because my keyboard is set to dock to the bottom of the screen. As a temporary fix, I will change it to the "undocked" mode so the active window I am trying to input text into will not resize.</p>

            <p>I have this issue intermittently as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I type a letter on the touch cover the on screen keyboard disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it happens after a resume from sleep, but not always.</p>
<p>

            <p>The problem seems to have resolved itself in PowerPoint. I've tried sleeping the SP2, then removing the keyboard and waking up the PC and the issue did not occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the only time it seems to be happening is text boxes in the desktop version of Chrome. Every time I touch any text box on a website, or the omnibox at the top, the on-screen keyboard pops up, regardless of the keyboard cover being attached. As soon as
 I press one key on the keyboard, the OSK disappears, so I am learning to touch and just start typing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling the dock option of the OSK has helped the issue of windows resizing everytime the OSK would pop up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried tapping text fields in desktop IE and Firefox and they both did not cause the OSK to pop up.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>When I started my PC today&nbsp;<em>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Display - 7/25/2017 12:00:00 AM - 22.19.128.0</em> was installed by Windows Update.&nbsp; Since then, the maximum screen resolution available is 1280 * 1024 whereas it should be 1680 * 1050.&nbsp; See&nbsp;<a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=rx+580" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=rx+580</a>
 for a listing of this update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This driver should not have been installed as my AMD Radeon HD 4350 GPU is not supported by native drivers in Windows 10:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/Driver-Support-for-AMD-Radeon%E2%84%A2-HD-4000,-HD-3000,-HD-2000-and-older-Series.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/Driver-Support-for-AMD-Radeon%E2%84%A2-HD-4000,-HD-3000,-HD-2000-and-older-Series.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there appears to be no way to remove this update as when I click on the
<em>Uninstall updates</em> link in Windows Update, the new driver isn't listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I remove this driver, go back to the existing driver&nbsp;(version 8.970.100.9001 according to the article above), and prevent the "update" from being installed again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Nothing there that shouldn't be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find a mysterious entry in the Devices section (on my PC) labeled "Cell Phone" (or something to that effect).&nbsp; I have now deleted it.&nbsp; I hope that takes care of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some additional background, I just fresh installed Windows 10 1809, but using a copy created by the MS's Media Creator.&nbsp; Before, it was still running 1803. I t now has a new app called "Your Phone".&nbsp; It may or may not have anything to do with this problem.</p>

<p>I think that will be the solution. Once in a while check that it hasn't come back. Not sure how it got there, if you haven't got a phone. Yes, 1809 has a
<strong>Your Phone</strong> app at the bottom of the <strong>START </strong>button list...</p>

</p><p>But mine is an upgrade-install, &amp; it must have picked up I have no phone. Yours is a clean install. It had to make a decision whether to give you phone or not. Maybe it made the wrong one.</p>

<p>Another phone message appeared.&nbsp; It appears that I have not cured the problem yet... but I have verified that it is a Cortana message.&nbsp; I tried to get a screen capture, but MS's new Snip applet closed the message before I could actually try any of the three

            Then try open "Your phone" app. That's a new app and I think the message could come from that app. Check if once open and close, you get again the message.

<p>I did already did try that, but I'm stymied three levels in when it asks for my cell phone number. There's nowhere to tell them I have no cell phone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the message appears again, I will click it and see if it gives me the option to stop the messages.&nbsp; Maybe I should hack the registry to eliminate Cortana messages all together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the methods provided to fix the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 1: Check the Driver’s status in Device manager.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/open-device-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&lt;&lt;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/open-device-manager&gt;&gt;</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<b>Note:</b> look for the NVIDIA driver whether it has installed properly, looks for the exclamation mark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p><br />
If the driver is not installed properly I would suggest you to uninstall and re-install the drivers:</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Uninstall the Driver:</strong></p>
<p><br />
a. Open Device Manager.<br />
b. Double-click the type of device that you want to uninstall.<br />
c. Right-click the specific device you want, and then click Uninstall. You can also double-click the device, and then on the Driver tab, click Uninstall.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Note:</b> To reinstall the drivers restart your computer and check the device to determine whether it is functioning properly. If it is not, try reinstalling the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists i would recommend you to download the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p><br />

    <title>Native resolution not displaying properly. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimmfknbb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Native resolution not displaying properly.</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded my nvidia drivers to the latest version, now there are big black margins around the edges of the screen when i use the native resolution. The native resolution is 1366 x 768; however the only resolution that fits my screen properly is 1768
 x 992, which makes text and icons appear small. I believe either windows or my graphics card are detecting my TVs resolution improperly. is there a way to adjust what my pc thinks the resolution of my screen is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware: VIZIO VX37L (using HDMI), nVidia 960gtx, Windows 10</p>
<p>The picture below is what the screen looks like using native resolution.</p>

            My drivers are all up to date. This problem was caused by updating my drivers. The native resolution (1366x768) works when i am playing a game in fullscreen mode, but when i go back to the desktop it has these big black margins (as shown in the picture
 above).&nbsp;

<h2>            Surface Book 2 does not charge when connected to Docking Station when Book 2 is turned off &#40;UPDATE your Docking Station Firmware&#41;</h2>
                    <p>But it charges fine once I turn the PC on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is connected via the connector from the docking station, and the little white light on the connector turns on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The monitor and keyboard work fine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just does not charge if the laptop/Book 2 is off. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've updated, and tried flipping the connector from the docking station in the reverse direction.&nbsp; I don't get it ;- )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you! :-)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'd love to help you in getting the issue resolved with your Surface Book 2's charging capability when in shut down state. For us to do so, we need to isolate where the problem is coming from and with this situation, we need to determine if the device charges
 in an off state when directly connected to the power supply without the Surface Dock involved. If it does then we suggest that you
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4023478/surface-update-your-surface-dock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">update your Surface Dock</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

If so, and you're getting the same result, please try a direct-modem connection, to see if the issue still occurs then.</p>

<p>It does lock as it is now, but would be best to have it log off as it tends to end up with 10 users logged on until we restart it.</p>

            No...that is not best. I am looking for answers as I set up lab machines in an EDU environment. I want to search for answers on the web like I do with EVERY OTHER piece of software. This is already a time consuming and irritating process that is needlessly
 over complicated under this new OS. How about you just answer the question instead of redirecting to a closed group.

            <p>If one really wants a LOGOFF, pretty sure they will be using similar solutions as were used in previous versions of Windows in such environments.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Something *like* <a href="https://4sysops.com/archives/automatically-log-off-idle-users-in-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://4sysops.com/archives/automatically-log-off-idle-users-in-windows/</a> . . .<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>I still fondly remember the Logoff Screensaver in the labs I helped run (1200+ machines, 40,000+ users.)&nbsp; It's a risky thing - logging off users forcefully.&nbsp; Get it wrong and someone loses a thesis (of course - they should have SAVED!)</p>

            <p>So . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no built-in Automatic LogOff feature. &nbsp;Guessing you mean that your screen gets locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check your screensaver and power (Hibernation / Sleep) settings for what happens when any of those things trigger (like bringing you back to the logon screen, etc.) &nbsp;Change appropriately so they DO NOT do the locking - if that is your decision / risk assessment.</p>

 Running Windows 7 home premier. Does anyone know how to fix this problem once and for all? I have logged in as the administrator, I have followed countless threads - nothing is working.

Download farbar service scanner. </a>Run it as admin. Click all but the last option then click on scan.<br />

Copy and paste the results back here<br />

I would say malware has removed reg entries (for the services), for the firewall, security center etc<br />

    <title>MP3 files suddenly not playing in Windows Media Player - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim a bassplayer  say:</h3>
<h2>            MP3 files suddenly not playing in Windows Media Player</h2>
                    <p>I have always played MP3 files with Windows Media Player and have never had a problem.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, I just updated the driver to my laptop for IDT Audio( to enable to record with internal mic), and now none of my Mp3 files will play.&nbsp; When I attempt to play them with Windows Media Player, I get the following error message:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"Windows Media Player cannot play the file.&nbsp; The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file."<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Prior to my updating the driver (see above), Windows Media Player played those files without any problem.&nbsp; (I have Windows 7)&nbsp;&nbsp; Can anyone help?&nbsp; Thank you.<br />

            <p>Unless you were having problems with the old driver that made you want to update, I would roll back the driver to the previous working version.&nbsp; You can do this on the driver tab from Device Manager.&nbsp; Or you can run system restore to go back to the previous
 day.</p>
<p>
you can restore Windows back to an earlier time, called a restore point. This restores backups of your registry and system settings, but doesn’t touch any of your files. It only takes a couple of minutes, and you can undo the process or try another date if
 it doesn’t fix the problem on the first try. When you aren’t sure where to go, this is by far the safest, fastest, and easiest option to try first.&nbsp; This works best if you use it immediately after a problem shows up.&nbsp; Waiting more than a week or two means
 the good backups can be too outdated to use.
