<h2>            Doesn&#39;t stay in sleep mode.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have windows 8 on a new HP pavilion; it goes into sleep mode fine, but it doesn't stay in sleep mode.&nbsp; It comes back on after a few minutes, and I'm not anywhere near the computer.&nbsp; How can I get to stay in sleep mode?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,&nbsp; mike</p>

<h2>            I need help getting ownership of my boot c drive</h2>
                    I have been having an issue for the past 24 hours with the permissions on my C (Boot) drive in Windows 10 Home. I found myself saving almost everything to my 2 TB extra hard drive and decided I wanted to save my Curse Client directly in the c drive without
 a folder, just the files. When I tried to save without a folder in my c drive, a popup appeared informing me that I didn’t have the correct privelage to save there. I thought this was weird so I clicked start and sure enough I was still an administrator! I
 initially thought this was an issue on Curse's end so I decided to test my theory by attempting to save a regular dot txt file to my boot drive. This worked but only if I saved it to a folder on the drive, I couldn't just save the file directly to the c drive
 without a folder which I COULD do on my 2 tb hard drive. I didn’t really know what to do and attempted to change ownership of the c drive through properties&gt;advanced&gt;change(Right beside “owner”) and then I saw tha

            <p>What you found is a restriction that Microsoft introduced many years ago with Windows 7: While UAC (User Account Control) is at its default level it will not let you save files to the root of the System partition. You have two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable UAC (not recommended)</li><li>Save the files to a folder off the root.</li></ul>

<h2>            ninja gaiden black download issue</h2>
                    
<p>I bought Ninja Gaiden Black for download last night off of Xbox Live. I paid for it with Xbox points. It is showing as payed for on my console. I tried to download it last night and woke up this morning to my console having issues due to being plugged into
 a power strip. I got that taken care of and resumed the download. When&nbsp;it was done I clicked on "Play game now" and it came up with a game error saying it couldn't start and to try downloading again. So I followed the instructions here to delete it and clear
 the cache and re download. Again, download is done and it gives me the same error. I wouldn't think my hard drive is bad, I just bought it but I have downloaded updates and saved games to it with no issue.</p>

<p>I have now tried redoing the update for xbox live and also reformatted the hard drive, why won't this work??? Again, I don't think it would be the hard drive as I have game saves from what I have already played and updates downloaded to it no issue.

<p>well that answers that question. I didn't know there were third party hard drives for the xbox 360. I bought this one on recomendation of a friend that found it for me. I saved money but now I can't use it for what I wanted it for :( &nbsp;If I find an actual
 copy of the game will my system be able to play it? How do I get my ms points back for not being able to play it, or can I? was this just throwing money down the toilet so to speak?</p>

<p>If you're using a third-party drive, then you may still run into issues even with the game disc. I'm afraid that we can't issue refunds for purchases made in the marketplace; however, if you use an official HDD, you should be able to play that game without
 issue. :-)</p>

                    <p>
</p><p>So I have a Pro 3 (I7) with a docking station. &nbsp;A little while back, the docking station spontaneously quit working with the computer. &nbsp;It was getting power to the USB as it was able to charge various devices, but there was no connectivity to my Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At fist I didn't know if the prob with my Surface or the doc, but a trip to a MS store showed me my Surface was fine. &nbsp;I quickly ordered another docking station from Ebay. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used this second docking station for about a month.........and a few minutes ago, it also quit working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like before, it's getting power (the USB ports are still hot), but there's no connectivity to the Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help? :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two docks failing in a month just seems unlikely to me, yet all indications show that my Surface is just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't afford to keep replacing docking stations lol</p>

<p>Thanks! &nbsp;I tried that (along with a zillion other things) --- no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, out of desperation, I decided to just wipe the entire computer and factory reset. &nbsp;Surprisingly, the dock began working....almost. &nbsp; Surface is now communicating with the dock. &nbsp;I'm getting power and I have access to the USB ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But.....now the hdmi mini port (on the Surface and on the dock) refuses to connect to anything. &nbsp;I can no longer connect to my external monitor with the hdmi miniport.</p>

</p><p>I even upgraded to Windows Creative --- no effect. &nbsp;I tried a different monitor -- no effect. &nbsp;I tried connecting to the dock port and I tried the Surface port....nothing. &nbsp;I tried deleting the drivers and reinstalling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm definitely at a loss at the moment. &nbsp;The only thing I've not done is get new hdmi mini port cables (which I may try next....but they're slow to arrive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my dock problem was software (as demonstrated by wiping Surface and reinstalling), I can only assume that my hdmi problem is also software. &nbsp;Everything worked perfectly.....until it didn't lol</p>

<h2>            Right panel with chat does not show next to left panel with contacts. It shows in the same window and contacts disappers.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed new skype 8 on Mac and there is missing right panel with chat history window next to the left panel with contacts/chat list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see only chats list and when I click on chat, the chat history will show in the same window and the list of chat disappears. From the window with chat history is only way to go back by clicking arrow in the top left corner, than I see the list again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contacts - i don`t see right panel with chat history when I click on contact</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1e04c43-9acb-4ff5-a7e4-9441ed4f562c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1e04c43-9acb-4ff5-a7e4-9441ed4f562c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The click opens messaging panel in the same window, contacts disappers - I don`t see left panel with contacts. If I want to see contact, I have to click go back arrow. So if I messaging with more people at the same time, I have to constantly go back and
 forth...</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/052f725a-306f-4de3-8010-91ef541c4cab?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/052f725a-306f-4de3-8010-91ef541c4cab?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What I want to see - both panels next to each other. When I click contact, the messaging panel changes at right side.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da563235-cd50-442b-b407-f1552e464118?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da563235-cd50-442b-b407-f1552e464118?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>At first - I thought it is a new feature, because I have it like that on two mac computers. But this weekend I have updated skype at my parents mac and they see both panels next to each other. I have tried to find it in the settings, but there is nothing
 like that.</p>
<p>How to set it up please?</p>

            Have you tried resizing your window to be larger than 760px? &nbsp;I find that is the responsive breakpoint that causes the contact list to be hidden, and the back button forced to be used when in Skype. Once you resize the app window to larger than that, bot
 are in view again.

            Sounds like you may want to uninstall and reinstall the Lexmark printer drivers and add-on software. &nbsp;If the behavior persists, get the latest version of the Lexmark software / drivers and try that. &nbsp;If that doesn't work, it seems you would need to contact
 Lexmark.&nbsp;

<div>Hi SJDukes,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Which Operating System do you have?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>LXCTtime.dll is a Lexmark printer file. Program starts upon Windows startup. It is not a Windows system file.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you have a lexmark printer, (or other Lexmark product) try to reinstall it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the steps from the below link.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Find and install printer drivers</strong> <br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Find-and-install-printer-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Find-and-install-printer-drivers</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you had, but have now removed a Lexmark product, then look in Msconfig, startup tab and untick anything you can see which relates to lexmark</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>This is what you need to do</strong> .</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1, Click start, in the search box type 'msconfig'</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Click on Start up tab</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. Uncheck entries relating to lexmark printer</div>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Could you provide us the error code you encounter in blue screen?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.<br />
</strong>First I would ask you to run the check disk in the recovery console and check. Refer to the articles below which explain how to install and use the recovery console. The second article explains how to run the check disk.<br />
<strong>a. How to install and use the Recovery Console in Windows XP<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307654</a></div>

</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2.<br />
</strong>If the issue still exists I would recommend you to follow the methods in the article below and check if you can boot to the desktop.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>How to recover from a corrupted registry that prevents Windows XP from starting<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307545</a></div>

<p>Thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>1. okay by error code do you mean the second line on the blue screen which for me is<em>unmountable boot volume,</em> or the last line</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>method 1; computer does stay on long enough to do anything and i do not have the xp cd or the system recovery disk</p>
<p>method 2 seems to require the sydtem recovery program already installed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i am also trying the external hard drive cage/caddy work around to access the drives, but am getting an i/o drive error, what i can work out my harddrive may be damaged but am trying a data recovery program as we speak</p>

<div>Here is some reality:</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is extremely unlikely that any store bought computer purchased on this planet will have the XP Recovery Console installed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is extremely unlikely that any store bought computer purchased on this planet will come with a genuine bootable XP installation CD that can be used to boot the XP Recovery Console.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is extremely likely that the majority of posters to the forums have never actually seen, possessed or otherwise come into contact with a genuine bootable XP installation CD in their life, &nbsp;or if they ever had one in their possession, it is now nowhere
 to be found.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is extremely likely that the majority of posters to the forums will not have any kind of bootable XP media or not be sure what they have.</div>
<div><br />

<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt.</p>
<p>First verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage
 amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>
<p>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</p>

<h2>            Visual Studio on Windows 7</h2>
                    I have upgraded a Vista laptop to Windows 7. After upgrading I found I could not run VS 2008. I tried installing the VS2010 Beta 2 to see if that would work but sadly no, I have now unloaded both versions and reinstalled VS 2008. It appears to install
 without errors but when I try to load an existing project it fails to load with the following error:-<br />
Unable to read project file &lt;name&gt;. MSBuildToolsPath is not specified for the 'Tools Version "4.0"' defined at 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSFT\MSBUILD\TOOLSVERSION\4.9, or the value specified evaluates to the empty string.<br />
Can anyone help???<br />

    <title>WMC and Media player don&#39;t play when started with HDMI audio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rickph  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMC and Media player don&#39;t play when started with HDMI audio enabled</h2>
                    This is an update of a previous post in October (WMC-Live CODEC error on recorded TV...). &nbsp; I have finally managed to get WMC and Media player to work via HDMI and with audio, but through a method that I can only conclude points to a bug in those applications,
 or the OS.&nbsp;&nbsp; When WMC or media player is started while a TV is connected via HDMI, AND, the HDMI audio driver is selected by default, playing any recorded TV files halts the player immediately on play start with an error message.&nbsp; When either application is
 started with HDMI connected but audio default set to the speakers of the laptop, the TV files will play but the sound comes out of the laptop speakers.&nbsp; I could patch the laptop headphone jack to the TV audio system, but this is rather inelegant; HDMI audio
 should just work.<br />
<br />
Now the interesting part; after starting a file in WMC or Media player with the laptop audio selected, I paused the playback, then went into control panel and changed the audio default from the laptop speaker to the HDMI digital (NVIDIA driver for this laptop).&nbsp;
 I was expecting the player to halt with the error as soon as I took the playing file out of pause, or at least resume without any sound at all, but was surprised when the playback resumed normally, and the audio was now coming from the TV through HDMI, the
 way the applications should work.&nbsp; This is pretty clear proof that there is no hardware or driver issue here.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I pointed out in the original post, VLC player works fine with HDMI default enabled, further pointing to some sort of bug in WMC and Media player.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            OK, I think I just stumbled onto the solution to this problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; It took some searching through the (MS hosted) Windows Experts forum on WMC, but a solution that worked for a slightly different problem turned out to also solve the problem I was having.<br />
<br />
So what was it?&nbsp; follow these steps:<br />
<br />
Go into Control Panel, find and open "Manage Audio Devices" <br />
<br />
With the HDMI TV connected and active, select the (NVIDIA) HDMI Digital Audio Device and open up the Properties<br />
<br />
Select the Advanced tab<br />
<br />
In the Exclusive Mode box, <span style="font-weight: bold">uncheck</span> the tickbox titled "Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device"<br />
<br />
That's it.&nbsp; Everything now works as it should with WMC and Media Player both playing TV files correctly with the HDMI audio enabled.<br />
<br />
I don't know what the consequences of having that box unchecked will be, but clearly, the default setting when the OS was upgraded and the driver loaded had that checkbox enabled.&nbsp; If an auto-update changes this setting back to default, this could explain how
 something that was working, suddenly and mysteriously stops working.<br />

<h2>            Second Sata Hard Drive not showing in My Computer or Disk Management</h2>
                    Ok, I have read other questions on this, and I have still been unable to get my second drive to work. They are both 1tb Sata drives. The second drive in question shows in / on: Startup, Bios, and Device Manager, but it does not show in My Computer or in
 Disk Management. I am really stumped on this... I have worked with computers some, but I have never had this problem, and I know the second drive is good, beause it shows up in another computer just fine. Any advice?

            Bios is set to automatic for second drive, and as far as config, its Sata. They should automaticly set the drive and all that... I guess I should also mention I am running Windows 7, huh? ^^' But yes, just checked that, it is set to automatic in Bios,
 but it is not assigning it a drive letter, nor can I do so in Disk Management.

            Thats not quite correct, you need to check the mobo manual as to any specific bios settings&nbsp;for whatever port you are connecting your sata drive to, it varies by mobo and its not just a question of connecting it.&nbsp;(it doesnt matter that you are running
 win7)

            Well, I just checked the Mother Board Manual and it recomends that settings be left as is, leaving Sata drives on 'Auto'. Sata 1 is my Primary Hard Drive, Sata 2 (Drive in Question) is my second Hard Drive, and then Sata 3 is my DvD Drive. All three show
 during Startup, Bios, and in Device Manager. Only the Second drive does not show up in My Computer or Disk Management. If it will be of any help, I am using this Motherboard: A740GM-M (&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ecs.com.tw/ECSWebSite/Product/Product_Detail.aspx?DetailID=864&amp;CategoryID=1&amp;MenuID=20&amp;LanID=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ecs.com.tw/ECSWebSite/Product/Product_Detail.aspx?DetailID=864&amp;CategoryID=1&amp;MenuID=20&amp;LanID=0</a>&nbsp;).
 Thank you for helping so much Palcouk, hopefully you can help me get my second drive working. Kind of detering when you put it in... do the installation of OS, to find out, second drive is not showing now...

    <title>Failure configuring Windows updates Reverting changes Do not turn off - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Failure configuring Windows updates Reverting changes Do not turn off your computer</h2>
                    <p>Background:</p>
<p>A friend of mine's son (11) tried to upgrade from Win8 (I assume) to Win10 (Lenovo N580). This is a "gifted machine" from an aunt, so no discs/documentation came with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine is stuck in "Failure configuring Windows updates, Reverting Changes, Do not turn off your computer." 3+ hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have shut it down several times via power button as well as pulled the battery twice; on each restart I've held down the "Shift" key and pressed the F8 key (repeatedly). Same result, i.e., starts the boot process, the jumps form the "configuring windows"
 screen to the "Failure..." screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

 to a new facility. &nbsp;Prior to that the worked okay using a wireless router. &nbsp;I switched to a cable router and had the same problems as above. &nbsp;I then purchased a new router and still have the same problems.</div>

            Hello Charles,
<div><br />
<div>You said that both machines have&nbsp;McAfee&nbsp;security software installed?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Did you uninstall it from both computers?</div>
<div><br />

 Button and select user</b>&nbsp;from given Change Owner to list if user or group is not in given list then, click on other users or groups. Enter name
 of user/group and click ok. You can even click on administrator here, if you are logged in as an administrator.</p>
<p>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now select User/group and click apply and ok. (Check “Replace owner on sub containers and objects” if you have files
 and folder within selected folder)</p>
<p>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click ok when Windows Security Prompt is displayed</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Owner name must have changed</p>
<p>j.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now click&nbsp;<b>Ok

<h2>            Windows 10 Internet Problem</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem on my internet. Everything is fine when i install windows 10. 5 days later, internet is limited.
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be3f3b08-a0e9-4bfe-9307-7336653a9c88" /></p>
<p>I cant access anything through any program, i can't even access 192.168.1.1 which is my default gateway. So far i have done:</p>
<p>-CMD (netsh, ipconfig)</p>
<p>-IPv4 Settings</p>
<p>-Disabling, Uninstalling Driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over on W8.1, i also have internet problems, and it always get solved with Troubleshoot problems. But now, it shows different results:</p>
<p>-Could not automatically not detect this network's proxy settings</p>
<p>-DNS Server is not responding (no, i don't have a preffered dns address)</p>
<p>and (first i have seen)</p>
<p>-Your conputer seems to be correctly configured, but device or resource (wpad.home) is not responding.</p>
<p>Wpad.home? What is that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems wierd, but if i disconnect the cable from my router, edge will show "not connected" but, if i connect it i will get "hmm, can't reach this page". In firefox "Server not found".</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13dd02a5-da8d-4523-8023-a0253246c325" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can connect to the wifi no problem, no windows updates were installed (i think so), i haven't tried LAN, and other conputers are fine to browse. I don't know what to do. I don't want to reinstall windows. It is a pain to reinstall all of my apps. I don't
 think i want to go back to 8.1.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. If i don't have the answer to solve this, is it helping to buy a usb wireless adapter?</p>

<h2>            Skype for Apple, any incomming call stops my keynote presentation.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Skype V7 did not have this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I could have a Keynote presentation running on my meeting room projector &amp; at the appropriate times People would join or drop out of Skype it worked without much issue. I would freeze the projector at convenient time &amp; then add all new callers to
 the group call, all those on Skype can see the screen through a web cam which is easier as I have 120 people in the room with me &amp; only 5-15 on Skype at any one time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when ever someone calls in via Skype it stops the presentation &amp; I have to restart it, especially annoying when it includes embedded videos which I really don't want interrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know v7 had a setting to prevent this, any one know where has the option gone in v8 or if it is even exists anymore?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Carlos_le_Skyper,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Call merging is not yet incorporated on the latest version of Skype. Meaning to say, when you are on ongoing group call, and someone calls you, the ongoing call will be put on hold and you will be asked to answer or decline the incoming call. If you will
 to choose "answer" your ongoing call will either be put on hold or it will be terminated. To isolate the issue, how do you answer the incoming call when you are on ongoing group call?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks and I look forward to your reply!</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes merging isn't available like it was in v7 which is another complete pain!! To get round it I have told them all to ring &amp; instantly hang up so I have a record of the call which seems to only hold the existing call for a few seconds &amp; then I have to add
 each caller separately when its convenient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But more of an issue is why a new incoming Skype call stops a presentation I have running &amp; how do I stop this happening, when I never had this issue before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please allow v7 to be used till you have a stable v8.</p>
<p>Cheers Carl.</p>

<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee.</p>
<p>------------------------------------</p>
<span>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>For HP and Compaq, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>

            You wish to restore your computer to factory settings? Read the official manual:<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
<br />
On some models, you can perform a recovery from the partition on the hard drive, accessed by pressing either the Start button or f11. This restores the computer to its factory condition.<br />
<br />
To restore the system from the partition, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Access Recovery Manager in either of the following ways:<br />
● Select Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Recovery Manager &gt; Recovery Manager.<br />
– or –<br />
● Turn on or restart the computer, and then press esc while the “Press the ESC key for Startup Menu” message is displayed at the bottom of the screen. Then, press f11 while the “Press &lt;F11&gt; for recovery” message is displayed on the screen.<br />
2. Click System Recovery in the Recovery Manager window.<br />
3. Follow the on-screen instructions<br />

We are going to need more information to be able to help you in resolving this issue.<br />
<br />
What exactly is your laptop showing you for your network connection?&nbsp; I am not quite sure what you mean by "unidentified network".&nbsp; Do you have a network icon in the system tray?&nbsp; If so, does it show with a red "x" on top of it?&nbsp; If you go into the Network
 and Sharing Center in Control Panel does your network connection show Connected, Disconnected or Disabled?&nbsp; Or is it missing altogether?<br />
<br />
What type of computer is it?&nbsp; What version of Vista is it?&nbsp; What brand and model is your router?<br />
<br />
Try this:<br />
Click Start , type cmd in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.&nbsp; <br />
At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
ipconfig /all (there is a space between ipconfig and / )<br />
The ipconfig /all command displays Windows TCP/IP settings for all your network adapters.<br />
If your IP address for your Local Area Connection is either 0.0.0.0 or 169.x.x.x (where x is any number), then your computer is not getting an IP address from the router.&nbsp;
<br />
If that is the case, try this:</p>
<p>ipconfig /release</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>ipconfig /renew</p>
<p>Test it again by typing ipconfig /all again to see what the address is.&nbsp; If the address is still not correct (if you are on a home router, it should start with either 192.168.1.x or 192.168.0.x or 10.x.x.x), try plugging the cable into a different port on
 the router, try a different cable, or it is possible that your Network card in your laptop has gone bad.</p>
<p>Let us know the results of these things so we can help you resolve this issue.<br />
Thank you,</p>

    <title>Problem with creating or changing user accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> attycjs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with creating or changing user accounts</h2>
                    
<p>When I try to set up a new user account, no matter what name I give the account, I receive an error saying, "The specified acount name is not valid, because account names cannot contain the following characters: /\[]":;&lt;&gt;+=,?*&nbsp; Please type a different name.&nbsp;
 None of the taboo characters are in the names I have tried.</p>
<p>When I try to change a user account, I cannot do so.&nbsp; So, if I try to give myself administrator rights, no such luck!&nbsp; I cannot change any of the other accounts on the system, either, including&nbsp;the Sonos ZonePlayer account, which is the only accouint with
 administrator rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AAARRRGGGHHHH!</p>

<p>OK. I know nothing about Sonos and I admit that I cannot work out why you should have a Dell machine without a single active admin account. It seems a perfect way of painting oneself into a corner. Below is a method to jump out of this corner. It works for
 all Windows machines but I have no way of knowing how your Sonos music system might respond to it. The process is involved and requires some careful typing. Ask a computer-savvy friend to assist you if you lack experience in this area.<br />
&nbsp;1. Set your BIOS to use the DVD drive as the primary boot device.<br />
&nbsp;2. Boot with a Windows Repair CD. <br />
&nbsp;3. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …" appears.<br />
&nbsp;4. Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and then click Next. You are now in Repair Mode.<br />
&nbsp;5. Select an Operating System, then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;6. Select the Command Prompt.<br />
&nbsp;7. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".<br />
&nbsp;8. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; move&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; \&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy&nbsp; cmd.exe&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;9. Reboot normally but hold down the Shift key permanently.<br />
10. When challenged for a password, tape the Shift key five times. You will see a small black screen.<br />
11. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see a list of all accounts that exist on your machine)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see if the Administrator account is active)<br />
12. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user "JohnDoe" ppp&nbsp; /add {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To create an account called "JohnDoe" with a password of ppp)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net localgroup administrators "JohnDoe" /add<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To promote this account to admin level)<br />
13. Log on under this account, using the new password.<br />
14. Reboot the machine into Repair Mode as per Steps 1..6 above.<br />
15. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy \sethc.exe {Enter}<br />
16. Reboot into Windows.<br />
Instead using a Windows Repair CD in Step 2, you can use your Windows 7 Installation DVD. The steps are similar to the ones above.</p>
<p>When finished you should have a machine with two fully tested admin accounts. Having fewer than two is short-sighted and will invariably get you into trouble.</p>

    <title>Recovery - It looks like Windows didn&#39;t load correctly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Recovery - It looks like Windows didn&#39;t load correctly</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently locked out of my computer. Am I usually able to access the Recovery screen, but some times my two monitors have nothing to show me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all began after I finished a FIFA 17 game; my monitors turned a dark brown and the computer was unresponsive. I forced it off and when I rebooted I came to the Recovery screen, but that was after many attempts. The other times the monitors showed me nothing
 and the computer was unresponsive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within the "Advanced options" I have tried the "Startup Repair" option, but it says "Startup Repair couldn't repair your PC. It does refer to the logfile from the diagnosis and the errorcode 0x0 popps up through the file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the startup settings and enter safe mode. THe first times it worked, but after I copied all the files on my computer to prepare for a system reset, I can no longer login through safe mode; it freezes the screen seconds after I come to the lock
 screen. I cannot use the keyboard before the freeze to enter the password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried resetting the computer, but after 31 % it undoes all the changes that were made and says "There was a problem restting your PC. No changes were made." This happens with either of the reset options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I have also tried to fix some the issues using the command prompt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>cd %windir%\system32\config&nbsp;<br />
ren system system.001&nbsp;<br />
ren software software.001&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>After typing the last command, it says "The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just now, I tried to access the Media Control Tool, but it failed and said it isn't recognized as a command.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I honestly have no idea how to fix this. I am not that good with command prompt or computers in general, so I am in need of some serious help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In advance, thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Eventually I found the problem; the graphics card was somehow interfering and cause my computer to crash during install. All I had to do was to manually plug it out and now everything is working great!</p>
