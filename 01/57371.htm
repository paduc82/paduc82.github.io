    <title>Windows 10 store will not open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> themaestro1967  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 store will not open</h2>
                    I updated to Windows 10 a few hours ago, but a few apps won't open. The Store opens for a split second and then closes, and other apps such as Mail open and say 'This app can't open - Check the Windows Store for more info about Mail'. I have another computer
 and the Store opens fine on it. Any ideas?

            <p>I had the same issue and managed to resolve it by creating a second account on the PC. I don't know if it will work for everyone but it's worth the try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should create another account, log out from your main one and log in with the second. Then Windows will take several minutes to configure it. When the configuration is done, try to launch the Windows Store to see if it works with this second account.
 Then you can log out and return to your main account. The Windows Store and the other apps should work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope it helps :)</p>

            Thanks, but it didn't work. I actually had a Microsoft representative take control of my PC during a live chat, but he tried what he could and it just didn't work. He said that the only option left is to revert back to Windows 8.1 and then re-upgrade.

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that my problem was that I installed Norton Security Suite from Comcast, but it was not totally compatiable with windows 10. I removed it using Northon removal tool and that is the point when I started having the problem with Windows Store. Last
 night I reinstalled Norton Security Suite, but they had changed to the new Windows 10 version. This corrected all my problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to add that the problems was the Bits-Client service would not start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks </p>

            <p>Why is none of it working?? I tried this and it didn't work (it couldn't find it). And I did replace user_name with the user name, by the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I just thought of trying to find it by going from C: (why didn't I think of it before?). I got there and there was nothing in the local cache.</p>

            Yes, that would work with the apps that were <em>already installed</em> and were in Windows 8.1 when I upgraded. Not ones to download.

            <p>I also faced this situation and the first action I took was to log in as another user. I observed that there was not any problem in the second account&nbsp;so I decided to do something drastically immediate! I deleted my default account (both profile and data)
 and after that I rebooted the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I recreated the account using the same credentials and restored my files through File History.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process demanded approximately 20 minutes...</p>

<h2>            Resource Monitor and Task Manager showing incorrect CPU usage, or is my CPU capped at 33&#37;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, hoping someone can give me a clue as to what's going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Windows 10 Professional, up to date, on a Toshiba Qosmio X70-A, i7-4700MQ @ 2.4 GHz, 32 GB RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, I run most of my work on a work cluster, so I rarely make this machine work for all it has. However, lately I have been trying to parallelize some R code locally, and have noticed that both the Resource Monitor and Task Manager are reporting completely
 false values of CPU usage. For instance, in the screenshot below, each of 8 Rscript processes is using 12% CPU, and the total for all 8 is reported correctly, but the total cpu usage seems to be capped at 33%.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e45e91d-1771-476d-aad6-0098a12c678f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e45e91d-1771-476d-aad6-0098a12c678f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The same problem is occurring in task manager - &nbsp;the details tab reports individual cpu usage correctly, but the total cpu usage seem to be capped at 33% for some reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, it could be the case that the CPU is for some reason being capped at 33% and those 12% are per core rather than total usage. However, if that's the case, what in the world would be capping cpu usage? It's not power settings as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't too heavy of an issue, but it has been problematic in terms of trying to optimize how much code I can run at any time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You get unbanned roughly the same time as you were banned so if you were banned at 9pm you'll be unbanned then. While I'm here we'll have no naming &amp; shaming either if you want them dealt with then file a complaint. Anyone who has been deranked needs to
 contact Treyarch for help and not waste their time talking too these two chancers.</p>

<p><span><span><span>We expect you will review them carerefully.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Sorry if it makes you don‚Äôt feel good when reading it although it is true from our customers feelings.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Sencerely Yours,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Julia Corn</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>***</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1- Whenever Microsoft upgrade its new windows version, it becomes slower than its previous version, changing its operating, mouse click, locations of its icons,
 command names ALTHOUGH IT APPLIES AND WORKS AS THE SAME FUNCTIONS AS OF THOSE OF THE PREVIOUS WINDOWS VERSIONS.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>For example, users who are familiar with the windows version 7 will feel difficult to operate the new windows 8.0, 8.1 and 10:&nbsp;he/she doesn‚Äôt know where the familiar
 commands are located to use them or even where to find out the command to turn off his/her computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2- This windows changing is NOT BETTER THAN the previous windows version because it only changes their appearance and locations BUT NOT THEIR QUALITY such as being
 BETTER, FASTER, etc.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In the contrary, users who are familiar with MAC versions still are familiar with the NEW MAC VERSIONS on upgrading due to it does NOT CHANGE ITS APPEARANCE, COMMANDS
 LOCATIONS, BUT <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">BETTER QUALITY</span>. For example, users who use iPad are always feeling familiar with it through its different versions.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3- Microsoft believes its new windows version looking good/better on changing appearance and locations of commands, but in reality, it‚Äôs NOT RIGHT AT ALL. UPGRADE
 must be BETTER, FASTER QUALITY, AND LESS using DIFFICULTY as well as LESS ‚ÄúRAM EATING‚Äù, etc.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>UPGRADE must NOT be only changed its another appearance and command locations. APPLE IS BETTER THAN MICROSOFT ON LEARNING THIS LESSON.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4- Users DO NOT WANT ANY NEW MS WINDOWS WHICH ONLY CHANGES EVERY COMMAND AND ITS APPEARANCE BUT DO THE SAME WORKS LESS EFFECTIVE. This makes every user, individual
 or company, unlike new windows versions upgrade at all, especial of companies with hundreds/thousands employees. Why? They MUST spend a lot of (WASTE) money &amp; time to change (upgrade) new windows version for their every computer in their system, employees
 training of using new windows version, etc.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5- That‚Äôs why a lot of companies still use Windows XP or windows 7. According to them, Windows XP or 7 are much better than windows 8, 8.1. WINDOWS 10 still has
 a lot of difficulties and obstacles to be fixed.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span><span>6- Our own opinion: we prefer windows XP and windows 7 versions: THEIR APPEARANCE ARE ATTRATIVE,&nbsp; BETTER COMMANDS, AND THEY
 ARE DOING BETTER JOBS THAN ver. 8.0, 8.1 or 10. We CAN NOT RECOMMEND windows 10 to everybody until we‚Äôre sure that it‚Äôs GOOD ENOUGH.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>1- Your question makes me feeling that I‚Äôm working for a MS rival. Sure not 100%.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>2- In fact, I‚Äôm working in the ‚Äúbackyard‚Äù section of a company which I can‚Äôt be permitted to release any of its info. My job is using, testing and
 analyzing OS of MS, MAC, and others, as well as taking clients‚Äô opinions and ideas and report all to my company. I have no idea what they will do or make any decision of with my report.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>3- Above are some summary ideas and opinions from my own experience of my job and clients‚Äô as well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>4- At last, I myself love MSOS but in daily work I got a lot of obstacles and problems in using new MSOS such as very slow downloading, internet
 disconnect, etc., which I must report to my company. I expect that any future MSOS will really do good job later.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Sincerely Yours,</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply,</p>
<p>
Since you have tried manual reinstallation and repair to no avail, I suggest that you clean install Windows Essentials. This will remove all Windows Essentials related files giving you a clean state to work with. Here's how:
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><strong>Note</strong> : If you are using Mail, I suggest that you back up your emails through this

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>1. Uninstall Windows Essentials using
</span></span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/messenger-wlinstall/how-to-uninstall-windows-live-essentials-via-cmd/3d26c7ea-faf0-437a-88b0-c5bdd3dd31ec"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">CMD Line Parameter</span></span></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>2. Delete the Windows Live folders (if any) found on the following directories:</p>
<ul>
<li>C:\Program Files\Windows Live</li><li>C:\Program Files\Common Files\Windows Live</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>3.

<h2>            Windows 7 Updates - Error Code C1900101-30018</h2>
                    &nbsp;I am running Windows 7 and have no interest in upgrading to Windows 10 given all the problems I had during the year when the "so-called" free windows 10 upgrade was offered. What this free upgrade attempt left me was this bug has left me is a constant
 error code C1900101-30018. Does anyone know how to get rid of this error code without the need to clean wipe my computer and start re-installation all over again. Honestly, if there is no simple fix, it is probably easier to throw the computer in the garbage
 bin and buy a MAC.

            Looks the problem is not software related but hardware related.
<br />If you can still get into windows right click your start button and select run.
<br />Type the following.
<br />
<br />perfmon /report
<br />
<br />Space after the perfmon.
<br />Run that and send us that so we can see what is going on.
<br />
<br />Also go to search and type memory and run the memory diagnostics.
<br />And This maybe an issue with your drivers. 
<br />Try these steps. 
<br />
<br />Select the Start button, type Device Manager, and select it from the list of results. 
<br />Update all your drivers for all your devices (network card, usb etc)
<br />Select Search automatically for updated driver software and follow the on-screen instructions to update the drivers. 
<br />If no updates were found, then right-click on the mouse select Uninstall. 
<br />Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />And if none of the above works then best to go to the vendors site and download the latest drivers for your device.
<br />So for example, if your computer is a Dell Latitude then you would go here.
<br /><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/latitude-3570-laptop/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/produ...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure to download the drivers for the system type of your machine.
<br />To find this out go search and type system.
<br />Look for the system type.
<br />It will either be 32bit or 64bit.

<p>Hi Jamie,<br />
<br />
Conflicts with the latest update is one of the possible reasons why the display language of your computer changed itself back to English. To resolve this, you can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Control </strong><strong>Panel</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Clock, Language, and Region</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Language</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Advanced </strong><strong>settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Use </strong><strong>language </strong><strong>list </strong><strong>(</strong><strong>recommended</strong><strong>)</strong>.</li><li>Then, download the language pack for your language and select it as a <strong>
Display Language</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, don't hesitate to get back to us.<br />

<p>Thanks Eric, but the problem is that I can't download the language pack. Control panel is telling me that "A language pack isn't available" as you can see in the screenshot. How do I resolve this? Can I download the language pack from another source?&nbsp;</p>

            I would concentrate on these:
<br />Intel Chipset SW
<br />Intel Trusted Execution
<br />Realtek Card Reader
<br />
<br />However, after a Reset or Clean install, if it were me I would reload a full driver set!

            Well from looking at that page on the Toshiba site, there is no ISO download, so it looks like each driver has to be loaded separately . . .

<h2>            Dial up connection error with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have <strong>Nokia 5800 XM</strong> and I connect internet using <strong>Nokia suit</strong>. It worked well before on
<strong>win 8.1</strong>. But after <strong>upgrade to win 10</strong> it doesn't connects. When i tried to install Nokia suit on win 10 , it said that it needs
<strong>windows media feature pack</strong>. I connected same phone via <strong>Bluetooth personal area network</strong> which worked fine. I downloaded the update using same dial up. After installation and restart, computer won't connect to dial up which was
<strong>working fine before update</strong>. It also doesn't connects via Nokia suit.(Connection tried through both Data Cable and Bluetooth). I think that it is some
<strong>problem with the update KB 3010081</strong>. I also tried to turn off Windows features but that won't help.</p>
<p>

<p>...before installing KB 3010081 Bluetooth modem was working fine, because i remember it disconnecting 2 or 3 times while using IDM as it normally did (on Bluetooth, re-connection successful afterwards) , but after restart, it didn't even connect. it stucks
 on verifying user name and password.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>...there are 3 or 4 errors i have received while trying different methods like error 628 and 629. sometimes it said that connection could not be established.</p>
<p>After uninstalling my modem so that i could reinstall it, computer didn't recognize the device, for which i had to uninstall and reinstall all the possible network drivers.

<p>Now its been a while with this issue as i have seen for many users, so please help us all out.</p>

            <p>Hi Arbab,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might arise due to firewall from the security software, so I would suggest you to disable (<strong>preferably uninstall</strong>) the security software (if any) installed in the system and check if the issue is reproduced.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 handwriting editing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jpg0002  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 handwriting editing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>The Pro 3 handwriting had a really useful feature: editing a word (tap in the text and the word appears in the handwriting area, with each letter separated).
</p>
<p>Is there any feature like this for the Pro 4? </p>
<p>Other than erase-a-word-with-backward-line, are there any other editing techniques for handwriting for the Pro 4?</p>
<p>Any tutorials out there for those who have switched from Pro 3 to Pro 4?</p>
<p>Any way to revert to the Pro-3 way on the Pro 4?</p>
<p>Any apps that work better than the installed default?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help. Searching online didn't yield much.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Hey Paul,</p>
<p>I found this <a href="http://www.lovemysurface.net/train-windows-10-handwriting-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
site&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;that shows how to train the Pro 4 to learn your handwriting and improve recognition. If you still can't see the options like the site shows, then I guess you'll could open a support ticket with Microsoft.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Why Did Windows Update Agent 7.6.7600.320 List 122 Updates Required &#40;Some Already Installed in 2011&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My PC is set to notify me about that updates are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thursday, Nov. 27, I received notification of 2 important updates for Windows 7.&nbsp; The only thing I noticed was that it took a long time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Saturday, Nov. 29, I got a notification that I had 122 - yes, 122 - important updates -<strong> some going back to 2011 and according to my update history had already been installed.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; So now I see that not only only did I get SP 1 KB976932 and
 update KB2977759, but something weird called Windows Update Agent 7.6.7600.320 (?) that I have never encountered before in my update history.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Can this be fixed?&nbsp; I'm not a computer expert.&nbsp; I just want to keep my computer up to date.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. I read your instructions several times and found then very helpful. But I admit to being defeated by the How to Use Sky (now One) Drive video.&nbsp; Partly&nbsp;because I have vision problems and can't see the screen very well.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;seems&nbsp;I now have a OneDrive but
 it's&nbsp;name&nbsp;is:"<em>mypersonalemai</em><em>lOneDrive</em>"and I don't want that email publicized.&nbsp; So how can I delete OneDrive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;Discretion being the better&nbsp;part etc. , I ran the Update Troubleshooter&nbsp; - nothing - so&nbsp;just installed all 122 updates. That took a long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Two days later, I got a message for another 6 updates - already there&nbsp;far as&nbsp;I&nbsp;could see- but installed them again and checked Installed Updates rather than History.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I see&nbsp;this is a persistent problem. &nbsp;<a href="http://http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/windows-updates-keeps-repeatedly-installing-the/eef86e6b-4b5e-4fd3-9732-41d65d2a5c12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/windows-updates-keeps-repeatedly-installing-the/eef86e6b-4b5e-4fd3-9732-41d65d2a5c12

    <title>Compatible 360 Game not registering&#47;loading on Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lacey lady rain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Compatible 360 Game not registering&#47;loading on Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>I received (in September 2016 and am still struggling)&nbsp;a brand new 2 disc xbox one compatible game of the year edition Red Dead Redemption game. Xbox one will not register/acknowledge the discs, so I cannot download/play the game. I contacted Xbox/Micrsoft and Rockstar and spent months&nbsp;via chat and phone trying everything they could think of with no success. It has to be a setting or something on my system because I tried the game in my boyfriend's Xbox One and it worked fine. This is my first gaming system since Nintendo and Atari (yes, I grew up old school) and I have never owned another Xbox system (no 360 or kinnect or any of that). My boyfriend was so excited to get me this game and proud of himself because he knew I loved watching him play, so we are both rather upset. &nbsp;I know it is console, not disc related, but I'm confused as to why it won't work on my system,&nbsp;how do I fix this? PLEASE HELP!!!!</p>



<p>*Also, the console is a Halo special edition one, not sure if that matters?</p>

I sent aessage saying I've done nothing wrong which is when he said "kys" and then "reported" which is when I was banned. Can I be unbanned by any chance and maybe ban him although he does have multiple accounts, it would make me feel better.</p>
