<h2>            I want my computer back the way it was.. Any chance&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    For the last 2+ years everytime I get an MS update I go through all kinds of problems with this computer and it takes me months to get it back running the way it should. This last MS update I was having so many problem with it running, that I did a system
 restore.. I had no clue this had changes so much from Windows 8. It removed so many apts that I have spent days looking for these to download again.&nbsp; It removed my virus software, my malware, games I had downloaded&nbsp; AND ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE.&nbsp; I will be
 more than glad to copy and paste all the thing this system restore removed if needed. Now I have no sound at all. The videos will play, the light on the speakers are lit, but no sound.&nbsp; I have ran 3 trouble shooters that tell me that the speakers are working
 fine. NO THEY ARE NOT.&nbsp; I have check all connections and even gone into chrome settings to try some of the&nbsp; ideas others have given me about turning some of these off.&nbsp; If I could do without MS p

<p>That's interesting ... I have all the same updates as you, and yet my computer doesn't have any trouble at all.</p>

</p><p>That's not to say that I&nbsp;<em>like</em> everything about Windows 10. Actually, I think that a lot of Windows 10 is plain

</p><p>The only way to 'get your computer back' is to restore a backup. System Restore is

<p>
</p><p>1. a clean install, because it sounds like your computer is really messed up;</p>
<p>2. start making daily image backups; and</p>

I do have a backup that I did late last year. I wish I had thought about doing that.&nbsp; I bet even my keycodes would have been on them and I would not have had to buy new software. Now to find that since I have been remodeling my house. Yikes don't' have a clue&nbsp;
 where it's at, but will certainly try to find. Oh I was getting blue screens, white screens and black screen after that MS update so I thought I would cure all by doing a system restore. It worked on windows 8 but no way on 10.. My computer is only 3 1/2 yrs
 old and I keep everything updated.&nbsp; I have a gaming computer with Windows 10 Pro, 1TB ram and 380 GB of&nbsp; memory, . AMD FX Quad core&nbsp; processor, and Cox is my ISP. I should not be having these problems but every single time I get an update something goes wrong.&nbsp;
 MS only tells me that this is not what they intend to happen with the updates.

            Ah okay, I've struggled with that myself before. &nbsp;There's a couple things you'll probably want to check. There's the share permissions, then there is also the folder permissions. They're separate, but both need to be opened up for the share to work.
<div><br />
<div>So the first place is under the Sharing tab/Advanced Sharing/Permissions. &nbsp;The other one is on the Security tab. &nbsp;In both cases, you want to allow "everyone" to "read".</div>

    <title>VSS and SPP problem when ran backup to external hard drive and Volume - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            VSS and SPP problem when ran backup to external hard drive and Volume Shadow Copy Service problem when tried to Change Backup Settings &#40;0x80042302&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>I encountered a problem that i can not backup my system by using backup and restore function in win7. I had it done before and i have a backup image in my external hard drive. Several days ago the system tried to backup again due to the set backup schedule,
 but it failed all the time.</p>
<p>Firstly popped up a window saying that: "A shadow copy could not be created. Please check "VSS" and "SPP", application event logs for more information. Details: A Volume Shadow Copy Service component encountered an unexpected error. Check the Application
 event log for more information. "&nbsp; and offering two options: 1. Try to run backup again, 2. Change backup settings. Because failed for the first one, so i clicked on the second one and another pop up:</p>
<p>"The backup application could not start due to an internal error: A Volume Shadow Copy Service component encountered an unexpected error. Check the Application event log for more information. (0x80042302)."</p>
<p>I searched the internet for solution telling that, like, start Volume Shadow Copy Service in Service, increase the space in disks for system protection, and reboot the computer, etc. I think i tried that all, but the problem is not solved at all.</p>
<p>Also, i tried restoring the system by using restore point, it failed again.</p>
<p>Is there anyone could help?&nbsp; Very appreciated!</p>
<p>Chinhiunvun</p>

            Look for the CBS log folder in Windows CBS log folder. It might be the reason why so much space is used up.
<br />
<br />Also use the following to find and delete large log files:

            Hi uomo1885, this is the problem, and it is very common at the moment, that folder is meant to be 50 - 200MB
<br />
<br />OK, here is the Fix:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type services and hit Enter to open the Services app 
<br />
<br />Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it 
<br />
<br />Set its startup type to Manual 
<br />
<br />Restart your System
<br />
<br />Then open Windows File Explorer 
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS 
<br />
<br />Delete all of the files in the CBS folder 
<br />
<br />Restart your PC 
<br />
<br />Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup

            Hi, if you can alter the pole rate to 125 hertz this will sort the lag out. I have seen posts saying this can be done in the game options, others saying you do it via software it came with, on a PC

            <p>Rajeswhwari,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think this is a problem with the ClearType setting. All the other browsers and programs do not have blurry text, but only Edge browser does. The problem seems to disappear when the NVidia graphics forces the application to be run on High-Performance
 NVidia driver, but not with the integrated driver; this has to be related to the coding or driver issue, not individual user's setting issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do check. I like Edge browser, but I do not want to ruin my eyesight for that.</p>

            <p>Yeah, it helps, but how do I keep this emulation active?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because every time I restart the Edge, it reverts back to blurry fonts. The "solution" works only with Developer tools open.</p>
<p>"Persist emulation settings" doesn't help.</p>

    <title>Unmapping a networked drive in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unmapping a networked drive in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>While running Windows 7, I mapped a couple of networked drives in a NAS drive and accessed them successfully as Y: and Z: drives.&nbsp; I did not think to unmap them before I upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; Trying to unmap them now from File Explorer, I right-clicked
 This PC and when the drives showed, right-clicked them and selected Disconnect, which seemed to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in File Explorer, the two drives still show in what I think is called the Navigation Pane on the left, and the Network Drive icon has a red X through it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get rid of these two entries?</p>

            Before posting my question to the TechNet forum, I happened to need to reboot the PC.&nbsp; When I looked again afterwards, the networked drives had gone from the Navigation Pane.&nbsp; So I guess the complete answer is to first disconnect the drives, then reboot
 the PC.<br />

<p>The thing that determines if an account is a child account is the Date of Birth (DOB) that was put onto an account when it was ORIGINALLY setup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that DOB is still under 18 by law it has to have an adult account attached to it in the family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can actually have multiple adult accounts in a family so just because there is already an adult account in your family is not what is holding you up it is the DOB when the account was originally setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the DOB on the account will not affect the DOB for the Xbox profile once an account is setup the DOB thats put in is the DOB that the Xbox profile sees and it is set in stone there is no way to change that.</p>

    <title>FIFA 17 on Xbox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> monetaryink324  say:</h3>
<h2>            FIFA 17 on Xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm a Korean student who has great enthusiasm of playing FIFA. This year after hearing the news about FIFA 17, especially about THE JOURNEY mode, I was so impressed and I could not wait to play it. I've had xbox since I was 12, and for a while I was not
 playing games to focus on my school works. Now that I'm in college and I have grown up to be a man I have continued playing games on xbox. FIFA 17 was the very first game since 2012. What happened is that I was hoping to play FIFA 17 The Journey mode and after
 buying it I found out on the game that there was no THE JOURNEY mode on the game. I wouldn't have bought it if there was no THE JOURNEY mode available. And after searching for information, there was any information on the explanation about FIFA 17, but rather
 I found the information on the Korean private web site. I was so disappointed to XBOX because there was no info at all about how we cannot play THE JOURNEY mode on XBOX 360.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like a compensation on this matter. OR a refund. But I do believe your company will be in favor of my compensation. IF not is it possible for me to play FIFA 17 with new XBOX ONE without buying it?</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that $70 is not a small money for a freshman college student please take this issue seriously. Thank You</p>

            Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 - Windows Mahjong App error code 0x8e5e04b6</h2>
                    <p>Having problems with Windows Mahjong App. It used to work but came up with the error code 0x8e5e04b6.</p>
<p>I have tried removing and downloading it several times but keep getting the same error.</p>
<p>I am still able to run other Windows games Apps and the&nbsp;link into my xbox&nbsp; account with no problem and have checked that my Apps are set to auto update and sync as suggested on the forum.</p>
<p>I have even changed from Ethernet connection to Wifi to see if it makes any difference but no luck.</p>
<p>Also&nbsp;tried rolling back to a previous restore point before fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Appreciate if someone could help me resolve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<h2>            Xbox app asks for a pin but i don&#39;t have one</h2>
                    <p>i have seen other people with this problem and they say go to settings - accounts - sign in options yet there is no sign in options there is sign in and passkey but in there there is no pin delete or create a pin, you can create a passkey but that is 6 numbers
 when the app asks for four numbers. Is the microsoft moderators giving us the wrong or incorrect answers??</p>

<br />
<br />Enter the following command then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage

<br />install the 8.30 version which Microsoft is replacing Skype 12 with on Windows 10:

<br />
<br />Still not working:
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />File a bug report so the engineers are aware of the problem.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />NOTE: We’re letting you know that support for Skype version 7 will end on November 1, 2018 on desktop devices and November 15 on mobile and tablet devices. When support ends, we’ll begin requiring updates to version 8. Although you may be able to use older versions for a little while longer.
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. Since September 2018, we started seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<div>Hi, I've recently reinstalled my entire OS system on Dell vista desktop computer (Windows Vista Home Premium Bit SP1, Intel Celeron)<br />
<br />
It's stating that "The network adopter "REALTEK RTL8101 FAMILY PCI-E FAST ETHERNET NIC (NDIS 6.0)" is experiencing driver or hardware related issues."
<br />
<br />
My internet connection on main computer is working fine. But from my router to dell computer's internet connection is not working. I'm not using wireless. The computer is directly connected to the router by ethernet cable.
<br />
<br />
What do you think is the problem? How can I fix it?</div>

<h2>            Just freed 1gb of space and no space instantly</h2>
                    i've had this problem for a month, been looking for solutions all over the internet but i can't find any answer.. the problem is in my 2nd partition total of 100gb winddirstat shows that i have a total of 90gb memory used(i run it in administrator) but
 still windows warn that i have full disk space at drive d: and in my computer folder it shows that i only have 64mb of space.. then i deleted a total of 1gb of space.. then when i click refresh in my computer folder it instantly become 104mb.. note that this
 is 2nd partition so running disk cleanup will only erase the contents in recycle bin and the pagefile.sys is in drive c: and i also deleted the recovery points because i read somwhere on the internet that it eats alot of space but i guess if i just restored
 my windows it would have fixed it, i've dug my own grave.. if there is a way that will not erase all of my files that would be helpful VERY<br />

            <p>You basically need to find what is using the space. Providing you still have the required space on the operating system drive download and install Treesize Free from Jam Software. This will analyse the disk and give a list of the size of each directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you know where the space is being used you can then work out what might be causing it and what needs to be done.</p>

            WinDirStat has the same function as the one you mentioned and it shows that i only have used 90gb of space.. but when i click properties on drive d: it shows that i only have less than 100mb of space; 100gb total<br />

            <p>No you need to know what IS using the space not so much what free space you have. I appreciate the discrepancy between the 90GB of used space and the 100MB of free space but you need to derive both values from the same utility. Disk Properties only does
 a rudimentary analysis, compare how quickly in responds to what true analysis takes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from anything else you need to generate more space as below 15% free can stop some disk management.</p>

            WinDirStat is viewing an unkown space that eats 8.9gb space..now i have this new problem but i think it's related, i deleted a folder that costs 5.5gb im having doubts that i might need it or not.. so i decided to restore but i can't seem to do so it says
 "the folder is in use make sure to close the application using the folder" so i decided to cut the file and paste it in my external drive.. and it's copying the file and it won't stop until my external gets full, right now the copying file is about 9gb but
 the folder i cut is only 5.5gb.. the file is still being copied

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate that you are concerned by about partition D but partition C needs to have 12gb free disk space for your system to run efficiently.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My first suggestion is that you are making the most of what Disk CleanUp has to offer.
</span><span>A new function was added to Disk CleanUp in October 2013, which is not available in cCleaner. You need to change existing settings to take advantage of the new function. Type
<strong>Disk CleanUp</strong> in the Search Box above the Start Button and press the ENTER key. Click on OK and after the space calculation you will see a window with a list of Files to delete. Use the scroll bar to the right of the window to see hidden entries
 further down the list. Check the boxes before <strong>Service Pack BackUp Files</strong> and
<strong>Windows Update CleanUp</strong> and click on OK If you do not see <strong>
Windows Update CleanUp</strong> then click the <strong>Clean up system files</strong> button. You will see savings every time after Windows has been updated but they are not as significant when it is run after the first time. You need to restart the computer
 to complete the process. . I also recommend you click on the More Options tab, System Restore and remove all but the latest System Restore point.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In your first post you made this comment.<br />
<strong><em>i also deleted the recovery points because i read somwhere on the internet that it eats alot of space</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you aware that System Protection should only be monitoring your C partition. It should not be monitoring D or any external drive. If it is turn it off.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am not sure that WinDirStat is working for you. If it was you would know what is causing your unexpected increased disk usage. You can encounter software that hides files but is less of a problem so I feel that is most likely
 not your problem. I suggest you uninstall WinDirStat <span>&nbsp;</span>and use Treesize to investigate disk space usage. To download and install Treesize (freeware) go here:<br />
</span><span><span><a href="http://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</span></a>
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Post the names and the sizes of the 6 largest folders and the total at the top of the list.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your computer case permits you could benefit from adding a second internal hard drive.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you having internet connection problems? Your Realtek network connection has been disabled. You may choose to update Realtek LAN driver to version 7.049.0927.2011:<br />
<a href="http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=2889#driver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=2889#driver</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the driver and copy it to a folder on your desktop. Write down the path to the folder. If the driver has been zipped you will need to right click on the file and extract to your folder.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Next type Device Manager in the Search box above the Start button and press ENTER. Locate and right click on the device and select Properties. Click on the Driver tab and the Update Driver
 button. Click on “Browse my computer for driver” and click the Browse button. Type in the Search box the file path to your folder and click on Next. The system should find the driver in your folder and update. If it does not find the driver recheck that the
 driver is not zipped.</span></p>

<h3> jlinc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update to Windows Vista Home Premium with Service Pack 1 failing with error code 80091007.</h2>
                    I have a Windows Vista Home Premium laptop. &nbsp;Since I got it in 2008, it has NEVER successfully performed a Windows Update of the Vista Service Pack #1. &nbsp;It has failed every time, causing (I believe) the WINSXS directory to grow to a whopping 97GB (of a
 140GB hard drive. &nbsp;The error code I just got was 80091007. &nbsp;My laptop is a fine computer, and I mostly use it to browse the web. &nbsp;It seems silly to junk the laptop just because Vista updates NEVER work, causing (I believe) my Hard Drive to just get increasingly
 cluttered until it chokes. &nbsp;Help !!!

    <title>4K not working with splitter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> all nighterlong  say:</h3>
<h2>            4K not working with splitter</h2>
                    <p><span>A while ago I got a new 4K monitor, a Samsung UE510.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From what I understands it has two ports that support 4K, one at 30hz one at 60hz. My Xbox has had no issues upscaling resolution to that when directly wired.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><span>However, because I have multiple devices that support 4K I got a HDMI switch too. One that specifically supports 4K at 60hz, which my Xbox requires. Plug it in.
 All my other 4K devices have no issue. However my Xbox displays a black screen or when I send it off to low res mode, says my monitor doesn’t support 4K.</span></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><span>I’ve tried new switches, hdmi cables, switching ports. But to no avail. Any help would be appreciated.</span></p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>it won't be a solution, but a possible issue would be that the communication between console and monitor(or TV) is hindered by the switch(es) resulting in it not recognizing each other properly.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if there is anything that can solve it though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you are participating in the Xbox Insider Program then be sure to report the issue.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately not all HDMI switch boxes are created equal.&nbsp; Does this switcher say it supports HDMI 2.0 and HDR?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This maybe the reason why it's not working perhaps.</p>

            Yes, I made sure to check. And the splitter does indeed support hdmi 2.0 and HDR (although my monitor does not support it)

<p>I'm not sure why it is, but I've used a few switch boxes over the last few years with various levels of success.&nbsp; I've had switch boxes that worked great with my old displays, but then didn't work with my new one.</p>

<p>Why do you keep saying this rubbish??</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Xbox One X already comes with a high speed HDMI cable, it's not 'Gold Plated' and works perfectly well for 4K and HDR at 60Hz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the cable won't make any difference here.&nbsp; The issue is with the switcher.</p>

<h2>            Keyboard disconnects on start-up&#58; have to reboot for it to work.</h2>
                    I thought I was having a problem with the password box not accepting input, but then noticed that the keyboard lights are off and the keyboard is unresponsive, sometimes, on start-up. This requires a RESTART which corrects the problem. Running Windows
 7. Any thoughts?
