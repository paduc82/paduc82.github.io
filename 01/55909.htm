<h2>            Skype claiming to be signed in, but showing no contacts as available and not sending or receiving messages</h2>
                    <p>Starting his afternoon, my desktop version of skype is showing me as signed in, but showing all contacts as offline and not sending or receiving messages. On my tablet messaging is working fine at the same time (through the same connection), and contacts
 are showing up as online. I'm using Windows 7. I've checked that Skype and IE are both up to date, and even did a fresh install of Skype, with no effect.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, before it cut out entirely, I was getting large lag spikes on messages, and they'd sometimes take more than minute to actually send, or not send at all until the other person replied (as well as me not receiving theirs until I sent another
 of my own).</p>

            <p>Mine is not limited to Video and TV. Matter of fact it seems to be related to all windows store apps, even the compressed file unpacker (compressed folder tools). The names have changed to be like : @{Microsoft.WindowsStore_2015.25.24.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe?ms-resource://Microsoft.WindowsStore/Resources/StoreTitle}</p>
<p>or in the case of video :</p>
<p>@{Microsoft.ZuneVideo_3.6.16941.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe?ms-resource://Microsoft.ZuneVideo/resources/IDS_MANIFEST_VIDEO_APP_NAME}</p>
<p>Whether the change in name has something to do with it I have no idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using windows defender as a firewall but I also have AVG antivirus and have cleaned the system with Malwarebytes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to start the store, there is no error. But when I try to start a video with Video and TV there is an error:</p>
<p>The remote procedure call failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its not a huge deal because I've already changed my defaults but it would be more convenient if the programs that were pre-installed would work.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So much for the Bang and Oulfsen sound system that I had. Event viewer shows&nbsp;that with a&nbsp;series of kernel-pnp then User pnp that ended with the same device management service added.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a sports car taken away and given a rent-a-wreck. Of course MS knows what's best for me. When you think about it, how did people even survive before MS came along?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So much more was changed that I can't undo. It's funny that the firewall log states that I requested this very much unwanted update. Do those at MS feel better believing I requested this update instead of knowing they stole from me what I bought and paid
 for? Then again, I don't know anymore who owns my computers seeing as I have no control over&nbsp;them anymore. Another example, I want nothing to do with bluetooth but I can't get rid of it. Reboot and it's back. You really did a number on my automotive diagnostics
 computer that was running version 7 pro. God only knows what that useless thing is now. That's from Ford and MS does the programing for them. You can't stay out of your own way. Genius. Remember when updates showed up in updates and could be undone? Remember
 when a beta version was a beta version? Everything is a beta version now and everyone is a pawn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get to my MS account the password didn't work anymore and I couldn't reuse the same one. Why? It's not my computer that gets hacked to get mine and everyone else's information. It's Yahoo. Sony, MS, Facebook, etc., etc., etc. I guess pretending you are
 doing something is pretending you are doing something meaningful. Imagine if you just left my computer alone?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will I ever have sound again? Sound that will still be there after a reboot?</p>

<h2>            REALLY slow boot and shutdown on Windows 8.1 after forced shutdown.</h2>
                    <p>I work with a laptop Lenovo z50-70 with Windows 8.1 installed, this problem has been happening 3 times by now, usually it starts with me playing some game when suddenly there is a freeze or other problem that leads me to shutdown the pc by force using the
 power buttom. Prior to this my laptop would take up to around 1 hour to both boot on and turn off. After that it would run normally except i would have to reconnect to my wifi and fix the audio devices that will be disabled for some reason. Same happens when
 trying to run on safe mode.</p>
<p>Curiously this started happening right arder one day there were 2 consecutive s while imy laptop was connected without battery.</p>
<p>I usually resign myself to making a formatting of the pc and it fixes the problem... for a week or so, and then this happens again eventually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: i managed to fix the "CNBJ2530.DPB" corruption by using restorehealth on normal mode (safe &nbsp;was the reason it sent me an error) BUT my laptop still takes up to 1 hour to boot up a little less to turn off.<br />

<h2>            Windows Defender won&#39;t update</h2>
                    <p>I did a disk cleanup on C drive&nbsp; with the ( windows disk clean up) found in properties and clean up system files.&nbsp; Well after I used it my windows defender will not update it says it did not update because of an internet or networking connectivity. Everything
 else works fine including my internet. Also I have a&nbsp;SSD so I have my system restore set small so I can not do a system restore. I hate the thought of&nbsp; installing the OS again to cure this problem</p>

            <p>I was&nbsp;able to manually update it thanks.</p>
<p>I feel this maybe a flaw in the OS as the only thing I did was use disk cleanup ( I have used it before but this was the first time I used&nbsp;it to clean up system files)&nbsp; there was no down loads or anything installed on this PC. I did increase my system restore
 size for the future</p>

    <title>Conexant SmartAudio HD Sound Problem. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simeon morris  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conexant SmartAudio HD Sound Problem.</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP ProBook 455 G3 which I have for 4 months. I have windows 10 with &nbsp;Conexant SmartAudio HD and recently been experiencing problems. I would turn on my laptop and my sound would not turn up. I went into troubleshoot and I was told to restart to
 allow updates to finish. That happened a few times this week. Now ever so often the quality of the bass in my headphones and external speakers have been muffled. I've turned audio enhancements on and off and there isn't any difference. Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Just to tell you how random the occurrence of this is, when I posted this problem I was having problem and now it has started to work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions, I'm not too sure when it started but it happens on random occasions, lets say it started about 2-3 months ago.However, the past two days my audio has been disabled and when I click the speaker level icon in the bottom right corner
 of my screen a troubleshoot runs automatically, then they tell me i have to restart my PC. Today has been the first time in a while since I've has muffled sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't done any updates, but I downloaded some software which was LTSpice XVII and CircuitMaker. I would assume since i don't shut down my computer often that the PC would need to restart for the program to fully install but I've been using the programs
 fine, and what does these programs have to do with my audio anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have tried using different headphones and got the same problem, and when I said external speakers I meant the speaker for the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No Bluetooth devices used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The troubleshooter was automatically done. When completed it told me to restart computer. After i got my volume to adjust with no muffled sound. Only recently it has been acting up.</p>

<h3> gazoya  say:</h3>
<h2>            Playing Tag Matches with a friend</h2>
                    
<p>So when I play ranked tag matches online, I noticed that sometimes I would fight against two people using their own gamer tags as opposed to [Gamertag](1). I play with my brother in ranked tag matches as a guest most of the time. So how do these people play
 on the same 360 with separate gamer tags? Just recover your account on the 360 you're playing on? Also when you play tag matches with 2 separate gamer tags, does the person who recovered (if that's how it works) their tag get credit to their statistics?</p>

<p>Pretty sure they get credit for their stats since it's their GT. As for how? You simply have a friend come over or you go over to their house with your GT loaded onto a memory card. You can also recover your GT on their 360 or vise versa. Once that's done,
 just simply pick up the second player controller and sign in. From there, you can just let your friend choose the tag match and wait to select your character.</p>

Thank you so much for your help. I am using the Skype for Business Web app. When I click on the link in the meeting invitation, I go to a webpage and then it provides a link to open the app.&nbsp; Neither of these helped: "<span><span>If

<br />

Below the title (listed above) is the following:&nbsp; The procedure entry point hrlslpStateCheckingEnabled could not be located in the dynamic link library netshell.dll<br />

I have also received a similar location .dll message when accessing the printer.&nbsp;

            Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
Have you installed the MSN application?&nbsp; Once you went from XP to Windows 7 the application would not be installed anymore and would need to be installed.

            Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; Yes, I did reinstall MSN.&nbsp; It is working now, but just the pesty error box pops up at the login screen.&nbsp; I click OK and it goes away and I am able to get into MSN.&nbsp; It is just an annoyance at this point.

            Well, I did go to registrypatrol.com&nbsp; The free scan identified registry dll issues, so I paid the price and purchased the product.&nbsp; While it "found" lots of issues, the dll issues that I am experiencing were not fixed.&nbsp; My husband attempted to download
 a newer version of MSN today in hopes that would clear the issue.&nbsp; However, we are not able to get the download to work properly.&nbsp; We are wondering if there is a problem with the MSN download site?

<p>No, I have not been able to correct the issue.&nbsp; I simply click the ok box before typing in the password, and all works.&nbsp; It's pesky, but only for a second.</p>
<p>Sorry (but secretly a little happy too) to hear that someone else has the problem.&nbsp; Maybe MSN will look a little more seriously at it now.</p>

<h2>            Unable to use microphones</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>Hello Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I've built my own PC (I used to have a laptop before), and I've run into a small problem. I am unable to use the microphone. I have a pair of Bose SoundTrue headphones. The cable is 4-pin (female). I bought the Female to 2 Male audio splitter (it
 splits the audio and the microphone), but that didn't work, and the computer did not record any sound. I downloaded the latest audio drivers for my motherboard, Realtek HD Audio Manager (Gigabyte Z97X Gaming 7), but still it didn't work. When I used Steam's
 voice settings to test my microphone, it worked when I pressed the buttons on the cable (where the microphone is), although I only heard the clicking of the buttons. The same happened when I used the Audio Devices Manager inside Control Panel to test my microphone.
 I click the buttons on the cable, and I can hear the buttons being clicked (and the playback from the computer). The computer picks up the button clicking, but it doesn't pick up my voice. I tested the microphone on my phone, and it did record sound, so I
 suspect something is wrong with my computer. I opened my PC up, and checked whether the front jack and headphone cables are plugged in correctly, and they were. When I speak into it, it does not pick up any sound whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could help that would be great!</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am sorry to know that you are having issues with the recording. I will be glad to assist you with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This might be due to some incorrect audio settings or it might be due to the outdated audio HD drivers. Let‚Äôs try the following methods and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1: </strong>Make sure that the Microphone is not disabled and is set as default.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Make sure that the microphone that you are using is not disabled and is set as default in the computer. Follow these steps to check this:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Right click on the volume icon and select ‚ÄúRecording devices‚Äù.</li><li>Now, right click on an empty space and select, ‚ÄúShow disconnected devices‚Äù and ‚ÄúShow disabled devices‚Äù.</li><li>Select ‚ÄúMicrophone‚Äù and click on ‚ÄúProperties‚Äù and make sure that the microphone is enabled.</li><li>You may also check if the microphone that you are using is set as default.</li></ol>
<p><span><strong>Step 2: </strong></span><span>I suggest you to set microphone as default device and check.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>a) Right click on the <strong>volume icon </strong>in the system tray and then click "<strong>Recording devices</strong>"</span></p>
<p><span>b) Right click on the blank space in the popped up window and then select "<strong>Show Disabled Devices</strong>" and "<strong>Show Disconnected Devices</strong>".</span></p>
<p><span>c) Right click on Microphone and then click "<strong>Enable</strong>".</span></p>
<p><span>d) <strong>Highlight the microphone </strong>and then choose "<strong>Set as Default Device</strong>".</span></p>
<p><span>e) Click <strong>Apply </strong>and <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, check the issue. If it is already enabled, then try the next method and check the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2: </strong>Run <strong>Recording Audio Troubleshooter</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This troubleshooter is an automated Windows 8 inbuilt tool which finds and fixes the common issues with the recording audio devices and its settings. Perform these steps to run this tool and check if that helps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Press ‚ÄúWindows Logo‚Äù + ‚ÄúW‚Äù keys from the keyboard.</li><li>Type ‚ÄúTroubleshooting‚Äù in the search bar and press ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù.</li><li>In the ‚ÄúTroubleshooting‚Äù window, click on ‚ÄúView All‚Äù on the left pane.</li><li>Click on ‚ÄúRecording Audio‚Äù.</li><li>Click on ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù and then click on ‚ÄúRun as Administrator‚Äù.</li><li>Click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</li></ol>
<p><span>If this does not help, then let‚Äôs try updating the sound card drivers and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 3:</strong> Update the Sound Card Drivers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1: </strong>Check the Windows updates for any latest driver updates.</span></p>
<p><span>Check in Windows updates if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2: </strong>Update Driver Software from the Manufacturer‚Äôs website:</span></p>
<p><span>Go to the computer or sound card manufacturer‚Äôs website and search for the latest Windows 8 audio drivers available for the sound card model and then install it by following the instructions given in the website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I hope the above suggestion helps. If you need further assistance, get back to us and we will be glad to assist you.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>Yesterday I fixed it by uninstalling the Realtek HD Audio Manager that provides the drivers for my Gigabyte Z97X Gaming 7 Motherboard. My microphone worked fine then using the default Windows 10 Drivers. The device is set to default and the troubleshooting
 can't detect anything. All the cables inside the computer are correctly connected. Right now I am reinstalling the Realtek HD Audio Manager and I'll see what happens.</p>

    <title>How can I use the Append Data permissio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bigdoggit  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I use the Append Data permissio</h2>
                    I see this tantalizing security permission "Append Data" for files but cannot seem to use it. Removing it disallows an individual to make any updates, not just updates to the end of the file. I am trying to understand what this permission is for or how
 to use it.

            I have read that exact document several times but I cannot get Windows to behave as the document says it should. That document clearly says the "Append Data" permission is intended for files and would allow or disallow a person from adding new data to
 the end of the file but not from changing, deleting, or overwriting existing data. When I turn this permission off no changes can be saved to the file. This does not coincide with what I read. Have you used this permission and made any sense of it? Has anyone
 used this permission successfully? Any thoughts on what is actually does instead of what a support article says it should do? If you have made it work could you please tell me how you did so I can recreate the situation. That would help me learn.

<p>Sorry but I've never used that permission. My experience with permissions is that you always want to be conservative. If you are just tinkering (and it&nbsp;<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">is</span>
</em>&nbsp; fun to play), then make sure you take an image using something like Acronis True Image before you make permissions changes. It is really easy to set something wrong and lock yourself out of Windows. If you have something you're trying to do with permissions
 in a domain or on a standalone workstation in order to accomplish a goal, then perhaps if you state that goal someone may have suggestions for you.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I was unable to help you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>This can arise out of corrupted Calendar folder. To resolve this issue, please rename your Calendar folder using the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close WL Mail, and any other WL programs </li><li>Click <strong>Start</strong> (then Run for Windows XP), paste the following path and press Enter
<strong><em>%Localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Calendars</em></strong> </li><li>Rename the folder of the account you use to sign in to Windows Live Mail to sync your calendar (ex. rename *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***).
</li><li>Restart your computer for changes to take effect. </li><li>Launch WL Mail again</li></ol>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            I'm having the same problem as posted above.&nbsp; I've been using WLM for 18 months or so without difficulty.&nbsp; Also, I'm not using WLM calendar at all.&nbsp; I found a suggested fix to rename a calendar file in the location c:\Users\(username)\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows
 Live Mail\Calendars.&nbsp; There are no files at this location - only a 48 byte file titled "dbstore.ini."&nbsp; I have repaired WL Essentials, but no help.&nbsp; Please advise.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;

<h3> katie8797  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1&#58;  HP GH82N DVD RAM Drives Fails to Burn</h2>
                    <p>My HP GH82N Dvd drive has stopped writing info since the beginning of September 2014.&nbsp; I have tried to rectify the problem by:&nbsp;
<br />
updating the DVD-Ram Driver through HP (the most recent driver is already installed, but didn't work with burning problem),
<br />
using your various "fix-it" <br />
programs; following the extensive manual fix by editing the registry, according to one of your posts, (didn't work)<br />
restoring and reformatting the hard drive (several times); researching similar problems with consumers on various sites
<br />
in regards to burning DVD's including yours looking for an alternative with no real resolve,
<br />
I've done virus scans, hardware and device scans, windows updates<br />
making sure that the driver update option is turned on, still have the problem.</p>
<p>This has been making me extremely frustrated which I know shows through in my post.&nbsp; I've been trying to fix this now for
<br />
2 weeks, several hours a day and going to bed at dawn.&nbsp; <br />
The only conclusion I can see is that it started in this month of September 2014 and that maybe recent 8.1 updates created the<br />
problem.&nbsp; My guess is that lately, your driver configuration updates have extreme difficulty in distinguishing between a
<br />
USB Flash device and a DVD RAM Drive.&nbsp; I would appreciate that a conclusion is in the near future if it comes with another<br />
update, or to resort back to what was done in prior months.&nbsp; Please let me know if there is another method that I haven't tried<br />
above besides purchasing another computer that does not have a Windows 8 operating system.&nbsp;

<p>This error has to do with Microsoft Active Sync. Here is a rather long but useful thread describing the problem.</p>

    <title>USB modem stick - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gauloisvorace  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB modem stick</h2>
                    <p>I use a USB modem to get online with my Surface pro 3. However it only works when the stick is plugged directly in the computer. When plugged in the docking station (USB 3.0 or 2.0 connectors) the stick &nbsp;is not detected and the computer won¬¥t go online.
 There is nothing wrong with the USB connectors on the docking station since they all work with ordinary memory sticks. Is there a technical reason why the modem does no work when plugged in the docking station ?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to us on the community forum. We understand you have trouble using your USB modem on a docking station. Are you using a Pro 3 docking station? What's the maker/model of the USB modem stick? Do other USB devices work in the same

            <p>Hi Clare,</p>
<p>I am using a Pro 3 docking station. My stick is from ZTE model LTE USM modem MF 823. Other sticks are working fine on the USB ports of the docking station.&nbsp; The settings for update is on automatic and a manual check says that they aren¬¥t any update to install.</p>
<p>As already written there is no problem when I connect the stick directly on the surface.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>We understand you have checked the update. Just to be sure, try manually checking and installing updates

</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>**Place Surface in the docking station, and make sure the docking station is getting power.**</strong></li><li>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and tap<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Settings</strong>.

You may need to restart Surface after the updates have been installed.</li></ol>
<p>After that, while the USB modem is also connected to the dock, go to device manger to see if the device recognizes the USB modem, Or, if you see a warning icon there. If you do see one, try&nbsp; running the Hardware troubleshooter.

<p>I have tried with two different USB modem sticks from HUAWEI. Both of them worked fine when connected to the docking station. The only problem&nbsp;being that they&nbsp;are not LTE (4G) compatible. That is the reason why I bought a new USB modem stick. It would be
 good if someone could investigate the ZTE stick compatibility with the docking station.</p>

<h2>            plugged in not charging</h2>
                    So I've got a relatively new SP3 (about 2 weeks old) and when I visit certain websites like a Facebook game, with it plugged in, the battery status says plugged in, not charging. However, if I go to a website like this, it says plugged in, charging. I've
 followed the steps put forth here:&nbsp;http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/surface-battery-wont-charge#solution4 to no avail. Any ideas on why it's doing this?

<h2>            How to Change Windows 10 Desktop Icons</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 on a 2 in 1 device.&nbsp; Unlike Windows 7, the option to change standard Windows desktop icons This PC, Recycle Bin, My Documents, etc.&nbsp; I have all the .ico files for the theme I want, but since the theme was originally created for Windows
 95 I can't just install the whole theme the usual way.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was surprised that a KB search only turned up how to do this with Windows 7 or earlier.</p>
