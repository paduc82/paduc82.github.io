    <title>No split screen in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kemperhill  say:</h3>
<h2>            No split screen in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp; have a computer I built and installed Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; I installed my dual DVI output graphics card and booted the computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is the monitors are mirrored.&nbsp; I have followed three articles from Microsoft and nothing will split the monitors.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp; have gone into Control Panel, Appearance and Personalization, Display, Display Setting and the compute only recognizes one monitor.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the articles said to go to CP, A&amp;P, Personalization and click on Display Setting but there is no display setting in Personalization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So could someone explain to me how to split the screens in W10.&nbsp; The computer I replaced was running W7 Pro and it split the screen when it booted.&nbsp; I have a second computer running W7 and it also split the screen when it booted.&nbsp; Is there a setting, or
 something, different in W10 that needs to be set, or changed.&nbsp; Thanks. </p>

            <p>Ok, that fixed the split screen problem, but another problem surfaced.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a 22" screen I use as the main screen and an 18" screen for the second screen.&nbsp; But the 18" screen is showing up as the 1 screen and I can't get the position of the screens
 to change.&nbsp; I have swapped the monitor VGA cables but that doesn't change the&nbsp; position of the screens.&nbsp; So, how to change the position of the screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the 18" screen is 1, and the 22" screen is two and I need the 22" screen to be 1, and the 18" screen to be 2.&nbsp; Thanks.

    <title>Using Windows 10 Photo Viewer how is it possible to burn an album to a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skings  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Windows 10 Photo Viewer how is it possible to burn an album to a CD or DVD&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We've created a large album for a school project with over 700 photos. We need this album on a CD or DVD. 2nd choice would be to save it to a thumb drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've found the share and upload option, but both options require use of OneDrive, which is taking a long time. Even after it is finished, we're still not sure it will give us a burn option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Related questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the file extension for a photo album?</p>
<p>Is it possible to find that folder and burn from it? If so, how?</p>
<p>If we tag these photos en masse using Photo Viewer, how can we assemble them from all their various folders into one folder using Windows Explorer?</p>
<p>If that is necessary, how then does one burn a folder to either CD or DVD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Service is being blocked, installation for a program on Windows 7. &#39;Hardlock&#39; service.</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am trying to install a program that used a service called 'Hardlock' to verify its license.<br />
But when installing Windows 7 is blocking the service from being installed and started.<br />
<br />
This worked on Windows XP.<br />
<br />
Any help would be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Hi Deano81,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers community. <br />
a.&nbsp;Which program are you trying to install?<br />
b.&nbsp;Is it compatible with windows 7?<br />
c.&nbsp;Are you getting any error messages while trying to install it?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Check for its compatibility in windows 7 using the below link.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</span></a>
<br />
<br />
Hardlock is not a Microsoft service. Windows Installer service is used by the Operating System to install any software/application and not any other service.
<br />
<br />
Try installing it and let us know the exact error message (if any).<br />
<br />
You may also try installing it in windows XP compatibility mode.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Program compatibility is a mode in Windows that lets you run programs written for earlier versions of Windows. Most programs written for Windows XP also work in this version of Windows, but some older programs might run poorly or not run at all.<br />

    <title>Ethernet access via a USB adapter from a Mac Book Air running Win10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ethernet access via a USB adapter from a Mac Book Air running Win10 under Virtual Box to swap OS.</h2>
                    <p>For work purposes need to have Ethernet access via USB adapter from my Mac Book Air running Win 10 under Virtual Box &amp; cannot get the Win system to run the Ethernet device.</p>
<p>It says it is Enabled but has NO Network Connection yet it is plugged into the Lan port on the router which if I drop back to the Mac OS all works fine as it seems to be easily able to find the router info such as IP Address &amp; Router IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Occasionally I see a page on the Win 10 system that looks like I can insert Router IP's etc &amp; other info but now it looks like I am locked out of that having tried many times to insert IP addresses the same as what the Mac OS picks up automatically every
 time I simply plug into the Lan port.</p>
<p>If I change Lan ports it comes up with that exact IP Address.&nbsp; The Mac OS seems to be able to find things easily &amp; adapt but Win 10 looks like a complete dunce in that area...NOW I really appreciate why I switched to a Mac years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The USB to Ethernet adapter is USB2 to Fast Ethernet Adapter ID from the Mac system says its a AX88722.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try the Help screens on Win 10 it wants Internet access which is rather hard to do when the thing will not connect to the Router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody any clues??</p>

            <p>Wow, lots of reading in that lot...but to no avail as in the process of going thru many bits &amp; pieces the USB to Ethernet device died on me.</p>
<p>Back to square 1..ugh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found another much more expensive device a USB 3 Gigabit Ethernet Adaptor at just under $60Aud which covers Win OS starting at XP right thru to Win 10 &amp; Mac OS 10.6 plus Linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Took quite a while to work out the enclosed instructions &amp; got it running on both the iMac desktop &amp; the Mac Book Air OK.</p>
<p>Then started on getting it to run on Win 10 under Virtual Box &amp; that's where the fun starts as Virtual Box is more or less the master OS &amp; Win 10 the slave so one has to duck &amp; dive between the 2 to get it to work. Once going it is very good.</p>
<p>However swapping back to the Mac OS is clunky as is going back the other way which I will need to do at times as I work on things &amp; as the documentation for the device is scant I am carefully doing a step by step instruction to move effortlessly between
 the 2 OS&nbsp; as well as being able to use it on the 2 Mac machines in normal Mac mode.</p>
<p>If anyone in future wants to know I can post info on this site.</p>

            <p>no, I reverted back to Windows 8.1...solved my problem</p>
<p>I cannot afford newer audio equipment just to compatible. Looks like Windows 8 will still be good for another 5 years anyway.</p>
<p>Then I will buy an Apple</p>

<p>You can't remove a card while it's attached to an active gold subscription. You'd have to either add a new card and have billing remove the old one, or wait for your gold to expire (make sure you have auto-renewal turned off) and then you can remove it.</p>

<h3> fotofundi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error code 80248014</h2>
                    <p>I recently bit the bullet and did a 'clean' instal of Windows 7 HP with SP2 as my computer had been taking 20mins or more to boot up after 3 years of continuous (ab)use. All was well for a few days, it downloaded and installed the 175 odd updates that Win7
 has accumulated so far. Some 10 days later I had a message saying my copy of Windows was still in the Trial period - despite having entered my key code during installation. I re-entered the key code and everything looked fine but next day later I noticed a
 message bottom right hand corner saying my version of Windows was not genuine (it is).</p>
<p>I then found that when trying to run Windows Update I got the message "Windows could not search for updates" and Error code 80248014. Following the link "Get help with this error" I downloaded and ran the MS 'FixIt' programme. It didn't seem to do anything
 but the message saying my copy was not genuine went away. However Windows update still comes up with the same message and error code and I cannot get updates.</p>
<p>Any suggestions how to fix this?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the information. The winwiki link didn't work, but I now suspect my hard disk is about to fail or large parts of it have already done so. Despite the 'clean' instal, it is taking longer and longer to boot and respond to input. The non-genuine
 Windows message has also reappeared, so I have done a full backup and ordered a new hard drive.</p>
Wish I got paid for the years I have spent sorting out problems on Windows and these darn machines!

<h2>            LOCKED ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
                    
<p>I have had to visit here WAY too often to ask, and I am sick of doing so, about LOCKED ACHIEVEMENTS. I have had SEVERAL at 100% and they are still staying locked up. WHAT THE HECK. Why? Why is it that ya'll can't fix this bug. Your Support personnel blames
 the router, the modem, the connection, then the GAME. Really? Why not take a look at YOURSELVES???? Why not take responsibility for YOUR coding bug? I'd believe it was the GAME, the ROUTER, the MODEM, or the CONNECTION, IF resetting all that mess and deleting
 and REDOWNLOADING EVERYTHING fixed it, but it DOESN'T! So, how about doing more than just placebos and BULL&amp;$^%, and actually FIX it? Is that really too much to ask? This is a simple fix guys. If a freakin cheeve is 100%, IT UNLOCKS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also spoke on chat to one of the tech help folks, Janice, who blamed the issue on the game. Yeah, see... no. It's not the game. It's XBL. MS. And maybe actually FIXING it would be nice, instead of trying to blame others.

<p>And, due to your condescending remarks and general bad attitude, sonny, let me state a fact. It is NOT a matter of 10 G, NOR even gamerscore, that is making me ***. It IS the issues of A: bad coding and bugs that are easy fixes, B: YOUR TECH SUPPORT SUCKING,
 C: People like YOU who are supposed to be able to defuse an irate customer instead of egging them on, and D: the PATHETIC support we as gamers get from folks here. 90% of the time, I can get better help from the trolls on /VG or /V at 4chan, and that is just
 pitiful. </p>
<p>You are supposed to be an ambassador, representing this company and system, helping gamers like yourself, and doing right. You are FAILING, boy. Do you have NO knowledge of dealing with the public? NO retail experience or Sales? Because, lemme tell ya kid,
 talking down to someone who's upset? All that does is embitter them towards A: continuing to use and/or promote your product and services, and B: create a greater issue of enmity that can end up biting you in the ***. You are supposed to be BETTER than the
 angry folks here, COOLER HEADED. You are only showing me, and others, that we are better served going elsewhere for support. YOU and people like YOU are the reason why so many jump ship to the PC instead of sticking on a console. It's pretty shameful, and
 sad. Especially when it could have been so EASY to defuse this. </p>
<p>YOU:" Hey, Sir, have you tried this stuff yet?"</p>
<p>ME: "Yeah, dude, not bleeping working"</p>
<p>YOU: "Well, I'm really sorry, lemme see if I can find out more" ACTUALLY GOES TO FIND OUT MORE</p>
<p>ME: "Well, gee, man, thanks."</p>
<p>YOU: "No prob dude. Hope it works out, I'll try to stay on it, holler at me in a week"</p>
<p>ME: "Thanks man." HAPPILY LEAVES FORUMS, FEELING SATISFIED WITH HELPFUL RESPONSE.</p>

<p>Only had problems with gamer score unlocking twice...</p>
<p>First time was Forza 5 with earned achievements unlocking after the next race, rather than when they should; it was consistent throughout the entire game.</p>
<p>Second was after my girlfriend got a new router; after port forwarding and getting a open N.A.T., no problems with achievements popping or syncing game saves.</p>
<p>I have two X Box One s, use my girlfriends quite frequently and, except for the above mentioned, haven't had a problem with achievements. Multiple friends haven't mentioned a problem with achievements either...leading a belief that the problem is on your
 end.</p>
<p>Strict, moderate, or open N.A.T.? Results of a speed test listing download, upload, ping, and packet loss? D.S.L., satellite, cable, radio, or cellular? Interference from Microwaves, baby monitors, cordless phones, or garage door openers? What color is your
 neighbors car, and who is your daddy? The answers to these questions would help the community help you.</p>

<p>Mauz try this solution, delete and re-download your profile, then go to the game that has the achievements that are still locked at 100% and start it, once you are logged in with the game, go to settings, network, go offline, then go back to the game so
 that you can see you have been logged out of the game servers, then go back to settings and go back online then return to the game and log back in, the achievements should unlock, you may have to try that a few times, but it should work, also just let you
 know it is usually the router lagging out as you unlock an achievement that causes the glitch, which prevents the profile from communicating with the game servers that it has completed the requirements for the achievements.</p>

                    <p>Original title : ID Thief Has Disabled Help Features On Neopets, Facebook &amp; Yahoo Answers In Order to Get Money From Me</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been dealing with a problem lately, On Friday, NP was stolen from my Neopets account, and the site&nbsp;<strong>claimed</strong> I had
<em>maxed</em> my challenge scores when I had not even played ONCE that day, fortunately, later on it was fixed. However, when I contacted the Neopets support center, they told me my email address was
<em>invalid</em>. </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also the ID thief <em>Michael</em> attempted to block my Facebook newsfeed so that he could isolate me from my contacts when he finally decided to commit a crime against me. When I tried to access the FACEBOOK help site, I got a similar message,
 it read&nbsp;<em>improper spelling</em> no matter <strong>how </strong>I typed in my request. One last thing happened on Sunday, I tried to extend a question about this criminal, the Edit bar had been deleted, so I could not do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What can I do if he uses the info that he has gotten from hacking into my computer to rob me &amp; my family? My grandma has a lot of money, also my Mom has an RRSP set up for me, I'm afraid he is going to use what he's found on my machine to figure
 out the passwords and drain my family of our finances. </p>

<h2>            Blue Screen of Death after update to Windows 10</h2>
                    After updating to Windows 10 in the middle of using the computer I got a blue screen that said it ran into a problem and needs to restart but as it begins to restart to goes back to the blue screen with a different error message. The computer will not
 go into safe mode but the Startup Menu works. I go to System Recovery to get my computer back to the way it was before the update and as its starting up again I get a different blue screen message saying the a problem and been detected and computer needs to
 restart. Basically it won't let me do anything without having an error message and having to restart. PLEASE HELP.&nbsp;

            Yes I keep getting error messages and no I haven't. Method 1 doesn't work because when I go to do a System Recovery it says there was an error and it restarts all over again. Method 2 doesn't work either.&nbsp;

<h2>            Service Pack 2 Build 6002&#58; This copy of Windows Vista is not genuine. </h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I bought my Dell XPS 420 about 2 years ago. April of 2008. However recently, I had this error where it would ask for an activation code, and to activate Windows now, or later. I also had a black screen as a background, I can't use the internet, I can't
 use System Restore, or Windows Update for that matter.</p>
<p>Many drivers would be shutting down by itself, such as Windows Explorer when I tried to launch it...</p>
<p>I also get a blue screen error, where it would say: "A fatal error has occured," and the computer would shut itself down automatically. Sometimes I can't even get onto the home page where I would log on...</p>
<p>I'm using Windows Vista 32 bit Home Premium if that matters.</p>

<p>
<span>Hi Itgranny,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Vista answers Forum!</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would like to ask few questions to help us focus in the right place.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>How long have you been facing the issues?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When was the last time it was working fine?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes to the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>I have few steps here that might fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>As a workaround, I suggest that you boot the computer in Safe Mode with Networking and check if you are able to access the folder, follow the steps below to boot the computer
 in safe mode with networking:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Restart your computer if it is powered on.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tap the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Once you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.</span></p>
<p>
<span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Use the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.</span></p>
<p>
<span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Select Safe Mode with Networking and press Enter.</span></p>
<p>
<span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You should see drivers loading, and then please wait.</span></p>
<p>
<span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You should then be at the Welcome Screen.</span></p>
<p>
<span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Additional Information:
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/323ef48f-7b93-4079-a48a-5c58eec904a11033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/323ef48f-7b93-4079-a48a-5c58eec904a11033.mspx</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the internet explorer is working fine,
</span><span>you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software
 conflicts. </span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>User Account Control permission</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>5. Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>6. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue is resolved check which third party is causing the problem, referring the link given below:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Note: ensure to boot the computer back to normal state, go to Step 7 in the above link.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, I suggest that you perform System File Checker [SFC] scan on the computer, which replaces the
 corrupted system files on the computer, follow the steps below to perform a scan:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to empty the temp folder and later follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Start&gt;&gt;type %temp% in the search box&gt;&gt;press enter&gt;&gt;delete everything present in the temp folder.</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box. </span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Calibrating pen on Windows 10 LTSB tablet does not include &#34;Pen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martinleroy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calibrating pen on Windows 10 LTSB tablet does not include &#34;Pen and Full Windows Touch Support&#34; on Tablet PC Settings dialogue box</h2>
                    <p>When trying to calibrate a pen touch device on a Windows 10 LTSB tablet, the "Tablet pc settings" dialogue&nbsp;box&nbsp;opens correctly, however, instead of Details stating "Pen and Full Windows Touch Support"</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79f8465e-c12c-417a-b2fd-b0bc0694c998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79f8465e-c12c-417a-b2fd-b0bc0694c998" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>the details give only "Full Windows Touch Support" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4dcfb223-1945-44af-b84e-95f99526eff6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4dcfb223-1945-44af-b84e-95f99526eff6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click the "calibrate" button, I only get an option&nbsp;to calibrate touch screen, not an option to calibrate my pen. I have 250 Lenovo Yoga 11e devices and all but one allow calibration of pen device.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As per the above screenshot that you have provided, I would like to know if the same issue exits when you boot&nbsp;onto your desktop. If no, then I&nbsp;recommend that you contact the manufacturer of your computer as the issue here lies with the BIOS which is unrelated

            <p>Hi Hari,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting&nbsp;your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the above information that you have provided, I&nbsp;understand that your screen&nbsp;splits into four when you log into the computer. Do you get the same effect when you are on the desktop screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persist even when you have sign-in the desktop, I suggest that you place your PC in safe mode and check if the issue continues in that mode as well. This will help us identify if the issue is with the drivers or the system as a whole. Safe mode
 starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue does not persist in safe mode, then&nbsp;I suggest that you install the latest update for your graphic drivers and check if the issue continues. To learn how to install driver updates, refer to the link below</p>

    <title>Windows reading audio devices being unplugged. Please help&#33;__ - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xef42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows reading audio devices being unplugged. Please help&#33;__</h2>
                    Recently my sound cut out while I was in the middle of playing a video game. I didn't think much of it and went into the audio playback devices to find that windows was reading my headset and speakers alike both being unplugged even though they are plugged
 in correctly.<br />
<br />
Actions taken<br />
-checked if sound drivers are up to date, which they were<br />
-checked if the system sound was at it's maximum, yes<br />
-uninstalled and reinstalled audio devices<br />
-used microsoft's automated sound troubleshooting service, only to get the answer of my audio device being unplugged.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I'm sure I have done much more over the past few days troubleshooting but those are the major and most common solutions that I've found. I find it very odd that this happens out of the blue while I am listening to music and playing a video game. Any help is
 MUCH appreciated!<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check in Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) to see if your on-board audio is enabled (if you have). If
<br />
you have a separate sound card it might have become unseated.<br />
<br />
Set all Windows Services to their defaults.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt;&nbsp; Services&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Check left side of page for your Windows version <br />
<a href="http://www.blackviper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.blackviper.com/</a><br />
<br />
====================================<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to see
<br />
if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take several
<br />
tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. I've previously already tried most of your suggestions without any success.<br />
<br />
While I am able to access my speaker/headset properties I cannot configure them, probably due to them being read as unplugged. As far as my headset microphone, it is being read but it's highlighted to it's maximum on the voice indicator which is abnormal and
 something I never saw before.<br />
<br />
Another interesting discovery was downloading realtek's audio manager. Realktek audio manager read that the front input/output jacks were plugged in, though, the back speaker jacks were not. However no sound came out of the front output jack (headset) even
 though it said it was plugged in and working. I was maybe wondering if picking up a usb audio output/input jack connector could be a short term fix, for my headset at least.<br />
<br />
Any other assistance is greatly appreciated. This has become quite stressful.<br />

            Hi dmkkg 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. A quick repair of Office will fix your file association issue. 
<br />
<br />Note for Office 2013 and below - Please repair only if you have product key with you as sometimes it asks for the product key again after the repair.
<br />
<br />How to Repair
<br />Windows Key+R &gt;  Type appwiz.cpl and Enter &gt; Click on Microsoft Office &gt; Click on Change on top (you can right click also) &gt; Change &gt; Now, you would get options to repair Office 
<br />
<br />2. For PDF, you will need to do it manually. 
<br />Start concerned app which you want to make default &gt; CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to open task manager &gt; Right click on this app (you may require to expand it and click on an entry) &gt; Properties &gt; Note down .exe file name
<br />
<br />Right click &gt; Open File Location &gt; Now, you have the location where this app's program location is
<br />
<br />Right click on the concerned file in File explorer &gt; Open with &gt; Choose another app &gt; More apps &gt; Look for another app on this PC &gt; Now go to that location which you picked up above and choose the exe file which you picked up above &gt; You can also choose Use this app always to open.... 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>before I do all this, can you please let me know if this happens with all computers which have been updated to the latest version of Windows.&nbsp; If not, why is this happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Office 365 so why would that need a repair?</p>

            Why is not known. Sometimes, Windows 10 upgrades do cause unintended behavior. There is nothing new about this and there have been many reports of different kind of broken functionalities on this forum after the update.

<br />If you don't want to repair, you will have to do point 2 which will be very cumbersome for you. PDF is just one extension whereas there are many extensions in MS Office. Quick Repair is a very small step and will finish within 5 to 10 minutes.

            I don't have any other solution left apart from Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

    <title>How do I set up a Microsoft account for my small business. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewtat  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I set up a Microsoft account for my small business.</h2>
                    <p>To start, I have a small business and recently noticed when I have upgraded my windows 7 home PC to windows 10 I now sign in using my personal Microsoft account,</p>
<p>i have a number of desktop &nbsp;machines in my business and do not want the staff to sign in with their personal account but rather &nbsp;use their existing logon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I ensure this continues and staff do not get the option to merge their logon with a personal logon?</p>
<p>Can I set up a Microsoft account for business for all our business desktops.</p>
