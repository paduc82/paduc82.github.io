<p>Read the above information.</p>
<p>We don't know what type of Vista&nbsp;Disk you have.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Restore Point:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />
<br />
Click Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; pick a different time &gt; Next &gt; etc<br />

<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it:</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>

            <p>I just popped open my archives and ogled the original retail box! Looks a million bucks... ditto for everything else I've safely stored away in mint condition. But then I noticed the date of manufacture: 2003. Okaaay... that's FOURTEEN YEARS ago! If you've never played (or loved) a Mass Effect, then go for it. But without the benefit of a remaster or anything to make it seem like a modern experience, I do fear that you'll come away less than impressed.</p><p><br /></p><p>Back in the day, it was a benchmark for the genre - the best 'choose your own Star Wars adventure' there ever was! But I do fear that time hasn't been kind to this one. Kudos for mentioning it, though. At least it brings attention to the fact that there was a whole generation of classics playable on Xbox!</p>

            <p>The AI pathfinding is idiotic. I've reached doors only to get the message "You can't leave until your party is assembled." I've had to go back half a level because Carth couldn't work out how to walk around a table without my guidance. It isn't a rare thing either, it happens far too regularly.<br /><br />However that being said the game is awesome and I'm&nbsp;going to say one of the few I think you should absolutely get for the PC instead of the consoles. From the widescreen to the restoration mod (which adds back so much content), the console version just feels like a hollow experience in this day and age.</p>

There was a tile advertising as much on the dashboard, so I poked my nose in and saw that BLACK - one of the greatest gun games I've ever played! - was one of the contenders. I fired up the OG disc and was taken aback by a FULL HD splash screen in 16:9!!

Granted, the original game was prolly running @480p so at the very least this would've/could've been 720p, but FULL HD? Not even close! The sound design was phenomenal, but it just shows ho

<br />
<br />You should run a scan with the free version of MalwareBytes to see if it can remove this errror message . . .

<h2>            How to show MOST USED apps in Start Menu&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Help me with my Start Menu that I goofed up somehow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a change somewhere and it made all of the program shortcuts disappear that I'd added for APPs that I use often. They'd been in the upper left of the black box that displays when I tap the Windows key or click the Windows&nbsp;icon. Help? Please don't just
 give me a link so I can teach myself. I'm sure it's just a simple click somewhere that can either make it so I can add them again or it might even display the ones that I'd had there.</p>
<p>Here's what I see now with them all gone. <strong>The list used to be above </strong>
<strong>the word Suggested</strong>:</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jeff,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for the detailed reply.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By design you will not be able to drag and drop apps in "Most Used". However you can drag and drop apps from "Most Used" to "Start screen tiles". Then those apps won’t be showing under "Most
 Used".</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the article for additional information.</span></p>

                    <p>I have my sfcdetails now, but I do not have access to a "known good copy" of Windows 10, is there any other way of fixing my problem?<br />
<br />
I have picked out all the ones that didn't have "verify complete" and pasted them here.<br />

            do you mean that you want to bypass the logon screen at boot?
<br />please note that performing the following will enable anybody with physical access to keyboard to access your data.
<br />
<br />click start 
<br />type netplwiz and press enter 
<br />untick "users must enter a username and password..." 
<br />click apply 
<br />(if it is already unticked, tick the box and click apply then untick it again and click apply)
<br />you will be asked for a username and password (used to automatically log on). 
<br />if you are using a Microsoft account enter the FULL email address. 
<br />enter and verify your password and click ok 
<br />next time you boot the computer it will automatically log on. 
<br />
<br />to prevent it asking for a password when waking from sleep, go to settings -&gt; accounts -&gt; sign-in options 
<br />under "require sign-in" select Never. 
<br />
<br />hope that helps please let us know if you experience any problems.

            Hi Lenny, to remove the need for a password in Windows 10:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options 
<br />Choose to sign in with a local account 
<br />(in newer versions of Windows 10, this might be on the Your Info Settings Page) 
<br />Enter your old password and leave the new password box blank 
<br />Close the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter 
<br />In the resulting dialog, uncheck the option 'Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer box' 
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />That's It!

                    <p><font><font><font color="#000000">I currently have a Dell XPS 8100 running a retail copy of Windows 7 Pro that was purchased at initial release of Windows 7.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I also have a full suite of retail purchased Office 2007programs.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have purchased a new Dell XPS 8500 which comes with an OEM copy of Win 7 Pro.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I want to move all of the Microsoft programs onto the new computer including replacing the OEM Win 7 program with the retail copy of Win 7&nbsp;in order to retain&nbsp;future upgrade rights/protection.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then I want to wipe the XPS 8100's hard drive completely and give it to my wife who is running her own copies of retail Win 7 Pro Microsoft 2010 programs and re-install those programs on the XPS 8100.<span>&nbsp;

            <p>There is no deregistration process so you can just reinstall any Microsoft product which is not an OEM license as you require. Microsoft do monitor the use of a license and can block excessive use altogether.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If authentication fails after reinstall you will have the option to call the Authentication centre to confirm that the software has been uninstalled on the original system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dells come with a recovery partition&nbsp;to reinstall the system back to factory default including reinstating original drivers and applications. This can be a bit of a double edged sword with the junkware included but it is a simple exercise to uninstall it
 all before&nbsp;adding your own. Having seen the number of posts on here from people having deleted the recovery partition and regretted it if possible this should be left. Disk space is so relatively cheap now when I replaced my HDD in my Dell with an SSD I put
 aside the drive with its recovery partition for future reinstatement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only constraint placed on OEM software is that it cannot be transferred to another computer otherwise it can be the base of upgrade licenses the same as full retail packs.</p>

            <p>This is happening to many users who have upgraded from Win 8 too, the only workaround is to download the Win 10 iOS file via media creation tool &amp; either burn it to DVD or download the USB version, this will have recovery options when used &amp; allow you to
 reinstall or repair Win 10.</p>

<h2>            Windows Printing Error&#34;Windows cannot print due to an issue with the current printer setup.&#34;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since installing Windows 8.1, I have not been able to get my printer to work properly. When attempting to print a document, I receive the message "Windows cannot print due to an issue with the current printer setup." I am positive it is not an issue with
 the cables as I am able to print printer reports such as ink levels through the installed printer software. I have uninstalled and re installed all of the printer software several times with no impact. Any ideas as to why I am getting this error message and
 what can be done to correct the problem?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/db514c71-27a7-41f5-b902-096f81b9c6f6" /><span>&nbsp;</span></div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On my machine, the printer was already installed when I upgraded from Win 8 to 8.1...</p>
<p>It wouldn't print... the print spooler would hang at 50% CPU...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried a reinstallation method that worked in Win 8, but it wouldn't work in 8.1...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is basically what I got to work after a couple of days of trial and error...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1) Unhook the printer from the computer</p>
<p>2) "REMOVE" the printer in Devices and Printers (also the fax if your printer has one)</p>
<p>3) Stop the Print Spooler</p>
<p>4) uninstall the software\drivers</p>
<p>5)&nbsp; After Reboot, Stop the Print Spooler again.</p>
<p>6) Reinstall Software\drivers (use Compatibility Mode if necessary)... </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hook up the printer when instructed by the installer.</p>
<p>7) Make sure Bidirectional Support is Enabled in Printer Properties... PORTS tab</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is enabled, you should be ready to go... if not, unhook the printer again and reboot.</p>
<p>8) Enable Bidirectional Support and reboot</p>
<p>9) Hook the printer back up, and it should work</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Good Luck...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also... Since Win 8, I have found that uninstalling\reinstalling without at least REMOVING the printer first is useless... at least for a Lexmark... Win 8.1 seems to have some new wrinkles.</p>

            Thank you for the reply! Unfortunately it wasn't able to solve the problem. I don't know if this is helps, but when I attempt to print from PowerPoint, I get the message "The printer is currently busy or the printer queue is full. Try to print again at
 a later time." Attempting to print using any other program besides PowerPoint I get the same message as stated in my first post. I have checked and my printer queue is empty.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's a bit different than anything that I've encountered, but make sure Bidirectional Support is Enabled..&nbsp; The setting wouldn't stick on my machine at first... I finally figured out that the printer had to be disconnected from the computer to change this
 setting...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since your first error message mentioned "Default", make sure your printer is set as default.</p>

<h2>            Skype randomly will refuse to let me click on conversation window</h2>
                    i run skype 8 on windows ten, in split window view, because i use skype as a roleplaying platform and have multiple conversations in text going at once. lately (the past couple of months) every once in a blue moon, skype would refuse to let me click on
 certain convo windows, make a ding noise as if i clicked something i shouldn't have. To fix it i would have to sign out of skype all together and then sign back in. now (as of a week ago) it has begun to do it at least once a day..... as of today it has done
 it 15 times within the span of 2 hours.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I updated skype, removed skype from my computer and redownloaded, restarted my computer several times and it still keeps doing it. it's HIGHLY frustrating, and if the issue doesn't resolve soon, im going to end up switching to Discord and kissing Skype good
 bye, the same way i did with Yahoo messenger, 4 years ago.

<p>If only you are the person befriending him, you become a "follower". Only if your friend adds you to their friend list on the Xbox One as well, you become friends.</p>

            Just to add, on the Xbox 360 there is also a friends list limit of 100. Once that is reached you don't see new requests on the account either.

    <title>How Can I Turn Off Mouse Shortcuts&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How Can I Turn Off Mouse Shortcuts&#63;</h2>
                    Whenever I use my mouse to move to the right my computer automatically switches applications such as if I was on the internet and &nbsp;moved my mouse to the right it would open a previous application and switch to that instead.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have two laptops with the new up to date software and this happens on both of them. It has become very annoying when trying to use my computer.</div>

<div><br />
</blockquote>
<p>This suggests that you actually have a Touchpad with Touch screen emulation features enabled.&nbsp; If you had a real mouse those symptoms would not happen.&nbsp; E.g. a real mouse can only access the Modern UI at the absolute corners of the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A Touch screen user could "swipe" from the left (so be moving right) to draw in a previous app.&nbsp; That would mean that the App switcher was enabled and its switch automatically option was enabled.&nbsp; You could turn off both options to see if you like that any
 better.&nbsp; Note that when you turn off both, in particular disable the App switcher, you also disable the Win-Tab keyboard command as well, although you could still use Alt-Tab or Task Manager to see all your open apps.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Alternatively, depending on your brand of Touch pad and the level of its software you may be able to disable most Touch screen emulation features to get your Touch pad back to emulating only a normal mouse.&nbsp; Or just become aware of the Touch screen emulation
 features and how to control them in order to avoid the problem symptoms you are now having with them.&nbsp; E.g. instead of completely disabling them you may find that your manufacturer's implementation would allow you to tweak the settings until you were more
 comfortable using them.</p>

    <title>Windows Mail Crashing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markkilner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Mail Crashing</h2>
                    After loading Windows 10, I decided to use the Windows Mail App to bring all my email accounts into one place (Gmail, Yahoo and Outlook).&nbsp; After working OK (although it doesn't bring them into one inbox) I can no longer use the app as every time I click
 on something (inbox or settings) the App closes suddenly.&nbsp; I have also lost access to historical emails in other email accounts.&nbsp; I thought deleting the app would help and just use Outlook but I am not permitted to delete it.&nbsp; Any ideas please?

<p>Hey HC, that would be awesome! I remember that happened when the 360 came out after the original XBOX. But sadly since those games are written in different code, they will not compatible for the XBOX One. Maybe someday though. Until then I am going to have
 keep my 360 around to play those games. &nbsp;</p>

<p>@ OP. Once again, I knew it was you even before clicking the link.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Do I have to answer you in Klingon again?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Just a heads up guys. This OP NEVER replies on threads he creates and seems to ask questions that are.... Well.... Baffling.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Oh. And he five stars himself every time too.</p>

<p>xenomorph v1, I do question HC HALO 3 RECON's posting tactics, but has it ever occurred to you that he never replies because he/she gets their answers every time? If you get the answer, why feel the need to respond? Although, in this case, I think you're
 right... Something's definitely odd.</p>

<p>"but has it ever occurred to you that he never replies because he/she gets their answers every time?"... Yes, I've definitely considered this... But...</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"If you get the answer, why feel the need to respond?"... Because it's the courteous thing to do to respond to the people who have taken the time to answer you.... No?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>HC has posted his or her fair share of threads, but never once has he/she come back... Even for a "Thanks all". Besides, I'm definitely not the only one who's noticed.</p>

<p>yea i have seen this, and while i dont condone it i do say he does have some questions i like to know, such as this question on the halo games, yes some are right in a year we wont care to much about bc but some will, some people, like myself, like to put
 in that old game and sift through it again. &nbsp;with that said, I loook forward to playing the games on the x1 but i must admit I am going to miss not being able to play the Mass effect games, gears , and halo games.</p>

<p>I get your point... But that's what your 360 is for. You can keep it.</p>

<p>My western seagate ext HDD worked on it. What I did use for a bit was a 250gb xbox hdd (off ebay someone sold me a corrupt one that my box wouldnt read but worked as an external hdd) I attached it using a transfer cable and it worked fine. Of course it only
 let me use 16gb of it. </p>

<p>I have both transfer cables ,an official and an unofficial. Its the hdd itself. wouldnt work at all with the xbox. Although it may come in handy for my pc for storage sometime if I ever fill my 1TB one!!!.</p>
<p>Just possible buying an old 20gb hdd and a transfer cable may be as cheap as getting a memory stick (official one as theyre more pricey) Also you only will see the usb wire rather than the stick coming out of the front of the xbox!</p>

<p>Does anybody know&nbsp;if I can install it on the new PC , as I now only have 2 installations. Will they allow me?</p>
