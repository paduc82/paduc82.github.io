<h2>            Wobbly lines on my Windows 10 PC-Tablet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a windows 10 pc-tablet. I use it to draw. I draw on Sketchbook for tablet and I could do so for months since I upgraded to the anniversary update. I recently got another update last night, and today I can't anymore because the wobbly lines are back.
 I would draw a straight line, with either my pen or my finger and it turned out jagged and wavy. I was just improving in my digital art and now I can't draw properly anymore.... Is there any way I could fix this? My pen is not a bluetooth pen. its simply a
 stylus. this is the only way i can draw right now. my parents will be angry at me if i told them. i have no money to buy anything new. please help me</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>update: </strong>I have tried a system restore, as a representative has told me to do, and it still didn't work. i might buy a graphics tablet, hopefully that just being the last time i do such lmao idk</p>

            <p>Hello, I got the same problem and it's not just styluses. It's all mices. It's mostely noticable when I zoom out, draw anything then zoom in back to 100%. These are straight lines made with tablet and mice:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b62266ae-1d5c-40a5-83aa-69cf6c956fb9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b62266ae-1d5c-40a5-83aa-69cf6c956fb9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It behaves like that on all my 3 computers, one with windows 8, the others windows 10. 3 different Mice, one tablet. With or without drivers from Wacom, all the behavior is the same. Only Wacom drivers 6.3.6w3 makes it better a bit for Wacom device, but
 for other devices (Genius tablet or mice) the issue stays the same. Example of spiral drawn in 50% then zoomed to 100%<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55a4b763-69bc-44cf-ad89-5c63d51bc921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55a4b763-69bc-44cf-ad89-5c63d51bc921" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>This same issue is easily to find out under "wobbly lines tablet" where people think it's a tablet issue, but obviously, it's Microsoft issue as devices like Surface and others are affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't matter which software you use for demonstration, it happens in all software from MS Paint through Photoshop to Corel Painter.</p>

<h2>            Unable to print from Microsoft Edge.</h2>
                    <p>I have now reinstalled my HP printer 3 times to get it to work properly with my computer. Everything is said to be connected but then the computer tells me my printer is off as I am sitting in front of it and it is definitely on. It will print from my collaborate
 chalkboard program but it will not print anything from the Microsoft edge.&nbsp; I do not like Edge at all and this is a brand new printer and brand new PC and everyday I have to try to trick my printer into connecting with my computer. WHY? And yes it has been
 properly connected wirelessly to my Wi Fi.</p>

    <title>Subject&#58; does not see one contact in skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> îº∏ÒÇÒÄ∏π êªµ∫ÒÅµµ≤17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Subject&#58; does not see one contact in skype</h2>
                    The situation is as follows. Skype is installed on my working computer in Eifon and on my home computer. On your home Windows computer and, if I'm not mistaken, Skype is installed by default. The question concerns skype on a home computer, namely that
 he does not see ONE contact. Contact is my English teacher who lives in Canada. I myself am in Moscow. And I really need to talk to her via Skype via a home computer - because it's not convenient through mobile devices.<br />
I would particularly like to stress that this (ONE) contact works on the computer and in the iPhone. I can communicate with this contact and poluchuchat messages. And on the home computer there is no - the system sees this contact, but it DISCONSES me from
 Skype when I try to write a message or call.<br />
I recorded the video as it happens, but unfortunately I can not put it here.<br />
I hope for your help and support. Thank you.

    <title>Is it possible to unmod a modded Xbox&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> manukross  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to unmod a modded Xbox&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Last week I bought myself a second-hand Xbox and I enjoyed it quite a bit.<br />
<br />
3 days ago, I slept at a friend's house and we played GTA V.I enjoyed the game so much, that I asked him if I could borrow it.<br />
He told me it was okay and gave it to me.<br />
<br />
When I got home the next day, I wanted to insert the GTA V disk only to find that I had been playing a copied version of FIFA 14.<br />
Everything worked fine and I was able to play online so I didn't bother checking if it was modded.<br />
Apparently, the seller modded the Xbox and didn't tell me about it.<br />
I tried to contact the seller but I couldn't get a hold of him.<br />
<br />
I turned off my Xbox and haven't played ever since, because I heard that modded Xboxes can be bricked and accounts could be banned.<br />
<br />
While chatting with an employee named Juliette, I was advised to add a post on the forums and it would be a matter of time before the Enforcement Team would contact me.<br />
<br />
I want to know if it is possible to unmod the Xbox (if so, how?) or if I have to buy a new console.<br />
I personally am against pirating so I'll do whatever it takes to go legal. [ Hurry please, XBOX IS SO TEMPTING :( ]<br />
<br />
Just please don't brick/ban, I couldn't do anything about this.</p>

<p>You'd have to purchase a new console. "Unmodding" it would still be considered system tampering, so it's just best to get a new console so it won't get banned.</p>

<h2>            Lost a REALLY IMPORTANT folder</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Windows 10 (up-to-date)</p>
<p>DELL XPS 8910</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I am not happy with windows 10 - the following may be OS-related.</p>
<p>I have a VERY ESSENTIAL folder which I was not backing up (due to path being too long) &amp; I couldn‚Äôt axs OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folder disappeared after February 27th 2017. </p>
<p>It is NOWHERE and the contents of the recycle bin are far less than this folder.</p>
<p>Restore previous version is negative...</p>
<p>Searching (many times [including with multiple details]) returns nothing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a few files I'd copied to flashes but there are no previous versions of these (and I know there should be).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been searching for several days for a recent documents folder and just found some of the subfolders in the word list on the right when one tries to save a document opened in word (and not in a folder).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it have encrypted itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE ADVISE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Is there a recent document folder? (File explorer only list 4 items).</p>

            <p>Hi Tanya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd like to know a few things to understand this better and help you recover the missing folder. Please answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you lose it after upgrading to Windows 10?</li><li>How long has it been since you installed Windows 10 on the computer?</li></ul>
<p>Windows 10 does not apply changes or remove personal files without your permission. We suggest you restore the previous version of the folder or drive that used to contain the files you are looking for. Refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17119/windows-7-recover-lost-deleted-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
page</a> for the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need more help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Hello and Thank you!</p>
<p>I did not upgrade to Windows 10. The PC was preloaded (from Dell)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look up "lost files windows 10" (&amp; permutations) the returns discuss upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never lost something this size before, and as mentioned, the recycle bin contents are far less in volume than the folder was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I greatly appreciate your expertise and thanks again!</p>

            <p>As suggested, you may need a third-party software to recover the missing folder. Your antivirus program may need to be turned off before you can run such recovery software on the computer. If you do not feel comfortable doing so, we suggest you reach out
 to the IT Pro audience in TechNet to seek other suggestions. You can reach them <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/home?sort=relevancedesc&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;searchTerm=windows+10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Some of the files may still be recoverable depending on how you re-install Windows (for example by programs such as R-Studio). The safest way would be to buy a new or second hand hard drive and re-install the OS to that, then destroy your old hard drive.
 This may be a bit of overkill depending on the sensitivity of the data currently residing on your hard drive. It also may not be economical depending on what you could expect to sell&nbsp;the old PC for. The question is what price do you put on the security of
 the data on the hard disk at the moment.</p>
<p>Another option would be to use something like <a href="http://www.dban.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DBAN</a> or <a href="http://www.killdisk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">killdisk</a>&nbsp;before installing Windows again which should prevent recovery of data by all but specialist data recovery labs.</p>

    <title>Add UNC path to search index in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kelly42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add UNC path to search index in Windows 7</h2>
                    I have a desktop computer running Windows 7 (retail version).&nbsp; I would like to add some UNC paths to the search index to allow Windows Search to locate files on mapped network drives.<br />
<br />
My network drives are mapped from a Windows Home Server which is running Windows Search 4.0.<br />
<br />
I am running Windows Search 4.0 on a (separate) computer at work and I have seen a tab in the Indexing Options to allow addition of UNC paths.&nbsp; Unfortunately it looks like the version of Search built into Windows 7 does not allow UNC paths to be added.<br />
<br />
I've seen some solutions to this problem which involve mapping the UNC paths to local drives using a symbolic link, but I don't wish to do this.&nbsp; The drives are already mapped and work fine that way.&nbsp; Surely there is a way to update Search on Windows 7 or otherwise
 enable addition of UNC paths?&nbsp; There doesn't seem to be a downloadable installer for Windows Search 4.0 for Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Note: I have just seen the Windows Desktop Search add-in for files on Microsoft Networks (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=f7e981d9-5a3b-4872-a07e-220761e27283&amp;displaylang=en).&nbsp; I'm going to install that, but shouldn't this already be
 a part of Windows Search on Windows 7?&nbsp; Why do I need an add-in from 2008 to enable something on a brand-new operating system which is already present in versions of Search which work on legacy OSes (XP, Server 2003)?

            I have noticed several responses to select "Always Available Offline" which copies the files to the local hard-drive.&nbsp; This is an unacceptable answer as my corporate system cannot be copied to my local hard-drive.<br />
<br />
Microsoft used to have the ability to add a network drive to the search/index list.&nbsp; This is a huge missing hole in the Windows 7 search.&nbsp; I will need to look at Google's search as an alternative if it handles network drives.

<h2>            Tenda Wirless Network Card driver Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm having a continual problem with the Tenda wireless network card installed in my desktop PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time a Windows update takes place the driver wont load.&nbsp; The driver is the windows recommended one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following message is displayed in the device manager&nbsp;"This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. (Code 31)".&nbsp; I've been able to resolve the problem in the past, but&nbsp;not this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trouble shooter's not been able&nbsp;to find a solution.&nbsp; I've attempted to update the driver but it says it is the most up to date available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I delete the driver and search for hardware changes it commences a search for a driver and within a couple of seconds&nbsp;the computer locks up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!&nbsp; It's starting to drive me crazy!!!</p>

    <title>Skype of Business Issue with Woman Interrupting Randomly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype of Business Issue with Woman Interrupting Randomly</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes when I use my skype of business line to conduct a conference call a message randomly occurs where a woman states that they did understand the function.&nbsp; Has anyone had this issue or know how to fix it?&nbsp; I run conference calls with external clients
 and it is embarrassing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Sorry for the delay.&nbsp; I unfortunately do not have a screen shot. There is a female voice who comes on the line when we utilize our skype for business dial in from a land line who states that they do not understand what was input.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same message
 when you randomly hit buttons on your phone that the menu does not understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say external clients I mean people dialing in from other departments from our organization.&nbsp; Sorry for the confusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a few people who experience the issue
 but it is sporadic.&nbsp;&nbsp; The version of skype for business is Skype for Business 2016 MSO (16.0.7571.7095).&nbsp; This version gets pushed out from our corporate IT area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your quick response.</p>

<p>Hi Stefanie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this problem also occur in other Skype for Business client version? Do you encounter this problem before your IT staff update your Skype for Business client?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the latest version of the Skype for Business client is 16.0.7726.1049, we recommend that you contact your IT staff and update the affected user‚Äôs Skype for Business client to see if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>we have engaged our phone support area because it is believed to be only an issue with two females when they dial in using a land line. &nbsp;Have you come across any other people wirh this issue? &nbsp;Our support area believes it may be due to the system confusing
 some female voices with dtmf tones.</p>

<p>Hi Stefanie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, your phone support engineer believe that some woman attendance may interrupted the conference call.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try muting the entire audience by pointing to Participant Actions &gt; Mute Audience to see if it helps.</p>

<h2>            Computer restarts after shutdown or after going into hibrination</h2>
                    This started yesterday (Sept 24.)&nbsp; When the computer goes into hibernation or when I click on shutdown, it turns off and immediately restarts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night I finally used the power button to shut it down.&nbsp; Today after starting the computer it is doing
 the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a&nbsp;Windows update yesterday that failed twice, then did install.&nbsp; That is the only change&nbsp;to any programs. The problem occurred both before and after the final successful install of the update.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have Windows 10.&nbsp; &nbsp;

            <p>Hi David,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I need to know some detail<br />
1.&nbsp;Which update you installed recently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: <strong>Disable</strong> automatic restart during system failure and check if you get any error message.
</p>
<div>
<p>a. Press Windows key + X.<br />
</p>
<p>b. Click on Control Panel, click System and Maintenance, and then click System.
<br />
c. Click Advanced System Settings.<br />
d. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type&nbsp;the password, or click Allow.</p>
<p>e. Click the Advanced tab, and then click&nbsp;Settings under Startup and Recovery.&nbsp;<br />
f. Under System failure, click to clear the ‚ÄúAutomatically restart‚Äù check box. </p>
<p>g. Click OK, and then click OK.</p>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2</strong>: I would have you boot the computer in <strong>safe mode
</strong>and then try shutting down the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Refer:<br />
Windows Startup Settings <strong>(including </strong><strong>safe mode)</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are able to shut down the computer in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform clean boot.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if this helps.</p>

            <p>The update was KB3087040-For Internet Explorer Flash Player for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had seen another posting for your solution #1 above.&nbsp; It didn't help.&nbsp; I also found another post that had me go to Power Options, then Chose what power buttons do, then click change settings that are currently unavailable, the uncheck "Turn on Fast Startup"&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Doing that has solved the problem, at least for now.&nbsp; I am uncertain what else having done this might do, but I can always reverse it.&nbsp;

            I should add that the fix only stopped the computer from restarting in a shut down.&nbsp; It still restarts itself a few seconds after is goes into sleep mode.&nbsp; I can hear a click when it turns itself off, but then a few seconds later another click and it comes
 back on.&nbsp;

            Update - I found on a none-MS site a suggestion to go to Advanced Options in Windows Update and change how updates are installed to "Notify to schedule restart.&nbsp; This has solved the second problem.&nbsp; Not sure why or why this should be necessary, but so
 far it has worked.&nbsp;

<h2>            The Old Windows Photo Gallery tries to install itself at every reboot. I already have Windows Live Photo Gallery. How can I get rid of that problem&#63;</h2>
                    Since I have a working Windows Live Photo Gallery, I do not need the reguar Windows Photo Gallery product. But, it repeatedly tries to self-install and never completes. I have to "Cancel" out many times - at each reboot.

            Hi NagaDonti,<br />
<br />
The Windows Photo Gallery doesn't cause this. This could be due to HP's Photo Gallery (and the infamous PhotoGallery.msi message at startup). Let's know more specifics about the installer dialog (what's in the title?)&nbsp;that comes during logon for us to understand
 the issue better.

<p>Hi frPearidge,<br />
<br />
I don't know if HP Photosmart Premier requires or includes HP PhotoGallery software. If you don't get a response here, I think it would be a nice idea to direct this question at HP support forums, since its a software from HP.<br />

If you do what cmonkedo did and then uncheck the HP Digital Imaging and hp Image zone it should solve the problem. Thanx cmonkedo!

<h2>            80070005 Error Code with Windows 8.1 KB3000850 Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>So I have been experiencing a recurring issue with Windows 8.1 when attempting to install any updates. Most of the time they fail and I have to try multiple times to get them download but they eventually usually do download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I haven't been able to get this "important" update to install because I keep getting an error code. The update I am trying to install is 'Update for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems (KB3000850)' and the error code I am getting is 80070005. I have used
 CCleaner to make room for the update, I ran an anti-Malware program and deleted several files to make sure the computer was safe, I ran the troubleshooter the Microsoft website offers, and have tried turning my antivirus protection off while I tried to install
 the update. None of these options have worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The type of computer I have is an HP 15 Notebook non-touch screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am attaching a screen shot of the error message. I would like to know if anyone else has encountered this issue and if you were able to solve it then please comment with your suggestion. All suggestions, as long as they are reliable and not dangerous to
 the computer, are welcome!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d665272-7761-41cf-af1b-425a13f54249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d665272-7761-41cf-af1b-425a13f54249" /></a></p>

            <p>
 possible solution is written as follows by microsoft:</span></p>
<p>
The error code 0x80070005 is also described as "ACCESS DENIED." It usually occurs when you lack file or registry permissions that are required to install the update (Because file or registry permissions may be changed by malware, we recommend that you scan
 for malware after you repair the permissions).</p>
<p>
To resolve the issue, make sure that you are logged on as an administrator, and then install the updates again. If the problem continues, use the SubInACL tool to repair file and registry permissions. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SubInACL tool</a>&nbsp;and install it in the
 %windir%\system32 folder. The %windir% placeholder represents the Windows operating system folder. For example, C:\Windows.</li><li>Start Notepad, and then copy and paste the following commands:<br />
<span>@echo off<br />
<span>subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f<br />
</span><span>subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CURRENT_USER /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f<br />
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT /grant=administrators=f /grant=system=f<br />

</span></span><span><span>@Echo =========================<br />
@Echo Finished.<br />
@Echo =========================<br />
@pause</span><br />
</span></li><li><span>Save the file as reset.cmd.</span></li><li><span>Right-click the Reset.cmd file in File Explorer (in Windows 8.1 and Windows 8) or Windows Explorer (in Windows 7 and Windows Vista), and then click&nbsp;<span>Run as administrator</span>.
 In Windows XP, double-click the file in Windows Explorer.</span></li><li><span>Wait until the execution finishes, and then try to install the update again.</span></li></ol>

<h2>            Corel Draw X5 taking WAY too long to install</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new laptop with&nbsp;6GB RAM and 750 HD.&nbsp; I've tried to install&nbsp;Corel a few times today and it goes through the set-up and motions ok, but the install hangs up about 2/3's of the way through -&nbsp;seems to be loading though no progress.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No other programs on the laptop, so space isn't an issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone's advice is greatly appreciated,</p>

            <p>I had the same problem. Remarkable is when I quit the set up after it stops on 2/3 &nbsp;the program seems yet installed on my computer. I removed the program and tried it again after deleting all temporary files and with a clean boot but it stopped at about
 2/3 of the progress bar. Then I started the uninstall procedure with the dvd in my computer and choose for the option 'repair'. This time the installation was fully completed and everything seems to work.</p>
<p>Success!</p>

Problem Event Name: BlueScreen<br />
OS Version: 6.0.6002.2.2.0.768.3<br />

<p>Additional information about the problem:<br />
BCCode: 1000008e<br />

BCP2: 9092234D<br />

C:\Users\John\AppData\Local\Temp\WER-48906-0.sysdata.xml<br />
C:\Users\John\AppData\Local\Temp\WER38AE.tmp.version.txt</p>

<p>I don't know what the files associated with this even are, and I have run into dead ends trying to fix this. I know this is an old topic that has been resolved but instead of starting a new question I figured I would add to an old topic of the same origin.
 Any help is vastly appreciated, all programs are running slowly or crashing, and I either get a black screen on start up or a blue screen crash randomly if it decides to work. I have tried defragging, fixing registry errors, deleting unused programs or programs
 thought to be affiliated with the crash, checked motherboard for overheating, no new programs have been added recently and no changes have been made to the computer, this all just randomly started happening this morning when I went to check my E-mail. I previously
 had a blue screen crash about 2 months ago, and through resolution with NVidia customer support it was determined I needed a new Graphics card which was installed and has been working fine. Tried to update my drivers for the vid card thinking this could possibly
 be it but it just crashes when I try to load it. And no it is not an isolated problem, almost any program I start up crashes or freezes. Anti Virus is also shut off now, but I do not believe this to be malware/adware/viral. If it helps I am running Windows
 Vista SP 2 on a desktop. Currently running in safe mode as it is the only option that SOMETIMES works. Thanks for any help or advice, it is much appreciated.</p>

            <p>Also when trying to update the driver for my graphics card I am getting this error:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows: WerFault.exe - Application Error</p>

            <p>Ok through a little research I discovered the WerFault is the Windows Error Reporting tool, as a quick fix I tried turning it off, but with no luck.&nbsp; Tried completely installing new drivers for the vid card and still getting error messages related to the
 WerFault.exe file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2 Error msgs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WerFault.exe - Application Error</p>
<p>The exception illegal Instruction<br />
An attempt was made to execute an illegal instruction.<br />
(0xc000001d) occurred in the application at location 0x6b91409b.</p>
<p>Click on OK to terminate the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QSetup Installation Suite: Diamond 11.11 2400-6900 Win7Vista Eng-Fre.exe - Application Error</p>
<p>The exception unknown software exception (0x0eedfade) occurred in the application at location 0x7605fc16.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still unclear how a corrupt or missing/damaged, whatever Windows Error tool can make errors with graphics cards or totally unrelated programs, even when the tool is completely turned off as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as a final note, the 'PCI Simple Communications Controller' is apparently damaged or corrupt now as well.&nbsp; Using an Unknown Device Identifier I determined it is associated with this file: @system32\drivers\pci.sys,#1920&nbsp;...When trying to repair the device
 no driver update can be found.</p>

<div><strong>Standard Hardware Troubleshooting</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</font>
<div>
<div>First lets test what hardware we can. Hardware faults can appear as many software faults, therefore we need to test hardware first..</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Please do the following in order. Memory faults can cause disk corruption, disk faults can cause disk corruption. Disk corruption causes corrupted files (which SFC may be able to fix). If you get an hardware error stop and post back.
<strong>Do not run chkdsk with faulty memory</strong>.</p>
<div><font>&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Memory Diagnostic</strong></div>
<div>If you haven't run a memory diagnostic then please do so. Click <em>Start</em> -
<em>Control Panel</em> - choose <em>Classic View</em> in left hand pane - choose <em>
Administrative Tools</em> -&nbsp; then<em>&nbsp;Memory Diagnostics Tool</em>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>S.M.A.R.T</strong></div>
<div><em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;(or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disk drives in Windows monitor themselves for impending failure.&nbsp;The feature is&nbsp;called S.M.A.R.T. It will detect impending&nbsp;failure&nbsp;30% of the time.&nbsp;In an elevated command prompt type (it's one line)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><em>wmic /namespace:\\root\wmi PATH MSStorageDriver_FailurePredictStatus get active,predictfailure,reason /format:List</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it's on Active will be true, if not on turn it on in the computer's BIOS.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Predict Failure should be False if everything's ok.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In Vista and later if SMART predicts failure Windows prompts the user to run Backup.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Run Chkdsk</strong></div>
<div>In <em>Computer</em> right click all your drives and choose <em>Properties</em>, then
<em>Tools</em> tab, then click <em>Check Now</em>. Tick <strong>BOTH</strong> checkboxes then Start. Reboot. This will take overnight.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>SFC</strong></div>
<div>Check for file corruption by clicking <em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click
<em>Command Prompt</em> and choose <em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;(or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>sfc /scannow</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Heat</strong></div>
<div><font>Heat can cause problems like this and also sudden reboots without crashing. Ensure your fans are not clogged with dust.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>For Memory Diagnostic Results</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Click <em>Start</em> - <em>Control Panel</em> (and select <em>Classic</em> view in the left hand pane) choose
<em>Administrative Tools</em> then <em>Event Viewer </em>then look at <em>Event Viewer (Local) - Applications and Services - Microsoft - Windows - MemoryDiagnostic-Results</em> for entries.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Look for <em>EventID</em> is&nbsp;<strong>1201</strong>&nbsp;or <strong>1101</strong> and&nbsp;<em>Source</em> is
<strong>MemoryDiagnostic-Results</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>Double click the entry for details on that entry.</div>
<br />
<strong>For Chkdsk Results</strong></div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Click <em>Start</em> - <em>Control Panel</em> (and select <em>Classic</em> view in the left hand pane) choose
<em>Administrative Tools</em> then <em>Event Viewer </em>then look at both the <em>

<div>P.S. <strong>7</strong> and <strong>55</strong> are the auto repair codes where windows repairs&nbsp;disk errors silently on the fly.
<strong>52 </strong>is the SMART warning.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>For SFC Results</strong></div>
<div><em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;(or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>findstr /c:"[SR] Cannot" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log|more</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This will see which files are corrupted. We may be able to copy them from another computer.</div>

<div><font><strong>Dump Files</strong></font></div>
<div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Dump files are files containing the state of the machine when it crashed. We can analyse the file to identify the driver (or program) causing the crash. See the last section on how to get them analysed by a volunteer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Analyse Dump Files</strong></div>
<div>If you want to analyse your own dump files. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You need to start Explorer as Administrator to access the files in <strong>C:\windows\Minidump</strong>. Right click Explorer and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>.</div>
<div><br />
Download and install Debugging Tools for Windows<br />
<div><font color="#0072c6">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852363</font><br />
<div>Install theWindows SDK but just choose the debugging tools.<br />
<br />
Create a folder called <strong>Symbols</strong> in C:\<br />
<br />
Start <em>Windbg</em>. <em>File</em> menu - <em>Symbol File Path</em> and enter</div>
<div><br />
<em>srv*C:\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Close and reopen WinDbg. <em>File</em> menu - <em>Open Crash Dump</em><br />
<br />
This will analyse the crash dump. You need to close and reopen WinDbg for each dump file analysed. Because you are downloading symbols from the internet WinDbg will appear to be doing nothing. But it's downloading. Be patient.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You are looking for a driver or system library that the crash occurred in at the end of the listing. Find the file, right click then
<em>Properties</em> - <em>Details</em> tab. If it shows a driver you'll need to update the driver identified. Most drivers are in c:\windows\system32\drivers.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Search the Drive for a File.</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Click <em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;replacing <em><strong>drivername.sys </strong>
</em>with the name of the file being searched (or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>dir c:\<strong>drivername.sys</strong> /a /s</em></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it shows a system file see if you can get a program from analyze -v.<br />
<br />
Type in theWinDbg command prompt</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><em>!analyze -v</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-v stands for Verbose and if&nbsp;the crash was originated by a program, as opposed to hardware or a driver,&nbsp;it will appear in the middle of the listing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>eg</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>PROCESS_NAME:&nbsp; java.exe</font></div>
<div><font>IMAGE_NAME:&nbsp; ntkrnlmp.exe</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>PROCESS_NAME only appears in the analyze -v output and only if a program originated the call that faulted.<br />
<div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Upload Them for Analysis</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Or upload the minidump files to your Public folder on Skydrive and copy the link from the address bar and I'll analyse them.</div>

            Thank you for the response. &nbsp;However before I had noticed this reply last night I had tried several new options with no luck. &nbsp;First I had tried to check to see what had been installed lately or any new changes. &nbsp;The only thing was an automatic windows
 update on the 14th, I am now wondering if this is possible related to the WERFault.exe file that is showing error? &nbsp;I then tried a system restore with no luck, still blue screen crashing with this error: &nbsp;CRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL ... which basically is a corrupt
 memory file if I am correct? &nbsp;I then tried a reinstall of Windows Vista (not clean install) with no luck, it gave me an error message and the install crashed when trying to extract old files to the new folder, before the install even began (2nd step I believe?).
 &nbsp;This leads me to my final point and the reason I can no longer try any of your suggestions is because I can no longer get it to boot to safe mode or anything for that matter. &nbsp;I now get a bla

            Just an update now too, tried a clean install, after deleting the partition (D:) &nbsp;I began the install and it gives me this error, tried multiple times, all with the same result:
<div><br />
<div>Windows cannot access the required file D:\sources\Install.wim. &nbsp;Make sure all files required for installation are available, and restart the installation. &nbsp;Error code: 0x800701e7</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now I am really in a bind, I wiped everything and can no longer install windows due to this error. &nbsp;All solutions I found required access to my computer, but I can't get it to boot even to safe mode so this is out of the question. &nbsp;Still unclear how all
 this can happen to my computer, when I have done absolutely nothing to change my computer, literally the only thing was a Windows Auto Update. &nbsp;If this corrupted something in my computer thus causing this I will be quite upset...</div>

            <p>Do you have a Windows DVD, either Win Vista or Win 7 (maybe Win 8 is similar enough as well). If you do we can run some basic hardware checks. Although if you are reinstalling from the recovery partition on the hard drive you should have access to the same
 tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL - IRQ (Interrupt ReQuest) is a way for drivers to respond to hardware in a structured way so important things get done first and less&nbsp;time critical&nbsp;things later or put on hold for a while. Reading data arriving from the hard drive
 is more important than drawing to the screen, which can be done later without data loss unlike reading from the disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a Windows DVD check if's it readable in another computer - copy D:\sources\Install.wim somewhere and see if it copies without error.</p>

    <title>Limit number of users on Windows 7 fast user switching - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Limit number of users  on Windows 7 fast user switching</h2>
                    Is there a way to limit the number of concurrent users logged into a Windows 7 Enterprise computer? I would like to allow users in a network environment to use Fast User Switching, but am concerned that there will be so many users logged in (and never
 log out) that the computer will eventually run out of resources and crash. Thanks.

            This question is outside the scope of this site (for consumers) and to be sure you get the best answer it should be asked either on Technet (for IT Pro's) or MSDN (for developers)<br />

            I have this issue too. We support hospitals and 20 people are logging in at once and the computers are crashing from heap exhaustion. I need to limit it to 10 people and then start force&nbsp;logging others off.

<p>As ZigZag suggested, you should ask in TechNet.</p>
