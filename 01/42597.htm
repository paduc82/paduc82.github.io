            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />The first thing that i suggest you to check is that you don't have an OWA session opened in a web browser.
<br />
<br />If that's not the case, clear skype for business cache.
<br />
<br />Log out of Skype for Business
<br />Delete any sign-in information
<br />Exit Skype for Business
<br />Navigate to Users &gt; [Your Username] &gt; AppData &gt; Local &gt; Microsoft &gt; Office &gt; 15.0 &gt; Lync
<br />Delete the sip_profileName folder
<br />Delete all files in Tracing folder.  Do not delete the folder itself
<br />Navigate to Users &gt; [Your Username] &gt; AppData &gt; Local &gt; Microsoft &gt; Office &gt; 16.0 &gt; Lync
<br />Delete the sip_profileName folder
<br />Delete all files in Tracing folder.  Do not delete the folder itself
<br />Open the command prompt and run ipconfig /flushdns
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, the next step should be an office online repair.

<p>I spent several hours trying to fix the same problem alone and then&nbsp;1 1/4 hours with 1st level Microsoft tech after what they called the "Creator's Update".&nbsp; The guy was useless.&nbsp; Basically took me through the same troubleshooting scripts you can find in
 different tech blogs most of which I tried already.&nbsp; Nothing he suggested worked.&nbsp; We scheduled a 2nd level call 3 days later.&nbsp; That a long time with no internet!"&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, the problem turned out to be the Checkpoint VPN software installed on my PC.&nbsp; I had uninstalled the VPN driver after seeing this mentioned on a blog - but seemingly, the whole software needed uninstalled.&nbsp; As this is a well known problem, I'm
 quite angry the 1st level tech guy didn't know to ask the question if I had a 3rd party VPN installed.&nbsp;What a waste of time!</p>

<h2>            Impossible to change the country of my billing acount, so no Xbox Live Gold &#33; HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Okay here's my problem: I've been a good Microsoft costumer for over five years now, because of a miner problem that I had met with my old Xbox 360 Elite, I had to buy the latest one (compatible with Kinect when bought). I had a month of free Live Gold membership,
 cool ! Now here's the part thats NOT COOL: When I turn on my Xbox and I'm on the dashboard I notice that I have a "DEAL" that says "2$ For Two months" and I'm like "<strong>[Mod Removed - Inappropriate]</strong>" but when I go to pay, they say that I have
 to put in my billing info, okay no problem, except that there IS A PROBLEM. I am an American who lives in France, I created my Xbox Live account being IN France, with a FRENCH E-mail adress (Hotmail.fr). The problem is that when I put in my adress and zip
 code etc etc [...] it won't let me get past saying something like "Not the proper zip code" or whatever. I don't care. I live in France, I have a French E-mail and a French Xbox Live account, why is it that my account is from AMERICA ?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you know, it's all good, I kept my cool and told myself that I'll try to change that later... Except that today (the day that I planned to add my Billing Info) I get some kind of
<strong>[Mod Removed - Inappropriate]</strong> telling me that I can change countries, but the only thing that they propose is Chile, Russia, Portugal etc etc [...] (the newly excepted countries on Xbox Live) the problem is that I would like to put FRANCE in
 there so I can finally get my 2 months for 2 bucks ! I don't think that is too much to ask for is it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, if anyone has an answer (or a way to get in touch with the Xbox Live client services without paying god knows how much in a phone bill) I would REALLY appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Create a new account? I don't know about &nbsp;you but I'm an Achievement Freak. My last acount had 36K G-points, and I had to Create another one (THEINSANE69).</p>
<p>Now that I've managed to get 3K G-points (which wasn't hard but took a little time, time that I do not want to do again) I don't wan't to create another account. Oh and, all of my game data is on THIS account, I really don't want to have to play the games
 all over again... </p>
<p>When I try to change my billing info via the same site that you posted, the "Country/Region" is America and there is no way to change it.</p>
<p>I really don't get it, my Windows Live ID is french, but my billing info has AMERICA in it... I mean come on whats the deal here?</p>

<p>The account region is set by what is entered when you create the account, not by what your ID is set to. The only way to change an account region is by using the account migration tool, but it can only be used if you're living in one of the 9 newly added
 countries to Live and France is not one of them. There is no way to change your account region.</p>

<p>Yeah there's loads of people out there having this issue mate, it has been going on for about 5 years and Micro$oft have done nothing to solve it. Before theses new forums came in there was a five-year old, 30-odd-page-long thread of peope complaining about
 it! I agree with you totally that it is unreasonable of them to expect you to just create a new gamertag. Whats the point of being loyal and buying games for this console and racking up achievements, friends, and a rep, just to be told to create a new one
 when circumstances in your life make you move? </p>
<p>The "rationale" about not allowing region changes that its about copyright issues to do with different regions. Well, Apple is quite happy to allow you change your iTunes country region, and they deal in music, videos, films etc. which all have copyright
 stuff associated too. </p>
<p>And if you can prove that you have moved, say by providing a credit card registered to that address, or a bill, then surely that would be enough for them to change your region for you? Why can't they procide that service for people who are buying their products????</p>

<p>zombiclone its an technical problem</p>
<p>unlike ITUNES</p>
<p>itunes does not need to output to a tv</p>
<p>NTSC content will not work with PAL content not to mention copyright issues and distibution rights are the publishers job</p>
<p>by creating a different account you maintain compatibility with NTSC content on your main account while allowing you to use PAL content on the new account</p>
<p>audio doesn't have that issue</p>
<p>and ITUNES only maintains the content on the device rather then a tv</p>
<p>NTSC and PAL disks cannot be mixed with content</p>
<p>if you migrate your account to a PAL region you no longer have access to NTSC content so you need to maintain the ntsc content</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>for every region there is different options and DLC and disks have different menus</p>
<p>nintendo and sony content will not work outside their regions</p>
<p>psn US content will only work with NA content not EU content on the occasion where there is CONTENT laws preventing international versions of games from being used elsewhere thats a distibution issue</p>
<p>blackops and many violent games like gears of wars 3 fall under that category</p>

<p>instead of posting the same issue and getting the same answer everytime &nbsp;multiple times</p>
<p>since you don't like the short answer</p>
<p>why don't you google dvd regions and distibution rights along with ntsc/pal for a very very long answer</p>
<p>it explains it all (itunes isn't restricted by dvd regions)</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Yes, I get the whole dvd region thing now, thats fair enough, you certainly have a point - of course ntsc discs will not work on a pal tv due to the technical differences. And there are also legal content issues varying by region. But pal/ntsc differences
 have nothing to do with buying an XBox Live Gold subscription - that is about being able to use your gamertag to play online with other players. And if you have moved to another country, you should be allowed to change your region so that you can carry on
 using the same gamertag. The point I'm trying to make is that when someone moves to another country, they should be allowed to prove their change of address and have their region changed so that they can then buy content for that region, buy a Gold subscription
 etc.</p>
<p>The fact that Microsoft does not facilitate that is ridiculous. I'm sorry to keep harping on about it, but it really is shameful. To just accept it and say "thats just the way it is, too bad" is apathetic. Surely if enough people raise complaints about it,
 they will have to do something. If you phone up Support with this probelm, and speak to someone higher up, they do raise a "ticket" about it, so maybe that is a start. I'm genuinely sorry to be an annoyance, but I feel strongly about this.</p>

<p>I also have the same problem as ZombiClone, and I also fully understand the NTSC/PAL issue. However, the problem in Europe is that the restrictions in "region" is related to actual countries. In the case of USA, it would correspond to Microsoft restricting
 people from moving between states while keeping their xbox live accounts.. So in the US the region is a quite large area, while in Europe a "region" is a country when we talk payment options (I have an account in the UK, but live in Denmark). And I was happy
 when I saw that it was now possible to migrate the xbox live account - only to be very disappointed when seeing that it was only related to a limited number of countries and not the "interesting country" in my case.</p>

<p>Do you want to metered your data usage?<br />
Or<br />
You want to allow huge downloads over metered connection?</p>
<p>And if you tell me what build of W10 you are using it may be better to understand and resolve your issue</p>

<h3> bill224  say:</h3>
<h2>            does one drive cause file explorer right-click not responsding problem&#63;</h2>
                    <p>last couple days I got serious problems that whenever mouse right click when clicking on a file, folder in file explorer it showing not responding and hang-on forever until I have to close it. can't copy, move, delete...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I tried many posters suggestions I can find, finally only the one working for me which suggest to disable one-drive by using msconfig.&nbsp; I always knew any new function popping up must cause trouble for me.</p>
<p>my question is : last time the same problems happened to my old notebook and I uninstalled one-drive caused a diaster can't but back to win8. this new notebook only has win10 no other option. if instead uninstall one-drive but disable forever would have
 any side effect happens in the future?</p>
<p>after the solution working for me I can't find the poster article any more, so come back here see any professional here can tell me about one drive detail information...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought the same notebook a week ago after I uninstalled "stores" and xbox, unpin twitter/or news (those kept change pictures on screen) the notebook can't reboot and best buy has to refund money(they only have one in store) to buy in another location,
 this time I just endure the irritations to avoid troubles....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really need professional here help.....</p>

            <p>Right-click causing issues is usually caused by bad extensions (the extra options you see on right-click menus like "scan this file now" or "open with 7-Zip").&nbsp; These extra menu options are all integrated with other programs, and if your rightclick causing
 a problem, you know one of these extensions has the issue.&nbsp; It could be onedrive, it could be something else.&nbsp; It could even be something that's only a problem if you happen to have onedrive PLUS that other thing that only cause problems when they are together.&nbsp;
 There's no way for me or anyone here to know for sure, but that's what the typical case is.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use a program called AutoRuns (from Microsoft) or ShellExView (some 3rd party tool) that lets you see which extra options have been integrated into your shell right-click menus and then you can turn them on and off and figure out which one(s) are
 a problem.&nbsp; If you search this forum (or the internet at large) for right-click crash or right-click hang there's quite a few great guides to it as well</p>

            <p>thanks for your quickly response.&nbsp; </p>
<p>can you show me&nbsp; more detail about AutoRuns?&nbsp; only found autorun.inf and autoplay thru search.
</p>
<p>indeed the other poster showing ShellExView, but hesitated to delete those things because not sure what are they, and how to recover if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As bad extensions all I saw after right click on my file, file folder are McAfee scan/shred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indeed I dislike all anti-virus softwares, they seem burry virus unless continue using them every day(can't expired).&nbsp; but any better anti-virus software existing? the old machine we have Kaspersky, got same problem till back to win 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>can we get rid of extra menu options which all integrated by McAfee and other antivirus softwares ? how can we stop uncessary changes by other programs without knowing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>if it really causes by McAfee, why disable onedrive can solve the problem? win 8+Kaspersky didn't have file explorer problem to me till upgrate to win10.</p>

            <p>Take a look here, I recently wrote quite a bit about how to use it.&nbsp; See:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-files/crash-on-right-click-in-windows-explorer-or-this/f874f2f8-81cb-4655-9afd-fdda19c20dc5">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-files/crash-on-right-click-in-windows-explorer-or-this/f874f2f8-81cb-4655-9afd-fdda19c20dc5</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news is you don't have to worry about knowing if it's okay to delete or not. Using this tool, you can just uncheck to disable the extension.&nbsp; That way if you decide it was a good one or one you want to keep, you can just check the box to turn it
 back on.&nbsp; Of course, if you do find one you really do want to delete instead of just disabling, you can also delete.</p>

            <p>To resolve it, I recommend using the Microsoft program "AutoRuns", which you can run here (no install needed, just click "run" or "open").&nbsp;
</p>
<p>--Thanks very much. however it has to "install", I click "run here" then pop up menu either save or cancel, I press save but didn't save at all. then I search in microsoft community it shows autoruns for win 8..., can't find for win10.
</p>
<p>I did search websites some declaring free update autoruns for win10, I'm worry if I can't find&nbsp; microsoft itself, does it safe to install from 3rd party companies? will they burry bugs within it? I deeply believe "stay away free-things, you would pay the
 priceless in the future".<br />
would you mind to confirm whether the autoruns for win10? And could it be possible verify your links still vaild?<br />

            <p>That AutoRuns from the official website may not say so yet but it will work for you on Windows 10 (or any version).</p>
<p>

<p>the ole machine has Kaspersky, when it lost control (can't catch serious virus caused by malicious advertisements), I uninstalled and just use windows itself defender but I didn't know it should under non-administrator account. in the end paied to Geek Squad
 tech support to get rid of the serious virus.</p>
<p>this is really the best advice I ever heard, thousands, millions ...thanks to you.</p>

<p>in the meanwhile I felt some data files would auto disappeared(win10), few times I found few files in recycle bin which I didn't perform "delete" at all. I don't have such weird feelings for win8 or earlier versions.---believe me I went thru MSDOS, windows
 Xp, vista, 8 and now 10. </p>
<p>when I disabled one drive, I saw a poster mentioned about one drive has capacity limits, Indeed I have lots files, file folders, can it caused files auto disappeared?

            <p>I'm waiting for my old machine repairing, so haven't back-up my files and not enable&nbsp; one drive yet.</p>
<p>================</p>
<p>this monrning after turn on my machine, quick access-&gt;documents-&gt;... all subdirectories files are gone, scared me to the death.
</p>
<p>in the meanwhile McAfee livesafe warned me to update after I done, about 10 min. later those files show up.</p>
<p>I'm not sure it is McAfee caused problem or else, really creepy.</p>

What third party application did you have installed that did this for you because Windows&nbsp; native does not do this.<br />

<h2>            Unable to install my 1394 OHCI Compliant Host Controller</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am unable to get the driver for my 1394 OHCI Compliant Controller installed.&nbsp; Everytime I try to install a driver, any driver, I get the following error message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. (Code 31)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The card is a StarTech PEX13943 and it used to work on this computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I look at the details I see the following Hardware IDs</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PCI\VEN_1033&amp;DEV_00F2&amp;SUBSYS_00F21033&amp;REV_01</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PCI\VEN_1033&amp;DEV_00F2&amp;SUBSYS_00F21033</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; PCI\VEN_1033&amp;DEV_00F2&amp;CC_0C00</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I solve this problem and get this card installed?</p>

            <p>I have solved my own problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem happened because the "1394 Windows Debug Driver(Kernel Mode)" was installed and&nbsp;Debug Mode was&nbsp;turned on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I used BCDEDIT and set the Debug Mode to NO.&nbsp; The Debug Driver no longer had a lock on my 1394 firewire card allowing me to install the correct driver and my firewire camera.</p>

<h2>            USB PORTS NOT DETECTING EXTERNAL DEVICES</h2>
                    
<p>I have 3 usb ports on my HP Pavilon Laptop.&nbsp; Have never encountered a problem like this in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can no longer use my external mouse, USB port will not read a flash drive or external hardrive.&nbsp; I have checked device manager and there are no error
 messages and all USB ports are reading as working properly.&nbsp; I have installed all the new updates and drivers and still nothing.&nbsp; I could understand if I were receiving error messages however that is not the case.&nbsp; Is it possible that all 3 of my USB ports
 would die at once and if so, why is everything reading as normal.&nbsp; PLEASE HELP!!!!!!<br />

<br />
Make sure its gone and IE and system are clean :<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;-&nbsp; click reset all zones to default - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
Close and Restart IE<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java still installs it<br />
and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look right. Permitted<br />
are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program ask about it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and run - not all<br />
are bad however some can cause your issue (Toolbars are BHO's).<br />

    <title>New Motherboard, CPU and RAM with Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spidey817  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Motherboard, CPU and RAM with Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    Hey all. I'm planning to upgrade my PC with a new motherboard, new CPU and some new RAM. My question is how difficult will this be in terms of my Windows 7 installation?<br />
<br />
All I have is the Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade disc that I bought when I was upgrading from Windows XP. Can I theoretically just plug my old drive into the new motherboard and go, or are there some loops I'll have to jump through to complete these upgrades?
 I'm asking because I've done some research and I seem to be finding all kinds of different scenarios.<br />
<br />
Actually, I also have a new, larger HDD that I'd prefer to install Windows onto, but there is currently no copy of Windows on that drive so I'm guessing I won't be able to use my upgrade disc to install onto the new, empty drive.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

            <p>Since XP came preinstalled on the original PC, it is an OEM version that was tied to that motherboard.</p>
<p>OEM version of Windows are not transferrable to new motherboards.</p>
<p>Your Windows 7 upgrade that you have will not work for you because you won't have a qualifying version of Windows to upgrade from.</p>
<p>Your only solution is to purchase a full version of Windows 7.</p>
<p>To answer your last question your Windows 7 upgrade could be sold to someone else that would like to upgrade, so it's not totally worthless.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, you can't transfer an OEM License.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Laptop/Computer came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc) , that Product Key that came with the Laptop/Computer is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines)&nbsp;is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The above&nbsp;rule also applies to OEM System Builders Licenses.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>___________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>And kindly read this please:</p>

            <p>Hi David</p>
<p>Only error message is "Operation could not be completed". when trying to put any printer online (have three). When trying to add new hardware absolutely nothing happens. I am assuming one or two files have been corrupted some how. The fact that no devices
 are displayed in the Device Manager is a little worrying</p>
<p>Also tried various Microsoft Fixit but none have worked error message "Troubleshooting cannot continue because an error occurred. We are sorry etc.</p>
<p>Thanks for reponce anyway.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Have you tried the troubleshooting steps provided in KB919750 as suggested in earlier post?</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>I
</span><span>would suggest you to perform SFC scan to fix missing/corrupt file and check if that helps. The SFC /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect
 versions with correct Microsoft versions. For more information how to do SFC/ scan, please follow this link:

<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> If the
 issue persists then, try creating a new user account and then try to make the printer online and add a new hardware check if the issue occurs in new user account.</span></p>

<h2>            Xbox Chat Not Working </h2>
                    
<p>about a week ago my mic stopped picking up my voice. In a party with my friends, I can hear them, and when i talk the circle next to my name lights up, but people can't hear me. I've tried to hard reset my Xbox, did the controller update, and i know its
 not a mic problem, because I've tried my mic on my brother's Xbox and it worked fine. Also, I've tried his mic on my mine and it doesn't work. Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>Unable to make Skype To Skype video calls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> islandflower008  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to make Skype To Skype video calls</h2>
                    <p>For the past month, I have not been able to make Skype to Skype video calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other person can make the video call and I can answer. I make an attempt to call the other Skype user and it just keeps ringing then says he's not there to pick up. Which is false because he's sitting there waiting for the call. We have done several
 tests. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My missed calls appears as Missed Call in my chat box but not the other Skype user's chat box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have logged in to different devices, 2 different PC laptops, Mac laptop, Skype on the web, and iPhone and duplicated the action. Still the same result. Not able to make a Skype to Skype call. The other Skype user is able to receive incoming calls from
 everyone else except me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current version of Skype on all devices is the most recent. Please see image of screenshot below. I am at a loss for what to do. Apparently another friend who is a Skype user is experiencing the same issue. Any advice is appreciated. I posted something
 up about 2 weeks ago and I didn't get a reply from Skype for resolution. WhatsApp is a temporary alternative but perhaps if this can't be solved then it may be a permanent one.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I am playing Crysis 1 and the game is freezing in the final sequences. d3d10core.dll</h2>
                    <p>I am playing Crysis 1 and the game is freezing in the final sequences. I have played it before when it first came out and never had a problem. I have also played Crysis 2 with no problems, all on this computer. (windows 7 pro X64, i7 cpu, ATI Radeon HD 5800,
 12 GB RAM). Video card drivers are all up-to-date, and I am running Direct X 11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the error files in System Information and found two faulting modules. One&nbsp;is d3d10core.dll. This is a Direct X 10 file. The other is atidxx32.dll (32 bit Direct X in the video driver). Any suggestions?</p>

            The only thing that has changed is the update of DirectX. As I mentioned I have played the game before on this computer with no problems. I have fixed the video card issue, but the d3d10core.dll fault remains. I suspect that this dll file is either corrupt
 or should not be there. I have run dskchk but it found no errors.

            Assuming the d3d10core.dll file is corrupt (and yes, they should be there) -<br />
I was going to suggest deleting the&nbsp;&nbsp; d3d10core.dll&nbsp; files from System32 and SysWOW64 and have
<br />
the DirectX Web Installer replace them, but I see they are protected (trusted installer), so you may need to run the full DX Redist (June 2010) as it should overwrite the originals. The Web installer does not
<br />
overwrite existing files.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Details - Microsoft Download Center - DirectX Redist (June 2010)</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm, Interesting -<br />
I see that Crysis 2 installs four d3dx files in the games directory, so it may not reference System32<br />
or SysWOW64 for DirectX.&nbsp; <br />
- Crysis,&nbsp; Warhead, and Crysis 2 also have a special D3D.dll called CryRenderD3D....<br />
Nothing about&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic">core</span>&nbsp; in any of them though.<br />

<h3> blazer88  say:</h3>
<h2>            CD&#47;DVD Drive not writing music to CD&#39;s</h2>
                    it all worked when i first got this computer. even burned some CD's with it just about a week ago. now it wont burn anything to be playable in a car stereo, CD player, etc...<br />
<br />
at first it was giving me this red bar that said "filled" on WMP when i inserted a blank CD. either after formatting the drive, or doing the Microsoft FixIt thing, it now will instead say "702 mb" or something of the like when i insert a CD. now it will write
 files to the CD, but there is no burn mark on the disc, nor can i play it in anything other than the computer.
<br />
<br />
here is an example of what it was doing at first. [IMG]http://hosting11.imagecross.com/image-hosting-14/4057Untitled.jpg[/IMG]

            alright, so i got it worked out. as a last resort i started messing around with WMP. turns out i had the burn setting to Data CD, instead of Audio CD. never even knew i could switch it up like that since all ive ever burned were music CD's. how it even
 switched to that, im not sure. might have happened when i put in a picture CD of the family.
<br />
<br />
either way, thanks for the help, Spirit. hope if i ever have any other issues you can be there to help.

<h3> alexleadingedge  say:</h3>
<h2>            New AOC U2879VF monitor, opening file explorer results in huge icons</h2>
                    <p>We have just provided a new AOC U2879VF (28" 4K) monitor to a customer for CAD work, and after connecting it up they noticed that when they click on File Explorer in Windows 10 it makes the icons become much larger. They also see blue artefacts in the Windows
 10 display options until they sign out and back in again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are using a nVidia Quadro M2000 card for their CAD work, drivers are the latest (updated after this issue started). The resolution of the new AOC monitor is&nbsp;3840 x 2160. The second monitor is 22" and is only 1920 x 1080 resolution. Windows automatically
 sets the "Change the size of text, apps, and other items" to 150%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works fine when both monitors have the same (lower) 1920 x 1080 resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just asked AOC about this but they say it is a Windows 10 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is causing the icons to resize to a larger form?<br />

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your display has a high resolution, Windows 10 will automatically set the scaling value to an appropriate percentage that's why the icons appear larger. Also, Microsoft recommends keeping your display resolution to the "recommended" value. If you prefer
 your text, apps, and other items to be even bigger or smaller, we suggest that you follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click <strong>Start menu</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Display </strong>and you can manually adjust it by clicking or dragging the slider.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes after performing the steps above.</p>

<p>Hi Clark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the Recommended settings, and I tried all the different screen resolutions and icon sizes, but the problem still exists, when I open File Explorer the icons on the desktop resize to a larger form.</p>
        </p>

<p>Since you already tried setting your screen resolution to its recommended settings, we'd like to ask for a screenshot of what is happening when you open
<strong>File</strong> <strong>Explorer</strong> so we can have a clearer view of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p><span>I have ascertained that it is Clover that is causing this, but only at Icon Scaling above 100%. Clover is a 3rd Party program that turns File Explorer into a system with tabs and a bookmark bar for quick folder access. Interestingly, it has control
 over the Desktop and Windows 10 "System" menu, which was unexpected. Uninstalling Clover stops the issue, re-installing Clover causes the problem to start again. Clover is nice but the icon scaling is far more important on this 4K monitor system because otherwise
 the labels and icons are unreadably small.</span></p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you adjust the size of the icons on both desktop and File Explorer to see if the icon sizes are changing?</p>
<p>
