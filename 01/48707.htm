<h2>            I cant switch the account of the Windows 10 Xbox app</h2>
                    I recently bought the xbox game pass at microsoft store, i had to create a new microsoft account to buy it because my old one was registered as a child account, that means that i can't buy anything there, ok. After i created the account i downloaded and
 started the game Sea of Thieves (with my new account which one i bought the xbox game pass), but when i tried to play it automatically logged with my old account (the one that i am a child) and is not letting me play. But the problem is that i cant switch
 my xbox account in my pc (which is windows 10) to the one that im able to do what i want. Does anybody knows how can i switch this account? It would help me a lot. **The main problem is, everytime i open the xbox app in my pc, it automatically enters with
 my account that i dont have the game pass, and it just doesnt let me switch the account. The only thing i could do was to change my privacity security setting from my old account, but i asked me to verificate it, and the only option that i had was to go for
 a alternative email verification, but now it says that i have to wait for 30 days till my solicitation be accepted, and my xbox game pass will expire before this 30 days, then i am going to lose the xbox game pass without even testing it! Please answer me
 since it would help me so much. if you are able to send me an email to&nbsp;<strong>(Mod Removed - Personal Information)</strong> i would thank you so much.

            If you open the xbox app you will see your profile pic in the upper left right click on it, it will give you a choice to sign out then you can sign in with a different account on the app itself.

<h2>            Windows 10, postscript 3 rip program not working after updates.</h2>
                    <p>So I use Wasatch Softrip to send print jobs to an Agfa Anapurna MW printer. I have been using an old version for quite some time as updating will cost significantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently my PC has been installing windows updates and during the update something happens that causes the ps3.exe application to stop working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does windows 10 have driver i can download to use when processing post script or if there is no way to make the software compatible can i simply prevent all future updates?</p>

<h2>            GDi32.dll error on Windows 10 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had to battle this for nearly a month now. I have checked Microsoft forums (such a this), Youtube how to, article how to, and pretty much any how to on this subject.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now know that dll means direct link library and basically&nbsp; a library that facilitates intra-pc information sharing for specific types of apps-multimedia and text apps. Hence, I am unable to use pretty much&nbsp;<strong>any app that uses multimedia or text</strong>.
 The screen snip is the error observed while attempting to launch VLC. It is the same for other video apps, for video call apps, for messaging and document apps, for file transfer apps. I have tried and failed to uninstall the apps with this dll error, and
 tried the instructions on the web, include entering commands in command prompt. I think the free dll downloads come with risk, so I have not tried those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what to do anymore. It is limiting my use of the PC in the most basic of ways. I install windows updates as at when due, and have no outstanding updates. Please help. Thank you.</p>

<p>Thanks for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The option for returning to a previous version of windows is unavailable. I looked through the links, and the reason is that its been over 10 days since the last update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The available options are to reset the PC, which still had the option to keep my files, but I would need to reinstall all manually installed apps; and to install another version from an external device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to upgrade the OS with the updates from the windows site, but the missing GDi32.dll error came up, again. I guess I have no choice but to reset the PC and lose the installed apps. Unless you have other advice?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Between my first reply and yours, I turned on the Update Troubleshooter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just completed that, and asked permission to apply one fix. The troubleshoot concluded with fixes to Windows Updater, and asked me to try to run the task once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error persists. I am still unable to launch the Windows Upgrade, due to the missing GDi32.dll.</p>

</p><p>I tried to do this but I cannot manually install this update...I downloaded the update file, but when I tried to run it, the same GDi32.dll error popped up. I have tried searching for the library, and for an SSU update (saw it on the microsoft help suggestion,
 here&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors ) on the Microsoft Update Catalog, but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thing else you would advise?</p>

</p><p>I found this KB update on the catalog, for my version of Windows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Due to ISP issues, I need to wait until the wee hours to get it downloaded and installed. I will provide an update when this is done.</p>

<p>This took quite some time!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded and installed nearly 1GB in SSU updates, compatible with my versionh of Windows, Window 10 Pro Build 1709, and restarted as instructed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Windows Update Troubleshooter, today, and found this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How do I repair the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Update Database Corruption</strong>? It says to delete and re-download the updates (not specified) to this computer-do you think this will solve it? Also, how do I complete this? Please note: Prior to running this troubleshooter,
 the Updates portion of my PC says updates are all complete and current.</p>
<p>I'd be most appreciative of the help. Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Vista Home Premium 32 or 64&#63;</h2>
                    I currently have Vista Home Premium on my laptop. I think it is the 32 bit since it will only recognize 3 GB of memory. How can I find out if it is the 32/64 bit and change it to 64&nbsp; bit? If it is the 32 bit only, can I over write it with the Home Premium
 62 bit withoout losing the info already on my computer?

            Click Start &gt; right-click Computer&gt; Properties &gt; it will tell you there.<br />
<br />
You have to do a clean install to change from 32bit to 64bit Vista.<br />
<br />
You will lose ALL Data and 3rd party Programs as you have to Format the Drive.<br />
<br />
And you will have to buy a 64bit Vista Licence, and make sure that your computer can run a 64bit version.<br />

<h2>            Sudden conversation disruption that is getting really annoying</h2>
                    <p>I am an online teacher and I use Skype to conduct English lessons mostly to students from Asian countries - Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first experienced this problem a month ago. I call my student, everything is fine for a few minutes, and then both our videos abruptly freeze and I notice my camera indicator ÀùflashÀù as well as my video in Skype. Everything turns back to normal for the
 next few minutes and happens again. I still haven't found the origin of the problem. My internet connection seems to be fine, speed tests against the servers in all three countries are flawless and I have the latest version of Skype installed. The problem
 persisted for a few weeks and the only way we could establish communication without any such interruptions was turning off our respective videos. The problem stopped occurring after I re-installed my Windows (btw, I am using Win7) and everything was fine for
 the next three or so weeks. The problem recently started occurring once again and I checked everything - from my Internet connection, to my Firewall settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced the above described issue? Any information/solution would mean the world to me as my job depends on Skype stability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

I scanned my laptop using the dedicated Lenovo program and the results are all good hardware-wise. The drivers installed are up-to-date. Latest Windows updates have been installed as well. I will let you know the results as soon as I conduct my scheduled lessons
 this evening.<br />

<li>Press the <strong>Windows </strong>and <strong>R </strong>keys on your keyboard at the same time, then type

file.</li><li>Disable your firewall and third party anti-virus for 15 minutes.</li><li>Restart your computer and re-launch Skype.</li></ul>

<p>Hello Karen,</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I followed the steps you suggested, however there was no folder under my name in the Skype folder. Please refer to the following screenshot: https://snag.gy/48wy5Z.jpg</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The ÀùLogsÀù folder was empty, while the SkypeRT folder contained three .conf files&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | https://snag.gy/IQr7jn.jpg |. Under the assumption that these were the the files I should erase, I did
 so after having turned off my antivirus and Windows Firewall. I restarted my computer and re-launched Skype, but there was no significant change, as the files were re-created after the restart.<br />
<br />
If it is of any help, the problem still persists, but I am unable to find the pattern - it occurs at random, but I the symptoms are always the same - both video and audio suddenly freeze for a few seconds, followed by the aforementioned camera indicator and
 Skype video ÀùflashingÀù.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your help, <br />
<br />
Mihajlo<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
I found the config.xml file, though it was a bit tough to find. I deleted it (following other steps). I'll update you on the matter.</p>

<h3> kevinmolodecki  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Display Adapter with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>With Windows 8.1 and my <span>Lenovo Flex3 15 laptop and </span>Microsoft Display Adapter I had no problems. I could not update to Widows 10 so I called and released my to Microsoft to install Windows 10. I now every time I used it I try to use Microsoft
 Display Adapter with my laptop I have to delete the Microsoft Display Adapter and its apps then reinstall it again to use it. I think if it works before every time with 8.1 at should work with 10 especially being the Microsoft Display Adapter is a Microsoft
 product. I would like to know how this issue can be taken care of. I do not always have access to the internet when I need use the Microsoft Display Adapter. It is a nuisance when I cannot use it when I need it. I tried making an appointment and never got
 the call. Then I called Microsoft got transferred three times and got hung up on, three time. So I called back and asked to speak to a supervisor and was told they could not because he or she was too busy. I ask if I could leave a phone number and was told
 they could not and would not call me back. I tried calling back and was told the people I needed to speak to does not work on Saturday or Sunday, that is why I kept getting hung on.</p>
<p>I would like to get help from Microsoft being both products are from ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù but I feel like Microsoft seems to have grown to large and feel they do not need to meet the needs of us that have been loyal to the brand. I was even think of going to a Microsoft
 smart phone but they seem to be a bad idea at this time. I can be reached &nbsp;if anyone would like can help me and restore my faith ne Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            BSOD after installing 8 gb ram on win7 64 bit</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>My computer has been running fine on 4gb ram.&nbsp; I installed 4 more gb of the exact same type of RAM and the system has been unstable since, getting multiple blue screens of death, etc.&nbsp; I have uploaded the .dmp file here if anyone could take a look at it,
 thanks!</p>

<p>Thats what I was afraid of. You can check the web site to see if a BIOS update is available (and what the new BIOS version fixes). Or if if its stable with 6GB then settle for that. One thing you could try is swapping the slot locations of the new ram with
 the original memory.</p>

<p>First try running Memtest86+, this runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or
<br />
confirm if your one or more of your memory sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours, if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />

<p>Prime 95:<br />
<a href="http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft/</a><br />
It's a stand alone .exe file contained in a .zip archive.<br />
Just choose to run the "stress test" option for 3 hours or more.<br />
If your PC can pass this test both your memory and CPU<br />
are fine (close the case cover to maintain proper ventilation)</p>
<p>Core Temp: <br />
Monitor the temperature of each core of your processor. For non overclockers using the stock Intel/AMD heatsink and cooling fan you can expect a temperature of 35 to 40C at idle and up 60C to 65C when running Prime95.<br />
<a href="http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/</a></p>
<p>CPU-ID (CPUZ): <br />
Shows the clock speed of the CPU under various load conditions (if you are using Intel's EIST speed step technology). Also has two tabs (Memory and SPD) which show the actual memory speed and 'SPD' tab shows the rated speeds for each memory slot that is populated.<br />

<h2>            Battery Saver Problem and Windows Update Issue</h2>
                    I have been using Windows 10 for a month now. All was good in the beginning, even had some recommended upgrades installed during this time. However for a past week or so the battery saver option is not working everytime i turn it on, as soon as i close
 the setting windows, if i open it again it is turned off plus the icon that appeared on the battery sign in the notification pane does not appear anymore. Along with that my recent updates are stuck at 32% it just wont go beyond that. I tried to run them while
 putting my notebook on charging (so that the saver is turned off be default) still no change.... My notebook is ASUS K555L.

            <p>Hi Abdul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 on an HP 2000. I&nbsp;downloaded and installed 10 back in early July. The battery saver function has always worked, however, starting a few days ago, I have now encountered the&nbsp;exact same problems&nbsp;as Usman with the battery saver mode.&nbsp;It
 will not enable either automatically nor manually.&nbsp; I have attempted to reset multiple times in settings, but it will not stay engaged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your instructions carefully, checked for Windows updates, but &nbsp;had no success with resolving he problem. I do at times run third party system tune up software that does remove registry items, cookies, junk files, spyware, etc. My thoughts were,
 perhaps something was removed that should not have been.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever the case maybe, everything has been functioning well for since early July. But again, just a few days ago, the battery saver mode has stopped and can not be re-enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time and assistance in this matter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>N2</p>

            <p>Step 2 worked just fine for me. I was trying to install "Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 (KB3140741)" today and Windows was insisting that my Tablet PC was on Battery Saver, which it was not.&nbsp; I even tried both ways with just having Battery Saver turned
 off, flipping it back on and off, and also plugging my tablet into power. Also tried restarting&nbsp;as well. Still them kinks to work out I guess&nbsp;with Windows 10, huh.</p>
<p>Glad I found this solution! Thank you very much.</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem, trying to update through a browser.&nbsp; The image I'm trying to upload is attached, but no matter what browser I use (Edge, Chrome, etc.), I receive this same error issue.&nbsp; It's most definitely on the Microsoft side.&nbsp; I'm using
 a direct LAN internet connection, so that's not the problem either.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 2 Cord</h2>
                    my surface pro 2 power cord sparked. &nbsp; I looked online for a new one and stumbled across the recall. &nbsp;Microsoft only replaces the plug to battery part. &nbsp;I believe the battery (charger?) is fried due to the spark. Why doesn't Microscope replace the whole
 cord? &nbsp;It was recalled as defective. &nbsp;Microsoft stores do not sell them. &nbsp;I have sent several emails to Microsoft without a response. &nbsp; &nbsp;

<h3> jmfjmfjmfjmf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot find documents from search bar</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded from Windows 7 to 10. Before 7 I used XP. One of the most important functions I need in my work is to be able to search very quickly (for example when speaking on the phone) for documents, files, emails etc archived somewhere&nbsp;in my computer,
 by entering for example a person's name, a string of words, a phone number etc that are in the contents of the item I am looking for. In Windows 7, the search function worked remarkably well for me. In XP it was OK and sufficient for my needs. In Windows 10,
 it seldom even finds very obvious things (for example a person's resume in MSWord by entering their last name).
</p>
<p>Is there something I can do to obtain the same search capabilities as in Windows 7?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern&nbsp;and we will&nbsp;assist you to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per&nbsp;your query, I am led to believe that you are&nbsp;unable to&nbsp;search for your personal document via&nbsp;entering the keyword in the search bar. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that in Windows 10, when you enter the keyword in the search box, you will find two options to search the web or my stuff. Click on the My Stuff option and you will be able to search for your personal documents similarly as Windows
 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, the search my stuff option is precisely the one that performs poorly and far from the Windows 7 feature. Is there any way to make it function to the level of the W7 one?</p>

</p><p>I would suggest that you try to implement the drop down options that are present when you make local searches. The options

            <p>Thank you Vanessa. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The main problem is that the search function does not find many&nbsp;items at all, and not that they are insufficiently filtered. For example I searched today by entering the last name of a&nbsp;person&nbsp;for whom I have the resume, a contact VM on Outlook, and several
 emails received over the last 15 years , the latest ones these last 2 weeks. These last emails are still in my inbox, and they have a signature with the person's name, phone, email address.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I enter the person's last name, it does not find any of these
 documents. Same if I enter his email address or his phone number. It only finds a very old irrelevant email stored in a folder I my documents where the person's email address is listed in the CC field.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above is only one example. I could list many more. In Windows 7, when I entered a person's name in the search field, it would list absolutely all documents, contacts, emails, pictures etc that contained the name somewhere. That is the kind of capability
 I would like to recover. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps is it possible to download and install the Windows 7 Search feature in Windows 10?

            <p>I have completed these steps 6 hours ago, and let the computer update indexing. It says it has completed it.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately the issue does not seem to have changed. I tested it by entering a person's last name, for he has sent me in the last few weeks several emails and documents which included his name in the text several times. It found none of them, not even
 his contact information in Outlook. </p>
<p>Very disappointing. </p>

<h2>            I want to delete my credit card</h2>
                    
<p>I recently renewed my Xbox Gold account for the year and charged it to my credit card.&nbsp; Now for privacy's sake I would like to remove its information.&nbsp; WHY is this impossible?&nbsp; Microsoft got its money and I have Auto-Renew turned OFF.&nbsp; Can I add an imaginary
 card and delete the real one?&nbsp; I would not of course try to charge anything to the imaginary one but I want my privacy!&nbsp; Or are "privacy" and "Microsoft" totally incompatible???&nbsp; Please don't suggest PayPal because I don't want MS to have my PayPal info either.</p>
<p>Surely there is some financial law that says once a company is done charging you for something, they have to remove your cc info if you request it.&nbsp; And if there isn't, there should be!</p>

<p>It's simple even if someone got into your account they cannot see your creditcard number
</p>
<p>Only 4 digits which they cannot use anyways</p>
<p>Also the terms of use clearly state while a membership is on a card a active creditcard must remain on the account till the membership expires</p>
<p>Read terms of use section 6</p>
<p>There is no law concerning that otherwise allot of companies would be brankrupt</p>
<p>Billing info is allowed not to mention subscriptions</p>
<p>If you really want to remove the creditcard you can by calling support and asking them to do so</p>
<p>If this was a promotional membership however with ms points or a game you must wait till the promotion is issued at 6-8weeks</p>
<p>Then they will cancel the membership and issue a prepaid code for the remaining amount of time if over a month</p>
<p>If it is just a monthly it cannot be done</p>
<p>Adding false creditcard won't work for 2 reasons billing violation</p>
<p>And it would fail on validation it would have to pass validation</p>

<p>Thank you for responding. &nbsp;It was a one-time renewal for a year's membership, period. &nbsp;Not monthly. &nbsp;There are no pending or revolving charges tied to it. &nbsp;It was not a promotional membership tied to MS points or to a game. &nbsp;Boom -- charged, Microsoft has
 its money. &nbsp;That should be the end of it. &nbsp; I should be able to control my financial information when there are no pending charges.</p>
<p>I would not actually try to add a false credit card because that would be just plain wrong. &nbsp;That was my frustration talking.</p>

<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I have never used Amazon music before.</p>
<p>At the same time most programs / software have configuration settings which you can access when you open it or it opens automatically.</p>
<p>In there one can usually find a heading such as load on start up or something to that effect.</p>
<p>Turn this off.</p>
<p>If it is a check box with a check tick in it remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another trick you can try is this.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Win-r keys.</li></ol>
<p>The RUN dialog window opens up.</p>
<p>( NOTE : the Win key is the key with the windows flag / logo on it )</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. In the Run Dialog window "Open" field type msconfig.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Press Enter key.</p>
<p>The Systems Configuration Utility opens up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;4. Click on the Startup Tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;5. Un-check the item that you don`t want to launch on startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ( Should be Amazon or something like that )</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;6. When you have finished click Apply and then OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;7. Re-boot to see that it has taken effect.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 2 with Power Cover Full Charge Capacity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dumanri  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2 with Power Cover Full Charge Capacity</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 2 / 128G running Windows 10. &nbsp;I purchased a Power Cover April 2016 and have recently noticed (July 2016) that the battery monitor is not updating properly. &nbsp;Ran powercfg /battteryreport and see a very strange history on the Full Charge
 Capacity. &nbsp;Since using the power cover the combined Full Charge Capacity has risen from 59,003 mWh (normal) to 123,829 mWh. &nbsp;That's 79.6% above Design Capacity. &nbsp;The internal battery Full Charge Capacity is 131% above Design Capacity. &nbsp;The individual Power
 Cover Full Charge Capacity seems to be normal at 2.9 % below Design Capacity.</p>
<p>How is that possible? &nbsp;Is this a software / firmware, hardware, or battery problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the Windows 10 and firmware updates are installed and I've gone through all the trouble shooting suggestions. &nbsp;I have done a hardware reset many times with no change to the Full Charge Capacity except to keep increasing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

</p><p>I have tried all the trouble shooting as stated above with no results. &nbsp;The battery monitor does not update correctly because it thinks the internal battery is at full capacity when it is not. &nbsp;Still trying to understand how the internal battery full charge
 capacity can be greater than the design capacity. &nbsp;From what I've read about Li-ion batteries it leads me to believe there is a hardware failure in either the battery or charging circuit.</p>

            "This user cannot access local area network." can you elaborate on that?
<br />What are you trying to do when this happens?
<br />What type of network are you on?
<br />wifi or using network cables?
<br />Are you using workgroup, homegroup or domain?
<br />What version of windows are you running, go to search and type winver for that information?
<br />This user cannot access local area network?
<br />
<br />Check your network connections.
<br />Make sure you are connected in the taskbar and you are not seeing any issues.
<br />Go to search and type troubleshoot.
<br />Select Internet connections and run through that.
<br />
<br />Are you using local account or Microsoft account to login?

    <title>Windows Always Starts with Night Light Mode On, Even When Disabled - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Always Starts with Night Light Mode On, Even When Disabled &#40;Found solution&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a desktop work computer with Windows 10 Pro, and ever since night light mode got turned on once, then disabled, Windows ALWAYS starts with Night Light mode enabled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The odd thing is that if I go to Action Center, the Night Light mode is disabled. I have to click the button to "Enable" it then click again to disable just to get it back to normal. This is quite irritating as it has to be done whenever computer boots up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is fully up to date, and I have scoured the Internet with this issue to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline; color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>Edit:</strong></span></p>
<p>In case anyone is having same issue, I found a solution that fixed my problem.
</p>
<p><a href="https://pureinfotech.com/fix-night-light-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Solution">Here is link to the page</a><br />
</p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Open regedit (Hold Windows Key + R, then type "regedit" and Enter)</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Backup your registry ALWAYS before making changes (File &gt; Export &gt; Filename)</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Navigate to:&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudStore\Store\Cache\DefaultAccount</strong></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Delete these two folders:</p>
<pre>           <strong>$$<span>windows.data.bluelightreduction.bluelightreductionstate</span>
           $$</strong><span><strong>windows.data.bluelightreduction.settings</strong></span></pre>
<p>5. Restart Computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>This fixed it for me. In case it didn't, there were other possible solutions on link I provided. Best of luck.</p>

<p>-Issue started approximately two weeks ago (First time I ever enabled Night Light to see what it is)</p>
<p>-No changes were made to the computer</p>
<p>-OS build is 15063</p>
<p>-I turned off nightlight by clicking on notification icon bottom right corner of my screen, brought up Action Center, then clicked on box that says "Night Light" to enable it, then same box again to disable it.</p>
<p>-I have no schedule set up for night light</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just rebooted my machine, night light mode is clearly on for me, and this is what the Action Center looks like. You can see Night Light box is not highlighted so it should be off, not on.</p>
