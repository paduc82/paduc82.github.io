<h2>            Endless loop of blue screen</h2>
                    My son turned off my Asus laptop while it was updating after it had been powered down for 3 months. I cannot get to do anything but a loop always ending in error. &nbsp;The Asus rep thinks the operating system needs to be reinstalled, &nbsp;then quoted me &nbsp;$260!
<p>
</p><p>I purchased the laptop brand new in Sept 2014. Originally it was Windows 8 but I did the free upgrade to 10 when it came available. My F9 screen let me know the operating system is Windows 8.x.</p>
<p>I've tried downloading the &nbsp;Windows 8.1 and 10 recovery to a usb flash drive on my Vista desktop, &nbsp;laptop recognized it's there but it's not booting it or prompting install.</p>
<p>I'm only worried about saving my photos but I'm clueless on how to fix this?

    <title>Windows Recovery CD &#47;DVD Disc &#47; Drive creation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tochman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Recovery CD &#47;DVD Disc &#47; Drive creation</h2>
                    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Recovery CD / DVD&nbsp;Disc, Recovery USB Drive.&nbsp; &nbsp;Windows 10 Pro Version 1511.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Problem:<span>&nbsp; </span>
Recovery Disc created under Windows 10 Pro, V1511 won't go past the opening screen offering choice of keyboard. Both keyboard and mouse are dead. Not responding. No error messages.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>In my case, I took up Microsoft's offer (regretfully) to "upgrade" to Windows 10 Pro over existing successfully installed Windows 7 Ultimate PCs, after Microsoft did a&nbsp;check of my existing
 hardware and installed software for compatibility and everything was found to be "OK".<span>&nbsp; No problems.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The on-line offer to "upgrade" began in July 2015 and I did the "upgrade" in December 2015,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">making a Recovery Disc almost immediately after the Windows 10 on-line install</span> that completed without problems. I was given a chance to revert back to Windows 7 within a month following on-line download and install
 of Windows 10.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>At first, everything worked fine, despite my total disappointment at the loss of the familiar W7U look, feel and functionality.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I immediately created a system Recovery Disc as advised.
</span></span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Soon after the first&nbsp; huge"cumulative" update, problems started. No cumulative update would install after a successful download. Incidentally, ALL other updates install OK. No error messages.
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>ONLY cumulative updates fail
</span></span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">to complete
</span>with W10 saying " we couldn't complete the update, undoing changes, do not turn off your computer" etc;. I get NO error codes or warnings what-so-ever.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I tried using the recovery disc created under Windows 10 Pro Version 1511 but couldn't get past the opening "select your keyboard" screen. Both keyboard and mouse do not work, so unable to progress.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">However, the first Recovery disc, created immediately after the existing Windows 7 Ultimate installation was overwritten by the "upgrade" to Windows10, worked
 just fine and I was able to select keyboard, and the mouse worked too.</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>This suggests to me that somewhere along the Windows 10 "ongoing project" development line, Microsoft has omitted essential drivers for keyboard and mouse when creating a
</span></strong><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 10 Pro Version 1511 recovery CD / DVD, or USB boot device
</span></strong></span><strong><span>to enable booting into the recovery environment / option for your system. Alternatively, if the drivers are included, they are not being recognised by the recovery software&nbsp;used to create a recovery
 environment.</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Anyone know what the appropriate drivers are and where exactly they are located, and how to install them for the Recovery Disc / DVD environment?</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Thanks ZigZag3143. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have the ISO and DVD. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you read my post carefully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do NOT want to install ALL programs over again, for obvious reasons, if I can avoid doing so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I don't have to do that anyway, as I can now do a complete image restore from saved images using my Windows 7 created recovery DVD, and image backups of Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My concern is for those hapless Windows 10 users who have had the same problem as I have had creating a working recovery CD / DVD / USB Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately for me, my recovery problem is solved for the moment. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">BUT, I still can't create a "Recovery" CD / DVD / USB Drive using Windows 10 Pro, V1511 that works.
</span>Without it, you eventually end up with a bricked system if you're unlucky to lose drive "C" on your HDD / SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only alternative is, as already mentioned, to do a complete reinstall of everything. Why would I want to do that needlessly?</p>

<h2>            windows error recovery keeps coming up at boot for no reason...</h2>
                    Hi i recently got windows 7 professional 64-bit from my school last Thursday by burning it to a dvd. Everything seemed fine after installation and such until Saturday when it would boot past the bio's screen and then pop up with windows error recovery
 which was telling me that windows wasn't working an to repair it or start normally either way it would keep going to this windows error recovery screen no matter what i chose. Eventually these events led me to believe that my hard drive failed in which i got
 a brand new one that Sunday and installed it all seemed fine then Monday morning it started doing popping up with the same error message i was able to try repairs said it was fine, try and boot and it would reboot again. Luckily i was able to install my vista
 home premium 64bit which seemed to be ok for most of that day till yesterday when it brought the windows error recovery up with the options to use last configuration or start normally (due to recent hardware or software changes but i have not install anything
 new in terms of software or hardware) which works but im not sure for how long. Im very tech savvy for my age and know what im doing this with computers, but i cant seem to figure out whats going on since its a new drive none of my hardware is failing and
 i just dont know. <br />
Appreciate any help....<br />

If this weren't so frustrating, it would be amusing, as it renders the location tracking function of all apps that attempt&nbsp;do so completely ineffective.

<h2>            10&#47;1&#47;15 - External Monitor no longer recognized by Surface Pro 3 &#40;post update&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Surface Pro 3. w/ Acer External Monitor. HDMI cable. All was working fine until this morning after receiving notice of updates applied at startup. Now monitor is not recognized - Surface only "sees" 1 monitor (the internal one of course).
</p>
<p>Any solutions? Ideas? Thanks!</p>

            <p>OK, I got mine working with MS Support call.</p>
<p>Here is what I have:</p>
<p>Windows 10<br />
Surface Pro 3 w/ keyboard<br />
Acer External Monitor</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the essence of the issue: Latest update doesn't seem to completely update in certain situations / sequences of events. This may be more likely if your Surface came with Win 8, and subsequently was upgraded to Win 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So.... First, try the Troubleshooter(s).</p>
<p><br />
In the lower left search box type "trouble"<br />
Hardware &amp; Sound -&gt; Hardware and Devices</p>
<p>run it. it may find/fix problems, and </p>
<p>may ask for restart when done...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then,</p>
<p>Run updates manually through All Settings - &gt; Update &amp; Security</p>
<p>after you restart</p>
<p>Come back to All Settings -&gt; Update and Security, </p>
<p>If there are updates waiting, install them, and restart then come back here again as needed....&nbsp;until there are none to install.</p>
<p>Then check for updates.<br />
If it finds them, then install those and restart&nbsp;and come back here again as needed</p>
<p>until no updates are found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked for me and I have my external monitor back online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

<p>it helps those answering your questions if you provide:</p>
<p>what <strong>version of windows (32bit or 64bit</strong>)</p>
<p><span><span><span>is vista<strong>Service Pack</strong> 1 (SP1) or SP2 installed?</span></span></span>.</p>
<p>what browser (exact version) you are using.</p>
<p>what <strong>anti-virus application or security suite</strong> is installed and is your subscription current?</p>
<p>what third-party firewall</p>
<p><span><span>is this "software firewall" the Windows Firewall or a third-party firewall? If the latter, what is the name of this application?</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;what antimalware software you may have installed.</p>
<p>which update(s) are you trying to install? (KB Number)</p>
<p>what error are you getting while trying to install updates?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span><span>The more information you provide will help someone to provide you with a relevant solution.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Windows 7 or Vista Updates Fail To Install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you find that a particular Windows Update does not install, here are some suggestions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;First clear up your Temp File/Cache, Reboot and try again. Best and easier to use Ccleaner &lt;<span><span> Download the basic version via &nbsp;</span></span>&lt;<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/download/builds.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/download/builds.aspx</a>&gt;
 The basic version does not contain the disgusted Toolbar&gt;.</p>
<p>Disable your Firewall and try !</p>
<p>In many cases, the update may fail to install in the first instance, but for some inexplicable reason, succeeds in the 2nd or 3rd try. So try a couple of times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It it doesn't help, search on Microsoft, for the patch / update KB number, and download its Stand-alone Installer. Now apply the patch manually. Search for just the number; don't include KB !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it still doesn't help, try this : Rt Click Computer &gt; Manage &gt; Services &gt; Stop the "Cryptographic Service" and rename the "Catroot2" folder situated in C:\Windows\System32\Catroot to something like say Catroot2X. Reboot. Now
 run the update/hotfix installers again. This action will re-generate a new Catroot2 folder and the updates/hotfixes, should hopefully install OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If still you have a problem then, go to C:\Windows\WindowsUpdate.log and look for the most recent entry. This will be present towards the end of the log. Any failed updates will have error code/s written next to them. Note them
 down. If you find just too many entries too confusing delete this WindowsUpdate.log and try installing the updates again. Now open the newly re-created WindowsUpdate log file and have a look at its contents. The warnings will probably appear as -:<strong>WARNING</strong>:
 Failed to find updates with error code XXXXXXXX.</p>
<p>Now Rt-click Computer &gt; Manage &gt; Event Viewer &gt; Applications and Service Logs &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; WindowsUpdateClient &gt; Operational . Check out for any<strong>Critical</strong> Message or Warning<strong><span><span><span>FATAL</span></span></span></strong>.</p>

<p>I suspect you're seeing the effects of a hijackware infection.</p>
<p>Please answer all of the following diagnostic questions by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. Did you upgrade to Win7 or is it a new computer?</p>
<p>2. When does your current NOD32 Ant-Virus subscription expire?</p>
<p>3. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application ever been installed on the computer?</p>

<p>thanks for your help guys it just started updating i made this:</p>
<p>If it still doesn't help, try this : Rt Click Computer &gt; Manage &gt; Services &gt; Stop the "Cryptographic Service" and rename the "Catroot2" folder situated in C:\Windows\System32\Catroot to something like say Catroot2X. Reboot. Now run the update/hotfix installers
 again. This action will re-generate a new Catroot2 folder and the updates/hotfixes, should hopefully install OK.</p>
<p>and i used to have check for updates and then let me decide to download or not so i made it all automatic which is auto check and download .</p>
<p>and i restarted my pc and then i found that it is updating .</p>
<p>thanks for your help you are the best.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 DVD Burn Support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronx_871  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 DVD Burn Support</h2>
                    Read all Google could find about MS Windows 10 not supporting DVD burn. &nbsp;Issue: &nbsp;I used to make home videos with Movie Maker for family and friends, and burn a DVD after saving file as MP4. &nbsp;It appears making CD/DVD for music and data files is supported
 in File Explorer but no support for homemade videos. <strong>&nbsp;Is there a Windows update coming to fix this?</strong> &nbsp;If not, which free/fee apps does MS recommend to overcome this serious omission? &nbsp;Three cheers for Windows 7! &nbsp;Bronx cheer for Windows 10.
 &nbsp;( I also tried the "free" and "free-for-limited-demo" apps that claim they burn DVDs in Windows 10 -- &nbsp;all<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&nbsp;junk</span> compared to Windows 7's built-in DVD burning app.) BTW, I also tried
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">older</span> Roxio<em> easyCD/DVD</em>, and it was not supported by Windows 10. &nbsp;And I had such great hopes MS finally got it right. &nbsp;

            I am NOT ripping a DVD. &nbsp;I am making video in Movie Maker, a great MS &nbsp;tool, but In Windows 10 there is no way to transfer my&nbsp;completed project to DVD via the burner<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">. If you know for sure VLC can do this, please
 let me know.</span> &nbsp;I have no problem uploading movie for online viewing or making a thumb drive copy that plays on other computers. &nbsp;Here's the deal, I am only asking for an answer to how to burn a DVD of a completed video project. &nbsp;Many people simply do
 not have access to a smartphone or computer, but they do have a DVD player and would luv to see video of family gatherings. MS will not comment on this, as far as I have seen -- must have something to do with copyrights and pressure from commercial interests,
 but this omission in Windows 10 took a lot of the luster off of moving from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 (free). &nbsp; Windows 7 Pro was flawless in its ability to handle a DVD video burning task. &nbsp;My strong feelings is that Windows XP was great and windows 7 Pro
 was awesome, but Windows 10 is not a fully developed OS if it cannot support DVD burning of non-copyrighted content. &nbsp;I may try going back to Windows 7 Pro but it is scary since one never knows what bombshell Microsoft has buried in that protocol. &nbsp;Thanks
 for commenting on my original question, which I, BTW, originally submitted as a comment. &nbsp;MS decided IT was more of a question. &nbsp;Go figure. &nbsp;No, it is more of a comment since no one but me apparently has this issue.

            I found that Windows 10 handles Movie Maker very well, and for a novice like myself, it is perfect for video and/or slide shows. &nbsp;The heavy-hitter apps from Adobe and others are just too complex for my needs. &nbsp;The only problem I have encountered is non
 support for DVD burning of a completed project. &nbsp;I'm thinking maybe I will need to purchase a video NLE program with bullt-in DVD authoring and burning, but would prefer to sick with Movie Maker. &nbsp;I've have tried running a thumb drive copy of a completed project
 on an older Vista desktop, but so far I have not been able to find a format that Vista and my NLE apps on it will burn, yet the video plays flawlessly. &nbsp;Thanks &nbsp;for your answer, and let me know if you find out more on this subject.

            <p>As noted in those other threads, Microsoft dropped support for Windows DVD Maker as of Windows 7. It isn't in the Windows Store so there isn't a way to use it on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest Movie Maker 2012 saves in .mp4 format by default, but Windows DVD Maker doesn't understand .mp4 format. Instead, you need to change the movie format to Windows Media Video (.wmv). Then you could copy that to a USB drive and use Windows DVD Maker
 on your Vista machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To save in WMV format, when you are choosing the file location and file name of your file, there is also a drop-down in the lower right where you can pick the file format. Change it from H.264 (.mp4) to Windows Media Video (.wmv).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DVD format is now considered a "legacy" format by Apple and Microsoft. Since it was created in the era of analog TVs, it has a maximum resolution of 480p (NTSC). That means it isn't an ideal format for HD video which will be down-rezzed to the standard-definition
 format of a video DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a Blu-ray player (or a modern video game console which usually has Blu-ray capability) then you could just put the movie file that Movie Maker creates directly onto an optical disc (even a DVD), but just as a data file. Then that will play in
 the Blu-ray player in HD quality.</p>

            considerate_guy, &nbsp;yep that should really help. &nbsp;I tried some different formats but I think I missed trying WMV. &nbsp;I was not sure which format to use for DVD Maker. &nbsp;I'll get back with more next week when I have time to return to my movie project. &nbsp;In mean
 time, I had one (1) DVD already burned using Windows 7 Pro, Movie Maker and DVD Burn, so I was able to use my third-party software to burn copies on the Vista system with both a DVD player and DVD burner. Many thanks for sticking with me on this issue and
 coming up with a solution. &nbsp;

            Summary and Update: &nbsp;Movie Maker 2012 works well in Windows 10 but is not available for download from MS. &nbsp;It can still be downloaded for older Windows systems. &nbsp; My copy of Movie Maker came with Windows 7 Pro. &nbsp;If you still have a Windows 7 Pro system
 think long and hard about upgrading to Windows 10! &nbsp; A computer running Vista or Windows 7 will burn a DVD in a heartbeat using Windows DVD Maker and enable you to play your DVD on just about anything. &nbsp;I used a Sandisk USB Flash Drive to transfer movie from
 Windows 10 computer to Vista computer. &nbsp; To get your movie on a flash drive, save your completed movie project "For Computer" and change format from default MP4 to optional WMV. Copy your saved movie to USB flash drive and load on your old system for burning.
 &nbsp;While this workaround is not perfect, it will let you continue making DVDs for a few more years. &nbsp; Since I now know what it takes to keep using Windows Movie Maker and Windows DVD Maker, I am

            <p>Editing your movie and the authoring of a DVD are treated as separate steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can most definitely still <a href="http://download.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
install and use Movie Maker 2012</a> for the editing step. It will install on versions of Windows 7 and higher (including Windows 10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the DVD authoring step, Microsoft's solution (Windows DVD Maker) is no longer produced. It came with Windows Vista and Windows 7 but isn't available for the later versions.</p>
<p>There are solutions for DVD authoring if you still need this "legacy" format. But as you noted, most of the video editing packages you can buy don't include it either. It's going away as the world has moved on to HD and possibly 4K in the future. It's also
 less relevant in the age of distribution of video via digital streaming in lieu of using optical discs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for those that are still hanging on to the standard-definition video DVD format (480p maximum vertical resolution), some free options are:</p>

<span>Installed RAM:&nbsp; 16.00GB</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We deployed all these patches via Configuration Manager to all the clients in our organization, we are mostly having the same version of OS image installed and running mostly on version 1607, some machine have encounter the same issue installing this patch&nbsp;<span>Microsoft
 .NET Framework 4.7.1 for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64 (KB4033393)</span></p>
<p>Had try to remove cache and recent patch update (eg. .Net Framework 4.7 (<span>KB3186568</span>)) and let it reinstall again, all install successfully except KB4033393.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Software Center error: Failed - 0x80070476(-2147023754)</p>

</p><p>Another worth mentioning also I did tried to download the offline installer for .Net Framework 4.7.1 and run the setup, but it is also failed to install from the setup package, as describe here:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4033393/the-microsoft-net-framework-4-7-1-for-windows-10-version-1607-windows</p>

</p><p>We couldn't just upgrade to the latest version of Windows 10 to solved each of the particular machine as from the company point of view and also the compatibility of all the internal services may also need to take into consideration. Do we have a better
 way of resolve this?</p>

<p>Hi all, just an update, there after we tried many stuff to get this patch install (particular to KB4033393), question posted to technet we have not get any feedback, and since we deploy the updates from Configuration Manager, then again we tried to raise
 up the "Maximum Run Time" to 480 minutes in SCCM &gt; Software Update (for that particular KB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not quite sure if this really overcome the issue, but as far as I could see that the patch is successfully installed on my machine on 5th March 2018.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this issue is now conclude at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. :)</p>

<h2>            problems with head phone audio</h2>
                    <div>Few days ago I got on my Surface and I noticed I couldn't hear anything. I tried multiple headphones and still nothing even though the head phones are working. I don't know if it's a virus or something. When I go to YouTube I have to put the volume on
 50/100 to hear something. Also when I play music, I can hear only the music part and I can barely hear the lyrics. Really frustrating and anything is appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;this first happened when I tried to watch a TV show thru Xbox. Initially I could hear the sound
 now just crackling, and screeching.&nbsp; please help. Have also downloaded all updates. Thanks julie</div>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry about the delay in response!&nbsp; Let's see what is going on with your Surface RT and low audio through headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say you just got your Surface RT.&nbsp; Can you confirm that all updates have been installed?&nbsp; Keep in mind, that with a device fresh out of the box there will be several layers of updates.&nbsp; Remember to restart Surface between layers, and keep it plugged
 in throughout the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have consistent low audio through various sets of headphones?&nbsp; To be sure, do these have in line volume controls or integrated microphone?&nbsp; Consider the beveled chassis of Surface.&nbsp; You are sure the headphones are plugged in completely?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is audio through the device speakers?&nbsp; Have you Bluetooth audio device you can check with?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know of your results.</p>

            <p>You can choose between whether it uses your Microsoft Account or a normal user account by going to all PC settings, to the Users section.:<br />
1) Just move your mouse to the bottom-right corner of the screen till the side menu pops up, and click on Settings (gear icon).<br />
2) From there, click on the "Change PC settings" link on the bottom-right.<br />
3) Now you should be on the PC settings full-screen menu. On the left, go to the "Users" section.<br />
4) On the right side, it will show your current account with a button that says "Switch to a local account". Clicking on this button and following the steps will enable you to be able to log into Windows as you do with all other versions of Windows like Windows
 7, Vista, XP, etc.</p>
<p>After you have switched to a local account again, switch back again to a Microsoft Account and enter the new Windows Live ID.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 and 10 Error Codes</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Shamelessly stolen from&nbsp;https://www.facebook.com/notes/microsoft-solitaire-collection/error-codes-how-to-fix-your-game/852275104794343/</p>
<p>Getting an error code in your game and don't know what it means? You've come to the right place! We also have some great, general ways to fix your game at the end. &nbsp;We update this often so be sure to check back!</p>
<p><span>The first codes are for the Windows 10 version of the game. Simply scroll down to see error codes specific to the Windows 8.1 version.</span></p>
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 10 Error Codes</span>
<p><span>If your error code starts with...</span></p>
<p><span>100 -&nbsp;</span>Check your internet connection: you might have become disconnected from the internet.</p>
<p><b>101, 105, 106 -&nbsp;</b>Something isn't quite right with the news feature or a file was missing from the manifest. Let us know about this!</p>
<p><b>102 -&nbsp;</b>Something isn't quite right with the ads. Please also let us know about this.</p>
<p><b>103,&nbsp;<b>108, 109, 110, 111</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</b>Something went wrong when trying to access the Star Club games. Let us know so we can try to help you.</p>
<p><b>104 -&nbsp;</b>Something isn't quite right with the Daily Challenges. Definitely let us know ASAP, please!</p>
<p><b>107</b>&nbsp;- Uh oh, something is preventing the game from downloading Star Club games. Check your internet connection first. If your connection is fine, check your anti-virus program and make sure Microsoft Solitaire Collection is on the OK list to access
 the internet.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>20 -&nbsp;</b>Example: 2020000 &nbsp;This means something isn't quite right with your Windows Store. Try these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Try clearing your Windows Store Cache by typing wsreset.exe into the Run window. Detailed instructions are further down this note!
</li><li>Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter (instructions are further down this note) and then installing any missing required, recommended, or optional updates.&nbsp;
</li><li>Restart and see if that fixes it.&nbsp; </li><li>If that doesn't work, try running the Windows App Troubleshooter:&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423</a>
</li><li>Unfortunately if none of those steps work, you may have a more serious issue with your Store. Try contacting Windows Store support at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fcontactus&amp;h=PAQE1OgZg&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus</a>&nbsp;&amp;
 click on "Services and Apps" </li></ol>


<p><b>30</b>&nbsp;- Example: 303019. This means the connection to the Windows Store was lost or could not be made. The most common reason is that the Windows Store is temporarily down. Usually it will come right back up shortly! Sometimes it means your anti-virus
 program or firewall is blocking the game from talking to the Windows Store. Go to your anti-virus or firewall settings to make sure that it's not blocking your game from accessing the internet.</p>

<p><b>Other error codes you might see &amp; what they mean.</b></p>

<p><b>1170000&nbsp;</b>- Xbox Live couldn't sign you in. Usually this means that there's a current Xbox Live outage, or a Windows Update that didn't install. First check the following website to see if there's a known Xbox Live outage:</p>
<p><a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-live-status&amp;h=lAQFBXVec&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status</a></p>
<p><span>If there's no known outage, try the following:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Check to make sure you're connected to the internet. </li><li>Check to see if Xbox Live services are down. This handy website shows the status:&nbsp;<a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-live-status&amp;h=AAQGMfw5G&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status</a>
</li><li>If they are all up, go to&nbsp;<a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2F&amp;h=aAQFHAyrO&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xbox.com</a>&nbsp;and sign in with the same account you sign in to on your computer/tablet.
</li><li>If everything is okay there, try restarting your computer/tablet with the "restart" option on the power/shutdown menu. Just clicking the off button or turning off your computer/tablet won't work. It needs to be restarted.
</li><li>If you still can't connect, try running the Windows Update Troubleshooter. We have detailed instructions here if you scroll down, but you can get it here: &nbsp;<a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.microsoft.com%2F%3Flinkid%3D9830262&amp;h=mAQEi4Fjx&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262</a>
</li><li>Check For Updates &amp; install any mandatory, recommended, or optional updates you might have missed. We have detailed instructions further down this note.
</li><li>Restart your computer - all those updates need to finish &amp; you need to restart to make sure they all went through.
</li></ol>
<b>1173000 &amp; 1174000</b>&nbsp;- You're not signed into Xbox Live so it couldn't load your statistics or awards. Try the steps above.
<p><b>1182000&nbsp;</b><span>- This looks like the game couldn't load your save data from the cloud. Try restarting your computer/tablet to get a fresh connection.

 see if the Xbox Live service is down.</span></p>
<p><b>1183000, 1187000, 1188000</b><span>&nbsp;- These are not common errors but you might get them if you try to load your statistics, awards, or Daily Challenges and your game can't access the internet or if the Xbox
 Live service is down.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>002000 &amp; 01600</span></p>

<div>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><i>Detailed instructions on troubleshooting steps below!</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Restart Your PC/Tablet</span></strong></p>
<p>Did you know that shutting down your PC/Tablet WILL NOT give you a clean boot? Most people don't, so no worries. The ONLY way you can get a clean reboot is to choose restart from the shut down menu. &nbsp;Physically turning your PC/Tablet off will not do it,
 choosing "shut down" will not do it, choosing "sleep" will not do it.</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your Shut Down menu (you can get it to it by pressing the Windows key, type Restart, click on Turn off Your PC, go to the bottom of the Settings window that will appear &amp; press the Power button)
</li><li>Select "Restart" from the menu </li></ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Check Your Internet Connection</span></strong><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open an internet browser </li><li>Attempt to go to&nbsp;<a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2F&amp;h=FAQGXATc_&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com</a>
</li><li>If you cannot load the webpage, check your modem or router as your internet may not be working properly.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</li></ol>
<p><b>Try the Windows Update Troubleshooter</b></p>
<p><span>Many issues can be solved by using this helpful tool!</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Click on this link:&nbsp;<a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.microsoft.com%2F%3Flinkid%3D9830262&amp;h=nAQG02I0j&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262</a>
</li><li>Open the tool and follow the instructions </li><li>Let it work its magic </li><li>Take any Windows Updates you may need </li><li>Restart your PC/tablet using the restart option in the shutdown menu (also described above)
</li><li>Launch the game again </li></ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Make Certain Your Windows Updates Didn't Get "Stuck"</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>Did you know that even if you have Automatic Updates selected, some Windows Updates can get "stuck" for various reasons? &nbsp;Lots of people (myself included) have discovered much to their surprise that some Windows Updates just simply didn't go through
 like we thought they did and it affects the performance of the entire machine.</p>
<ol>

                    <span>I used to be able to record videos and take pictures from my built-in camera on my laptop ("Motion Eye"). A couple months ago, my laptop crashed from too many viruses. I took it to get fixed and most or all of my downloads were
 deleted. And now when I want to record a video from my laptop's built-in "Motion Eye," the application on my laptop isn't there to click on record a video/take a picture anymore. But when I skype with friends, my computer automatically goes to the built in
 webcam. I'm confused. Usually my computer says it can't find the built-in webcam.<br />
I recently found an application called "CaptureWizard" on my laptop that wasn't there before. Thinking it would be the same thing as my old application (be able to record a video/take a picture), I clicked on it but it said:<br />
"Import Video could not find a compatible digital video device. Verify that the digital video device is properly connected and turned on."<br />
<strong>SO </strong>I guess my main overall question for you geniuses out there is how do I get my built-in webcam&nbsp; to be "properly connected"?</span> &lt;input id="gwProxy" type="hidden"&gt;&lt;/input&gt; &lt;input id="jsProxy" onclick="jsCall();" type="hidden" /&gt;

<p><span>Hi Summmmerrrlove,</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>A.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>From when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>B.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Any recent changes made on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, install the webcam software from the manufacturer’s website and check if it works. If this does not work then this might be due to the driver corruption. Try to uninstall
 the existing drivers and reinstall the latest driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong>start</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type
<strong>devmgmt</strong>.<strong>msc</strong> in the start search box and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on the driver for the web cam and choose the option
<strong>uninstall</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reinstall the drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Check if the web cam is working properly.</span></p>

    <title>Cortana gets stuck when clicked on MIC button in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oyesh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana gets stuck when clicked on MIC button in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I click on MIC button in Cortana, it gets stuck. And, the whole TASK BAR and START MENU stops working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 on Lenovo X1 Carbon. The speech recognition used to work fine, but now it has stopped all of a sudden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have turned on "Hey Cortana" as well, but that doesn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to kill Cortana, from the TASK Manager, once it gets stuck. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you guys will fix the issue soon. And, am excited to use the voice recognition soon. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Nextbook NXW10QC32G won&#39;t connect to the internet</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a nextbook tablet. &nbsp;Originally I was able to set it up to my broadband internet. &nbsp;The next day I couldn't connect to the internet. &nbsp;I took it to work and was able to connect to the broadband there, but the next day it wouldn't let me
 do it the following day, what is the matter with it?</p>

            <p>Well, I decided that since this tablet was less than 2 weeks old I would just take it back to the shop, which I did. &nbsp;They said it was a driver and hardware problem. &nbsp;The guy at the shop tried to fix it then and there, but he couldn't so I had to leave it
 with him to contact the supplier.</p>

            <p>Hello kelvinmorcill0,</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can earn Xbox Live Rewards Credit in two ways:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. By finishing the offers located on the&nbsp;MyMissions&nbsp;page at&nbsp;<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/mymissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/mymissions/</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-or-&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;For non-offer purchases, you can earn Credits by earning a one star&nbsp;MyVIP&nbsp;level through purchasing at least $300 USD or regional equivalent of eligible content. After you receive your first star you will begin to earn a percentage of your eligible purchases back as payback Rewards Credit. Pre-orders,&nbsp;in-game consumables, and subscriptions are not eligible for&nbsp;MyVIP.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /></p><p>In&nbsp;September 2014&nbsp;we changed to the MyVIP policy.&nbsp;As a result, payback based off Gamerscore (MyAchievements) was discontinued.&nbsp;Also, as of July 2014, we do not award Credits for Xbox Live Gold renewals.&nbsp;MyVIP&nbsp;has a recalibration every year. At the end of the year, we place you in your&nbsp;MyVIP&nbsp;rank for the new year based off your eligible spending from the previous year, and set your progress to the default state. This happened in September 2015 and December 2016.&nbsp;Since you are a&nbsp;zero star&nbsp;member, you do not get payback Credits on your purchases. You can check your current MyVIP level/progress at (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/</a>).&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Furthermore, please keep in mind that you are registered as a US&nbsp;Rewards member. This means we can only reward purchases made in USD. If you purchase in a different currency, not only will th

    <title>Won&#39;t stop updating and configuring - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnd3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Won&#39;t stop updating and configuring</h2>
                    Everytime I turn off my computer, Vista is downloading updates. Then the next time I turn it on, it says it's 'configuring 1 of 3- do not turn computer off'. This takes up to 20 minutes to configure all three. It seems as if it's attempting to perform
 the same update over and over. I let it run- I don't turn off the computer. To top it all, everytime over the past year that Vista has updated, my computer fails to boot, and has to search for solutions, which of course takes forever as well. It finally boots
 up, but this is obviously unacceptable. I need to know if there is a solution, or if it's just one more flaw in the terrible Vista operating system, and I should just download Windows 7, or, better yet, buy a Mac. Thanks for any help...<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are there any changes made prior to the issue?<br />

            <p>If it is played over the internet it can be hacked... Sadly XBLET doesn't want to admit this, because then they would actually have to do some work, it's easier for them to just issue some com bans when someone says something to hurt someone else's feelings.</p><p>There are plenty of mods in PUBG, it's sad.... aim bot and God mode mods are the most common.<br /></p>
