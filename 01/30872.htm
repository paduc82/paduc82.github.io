<h2>            Really&#63; No passive HDMI pass-through&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Please tell me that passive pass-through is in a planned update. I really don't want to have to turn my xbox completely on when I know I'm not going to use it whatsoever, just to watch tv. This is a feature I'd love to use, but not at the expense of adding
 more steps (and power usage).</p>

<p>I like it not being passive, thought I too would like the option to turn it on and off. The problem I have had is after being on or in a low power state, I am having to reboot the xbox one in order to get TV functionality. TV (DirecTV) will be working fine,
 seamlessly integrated, then it will time out and not "load" up. I get an error code and no amount of troubleshooting will help (In fact, in the help section I get a specific set of instructions to reset TV/HDMI settings, but there is no "Troubleshoot" box
 to click or say in settings, per the instructions). I restarted everything BUT XBOX One and only restarting XBOX One will correct the issue. I'm no slouch with electronics, but my wife and young daughter are not. So while I can figure these things out they
 would be stuck with no TV and I'll be stuck with still having the TV bill and not have access to it when connected to XBOX One.</p>

<p>Ouch. I genuinely had no idea that the Xbox had to be on to watch TV. I thought it was capable of traditional passthrough. Not a fan of that at all (especially where my cable box is acting so wacky right now). Think I'll end up using the HDMI in for my 360.

<p>I too was disappointed that I would need to have XBOX ONE on to watch TV using that input. I have DirecTV and decided I really did want the Live TV functionality. However, there is no way I was going to deal wiith my wife and kids trying to watch TV and
 having to turn on XBOX to do so. The best workaround for me was to put an HDMI in from DirecTV to the XBOX One but also use a component video out of DirecTV box directly to my TV. This allows two ways to watch TV on my setup. Everyone happy. In all hoensty.
 passive HDMI would be terrible as there would surely be deterioration in the picture quality.</p>

<p>Yeah, I've been toying with the idea of multiple outputs from my cable box to achieve the desired result. Don't want to use component cables, though. Too bulky and I don't think I'd be able to achieve 5.1 that way.
</p>
<p>Essentially, what I'd like to accomplish is my cable box being able to function through the One, through my receiver, and simply on its own through the TV's speakers for late at night.</p>
<p>I'm wondering, would an HDMI splitter or switch serve the purpose? The set up would look like this...</p>
<p>Cable box --(HDMI)--&gt; Splitter --(HDMI)--&gt; Xbox One</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --(HDMI)--&gt; TV --(TOSlink)--&gt; Receiver</p>

<p>It's after booting, the logo appears and then instantly goes to the aptio screen. I was using FL studio and then it told me to update windows so I updated it. This screen has appeared for a few days now but the first times I could leave them easily now I
 can't&nbsp; And I have tried all the boot disableing and safety enabling things that was in this one post from the Asus computer.&nbsp; It didn't work and once it did boot up it started like if it was brand new.&nbsp; All my stuff was gone but then a bit after l being like
 that it said there was an error than shut off and took me back to the aptio screen and that's where I'm at right now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've spent two days waiting on Microsoft reps to fix the issue but they all keep doing the same stuff. Updating windows, uninstalling every trace of office, and trying to create admin accounts to fix the issue.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 - Virtual memory keeps resetting on restart</h2>
                    Hi, everytime I restart my computer, the Virtual Memory keeps resetting itself. It keeps switching back to "No paging file" and the "Performance Options" window keeps popping up when I restart my com.<br />
<br />
I've tried to set to "Automatically manage paging file size for all drives" and even "System managed size" but it resets when I close the window. When I try to reopen the window, it give me this pop up:
<br />
<br />
"Windows created a temporary paging file on your computer because of a problem that occured with your paging file configuration when you started your computer. The total paging file size for all disk drives may be somewhat larger than the size you specified"
<br />
<br />
Please help !

    <title>Windows Live Mail mixing up message body and header listing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hubertttt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Mail mixing up message body and header listing</h2>
                    My computer OS is Windows 8 and using Windows Live Mail 2012. &nbsp;When I receive POP3 email, some emails have problems.
<div>The display of message listing showed the correct sender, subject and time information of email (say email A), but the reading pane is showing another email (email B).</div>
<div>When I click to open the email, it show that "email B" still.</div>
<div>This happens not on all the emails I received but around 10% of emails is mixed up like this.</div>
<div>This is very troublesome and do not know any way to resolve it.</div>
<div>Very much appreciated if any people can help.&nbsp;</div>

            <div>Hello!</div>
<div><br />
Thanks for replying.
<div>Tried to remove and re-add email accounts in Windows Live Mail but the situation is same.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sorry that I missed out something in last question and need to explain again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. The emails downloaded and keeping in the original Inbox of each email account is fine without the problem of mixing listing and body. &nbsp;There has been no problem also before removing and re-add email accounts.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. I have email rules to move emails to sub-folders under Storage Folders, and those are the emails having the problem of mixing header list and message body. &nbsp;I also move some emails manually to sub-folders and this problem also happens. &nbsp;In both cases
 not all emails having problems but around 10% of the emails have mis-matching header and body after moving.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope to receive a solution with thanks.</div>
<div><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting back and for uploading the log file. Before we forward your concern to our support specialists, I would like to isolate your concern if it was caused by corrupted Mail related files. Try to repair it first by following these:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <font><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows</span> +
<p>In case the issue still persists, I would like to ask some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you move back the emails to your Inbox, does the issue remains?</li><li>Does the issue happen to messages that was moved to a particular folder under your Storage Folders or all the folders under it?</li></ul>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Richard,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed your steps and successfully repaired Windows Essentials Programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I disabled all the email rules which move emails to sub-folders.</p>
<p>All emails arrive to each account inbox only and around 100 emails I received and no problem.</p>
<p>I moved them to relevant sub-folders manually and also no problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I enable all the email rules to move emails automatically.&nbsp; Since this changes many emails has the problem again.&nbsp; The emails were moved to different folders and the problem happened in emails for different folders.&nbsp; This time more emails have problems
 and almost 50% of emails have problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please kindly help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the delay in response. I would like to ask further questions to isolate the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>On your latest reply, "<em>I moved them to relevant sub-folders manually and also no problem</em>", do you mean the subfolders under your Storage Folders?</li><li>If you set a rule for your messages but not going directly to Storage Folders, does the issue still happen? (After creating the rule, just try to send a test email to yourself to easily check and to avoid other emails to be affected in case the issue will
 still appear.)</li></ul>
<p>Also, I would like to ask for a sample <em>.eml</em> file of an affected email. Kindly upload it in the private message area so we could escalate your concern to our support specialists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>

<p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; "<em>I moved them to relevant sub-folders manually and also no problem</em>", it is the subfolders under the Storage folder.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I modified 2 email rules to move emails to a new folder created under one of the account name (not under Subfolders), and I received 10 emails&nbsp;and so far&nbsp;there is no problem.&nbsp; At the moment I stop using all&nbsp;other rules and enabled only these 2 modified
 rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uploaded in private message area the sample .eml file and the screen shot for your reference, please kindly check.</p>

<h2>            Asus PB278Q Monitor driver, STILL NOT AVAILABLE</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Win10 my&nbsp;Asus PB278Q Monitor does not work. Asus has not released any new drivers for it since Win8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything the internet has to offer to get it to work but it seems that the missing driver is at fault, (I read somewhere that it might be a DisplayPort wake-up handshake protocol bug) . If Asus won't release it, can Microsoft? Is it that hard
 to update/convert a Win8.1 driver to Win10? Can Microsoft call up Asus and make them hurry up the driver?</p>

            <p>This is no help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, the latest driver is for Win8, and I have tried to install it and get it to work in various ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, the Program Compability Troubleshooter is for Executable programs, the driver is a .cat, .inf and .icm files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't just copy/paste what solution you think is going to work, read what I wrote. I find it so frustrating that everytime I try to get support on stuff like this, a non-relavant suggestion is made.</p>

            March 1 2016. Same story still goes. No update driver for the PB278Q for my Surface Book. Though it does work at 1080 resolution that's not the capacity of the monitor and is a hindrance. Poor work by Microsoft at working with the manufacturer. My Mac
 Pro picked this up right away.

            <p>I have the same monitor and I solved the matter as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;I got myself a Displayport v1.2 compatible cable and used it on the monitor since my GTX980 adheres to this spec.</p>
<p>2. Went to ASUS support page for a slightly different display PB278QR&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asus.com/Commercial-Monitors/PB278QR/HelpDesk_Download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;and downloaded the Win8 driver from "others" (ASUS_PB278_Windows_8_WHQL.zip
 is the same for both x86 and x64 OS).</p>
<p>3. Installed it through Device Manager through the "Have Disk..." option. Windows 10 complained about not being able to verify the Issuer of the digital cert but installed it just fine.</p>
<p>4. ICC profiles are also installed and device persists through reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made no changes to Windows in order to accept non-signed non-WHQL drivers.</p>
<p>I have Developer mode enabled through Settings-&gt;Update &amp; Security-&gt;For developers but I'm not sure if it makes any difference. I'm running Win10 x64 Anniversary Update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope I helped a bit.</p>

            <p>I hit the same issue that you did originally.&nbsp; I finally found a way to at least get the monitor to show up in device manager as ASUS PB278 - no idea if this is a good or proper setup but here's what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Follow ChrisPapadas' steps to download the WHQL driver (note you have to choose 8.0 not 8.1 on the ASUS download page).</p>
<p>2. After download make sure to right click and unblock the zip before extracting (not sure if important).</p>
<p>3. Extract the zip and right click the .inf file and choose "Install"</p>
<p>4. You will have to agree to install an unsigned driver</p>
<p>5. In device manager right click the generic display, choose update driver software.</p>
<p>6. Browse my computer</p>
<p>7. Let me pick from a list</p>
<p>8. ***Uncheck the "Show compatible hardware" checkbox***&nbsp; - this is key</p>
<p>9. Look through the list for ASUS PB278, select it and install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it should at least show up in device manager as a recognized device.&nbsp; Again I'm not positive that the drivers are working properly as I just tried this out so YMMV.</p>

<p>Recently, my father bought a new Xbox since the other one broke. Since I didn't have Xbox live, all my achievements, unlockables, etc were gone. I decided to make a new profile but this time I put in an Xbox live trial that my friend gave me. The only game
 i played with the 1 week trial was GTA V. I was kind of surprised to find out that I couldn't play any games my brother had downloaded that were free for gold. Saints Row 3? No. Black Flag? Nope. Dead Rising? Negative. Whenever i would click on a game to play
 it would say "Can't launch &lt;Name of Game&gt;". Its disheartening that i can't play the games i wanted to replay...</p>

<p>Your brother will need to download his profile onto the new console and perform a license transfer onto the new console. When he purchased the content, it was licensed to his account and to the console that he made the purchases from. Transferring the licenses
 to the new console will allow any user on that console access to the content.</p>

<p>A license transfer works for one digital game at a time, not the whole set to prevent piracy. I know it sucks, but the DRM helps Microsoft and other hardworking developers earn the money they deserve to put into other games. BUT, if if your brother downloaded
 his account to your console, and digitally purchased the game there, it'd be like license transferring, but without the 4 month wait inbetween. Hope this helps, hit me up for any other questions.</p>

            <p>Where did you get that information ANTHONATOR35? &nbsp;Because it's not true. &nbsp;License Transfers can work for all games if done properly.</p>
<p>SliverHybrid5, if your brother has already done the license transfer to the console then have him redownload all the content. &nbsp;There is no need for him to delete the games first, just go through his download history and redo it. &nbsp;This will move the licenses over to the new console.</p>

    <title>Problems uninstalling iTunes &#43; Bonjour. After restart, cannot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rucury  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems uninstalling iTunes &#43; Bonjour. After restart, cannot establish internet connection.</h2>
                    
<p>So, I've done as much reading as I can before coming here. I am running Windows 7 Ultimate (64-bit).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded iTunes64.exe, began the installation process and was greeted with an "installation stopped" error. I think QuickTime and some other programs like Apple Mobile Device Support and Apple Software Updates were installed. Thing is, I quickly tried
 to uninstall them so I could try and re-install iTunes. I admit I did so in no intentional order. When I tried to delete Bonjour, a window appeared and told me I needed to find Bonjour64.msi in order to uninstall it. So I did find it, in the ProgramData folder.
 Still, it says it is invalid and all kinds of lies.</p>
<p>So I read up on some ways to manually uninstall Bonjour, from the Windows Cleanup Utility to disabling the mDSNResponder... However, there's this one file, called "mdsnNSP.dll" that seems to be impossible to get rid off! It seems to be open in all sorts
 of programs. From Steam to uTorrent to AVG!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Desperate, I renamed said file "mdnsNSP.old", rebooted and then deleted it. But I did not notice that after the reboot, I had no internet access and there was a notification saying something like "cannot connect to Microsoft servers(...)".</p>
<p>I did not know what to do, so I did a system restore. I didn't have another, so I restored to when I uninstalled QuickTime. Now, I'm stuck with Bonjour, don't know how to uninstall it and am afraid to even touch it! I also probably have all sorts of registry
 errors from restoring, and I'm going to have to re-install a lot of things...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help!</p>

    <title>Pictures shortcut opens Location is not available, Missing photos - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petertx98  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pictures shortcut opens Location is not available, Missing photos</h2>
                    <p>Using Windows 10, I first discovered "Import Pictures and Videos" of connected iPhone 6 Plus&nbsp;would return the following error</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unable to connect to the device due to the following error:&nbsp; Unspecified error</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works about 2 weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found my Pictures short cut under "This PC" now returns</p>
<p>Location is not available</p>
<p>D:\Pictures is unavailable. If the location is on this PC, make sure the device or drive is connected or the disc is inserted, and then try again. If the location is on a network, make sure you're connected to the network or INternet, and then try again.
 If the location still can't be found, it might have been moved or deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how or when Pictures get mapped to d:\ drive which does not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access C:\Users\Peter\Pictures folder.&nbsp; However the only folder left is iCloud Photos.&nbsp; All my photos in various folders are gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are not in the Recycle Bin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I right mouse click to bring up Pictures properties - and look in Location tab, the target location reads D:\Pictures.&nbsp; Again this drive does not exist.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempt to change this path to C:\Users\Peter\Pictures and hit Apply, I would receive this error</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error Applying Attributes</p>
<p>An error occurred applying attributes to the files:</p>
<p>
</p><p>D:\Pictures</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system cannot find the path specified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ignore, Ignore All, Try again, Cancel</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot reset Pictures folder/shortcut properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has suggestion on how I can troubleshoot this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Software updated recently was "Microsoft Office Home and Business 2013-en-us" and Apple iTunes</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other shortcut "Documents", "Music", "Videos" worked as expected.&nbsp; Just "Pictures" folder is broken.&nbsp; As expected in Quick Access, pictures shortcut will not open either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

                    <p>I am new to Skype and cannot get video calling to work. &nbsp;I am simply unable to do it. &nbsp;When I've clicked on the "mini video camera icon" at the top of the page, it says it is unable to communicate via Skype (though not this exact wording). &nbsp;When I try to
 call by going to the "calling" drop down list, the word "video" is not darkened, and I am unable to do anything. &nbsp;</p>

            You need the recovery DVD or hidden partition on hard drive to reset it. Before you try to reset, make a full backup of the system. After that, use the recovery DVD or hidden partition to reset it. Most manufacture have guide on how to reset it or check
 online for your specific computer model.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No action is not even required.</p>

<p>Restart the machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Point to the installation files.</p>
<p>Right click Setup and click 'Run as administrator'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem persist, try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need to reinstall the software, but this time, do it using Troubleshoot compatibility</p>
<p>Browse to the installation files </p>

<p>Right click the setup file and click 'Troubleshoot compatibility'</p>
<p>Wait while it detects the problem.</p>
<p>Click the option 'Worked in a previous version of Windows'</p>
<p>Select Windows 7 RTM or a known version of Windows it is known to work in.</p>
<p>Click Next</p>
<p>Click Start the program, wait while it installs</p>
<p>When installation is complete, click Finish and save the settings.</p>
<p>Try connecting the to the Internet again. </p>

 and "Anthony's Computer" are listed under the network connections. Does this mean they are also using my internet, if so how to I stop these users and others in the future from doing this? There's an option box under each user which asks "Connect Automatically?",
 which is always clicked on, when I try to click no it has no effect. My internet lately seems to be working a bit sluggish and thinking maybe the reason for that is these other users. Guess the questions are how to stop people from using my internet connection
 and actually are they, if they weren't why would there names be on the network list? And how to stop anyone else in the future from also using my internet, I really need help on this quickly if possible. I shut off my router last night hoping that will also
 prevent them from using the internet but 2 of the names that were on yesterday are still there. The computer I use is a HP 2000 Notebook PC and the system is Windows 8.1, thanks for any help in this matter.
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">EDIT:</span></strong> For the time being I am using a cable from the router to the computer and turned the Wi-Fi off, I'm able to use the internet fine but will doing that stop others from using my connections,
 it looks like it does but am not positive about that. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span>There is no way to guarantee complete security on a wireless network. However, there are precautions you can take to help minimize security risks when you use a wireless network.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">If you have a laptop or a PC with a wireless network adapter, you can see a list of available wireless networks and then connect to one of those networks. So, it may be the other Wifi network connections available in your area.
 A wireless network security key is the password required to be able to connect your PC to a secured access point (ex: router) on a wireless network.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Whenever possible, you should connect to security-enabled wireless networks. If you do connect to a network that's not secure, be aware that someone with the right tools can see everything that you do, including the websites you visit, the documents
 you work on, and the user names and passwords that you use.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the section <em>‘Wireless network security recommendations’ </em>
from the Microsoft KB article to know more about the general security guidelines:
</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(66, 66, 66, 1)">Note: Holds good for Windows 8.1 also.</span></p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out. You are able to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/security/manage-xbox-one-passkey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
setup a passkey</a> or password to restrict certain actions within an account. Simply head on over to Settings&gt;Account&gt;Sign in, security, and passkey&gt;change my sign-in &amp; security preferences. From here you can choose to lock down purchase and sign ins through
 either a passkey (button sequence) or your account's password. Hope this helps! :D</p>
