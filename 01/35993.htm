<h2>            Windows 10 Update Errors &#40;0x800F0922 and 0x800703ED&#41;</h2>
                    <p>In mid-September I formatted my hard drive and installed Windows 8.1 (the version my computer came with) from Microsoft's ISO (not the bloated **** that came with my computer) and then did the updates and then upgraded to Windows 10 right away. Not long
 after I began having issues with Windows updates. My computer would say installing updates when booting, then after like 30 seconds say it failed and then said undoing changes. Then it reboots. Then during the boot it continues on with undoing changes and
 then sometimes reboots again but usually it goes straight to Windows. Because of this, booting into Windows can take several minutes which is annoying as hell. I didn't investigate the problem until today but here's the most recent event log errors I'm getting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation Failure: Windows failed to install the following update with error 0x800F0922: Cumulative Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3105213).<br />
</p>
<p>Installation Failure: Windows failed to install the following update with error 0x800703ED: Upgrade to Windows 10 Home, version 1511, 10586.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the&nbsp;System File Checker tool and it didn't find any problems ("Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.")<br />
</p>
<p>Everything I've found so far is either old (earlier this year or last year) or sites that want me to download their free tool to fix it for me, which is not gonna happen. I'm leaning towards formatting and just sticking with Windows 8.1 (or maybe getting
 a copy of Windows 7). Anyone have any ideas?</p>

            I tried those things that day they were posted and the Windows update reset reported a problem that it couldn't fix. I searched for that problem and found instructions in a different thread but those fixes didn't work. I decided to just format and re-install
 Windows 8.1 and it's been working great and so much faster. Something must have really been screwed up with my Windows 10 installation. I'm just gonna stick with Windows 8.1 for now since I don't want to have to format again if I have the same problem.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you get this error when detaching the Surface Book from the keyboard, you are usually instructed to troubleshoot the problem by clicking on the link provided in the error message. If you are unable to see this
 option or if it did not resolve the problem, try to close all programs first since there may be a program that uses the base's graphics. Open&nbsp;</span><span>Task Manager</span><span>&nbsp;by pressing&nbsp;</span><span>Ctrl</span><span>&nbsp;+&nbsp;</span><span>Shift&nbsp;</span><span>+&nbsp;</span><span>Esc</span><span>&nbsp;and
 close the running programs in the&nbsp;</span><span>Processes&nbsp;</span><span>tab. Please also take note that both the Battery 1 (tablet) and Battery 2 (keyboard) need to be charged above 10% before you can detach the device.
 If either one of the batteries is lower than 10%, please connect the Surface Book to the PSU.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still unable to detach the Surface, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download and run the Surface Diagnostic
 Toolkit</a></strong> (SDT). Apart from checking the system for software issues, it will make sure that you have the recommended driver and firmware updates. Perform a forced shutdown after running the SDT. Just press the power button for 10 seconds or until
 the screen goes off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to get the error message, check if there are any issues with device that are paired with the Surface Book. Open
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Devices</strong> &gt; <strong>Bluetooth and other devices</strong>. Check for driver errors with the Bluetooth devices. If you see any, select the device and click on
<strong>Remove device</strong>. Re-pair the device and once the driver issue has been resolved, try to detach the keyboard again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have successfully detached the Surface, clean the connectors using a soft, cotton cloth wet with rubbing alcohol and let the pins and connectors dry before re-attaching the tablet to the base.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if the suggestions are successful in resolving the problem. In case you need further help, please reply to this post. I will be notified and I'll get back to you the soonest I can so we can make sure this gets resolved.</p>
<p>

            <p>first off, I doubt that microsoft will even have the courtesy to give you any answer on your question.
</p>
<p>they are pretty much the same as the federal Government these days. Either they just ignore our questions and inquireys,or they lie and tell us what we want tot hear, give us false fixes and repairs that do not work and then lie and say&nbsp; they do. I do not
 believe you will be able to find any windows live essentials version 2009(last version for xp),and if you do they have rigged it so it will not install on your xp computer now matter what you try . you will only get an error message that this is not a valid
 win32 application. i have tried every way possible to re-install windows live mail on this xp pro machine and they have all failed. But. it would seem that XP has a mail program in its files that will still allow you to send mail out once you set it up for
 your internet connection/provider. receiving mail you will have to use an existing email address. good luck in your endeavor.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Glasshalffull,</strong><br />
<br />
1) Which edition of Windows are you using?</p>
<p>2) Do you get any error message when it asks for user name and password?</p>
<p>3) Does it asks for username and password for activation only for media player or with other player also?<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards:<br />

</p><p>Probably yes, this (\Device\HarddiskVolume4\) means that your windows had run a remote generic service (svchost.exe) which could be malicious. it happened to me as well. also the attacker was able to disable my firewall &amp; windows defender. I was running

    <title>Stuttering and lag when playing videos or games, Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Stuttering and lag when playing videos or games, Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Videos and games stutter and lag terribly, even if I close all other applications and browsers. Streaming video and games are the worst, but even videos played directly from my SSD will stutter, typically it's the sound that freaks out and "buzzes" (for
 lack of a better descriptor). I never had any&nbsp;problems like this with Windows 8.1, so this is an issue introduced by my "upgrade".</p>

<p>
</p><p>Nothing is overclocked, everything is at default settings. I've been trying to fix this issue for two days and at this point I'm throwing my hands up. Has anyone had this issue, and better yet,

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome and thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to&nbsp;any third party software installed on your computer. I would suggest you to try clean boot and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called
<strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow:
<span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer
 to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set
 of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean
 boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you
 may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps. Please post us if you need any further assistance with Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. I tried a clean boot and the problem persisted, so I got fed up and just wiped my system drive and did a clean install of Windows 10 Pro (64). The problem still exists. I've seen many people on several forums with this issue,
 but no answers yet. I've tried updating my Realtek drivers, my Radeon Pro drivers... and even now as I type this with music streaming the system is hanging every 20 seconds or so and causing the sound to "buzz", which I guess is just a loop of whatever sound
 was playing when the freeze occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a pretty serious problem, as it makes my PC nearly unusable</p>

            <p>Hi there.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You and I are probably in the same condition, I'm from China, using Windows 10 Pro/Chinese system language, on a MSI GT70-2OD 885CN Gaming Laptop, with a Nvidia GTX780M video card，and an Intel 4600 integrated graphics card.<br />
<br />
My system froze every 3~15 minutes, with one second of 'Scratched CD' liked things, repeating one tone of sound &nbsp;(Yeah,that sounds like buzzes!) and one frame of video, and the pointer stopped moving, then it goes away.<br />
<br />
Then I accidentally found that every time I change the wallpaper,or click on the 'Power' icon on the right of the taskbar,my system would froze for a second,the pointer would stopped moving,and
<strong>the MOST IMPORTANT THING</strong>,the color of the power indicator LED on my laptop blinks like
<strong>WHITE-ORANGE-WHITE</strong>,this means that<strong> the graphic card are switching between [INTEGRATED INTEL--NVIDIA--INTEGRATED INTEL]</strong>,<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">no wonder why the system are out of response!!</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I removed Intel graphics card driver,then the lag never happened again,but I lost my control over screen brightness and refresh rate,there are clearly something seriously wrong with the card switching plan in the Intel driver,or compatibility issues between
 Intel and Nvidia, or AMD ,this is driving me crazy......<br />
<br />
Anyway, we probably have no solutions until Nvidia or AMD or Intel release newer drivers, we can only hope that they fix this issue as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Sorry for my poor English.(^O^)<br />
<br />
Hope that I can help.</p>

            I have figured out that the problem is extreme latency caused by hdaudbus.sys. The problem is, I have no idea how to either fix it or get rid of it. I disabled my onboard sound in BIOS and am now running my speakers through my monitors. That didn't fix
 it. I uninstalled "High Definition Audio Bus" from device manager -&gt; system devices then installed the latest Realtek update. That didn't work. I started a fire in my office and danced around it in a loin cloth to please the angry gods. That didn't work either.
 I am extremely frustrated with my Windows 10 experience so far.

I am having the same issues Green screens-- lagging --stuttering and its super annoying i tried removing stuff and re downloading and nothing is still working very well. I am not very happy about this and i hope that someone at Microsoft gets these bugs fixed
 because reverting back to Windows 8.1 will be a pain. This happens on all my browsers i use but super bad on Explorer and Edge.

 but no answers yet. I've tried updating my Realtek drivers, my Radeon Pro drivers... and even now as I type this with music streaming the system is hanging every 20 seconds or so and causing the sound to "buzz", which I guess is just a loop of whatever sound
 was playing when the freeze occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a pretty serious problem, as it makes my PC nearly unusable</p>

I agree its hard for me to do work on my PC and my mouse acts the same way the videos it lags and wont move when it should and I KEEP GETTING TROJANS warnings on my PC since i did the update a i never had this issue before!!! I want this fixed ASAP!!!

            <p>Having the same issue, seems to happen after awhile when Im playing net intensive games. Every few seconds the system will freeze for perhaps half a second. This will continue until I close the program and reboot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should have listened to that little voice in my head and not installed WinX until 4 years after its release. Its about the only time MS products start to become stable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 7.1 was working fine, if MS has no relief in sight for this Ill have to spend a weekend reinstalling my OEM.

<h2>            Ori and the Blind Forest friert beim Start ein</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo zusammen,</p>
<p><br />
besitze seit kurzem die Elite Version der Xbox One.</p>
<p><br />
Habe "Ori and the Blind Forest" installiert und kann es auch ganz normal starten und alles funktioniert...ABER sobald ich das Spiel beende und die Box herunterfahre oder neustarte und anschließend wieder das Spiel starten möchte FRIERT es gleich zu Anfang ein
 sobald das "Moon" Logo erscheint :(</p>
<p><br />
Habe schon alles ausprobiert (Hardboot, Cache leeren, Xbox auf Werkseinstellungen gesetzt) und das einzige was es mir derzeit erlaubt zu Spielen ist jedes mal eine Neuinstallation des Spiels -.-</p>

<p>Hat noch jmd dieses Problem mit der Elite Version der Box bzw. seit dem großen Update für die One? Ansonsten rennt die Box tadellos...nur Ori macht Probleme.</p>
<p><br />
Bin für alle Tipps / Hilfe dankbar ;)</p>

<p>Besten Dank und liebe Grüße</p>

<p>moin moin,</p>
<p>hey Leute danke euch für die Comments ;)</p>
<p>Das mit Konsole auf offline stellen bzw. vom iNet trennen hilft bei mir leider auch nicht :(</p>
<p>In den letzten 2 Tagen ging es immer sporadisch, mal konnte ich spielen und das nächste mal hat es sich wieder eingefroren.</p>
<p>Kumpel von mir hat das gleiche Problem auch am PC...sind also nicht nur die Boxler betroffen.</p>
<p>@FlussFan, bin ja "beruhigt" dass es bei deiner Elite das gleiche Problem ist, hatte schonn Angst es liegt mal wieder nur an meiner Konsole ^^</p>
<p>Was ich noch testen möchte sobald ich die Möglichkeit habe ist eine externe Festplatte an die Box zu hängen und es von dieser zu starten...sollte jmd die Möglichkeit haben würde ich mich über eine Info freuen ob das was bringt.</p>
<p>Es sollte doch auch noch eine Definitive Edition ende des Jahres erscheinen...bin mal gespannt ob das noch was wird und hoffe dass dann dieser Bug beseitigt wird.</p>
<p>Das Game ist zweifellos eines der BESTEN was ich bisher gespielt habe, bin jetzt bei ca. 70% und freue mich schon auf das Finale ::)) Jede Neuinstallation lohnt sich &nbsp;XD</p>
<p>Best Greeetings</p>

<h2>            My Xbox 360 Slim HDMI port won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t work&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Ever since I got my Xbox, I've used it with an AV. Today I bought an HDMI cable for it and put it in thinking it would work fine. So when I switched to the TV input, (yes I made sure it was the right one) I turned on the box and I just got a black screen
 saying no signal. And I've tried the HDMI cable with my PS3 and it works perfectly. What do I need to do? I just wanna play my Xbox. And I can't even find display discovery in my settings. I need help.

<p>This is quite strange as it should pick up the HDMI right away no matter what resolution you choose. I was going to say that these cables can be quite touchy but as you have tried it with your friends it cannot be the cable and maybe an issue with your Xbox
 HDMI port.</p>
<p>You say you have a blank screen, can you hear any sound?</p>
<p>Even when I'm not displaying in HD I can still see the display discovery option</p>
<p>Settings&gt;System&gt;Console Settings&gt;Display&gt;Then second from bottom is display discovery.</p>
<p>There could also be a little dust got into the back of the Xbox try removing all the cables and giving it a clean and then put cables back in but leave the HDMI one till last.</p>

<p>Hello AmateurElf705,</p>
<p>Try resetting your display settings. Follow these instructions:</p>
<p>Reset the console display settings</p>
<p>If the display problem is still not resolved, reset the display settings of your console. Here's how:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Remove any discs from the disc tray.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn off the console.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn on the console.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Note If you are using an Xbox 360 Wireless Controller, turn on the console by using the Guide button on the controller. Make sure that you use the player 1 controller when you do this. The player 1 controller will have the upper-left light illuminated.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;As the console starts, on the controller, press and hold Y while pulling the right trigger. The display settings are reset to the default settings, and then the console automatically restarts.</p>
<p>If the problem is still not resolved, your console might need to be repaired. <a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/en-US/pages/Profileregistration.aspx?useraction=Requestarepair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Start the repair process online.</a></p>
<p>These instructions can be found here: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/image-on-your-tv-is-unclear#0e0c6c27148b4a2fa2934397921ff472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            BSOD Kernel Security Check Failure on Windows 8.1, Restart after 10 min</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
I have laptop HP 4340s ProBook bought before year and a half. I installed fresh Windows 8.1 before 4 months. Everything works prefect, &nbsp;windows boot in 9 sec. :)<br />
Only what I have upgraded is RAM from 4GB to 8GB same frequency, different&nbsp;manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But recently i got a big problem.</p>
<p>Every time when i am out of laptop after 10 minutes, when I don't touch mouse, or have nothing on screen loading or moving I got BSOD Kernel Security Failure and my computer restarts. Even if i have some IDE turned on and chrome, still after 10 minutes after
 i don't touch anything error comes.<br />
<br />
I have tried everthing:<br />
sfc /cannow<br />
chddsk /r</p>
<p>memory check from bios</p>
<p>memtest</p>
<p>scanned viruses with AVG FREE 2015&nbsp;</p>
<p>set&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">Small memory dump (256 KB)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">turned off fast start at power settings</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">did system restore</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">Basically, that's it. I don't know what to do anymore. Can someone help me. Thanks.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hello Thanks for replay again.<br />
<br />
I did memtest as i said before.<br />
I will do Driver verifier now, and i will edit post so you could see results or soever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Extra information what i have found is that it happens when <strong>laptop is charging.</strong></p>
<p>So point is when i am charging my laptop and i don't touch anything for 10 minutes it goes with error and restart. But when my laptop is on battery(i am not charging laptop) after 10 minutes it works, then comes screen saver or what i have set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> I **** up my computer after driver verifier -.- </p>
<p>Windows can't load and repair doesn't work. GJ man</p>

            <p>Hi man,<br />
<br />
I already re-installed my windows. I don't have any problems.<br />
<br />
Just for all of you to know this is big problem (error) &nbsp;i have got. Why?<br />
<br />
Because I installed windows without any error, all drivers and i have lets say mid-level (even maybe little below you) knowledge of how to install properly windows and how to set and maintenance windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Stefan<br />

            <p>Hi Stefan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated that the issue has been resolved.&nbsp;I really appreciate the effort made by you in order to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due to missing/corrupted system files. Blue Screen errors (also sometimes called black screen errors or STOP code errors) can occur if a serious problem causes Windows to shut down or restart unexpectedly. You might see a message that says,
 "Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer." These errors can be caused by both hardware and software problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since you have re-installed Windows and everything is working fine, you can always revert if you have further queries related to Windows. We'll be happy to assist you.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Sounds like feedback so either you have another mic (such as a built-in) or the computer
<br />
did not sense the mic was disconnected.<br />
<br />
Try a Power Off - wait 3 minutes then Power On.<br />
<br />
================================<br />
<br />
You may need to update the sound drivers.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to
<br />
see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take
<br />
several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
<strong>Also Right Click Speaker near clock - Playback Devices - right click in the box area - check<br />
Show disable and disconnected devices. Highlight speaker and on the&nbsp;lower Right click
<br />
Properties check settings for Device Usage enabled and so on. Also do same for Configure
<br />
on Lower Left of that box.<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Right click Speaker near Clock -&nbsp;Recording Devices - right click in box - check Show&nbsp;<br />
Disconnected Devices and Show Disabled Devices - check your mic - highlight them <br />
and then on lower right properties. Make sure the proper one is enabled and check
<br />
other settings - on Levels tab make sure MUTE is unchecked and APPLY / OK changes</strong>.<br />
<br />
Also in Control Panel look for some Audio Manager (maybe named after sound driver maker). Mine<br />
is RealTek Audio Manager, yours can be entirely different name if you have one.<br />

<h2>            Store won&#39;t load</h2>
                    <p>my issue is simple: xbox live store doesn't load on none of&nbsp;my xbox one consoles. Everything else works fine. Clicking on any icon or link to the store does simply nothing.</p><p><br /></p><p>I already performed a hard reset (hold power button until light goes off, disconnect console from power for 2-3 minutes and restart) to no result.</p>

            <p>There have been a couple of updates for the store in the last couple of days. Go to "My Games &amp; Apps" and check to see if there is an update for the store in there. For some reason I had to manually start it on one of my consoles, though the other downloaded the update automatically.</p>

<h2>            Controller stops working</h2>
                    Today I encountered an issue where my controller stops working once I enter a match of any kind, Including training. It works fine with other games and in the menus, but once an actual match starts no inputs register. I tried several different controllers
 and it happens with all of them.

            Have you tried switching out your batteries? Also I think SIL3NT SNIP3R09 meant clear cache and restart console, not catch. Try switching characters as well.

<p>Where do you clear the cache first of all and why would that have any thing to do with the controller not working when a game launches... Controller input is not stored in the system cache.</p>
<p>I have been experiencing this problems for a few days now. Last night when I was playing CoD AW with friends my controller stopped working in the game only. Menus and Xbox home it worked fine. As soon as I would join a game it would stop. It happens on multiple
 controllers and is very frustrating. </p>
<p>Someone from Xbox needs to respond to this as it is an obvious bug or problem with the system.</p>

    <title>My Gamertag &#38;quot&#59;Valiant Outcast&#38;quot&#59;, which I have - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> valiant outcast  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Gamertag &#38;quot&#59;Valiant Outcast&#38;quot&#59;, which I have had for almost two years, is now apparently not allowed by the X-Box Live Custom Content Filter.</h2>
                    
<p>My Gamertag "Valiant Outcast", which I have had for almost two years, is now apparently not allowed by the X-Box Live Custom Content Filter. &nbsp;What happened? I can't upload my content to Halo: Reach File Share (but I can upload anything that was not created
 or modified by my gamertag&nbsp;and thus does not have my name attached). Can anyone tell me what is going on?</p>
<p>Supposedly there was an error made during an update to the filter that has been unjustly blocking random gamertags like mine (Valiant Outcast), Midnight Hawk 2, and Irish Anger. Is Microsoft working on a solution to the problem? It is ruining games with
 content sharing capabilities for a large number of players.</p>
<p>To be thorough, Yes. I did check to make sure that it is not a problem with the Halo Reach Fileshare system, nor has my account been banned from uploading.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can provide,</p>
<p>Valiant Outcast</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
I too am having an issue with this update (KB3033929) Everytime I shutdown, I receive a message telling me not to unplug my computer as it is loading this update. After about 5 minutes the machine shuts down, when I look at my updates next day this one has
 'Failed'. This has been happening every day for the past 30 days. I've tried to manually update this important Security Update for Windows 7, but it always fails, giving me an error code 8007371B. I'm not an expert in settings and stuff, is there a simple
 solution to this?</p>

            <p>Do you have a dual boot system?</p>
<p>
Known issues with this security update
<strong>Issue 1</strong><br />
<br />
Some users cannot install this&nbsp;security update if their computers meet the following conditions:
</p><ul>
<li>Have a multiple-boot configuration of Windows and various distributions of Linux</li><li>Use a non-Windows boot loader</li><li>Have&nbsp;Windows and Linux installed on separate drives</li></ul>
We have been able to verify that systems that have the Windows boot loader enabled as the primary loader are successfully able to install this update and that systems that have a non-Windows boot loader specified as the primary boot loader cannot&nbsp;install the
 update, even if the user uses that loader to select Windows.<br />
<br />
<strong>Issue 1 workaround</strong><br />
<br />
To work around that issue, you can either use Windows as the default boot loader or you can change your BIOS settings to enable the Windows boot loader directly when you install this update.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I downloaded the System Update Readiness Tool -64 bit version as you advised, nothing seemed to appear on my system so I clicked on the 'download' button again and still nothing happened.</span></p>
<p><span>I followed your instructions regarding&nbsp;</span><span>changing my settings in Windows to be able to see the file.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I checked the&nbsp;</span><span>"Show hidden files and folders" box then
<strong>unchecked</strong> the&nbsp;</span><strong>"Hide protected operating system files",
</strong>which&nbsp;incidentally&nbsp;<em>recommends </em>that it should be<strong> checked???</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, when I unchecked as your advice I received this message - </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>WARNING:</em></strong><em> You have chosen to display protected operating system files (files labeled System and Hidden) in Windows Explorer.</em></p>

</p><p><em>These files are required to start and run Windows.<strong> Deleting or editing them can make your computer inoperable.&nbsp;</strong></em><em>Are you sure you want to display these files?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I clicked on the 'NO' button, as 'YES' looked like causing big problems for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something wrong here in how I'm following your advice?</p>

 these hidden folder sections.&nbsp; Copying and providing log files will not damage your system at all.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have AVG Free version, and I don't know what a dual boot system is, can you direct me on how to find out if I have or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's stay over on this thread so I can keep you separate from the other guy.</p>
<p>Dual boot means that you use your system to boot both into windows and then into another software - like Linux or Ubuntu.&nbsp; I'm guessing you don't have that setup?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Malicious download warning:</strong>&nbsp;You tried to download malware.</li><li>
<strong>Uncommon download warning:</strong>&nbsp;You tried to download an unfamiliar and potentially dangerous piece of
 software. You should only download programs from sites that you trust.</li><li>
<strong>Unwanted software download warning:</strong>&nbsp;You tried to download a deceptive piece of software. This program,

            <p>Hi JERRYMartinRS,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message or error code?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> You may run the troubleshooter from the following article and see if that does the trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> Check if the external hard drive gets recognized in Disk Management and assign a drive letter to the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To open disk management, do this:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, type
<b>Disk Management</b> in the Start search box and hit <b>Enter</b>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the drive gets detected in disk management, I would suggest you to assign a drive letter and see if that does the trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instructions, see this article
<b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-add-or-remove-a-drive-letter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change, add, or remove a drive letter</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also refer the following article for more information:

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Information provided in the article mentioned above is applicable to Window 7 too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, I would recommend you to update the chipset drivers on your computer by installing the latest Windows 7 compatible
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">drivers</a> downloaded directly from the manufacturer’s website.</p>

            <p>Same here.&nbsp; Spent an hour online with XBOX&nbsp;support but no success.&nbsp; They suggested I&nbsp;had a "blocker" of some kind on my iPhone.&nbsp; There are no settings either on the phone or in my privacy setting for Xbox that seem to prevent messaging.&nbsp; Besides, it works fine on the console or&nbsp;in Windows 10 on my browser.&nbsp; If it was an XBOX account privacy setting I&nbsp;am assuming it would prevent messaging on all platforms.</p><p><br /></p>

    <title>Can&#39;t turn off offline files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doomgaze3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t turn off offline files</h2>
                    I accidentally made a HUGE folder on my network shares "Always Available Offline" and I want to disable it. However, clicking the untick option on the right click menu does not work! Nor does going into the folder properties and unticking the same box.
 I have other files that I DO want to keep available offline. Is there any way to force Windows to stop making this folder available offline?
