    <title>No audio device found on Skype for Business - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No audio device found on Skype for Business</h2>
                    There was no audio when I was on a conference call even though I have a working speaker connected to my computer. On the bottom left corner of my Skype window there is a warning sign: No audio device connected. When I chose to edit audio device settings,
 another warning message: We didn't find an audio device, which you need for calling. I googled this problem and found another thread of the same problem reported by another user in May 2017. I read the support team's trouble-shooting responses and followed
 the steps in their instructions. My audio device was working properly in the sound test and I confirmed that all the boxes that need to be checked were indeed checked. What else can I do? The problem is still there and I need the audio to work in my Skype
 for Business. Thanks.

<p>Hello GGwitch, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to <strong>Tools-&gt;Audio Device settings</strong>. Can you see this audio device and it shows nothing. Please capture a screenshot for further check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, I see that Skype for Business cannot connect to this audio device. Under this circumstance, please try the following suggestions to see if it works:
</p>
<p>1. Check updates for the drivers. Make sure that it is the latest.
</p>
<p>2. Sign out Skype for Business and click <strong>Delete Sign-in info</strong> and restart Skype for Business.
</p>
<p>3. Change another audio device and see if it works in Skype for Business.
</p>
<p>4. G to control Panel&gt; on upper right corner of the screen choose
<strong>Large icons</strong>&gt; <strong>Sound</strong>&gt; under <strong>Playback</strong> tab right click the white box&gt; tick both options&gt; then choose
<strong>Speakers/Headphones</strong> provided by <strong>Realtek Audio</strong>&gt; click
<strong>Set Default</strong>&gt; <strong>Apply</strong>&gt; <strong>OK</strong>&gt; Restart Skype for Business and check whether the default option is "Mic and Speaker".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please let me know the following information for further check:
</p>
<p>1. Please check if the device works in other applications.
</p>
<p>2. Let me know the version number of Skype for Business(Help-&gt;About Skype for Business).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<h2>            Is an Xbox Forums rule in violation of U.S law&#63;</h2>
                    <span lang="EN"><p>In the United States we have the Bill of Rights and in that we have the Freedom of Speech Act.</p><p>In Freedom of Speech Act says "Citizens of the United States have the right of peaceful petition" now if you look at the forums rule (21)<b> “</b>Please do not start any "Sign petition" threads, or "Poll” is that not a violation of my Right given to me by the forefathers of my Nation the same Rights countless men and women of my county have fought bled and died to protect?</p><p>
</p><p>As an American company is Microsoft not bound by the laws of the United States and by outlawing my Right of Starting or Signing a Petition do they not violate their own rules? “Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise <b>violate the legal rights</b> (such as rights of privacy and publicity) <b>of others</b>” and “Publish, post, upload, distribute or disseminate any topic, name, material or information that incites <b>discrimination</b>, hate or violence <b>towards</b> one person or a group because of their belonging to a race, a religion or <b>a nation</b>, or that insults the victims of crimes against humanity by contesting the existence of those crimes.” “<b>Violate any applicable laws or regulations</b>.”</p><p>
By violating my legal rights by discriminating against my Nations right of peaceful petition does Microsoft break three of their rules?</p><p>
I get why Microsoft put that in their rules no company big or small wants people to get together and demand they change things but that is what my forefathers envisioned, a county where people were in charge and could exchange ideals and make changes by saying in one unified voice that they demand change.</p><p>If we are to allow Microsoft to remove one of&nbsp;our freedoms is that not a bad thing and should people not stand up for their Rights whenever they come under attack?</p></span>

            <p>Microsoft is bound by the laws of the United States and in my opinion law will always trumps any rule made up by any private business. So Microsoft should maybe reconsider that particular rule to allow&nbsp;people more freedom&nbsp;to expression&nbsp;their ideas.</p>

            <p>This forum is mainly about talking about Xbox, the games, support,&nbsp;and related Xbox&nbsp;gaming discussion. Individual websites, let alone corporate entities as large as Microsoft, have the exclusive right to monitor, censor, and moderate what gets published internally. You have the right as a citizen to consider yourself as&nbsp;part of the community, so as long as you abide by the stated rules of the forum (as well as the MSA).</p><p><br /></p><p>With the logic you present, you'd may as well go to a Star Trek fan forum, talk exclusively about Star Wars, and start threatening to sue for violations of free speech once they ban you for being an off-topic&nbsp;nuisance -- it just doesn't work that way.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>The answer is here</strong>: the&nbsp;first amendment to "free speech"&nbsp;was put in place to protect you&nbsp;against censorship by the government.

            <p>To add to what Internet Expert said the same applies to the use of Xbox Live, where by agreeing to the EULA when you sign up for the paid service, you are expressly told that by using the system and service you&nbsp;should have no expectation of privacy in anything you do while on that service, be it gameplay, voice communication, messaging and no right to modify the console or any games contained within. In addition Microsoft determines what violates those terms not the user. </p><p><br /></p><p>You haven't found any kind of loophole. </p>

I put this on this form simply because there was no other forum to discuss the rules. And as I said before a private business can make any rule they want I have no problem with that the only problem I have is when it comes in conflict with the Constitution that all&nbsp;are brave men and women fight and die to protect.

<p>The catalogue in not a download but a site to get downloads of updates, drivers&nbsp;etc., to be used offline or if Windows update didn't provide them for some reason.</p>

<p>Paint in XP was able to open JPG files so why not Windows 7? &nbsp;I have Office 2010 (Home &amp; Student) and I've tried to load the JPG filter from there</p>
<p>but it doesn't seem to work. &nbsp;I've selected RUN FROM MY COMPUTER and Office runs through the configuration process, but it doesn't make the necessary change to Paint.</p>
<p>Can you help Please?</p>

                    I'm having trouble in fsx using pmdg 747-400X. In the game I get a black cursor and I can't open the battery cover in the overhead panel to start the engine. I can open other covers and others not, like the emergency light switch. I did uninstall and reinstall
 both fsx and pmdg and came to find out that can cause problems. I'm operating in windows 7 using an HP Pavillion p6670t.&nbsp; Intel core i3 @560 3.33GHZ. 6.0 Gigs of ram and 64bit. I've done my due diligence on the web and found few people with the same problem
 and their solutions didn't help me. I downloaded the latest graphics card driver for my nvidia geforce gt 440.

Thanks in advance for any answers,<br />

<h2>            Obbtaining a Confirmation ID for the Milennium version of Windows XP</h2>
                    <p>We have a very old version of Windows XP, Milennium version, which is the only version that will work with our gate software for our condo association.&nbsp; For some reason the last time some one tried to do an update the message "This copy of Windows must be
 activated"</p>
<p>It gave me an installation ID of 323003 064666 266550 009371 758763 326940 986200 436382 936022 and will not let me go any further unless I enter a Confirmation Id.&nbsp; Although a Microsoft Tech worked with me for a long while, even though support has ceased
 for this version, he was not able to give me any Confirmation ID.&nbsp; Any Suggestions?</p>

            <p>(Actually, Windows ME was released to manufacturing in June 2000, while XP was released to manufacturing in August 2001 - 14 months later, and long after the millennium had passed)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ME was the last of the Windows_9x Operating systems, and had major changes from Windows 98 - it was no longer just an overlay over the DOS core as were the earlier Win9x OS's. It also was the first OS to have System Restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;ME was released to satisfy marketing requirements before all the bugs had been cured, and with XP already in Beta testing, no-one really wanted to support it. Certainly the AV companies did their level best to break ME's&nbsp;System Restore at
 every turn!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We may get some idea of the problem from an MGADiag report...</p>

</p><p>To properly analyse and solve problems with Activation and Validation, we need to see a full copy of the report produced by the MGADiag tool

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You mean the Sticker on the case from the preinstalled Vista Operating System from&nbsp;Dell, HP, Acer, Toshiba, etc)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>If you do, you can contact your&nbsp;Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you purchased your Computer there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall Vista back to how you bought your Computer.</p>
<p>The Recovery process can be started by pressing a particular Key or Keys&nbsp;combination at Boot. (Power On / Startup)</p>
<p>It may be F10, F11, Alt + F10, etc depending on the Manufacturer.</p>
<p>Ask them for the correct Key sequence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><em>The above reinstallation methods do not&nbsp;normally require you to supply a Product Key during the Installation Process as the Recovery Process uses the Factory Installation Product Key to automatically Activate during the reinstallation process.</em></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Cheers.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows &#43; Q shortcut stopped working.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo Z710 laptop with Windows 10. Everything was ok for several weeks until a week ago that the search shortcut (Win+Q)</p>
<p>stopped working.<br />
<br />
I ran sfc /scannow and searched the internet for a fix (registry edit or something) but i couldn't find any solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both keys are working properly and as far as i can tell other shortcuts (Win+P, Win+Tab...) are working too.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure why "Windows + Q" is not working properly. Maybe you can just press "Windows + S" to search first and wait for solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can use three finger tap on your track pad to search as well. Your mouse settings should be set as this by default.</p>

<p>What exactly are you referring to when you say, "So my Cortana is dead?"? Is the issue related to speech or hearing in Cortana?</p>

</p><p>This issue may occur due to corrupt or missing Windows files.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Error <strong>0x80070002 </strong>is a corruption error related to Windows Update that is associated with your device.
</p>

It will also provide the appropriate fix for it. Kindly follow the steps on this article:<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026529/windows-10-using-system-file-checker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Using

<span><span><span><span>
<p>This can happen for a number of reasons:</p>

<li>You copied a Windows 10 Pro off the Internet (usually a volume license - organization - key) and changed on a Windows 10 Home installation. Windows 10 Pro is not free<span>.&nbsp;</span>If this is what you did, you will need to reinstall the

            I purchased this refurbished laptop approximately 6 months ago. It came with Windows 10 pro pre-installed. The computer has worked fine for months, but recently started giving me this error. No major changes were made to the system. Since it was pre-installed
 by the dealer, I do not have a product key. In the system settings, it says that Windows Pro is activated using my organization's activation service, but does not show an expiration date or any other error code. How do I resolve this error code?

                    <p>I have never gotten the Mail app working on my Surface Pro 4. Can someone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have many email addresses (6 old Windows Live Custom Domain email addresses, 2 Gmail addresses, 6 Outlook.com/Live.com addresses), so
<em>please</em> don't make this about the number of email addresses - it's because of clients, and businesses, hobbies and whatever. Windows Live Mail handles all of these accounts just fine on my workstation, and I have them color-coded and humming along just
 like I want them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd just like to be able to use the native Mail app when I'm on the go with my Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After adding my email addresses, it seemed like, for the most part, the latest emails would be showing first thing in the morning on many of the accounts, but others would be outdated by several days. Throughout the rest of the day, nothing would sync. Period.
 Even when I synced manually, I'd get the dots across the top of the inbox for 15-20 minutes or longer, sometimes followed by a generic error message. When I'd go to edit accounts, and select an account, the "Change mailbox sync settings" was often grayed out
 on any given account, presumably because it was attempting to sync it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I tried:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Removed all accounts except my default account. This would often giving me the same behavior as when I clicked "sync," with dialog box open for a long time with the scrolling dots, followed by an error message. I tried deleting accounts from the Mail app,
 Calendar app, and from Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your email and accounts with varying degrees of success.</li><li>After they were all removed and my default email still wouldn't updated, I uninstalled the Mail/Calendar app using PowerShell.</li><li>I then restarted my Surface, and reinstalled the Mail/Calendar app from the store.</li></ol>
<p>I haven't added back any other accounts, but my main email account still wasn't syncing. So I went into the settings for that account and disabled sync for email. Now, when I go back into the account settings to try and enable sync for email, the "Change
 mailbox sync settings" button is grayed out, and has been for hours.<br />
<br />
<strong>Crazy notion:</strong>&nbsp;My default/primary account is a Windows Live Custom Domain account. Is Mail choking on it because of that?<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Venting Commentary:</strong> It's crazy that the ugly stepchild of Outlook Express is still serving me better on my PC than the latest mail app on this expensive tablet (which has already given me a few BSODs, even during the initial setup process).
 I've been told that Outlook is the best mail app on iPhone and Android - wish they'd port it to Windows 10! :P My sis and bro-in-law were having so many issues with their Surface 2's over the years that the MS Store finally upgraded them to Surface 3's. I
 thought their problems would be over with the switch off of RT, but they had many issues crop up with the new units. Just this month they went all in with iPads and iPhones, and their 6 year old is complaining about being given the Surface 3, which often won't
 even turn on. These are folks who have been on Windows Phone with me since the Samsung Focus, mind you, and suffered through the Windows 8/RT tablet days, hoping that Windows 10 would bring greener pastures. Instead they've put Microsoft out to pasture. Sad,
 but I can't blame them.<br />

            <p>Thanks. Sorry my initial post was convoluted: the main problem at that point was that I couldn't access "Sync Settings." It was grayed out with the message "Syncing your content" for two days. I couldn't even turn sync on for email.&nbsp;Also, yes, I had run
 the troubleshooter many times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up refreshing Windows last night, and was surprised that "Sync Settings" was STILL grayed out afterwards. And all night. This morning, I happened to go there without an internet connection, and I was able to click on that! I turned on email sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, about an hour now, the Mail app has said "Not Synced Yet" with the "please wait" dots going across the top of the inbox. An hour. Nothing. At this point I've removed all accounts, run the troubleshooter, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and
 refreshed Windows. Still no-go. Wow. I wonder if it's my account that's to blame?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Original Title:&nbsp;Vista CPU usage</p>
<p>Stupid Vista goes to 50% CPU usage and ties up the computer for hours after start up.&nbsp; Can't run anything with any kind of CPU demand without bogging down and crashing.&nbsp; It's not windows defender, I suspend that service and the machine is ok for another
 1/2 hour, them I'm back up to 50% CPU.&nbsp; Task Manager says idle process is &gt;90%, yet shows 50% CPU usage and the cooling fan sounds like a 747 taking off.&nbsp; Should I just shoot the machine and go for Linux, or what?&nbsp; Can't run games or anything, totally disgusted
 with POS vista and microsoft can deep-six it, and DON'T say get windows 7, it's probably worse.&nbsp; Is there anything I can disable to get the same performance as, say, windows 3.1?&nbsp; That would be preferable to the current situation.&nbsp; MSCKMA.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause<br />
strange issues).<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>Do these :</strong><br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Enter this at the prompt - sfc /scannow<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<p>Hi BITMAN123,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For upgrading to SFB2019 you mentioned, I understand you mean you want to use Cloud Voicemail and Auto Attendant after migrated to Skype for Business Online, right? If yes, of course they are available for your organization. Please also note, to use a voicemail
 and set up auto attendant, you should have Calling Plan and Enterprise E3 plus Phone System license or an Enterprise E5 license. You can refer to following link to get more details about it:</p>

<p>Hi <strong>DioMac</strong>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>To Customizing the Icon for a File Type without using any third party programs.</strong></p>
<p>a. Click Start, type <strong>Regedit.exe </strong>and press ENTER</p>
<p>b. Navigate to the following branch:</p>
<p><strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \ Microsoft \ Windows \ CurrentVersion \ Explorer \ FileExts \ .abc \ UserChoice</strong></p>
<p>c. In the right-pane, note down the value data for Program id. This is the user chosen Programmatic Identifier for the file extension.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.winhelponline.com%2fblog%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2fq1-09%2ffta-icon1.png" /><br />
d. If the User Choice branch does not exist, navigate to the following branch:</p>
<p><strong>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT \ .abc<br />
</strong>e. In the right-pane, note down the (default) value data (e.g. abcfile). This is the Prog ID for the file extension.</p>
<p>f. Navigate to the following key (where abcfile is the Prog ID noted in Step 2 or Step 4 above):</p>
<p><strong>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT \ abcfile \ DefaultIcon<br />
</strong>Note: If the Default Icon key does not exist by default, you need to create it manually.</p>
<p>g. In the right-pane, double-click (default) and mention the path to your custom icon (.ico file or reference to an icon resource from an EXE/DLL file).</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.winhelponline.com%2fblog%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2fq1-09%2ffta-icon2.png" /></p>
<p>For example, to set the 260th icon in Shell32.dll (contains a text pad icon), type the following path:</p>
<p><strong>C:\Windows\System32\Shell32.dll,260</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.winhelponline.com%2fblog%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2fq1-09%2ffta-icon3.png" /></p>
<p>h. Exit the Registry Editor.</p>
<p>Restart Windows for the icon change to take effect. In case it doesn’t, you can force an icon refresh manually, or try rebuilding the icon cache using Disk Cleanup.<br />
<br />
<strong>Registry disclaimer</strong><br />

<p>How to back up and restore the registry in Windows<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Try these steps:</strong></p>
<p>a. Right click on the folder.<br />
b&nbsp; Select Properties.<br />
c. Click on "Customize" Tab.<br />
d. Click on the button that reads "Change Icon", select the iocn of your choice and<br />
e.&nbsp; Apply Ok<br />

    <title>Internet Access Server causing internet connection issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dubzschi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Access Server causing internet connection issues</h2>
                    <p>I have browsed a lot of discussions with this issue and have tried all fixes that I've found pertaining to this issue but have not had any luck finding a solution to my issue. I apologize if this is a repeat post, but as I said, none of the questions I've
 view have helped.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>I have 2 laptops (windows 7), 2 xbox 360s, and Smart Phones that will all connect to my internet connection with out a problem and run great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I recently bought a PC geared for gaming, and I've had this error since I got it.
</p>
<p>I am able to connect to the Internet. Google always works as does Youtube, but youtube videos will eventually stop buffering until I restart the browser.&nbsp; Most games I play online will launch and play fine at first, but then they lose internet connection
 and will not get it back until I close the game and re-launch it, then it works fine for 5 minutes to an hour but eventually loses connection again until I close the game and relaunch it.. However, when games do lose connection if I Alt+Tab back to desktop
 I am still connected to internet and can run my internet browser to still connect to google or youtube.. Other sites are also affected (Outlook, Netflix, Microsoft, Twitch, etc. all will just keep loading and eventually tell me "the site is taking to long
 to respond").&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried Device Manager update, but it says it cannot find any updates for the Internet&nbsp;Access Server with yellow Triangle/!</p>
<p>Under Devise Manager&lt;Other Devices&lt;Internet Access Server&lt;Properties&lt;General&lt;Device Status: there is a message saying;
<br />
"The Drivers for this device are not installed (Code 28) </p>
<p>&nbsp;To find a driver for this device, click Update Driver."</p>
<p>When I Click "Update Driver&lt;Search Automatically" it runs the search, but ends up telling me:
</p>
<p>"<strong>Windows was unable to install your Internet Access Server</strong><br />
&nbsp;Windows Could not find driver software for your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you know the manufacturer of your device, you can visit its website and check the support section for driver software."</p>
<p>
</p><p>However after visiting the Linksys site, the only thing close to this I found was to update the firmware, which I did but was still didn't fix the issue, and I cannot seem to find anything pertaining to the Internet Access Service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried calling Linksys (Linksys E1200 series router), who directed me to call my ISP, who then told me to make sure my drivers were up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I wasn't even able to check for an update for the Internet Server Access (all were "grayed" out and unclickable.)&nbsp; However after clicking on "Devices and Printers" under start menu, right clicked router&lt;trouble shooting it was able to find one of
 the two updates I need thus allowing me to click "Update Driver" under "Devise Manager&lt;Other&lt;Internet Access Server(Still with Yellow Triangle/!)"&nbsp; However, auto search was still unable to find any updates.&nbsp; My ISP then told me to call Linksys, who again told
 me to call my ISP.&nbsp; So I then started searching for my own solution via internet which lead me to this site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried running the Command Prompt&lt;sfc /scannnow (as directed in many of the other topics here with this issue) and after it finished running the check it said "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations." I also tried this
 under safe mode with networking and still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the "Winsock" fix as directed and an IP reset through the command prompt, still with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent pretty much the last 48 hours trying to get this update with no luck, I finally came across a thread with a post that seemed to fix the issue for Vista, but I need the Windows 7 version which wasn't listed.&nbsp; A community member had provided a
 link to download the driver I cannot seem to locate for the life of me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am typing this from my laptop(not the PC having the issues) and it the internet is running great on this devise without issues as are all the other devises hooked up to this same internet connection. The PC in question is the only one that is hardwired
 to the router, all the rest are wireless and working fine. (No wireless card in the PC with the issue)&nbsp; If I hardwire my laptop(with the same Ethernet cable that is running to the PC with the issues) my laptop still connects to the internet and runs just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            .exe Files mysteriously removed&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I woke up and found that my Wallpaper was changed, my theme was changed, and other stuff, but as the title says, my desktop had none of the .exe files I had. Poking around in Program Files, Steam was missing it's .exe, my games were missing their .exes,
 Firefox was missing it's .exe(Reinstalled successfully!), and while some programs where left intact, it looked like our computer was factory reset, minus that all the other files(MP3s, MP4s, .txt, etc)were left. By the advice of a user on another forum, I
 turned off automatic update. Windows hung for 45 minutes looking for updates, then shut down. As I said, all other files were kept intact, but most .exes were deleted, it seems. I would gladly appreciate some help, because I really want to play some Quake
 III: Arena.</p>

<p>Hello HiMyNameIsXTD,</p>
<p>It sounds like you may have a virus or malware infection as .exe usually don't just disappear. If you don't have a virus scanner, I suggest you download and run Microsoft Security Essentials. It is a free download and will help to protect against Viruses,
 Malware and such. <br />
Click <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here for a link to download the Antivirus</a>.</p>
<p>Next, I would suggest you boot into safe mode and see if your programs are listed there.<br />
To get to Safe Mode:<br />
a) Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.<br />
b) Select an option when the Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.<br />
c) When the Boot menu appears again, and the words "Safe Mode" appear in blue at the bottom, select the installation that you want to start, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here for more information about Safe Mode</a>.</p>
<p>You can also create a new user account and see if your programs will show up for a new user. If they&nbsp;are listed, then you probablly have a corrupt user account.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></a></p>
<p>You may have a conflicting program that is keeping your programs from appearing. A clean boot may help you to determine the conflicting program.&nbsp;<br />
You will Disable all startup items and third party services when booting. This method will help us determine if this issue is caused by a loading program or service.<br />
<br />
The steps below will place your computer into a “clean boot”, meaning using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that we can determine whether a background program is interfering.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start on your Desktop<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type msconfig in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Once the computer is back to your Desktop, check to see if you are still having the problem.</p>
<p>If the issue is resolved by placing the machine in “clean boot” then we have some sort of third party application and or service running that is possibly interfering. To determine which program(s) and or service(s) that is causing this, we would need to
 go back into “msconfig” and <strong>start to enable programs and services and reboot</strong> until we see which one causes the problem.&nbsp; This can be a<strong>long process</strong> but is needed to find the conflicting program.</p>
<p>If placing the computer in “clean boot” does not fix the issue or identify the conflicting programs, then after the troubleshooting is done, follow the steps above “To return your computer back to normal boot”.</p>
<p>KB 929135 - How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>How to set your computer back, to boot normal: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click the Start orb on your Desktop<br />
2. In the Start Search box. Type msconfig, and then press ENTER. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
Click the General tab. <br />
3. Click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.<br />
4. When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</p>

<p>As said in the last thread (please don't make more than one on the same issue), Red Dead Redemption 2 may require some online connectivity so it can't be played offline. You can play the campaign offline but not some other modes that require online to play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are getting this error with every game then either you are on the wrong account or you've connected to the internet briefly where the xbox updated that the My Home Xbox was moved to another console - and making all of your offline games not playable.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Edge Browserror - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimallyn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Edge Browserror</h2>
                    I upgraded from 8.1 to 10 about 3 weeks ago and everything went well.&nbsp; Along with 10 I got Edge and it worked fine until yesterday.&nbsp; I went to a website and Edge alerted me that the website was trying to install malware and it blocked it.&nbsp; I also got the
 message "Browserror 12sws4is.com" and to call 855 982-2068 for technical support.&nbsp; I couldn't' clear the message nor close Edge so I used the task manager to close it and turned the computer off.&nbsp; When I rebooted the computer I had the same problem with Edge
 and the same message.&nbsp; I am afraid I was hacked (principally because of the way "Browserror" was spelled and call a phone number) but I don't know what to do about it.&nbsp; Please help and thank you.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks you for responding.&nbsp; I am no longer sure of the website I was trying to access and I am no longer able to tell.&nbsp; I cannot access any other websites.&nbsp; Any time I launch Edge I get the following message and it no longer works:

            <p>Hi jim</p>
<p>I think you may have had the same prob as myself and many others.</p>
<p>I think it may be embedded in streaming sites if same one.</p>
<p>Try this minimize edge then do a system restore to a point you know was ok.</p>
<p>Then download free version of superantispyware and malwarebytes free version.</p>
<p>Also go to http://www.bleeping computer.com/downloads/junkware-removal-tool</p>
<p>Http://www.surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro</p>
<p>&nbsp;Run these programs and they should remove any adware or malware on your system and get you back to normall.</p>
<p>Good luck hope this helps</p>

<p>Personally I love Edge and dont find that I have any probs with it.</p>
<p>I think its unfortunate people are experiencing probs but zI think there may be more to their probs than meets the eye so it makes it easy to blame edge.</p>
<p>I would still run the malware programs Jim as doing a restore doesnt necessary mean they are gone as after i restored i found quite a few snd they all seem linkef to the site I was on when edge froze up.</p>
<p>Happy browsing</p>

 screen&nbsp;of the site you were able to access indirectly on.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Now go to the EDGE settings, top right corner of&nbsp;screen,&nbsp;click on the three ... which stand for "more" there on the sub-menus click on Settings and clear the browser data.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Close Edge and re-open; the offending site should be gone. It worked for me.</p>

            Well it seems I spoke to soon.&nbsp; While the system restore solved the problem with Edge I soon found out that my system would no longer shutdown nor would it launch any apps.&nbsp; The only way I could shut down was to turn the power off.&nbsp; Finally I was able
 to perform a system reset which wiped out all the programs (but not&nbsp;my data)&nbsp;that did not come with the computer.&nbsp; This now seems to work OK but I have a lot of programs and personal settings to restore.&nbsp; I am more and more convinced this is a Windows 10 problem
 and I hope Microsoft is reading these messages.

            <p>It's not a Windows 10 problem, it's a Hacker/Scammer attack resulting from people visiting untrustworthy/infected websites. &nbsp;If it weren't then every Windows 10/Edge user in the world would be affected. &nbsp;Just Practice Safe Browsing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's the same scam as the endless stream of random scamming phone call's from "Windows" insisting that they've just detected that you computer has a virus and you really do need to let them access your computer, even when they ring on a 'phone line that
 has no internet connection! &nbsp;But, there's one born every minute, so the scam must be making money.</p>

<p>Really sorry your experiencing problems with your system.</p>
<p>Did you read Jsssssssss reply that Rene peerboom shared.?</p>
<p>I also got a reply from Stephen Boots advocating that method as well and said no need to restore.</p>
<p>I can only bow to those guys knowledge but I also know what worked for me and I dont seem to be experiencing problems others are having with win 10 or edge, why Im not sure lucky maybe.</p>
<p>There are loads of microsoft techs that dedicate spare time to help out in this forum so Im sure some one will reply I can only say I hope you get everything ok.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
1. When do you encounter this error message?<br />
2. Did you make any software changes to the computer recently?<br />
3. Have you installed Norton or McAfee security software on your computer?<br />
4. Are you able to boot to the desktop?</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1.</strong></div>
<div>If you are unable to boot to the desktop then we can start with the Last Known Good Configuration and check.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>How to start your computer by using the Last Known Good Configuration feature in Windows XP<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307852</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong></div>
<div>If you are able to boot to the desktop and you get this error message while working on a particular application I would recommend a system restore.<br />
Reference:<br />
<strong>How to restore Windows XP to a previous state<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also I would recommend you to download and install the Windows XP service pack. It improves the reliability of Windows by installing the latest software updates - new drivers for the hardware and more. Computer has the most up to date protection against
 viruses, spyware and malicious software.</div>
<div>Here is the link to download it.</div>

<div><br />
Hope this helps.</div>

    <title>Tablet keeps crashing in bootup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davido0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tablet keeps crashing in bootup</h2>
                    I have a Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 running Windows 8.1.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The same thing happens every time I try to power on the device. The first time I get a bluescreen: "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart... Error: UNEXPECTED KERNEL MODE TRAP"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After this, it powers on again, "Preparing Automatic Repair" I get to an "Automatic Repair" screen. Hitting "restart" shows the same Kernal Mode Trap error again. Hitting "Advanced Options" causes the machine to crash, kicking me back through the process
 again. Yesterday I managed to get through the advanced Options menu to open up a Console and allow Legacy Boot Menu, as outlined here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/faq/id-1653143/fix-unexpected-kernel-mode-trap-windows-error.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tomshardware.com/faq/id-1653143/fix-unexpected-kernel-mode-trap-windows-error.html</a>&nbsp;I
 also tried to repair Windows 8 via a Windows 8 repair disk in an external DVD drive. That didn't work either. However, now I can't even open these options.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm nearly positive it's a driver issue - however I can't press F8 for bootup options because it's a tablet, (and it doesn't respond to the external keyboard) and I can't even attempt to reinstall Windows because it keeps crashing. It also went out of
 warranty on the 8th.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any thoughts?&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This bug check indicates that the Intel CPU generated a trap and the kernel failed to catch this trap. This trap could be a
<em>bound trap</em> (a trap the kernel is not permitted to catch) or a <em>double fault</em> (a fault that occurred while processing an earlier fault, which always results in a system failure).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To assist you further with this issue, I would like to know some information regarding the same.</p>
<p>1. Are you able to boot to desktop?</p>
<p>2. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try installing the latest updated drivers from Lenovo website and check if the issue persists.</p>
