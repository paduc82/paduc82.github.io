<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it</span><span><span>.</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>

    <title>Nvidia Registry cleanup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elliottj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nvidia Registry cleanup</h2>
                    <p>Nvidia and MSFT crossed each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. My GT6800 died and replaced it with GT630.&nbsp; I did not delete old driver it was the same version.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Windows update came right behind my install of the hardware with an update for WDDM which I appled and then restart.</p>
<p>3. System went into a "C" drive search looking for something and never started the driver as the screen was "black".</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Only option was to power-off.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;That is a week ago,&nbsp; Now went throught 3 replacement boards, same on all three, "black screen power-off required" and use "safe mode to disable driver and use VGA".</p>
<p>6. I have been looking at the Registry and did delete a few entries as instructed&nbsp;in "Software" under "User" and "Machine" keys.&nbsp; Did not help.</p>
<p>7. I have been looking at more of the Registry and have noted some "Nvidia" endries I did not delete before install the latest driver 310.90.</p>
<p>8. VGA is part of the GT630 board.&nbsp; Running Dell Demision 8400 with 2G Ram and 80Gb harddrive, 450W power,&nbsp;using Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; Have latest chip set and BIOS from Dell and Windows has all update applied.</p>
<p>9&nbsp; I have sepent hours reading through the posting looking for help, and trying some, but all have not helped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question and help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming I have some old Registry enties from days gone by that is being used by Windows during the startup and it is pointing to some place on the "C" drive that has long been deleted.</p>
<p>Assuming I will backup my Registry to a Flash Drive,&nbsp; using Windows Registry back and create a System Restore Point.</p>
<p>Assuming I uninstall Nvidia software without deleting the folders after the uninstall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would not use a "reg cleaner" but I would go through each key looking for "Nvidia" and delete that key from the Registry. Starting with the "root".</p>
<p>I would then delete all folds in all user accounts for Nvidia, then re-install Nvidia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could this be what is going on following&nbsp;while&nbsp;Windows is starting up (I do the the icon and "Windows Starting" and does this sound like a workable plan?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>J.</p>

            <span>If you pre-ordered Mortal Kombat 11 digitally, Shao Kahn should have been downloaded alongside the game when it was first available for pre-load on your platform. Of course, there's always the possibility that the game might not have downloaded
 the character for some reason, and if this is the case, then you simply need to find the product listing for Shao Kahn on your storefront, and manually download the DLC fighter.</span>

    <title>Sharing only computer sounds in version 8.21 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> enriquefp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharing only computer sounds in version 8.21</h2>
                    <p>In the old versions of Skype (7.40 and before) there was an option to share my computer sounds (what I'm hearing) during a call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last version of Skype (8.21) that option has been transformed into "share screen and sounds".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is some feedback that I expect somebody ends up raising to the person in charge of this change:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Making the share of the screen&nbsp;mandatory when you want to share only the audio is a step back in the features Skype has.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know where this decision comes from (is it really so little used the feature of sharing only your audio?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion, there is only need for two buttons:</p>
<p>"Share screen"</p>
<p>"Share audio"</p>
<p>Separated, but compatible (meaning: You can activate both of them at the same time).</p>

<h3> cyclopz 42o  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Insider Hub</h2>
                    A while back, I think somewhere between 1-2 years ago, I enrolled in the Xbox Insider Hub Beta updates, and I dudn't have any problems with it. I haven't had my console hooked up to wifi for about a year, and I keep getting udates every time I turn on
 my Xbox, they're getting progressively larger, the latest (at 26% right now) is 3.6 gb. I want to opt out of it, but the Xbox Insider Hub app also needs an update, and the Xbox updates come so often that the Insider Hub can't even get past 1%. Is there any
 way to opt out of the experimental updates without using the Xbox, or a Windows 10 PC?

<p>G'day</p>
<p>I know you said without XBOX, but thought I'd advise how you take your console out of the Insiders from within the Insider Hub on the console or at least drop down to a lower ring.</p>
<p>After you load hub under Announcements you will see what ring (Beta) your in..</p>
<p>Click to manage and/or exit from the previews.</p>
<p>At of today you would have to factory refresh if you leave but could go down to Delta without a refresh.</p>
<p>If you go down a ring wait until the Omega ring OS version is the same and go down to there which has fewer updates and is nearly about to be released as a General release.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

            I think you might be able to use the Xbox Insider Hub app on Windows 10 to remove a device from the Xbox One preview program.

            I was planning on doing that, but my Xbox is stuck in a loop of update after update, and the update I mentioned is still going, now at 65%, and I only am able to get on wifi at certain times, cause we run off a generator. I'm slowly getting it updated
 a bit at a time, somewhere around 25% per connection, and once I get in, I will attempt what you have suggested. Thank you for your time, and sorry for the long winded posts.

<p>Hi there Cyclopz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the replies. We understand you are experiencing some issues with <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
opting out of the Insider program</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists,&nbsp;Try this:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Launch the <strong>Xbox Insider Hub</strong> on your Xbox One or a Windows 10 PC.
</li><li>On the main landing page, select <strong>Settings</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Manage devices</strong> and choose the one you want to remove from the program.
</li><li>Select <strong>Done</strong>. </li><li><strong>Note: </strong>This process typically takes about 10 minutes to complete. It might help to know the serial number or name of your previous console to ensure you remove the correct one.
</li></ol>
<p>As part of the removal process, your Xbox may undergo a factory refresh. If a factory refresh is required, your games and apps won‚Äôt be erased, but any profiles or system settings saved to the console will need to be restored after the refresh is complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Thank

<h2>            HELP - Defeitos &#43; Conserto&#47;Troca</h2>
                    

<p>Ol√°, em dezembro/2013 resolvi comprar o XBOX ONE ap√≥s ser cliente do XBOX 360 por alguns anos... Ap√≥s a compra do XBOX ONE, em menos de 10 dias tive que troc√°-lo 3x na loja conforme o C√≥digo de Defesa do Consumidor, pelos seguintes defeitos: 1¬™ troca - o
 Kinect n√£o funcionava. 2¬™ troca - Kinect queimou ap√≥s alguns dias. 3¬™ troca - A atualiza√ß√£o obrigat√≥ria n√£o completava a instala√ß√£o. Ap√≥s esse transtorno, a loja trocou novamente o meu console... tudo funcionava normalmente at√© o m√™s anterior. Em outubro/2014
 percebi um ru√≠do interno muito alto, no qual fazia o aparelho esquentar muito r√°pido e travar algumas vezes. Pelo que identifiquei, esse barulho vinha do Coller, parecia que algo estava "arranhando" ao executar. Ap√≥s este problema, no dia 11/10/14 resolvi
 entrar em contato com o suporte e abri o chamado n√∫mero:&nbsp;[Mod removed]&nbsp;com a descri√ß√£o do chamando dizendo que o aparelho seria trocado. Na pr√≥xima semana ir√° completar 1 m√™s, e hoje eu recebi um email da central do Xbox Brasil informando que o meu console
 est√° a caminho e consta um novo n√∫mero de s√©rie.</p>
<p>Acontec√™ que liguei na central e fui informado que o console que irei receber ser√° recondicionado... Isso mesmo, ser√° um aparelho usado, que j√° vou reparado por algum problema qualquer... Isso √© um absurdo!!! Paguei mais de R$ 2000,00 no console novo, e
 agora vou receber um console usado e reparado?! Onde fica a qualidade e a satisfa√ß√£o dos clientes?!</p>
<p>Ap√≥s isso, li v√°rios relatos na internet onde as pessoas enviaram o console com defeito e receberam outro console "novo" reparado que alguns dias depois apresentaram outro problema, Poxa, esse ser√° o console numero 5 que vou receber... Como dito no come√ßo,
 quando comprei tive que troc√° l√≥ na loja 3x, passei alguns transtornos, mas a loja sempre me atendeu. Agora quase 1 ano ap√≥s os fatos, acionei a garantia e v√£o me enviar um console usado/reparado?! E ainda corro o risco de ter que troc√° lo novamente.</p>
<p>Sinceramente, estou perdendo a credibilidade do Xbox, comecei a me arrepender pela escolha no console desta gera√ß√£o.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quero deixar registrado a minha indgna√ß√£o com o suporte prestado pela Microsoft Br.&nbsp;</p>
<p>J√° fiz essa reclama√ß√£o na central e no site "reclame aqui" e at√© agora estou esperando um posicionamento da empresa por email e/ou telefone.</p>

<p>Cara espera chegar o console se vir um console usado e n√£o for aquele que vc enviou, vc reclama se for um novo esta td correto, mas que eu saiba a microsoft n√£o trabalha com consertos de consoles ela s√≥ trabalha com troca de aparelhos eles confirmam o problema
 e dai enviam um novo, espera pois esse atendentes do xbox s√£o muito despreparados, alguns dizem uma coisa outros dizem outra, espera que eu tenho certeza que aquele atendente esta um desinformado,</p>

<p>Cara, espero que d√™ tudo certo mesmo... Que seja um erro de script do atendente, pois 2 atendentes me informaram que a troca √© somente com aparelho recondicionado. Um dos atendentes &nbsp;tinha um sotaque espanhol e ainda me disse que era pra eu ficar tranquilo,
 pois o console que irei receber √© recondicionado mas √© testado antes... Rs, brincadeira ter que ouvir isso n√©?! Curto muito o Xbox, estou torcendo pra que d√™ tudo certo, que eu receba um console novo e livre de problemas.. E assim, volto a ser feliz com o
 meu X1. Abs!!</p>

<p>Se der tudo certo ou errado posta aqui, se eles enviar um console recondicionado e ele apresentar problemas processa eles pois se vc perdir o dinheiro de volta vc vai ficar com uma mao na frente e a outra atras, e processando vc pode ganhar indeniza√ßao e
 ainda eles vao ser obrigados se vc quiser √© claro outro console, um console novo e uma indeniza√ßao gorda</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth doesn&#39;t work on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>First let's get something clear. The bluetooth is embed in my laptop and was working in Windows 8. Now on Windows 8.1 the option to turn it on/off has disappeared. The bluetooth driver is properly installed (according to the Device Manager). Bluetooth related
 services are all set to "Automatic".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when I go to Add a Device and try to connect my bluetooth headphone to my laptop, my headphone does not show up in the modal. The headphone is working perfectly fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea on how to solve this problem? There is no bluetooth icon in the taskbar but the devices is properly installed. Any input is welcome.</p>

<h3> apollofury  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to change process priority in task manager</h2>
                    Ive recently installed x86 windows 7 RC1 and found that when running 2 copies of world of warcraft (dual-boxing) + ventrilo (+ other scattered programs ... Vuze / MSN etc) that both windows in world of warcraft suffer massively in terms of both frame-rate
 and responsiveness when swapping between windows. Ive also noticed, that the system doesnt seem to allow ventrilo any processor time, which inturn makes the voice function in vent suffer ... becoming laggy and jagged when sending any voice data. Ive tried
 allocating more processor time for the programs, but windows gives me the error "This operation could not be completed, Access Denied". This didnt occur under Beta to my knowledge. I also havent tested this within safe mode ...<br />
<br />
Now i understand the system security specifics and believe i have given myself all the correct admin security priviledges, but im still getting this error, even if i run the programs as administrator, they are still suffering from small amounts of processor
 time. <br />
<br />
Ive got a fairly strong system, so its not as if there is limited resources - this has me boggled.<br />

<p><span>Hello, ApolloFury</span></p>
<p><span>I am happy to offer some suggestions, but you will need to go to the Windows 7 Support forums at the following link for help with troubleshooting:
</span><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/w7itpro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/w7itpro</span></a></p>
<p><span>After you open the Task Manager, click
<strong>Show Processes from all users</strong> to ensure it is running as an Administrator. To split the load, set each instance to its own core by right clicking the process, Set Affinity and ensure only a single core is selected. Select the other core for
 the second instance. If you have a second hard drive, running the second instance from the second hard drive should also increase performance.</span></p>
<p><span>Lower your settings to minimum in game.</span></p>
<p><span>You may also want to try choosing a basic theme to disable the Aero interface.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If your Anti-Virus scans on file access, it can cause additional slowdown as well with largefiles.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</span></p>

<h2>            CPU running at full speed even in idle state</h2>
                    The CPU is running at full speed even if there is no significant load on it . My ram consumption is 25-30% in idle state but my cpu is running at 2.5GHZ-3.2 GHz when its standard speed is 2.30 GHz without turboboost . However , the cpu utilization is only
 2-10 % but speed is maximum all the time.

<div>As far as Task Manager is concerned , I've been monitoring it for a while now but there ain't any service which looks like consuming that much CPU power ... And if there have been such processes would not that mean cpu utilisation should also be high along

    <title>What did you honestly think of Honest Hearts&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What did you honestly think of Honest Hearts&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I personally really liked Honest Hearts compared to Dead Money. I felt like there was more content overall in HH, more gear to get, more exploration and more story. Plus, who doesn't like the .45 auto? That gun is seriously BA. What did you guys think of
 the new DLC?</p>

<p>I really liked it too, the setting and story really fit in well with the whole world of the mojave and i agree that the unique weapons and gear are really cool. All done with the quests and got both endings now i'm off to explore a bunch of caves i've yet
 to fully explore.</p>
<p>Way better than dead money in my opinion, a casino, a brotherhood scribe, poision gas clouds, zomibie people, killer holograms i'm still confused over just what the hell dead money was supposed to be. They should have just kept to the heist aspect to it
 and just left the whole "survival horror" element out entirely. Every game has to have stupid zombies now and it's getting real played out, no zombies in my fallout please just stick with ghouls and mutants obsidian/bethesda.</p>

<p>I think the story to DM was really good, the story for HH was pretty good but I think they made everything really easy in HH for all of the people who complained about DM. I did like the side story of the survivalist, that was pretty cool, but I felt like
 there was a huge amount of space and not as much to do. dont get me wrong, I loved HH but there are things that are not perfect.</p>

<p>I liked HH. &nbsp;I really liked the scenery and the story was pretty good. &nbsp;I though Dead Money's was better and I wished you got to dive into Joshua Grahmns story a little more, but still worth the price of admission. &nbsp;I also though the loot was better in this.
 &nbsp;the .45 Auto is sick and I happy there is now a Ranger outfit you can wear that isn't consitered NCR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did like the toughness of Dead Money though so I was a little disappointed at how easy this was. &nbsp;Although, half of Dead Money's toughness was not having any ammo/weapons and I loved that you could actually bring your stuff with even if it was only 75
 or 100 lbs. &nbsp;Nothing I hate more than spending 100 hours collecting all this cool stuff and then not be able to use it when new content comes out.</p>

<b>The ghost people weren't really zombies.&nbsp; Feral ghouls are a different story, but that was Bethesda's idea, and thankfully, there aren't as many of them in New Vegas.&nbsp; But anyway, back on topic</b>[/quote]Honestly (the title of the thread is kind of funny),
 I thought the story in Honest Hearts was a bit too short for the conflict it tried to set up and for the size of Zion (the whole DLC, including the main quests, side quests, and exploring most, if not all of the locations took me about eight hours; you can
 probably breeze through Honest Hearts in half that time if you stick solely to the main quest) and the main quest was full of fetch quests in the most literal of senses.&nbsp; Still, it was a good narrative that was yours to define (albeit, the overall story was
 lacking compared to Dead Money's more intricate plot), full of interesting, well-written characters with some superb voice acting (Graham in particular).&nbsp; Some of the side quests were pretty cool.&nbsp; So overall, the story was alright, and while I liked Dead
 Money's plot better, the characters, writing, and voice acting in Honest Hearts were just as strong</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The setting was a nice change of pace and the overall art design was visually impressive.&nbsp; The rain caught me off guard the first time, but it fits with the canon.&nbsp; The whole Point Lookout design of a free-roaming wasteland as a piece of DLC was definitely
 a good decision.&nbsp; I liked the side story with the Survivalist and enjoyed exploring Zion, but a lot of the locations are pretty bland and feel like they are just there to help you get around quicker.&nbsp; Regardless, Zion itself is a cool place.&nbsp; I would've liked
 to have seen New Canaan (and yes, I know it was destroyed, but Obsidian could've not had it destroyed and set a part of the DLC or the whole DLC around it), but whatever; some of the concepts from New Canaan are still in Zion, and an original location is just
 as good as bringing the van Buren design documents to life in my eyes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were definitely some challenging enemies, and while the DLC doesn't strip your gear, the weight limit (and I liked that you could raise it with the right perk or Survival skill level; some nice role playing there) definitely makes an impact (albeit,
 mainly on Hardcore Mode).&nbsp; There are also new perks and a lot of nice loot, and even if you miss something, you can return to Zion whenever you want.&nbsp; And while I don't approve of the raised level cap due to it throwing off the balance of the game (albeit,
 not as much as I thought it would), I know a lot of people like it, so it's really just a matter of preference.&nbsp; Although I was only a few XP away from level 40 by the time I finished Honest Hearts, so you won't get much usage out of it (it could've been more
 though; the amount of XP you get from some quests is just ridiculous).&nbsp; Honest Hearts also wasn't that buggy for me; the game crashed only once during my time in Zion and that's about it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the plot in Honest Hearts was longer and not so ridden with fetch quests, and the side locations were a bit more interesting, Honest Hearts could've been the best Fallout DLC of them all.&nbsp; Still, the strong characters and the fantastic setting of Zion
 itself balance this out, and the loot, new perks, added challenge, and (for some of you) the increased level cap more than make this DLC worth your while.&nbsp; It's definitely an improvement over Dead Money by and large, and it is better than a lot of Fallout
 3's DLCs.&nbsp; So yes, I'd recommend it, and probably give it an 8/10.&nbsp; Anyway, that's my quick review</p>

<ul>
<li>Clearing the cache </li><li>Re-downloading the most recent title update (it saves to your hard drive, so you have to delete it regularly, rather than clearing your cache)

<p><span><span>Hi Yakhaman</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for using
<strong>Microsoft Answers </strong>Forums!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Are you able to use
</span></span><span>other USB devices on the computer? Are they detected on the front USB ports? Try to put the iPod to a different USB port and check. Is it detected in the different USB port?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the other USB ports are working fine then the USB ports in the front could not be connected physically. Let‚Äôs go to the device
 manager and check how many ports show up in the device manager.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Device Manager, locate the USB Controllers and check how many USB Ports are detected. If the front port is not detected then check these link below to verify your issue:

<p><span><span>You attach a USB-based device to a computer. Then, you try to scan for hardware devices. However, the computer does not detect the attached
 device, and you do not see the device in the My Computer folder. This device can be:

<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>USB flash drive

<h2>            &#91;Windows 10&#93; Problem with File explorer&#47;quick access</h2>
                    <p>I have just started getting a very odd problem with file explorer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open file explorer by clicking the icon on the menu or using Window Key + E, the window opens, quick access is selected on the left, but the right pane just shows 'Working On It...'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually it shows 'File Explorer (Not Responding' in the title bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However....</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select Run or Windows Key + R, and type in C: or D: etc, File explorer opens and is fine...until I select 'Quick Access'...when it hands again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run sfc and no problems are found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 Version 1709 Build 16299.371.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Suggestions appreciated.</p>

<h2>            &#34;InstallScript Setup Launcher Unicode has stopped working&#34; message when uninstalling Covenant Eyes</h2>
                    Basically, when trying to uninstall Covenant Eyes on my Windows 10 computer, I get the "InstallScript Setup Launcher Unicode has stopped working" error message. This is especially annoying since I need to uninstall this fairly soon so I can have repair
 work done. Is there a good solution for this?

<p><span>Wipe the DVD with a clean cloth in circular pattern and then check the issue.

<p><span>There is also a possibility that the files in the old disc are corrupted which in turn closes the window.</span>

<p>That means a web browser just know to use either ISP DNS IP Address or Proxy server IP Address but not both of them, however if you have specified the proxy IP Address in the proxy text box in internet explorer is overwhelm the ISP DNS IP Address right?That's
 why i don't have internet access?</p>

            <p>Whether or not you specify a proxy address, your computer will still use your ISP's DNS servers to resolve hostnames. Proxy servers play no part in the name resolution process, rather they receive web requests and pass them on to their destination server
 (or respond on their behalf if they already have the page cached).</p>

            Proxy servers are specialized web page storage "place" that allow the proxy server administrator(s) to be able to apply "filtering rules."&nbsp; It seems meant to be a "place" that companies can monitor and filter out Internet sites that they (the company)
 deem to not want their employees to have access.<br />
<br />
Depending on the "proxy" server configuration, it would have its own configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp; It can use the ISP's provided DNS server configuration or its own.<br />
<br />
Your Internet access is "forced" thorough your configured "proxy" address but since it is a "fake" one, the Internet access requests never can complete.<br />

            <p>Hi smlunatick,</p>
<p>So the computer / web browser is not so smart to turn back to DNS IP address of my ISP automatically. It mean the same as once you specified a fake Static IP Address it will stick forever with the Static IP Address&nbsp;instead of using a Dynamic IP Address automatically
 again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And is proxy server is an application that need to install in a windows server?</p>

    <title>Turn off DHCPv6 per Interface - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryderse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turn off DHCPv6 per Interface</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have setup an IPv6 only network and I have dozens of machines connected to it. Everything from WinXP 32 bit to Win8 64 bit and more.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Most of the machines are using Static IPv6 addresses because I am NAT'ing them to IPv4 so they can talk over the IPv4 only network too.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Some wireless devices need to use DHCPv6 because they won't accept static IPv6 addresses. I've got a DHCPv6 server running on my router for these clients.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, within this same layer 2 domain I've got a mix of statically configured IPv6 hosts and some that use DHCPv6. There is no overlap of IP addresses.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This would work a lot better if it weren't for one issue. Several of the Windows hosts (mostly Win7 and Win8) also pull an IPv6 address via my DHCPv6 server even though they already have a Static IPv6 address assigned. This consumes too many of my DHCPv6
 addresses. Since this is a lab network to test IPv6 only clients talking to IPv4 only servers, I need a unique IPv4 address for every IPv6 address. So, I simply cannot just increase my DHCP scope to allow all machines to have two IPv6 addresses because that
 would consume too many IPv4 addresses.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need the ability to turn off DHCPv6 per interface within Win7 and Win8. Actually, even if it's global that would work too but I still need to keep DHCPv4 running so I can't simply disable the DHCP service.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know how to do this? My searching is not coming up with anything useful</div>

Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers Community site. Your DHCP question is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums. It is better suited for the IT Pro audience on TechNet. Please post your question in the TechNet

            <p>Thanks for the quick reply.<br />
I had Windows 7 home premium and tried to install Windows 10 a few times as I couldn't get the Clean install working.<br />
Which I eventually did.<br />
I used the Windows update diagnostic or troubleshooter and it said:<br />
Service registration is missing or corrupt<br />
I used the system file checker and it said:<br />
Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations.<br />
I'm not sure how much was unable to download it says downloading updates 0% &nbsp;and goes through them then the errors pop up.<br />
and the three updates with the same error are:<br />
Security Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3074683)<br />
Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3074678)<br />
Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3074686)<br />
As for step 3 I'm a little confused with how to do a side by side or removable media fix if my Windows update client is broken.<br />
Sorry if this message is lengthy I wanted to detail everything.<br />
Thanks again<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:<br />
Just tried Step 3 and when I tried these querys in command prompt:<br />
Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth<br />
and<br />
Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth<br />
and<br />
Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:c:\test\mount\windows /LimitAccess<br />
This came up: error 87<br />
for this query:<br />
Dism /Image:C:\offline /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:c:\test\mount\windows<br />
I got:<br />
error 1639<br />
<br />
Please help.</p>

            Hi <br />
Thanks for the information.<br />
<br />
I tried method 1:<br />
It said Windows update components must be repaired and fixed next to it but the problem persisted.<br />
<br />
I tried method 2:<br />
Not sure exactly what some programs are named but:<br />
Background Intelligent Transfer Service - says its running<br />
Cryptographic services - says its running<br />
Windows Update - says its running<br />
Windows installer - wasn't. so i turned it on.<br />
The problem persisted<br />
<br />
Method 3:<br />
restarted using this method but the problem persisted.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if there are any alternate fixes if or when avalable<br />
As I would be very much appreciative.<br />
Thanks again.<br />
-Dan<br />

            Hi <br />
<br />
I got to step 3<br />
Tried renaming the two files but it said access denied.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the quick reply.<br />
<p>
</p><p>Update:<br />
I added myself in command prompt security properties and gave myself full control over the default hidden administrator<br />
I renamed Catroot2 but still saying access denied for Software Distribution<br />
Plus:<br />
When I go to the app store to update my apps<br />
&nbsp;now all of them are stuck on pending.<br />
</p>

            I performed a normal clean install on my Pc last night.<br />
The Updates are now working and so are the apps.<br />
The issue is resolved for me.<br />

<h2>            Error&#58; Enter a SIM PIN2 to unlock the mobile broadband service, Unable to connect to LTE connection on Surface Go</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Surface Go with LTE and it appears that the cell part hooks up and it knows the ISP but the data connection is locked with the SIM PIN2.&nbsp; I downloaded the dia program and ran it and it returned "Enter a SIM PIN2 to unlock the mobile broadband
 device"&nbsp; I tried to other ISP vendors and they also acted the same way.&nbsp; With Surface Go, I would try changing the control by Windows to manual and started the connect and it also would not work.&nbsp; I have updated and also downloaded the Microsofts update for
 the LTE and they did not fix the problem also.&nbsp; Any fixes out there that work?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Ideally when the PIN is blocked the normal PIN will not work and to get the PIN unlocked you need to contact the Mobile operator to
 get the PIN unblocking key (PUK) and then you will be able to use the mobile broadband service. For more information you can refer the article
