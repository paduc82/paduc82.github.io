    <title>Windows Media Player-error message when pasting album art&#58; Album - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wulfrun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player-error message when pasting album art&#58; Album art can&#39;t be changed when a song from the album is in use. Please try again later.</h2>
                    
<p><span>Error message when pasting album art</span></p>
<p>Having had to remove the My Music Folder and&nbsp;re-install WMP12 after having numerous problems, I have been individually adding all my music to my hard drive. To begin with everything was fine. All the music was automatically added to WMP and the album art
 was correct too. Some of the albums copied to my computer lacked album art so I began manually finding it and adding it.</p>
<p>After a while, a Media Player error message continually appears for a few&nbsp;certain albums&nbsp;when trying to Paste Album art - 'Album art can't be changed when a song from the album is in use. Please try again later.' - even though no song is playing. I have
 again removed and re-installed WMP12 but the message still appears though eventually the album art is changed even though it says it can't do it. A minor annoyance, but WMP12 should be perfect as it is a fresh install. What is causing it?. I have disabled
 WMP network sharing without it having any effect.</p>

<p>I suggest that you try resetting the media library. First note that resetting the library will make you lose all current play counts, and possibly ratings too. Then, follow these steps:</p>
- Reboot the PC.<br />
- Go to Start, type&nbsp; <strong>services.msc</strong> in the Search field, and press Enter. In Services, find the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service</strong> . If its status is&nbsp;<strong>Started</strong> , double-click the service and click&nbsp;
<strong>Stop</strong> .<br />
- Go to Start, type&nbsp; <strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft</strong> in the Search field, and press Enter. This folder will open up in Windows Explorer.<br />
- In this folder, rename the&nbsp; <strong>Media Player</strong> folder to something like&nbsp;<strong>Media Player old</strong> . If you can't see the folder, then it's probably hidden. Set Explorer to show hidden files and folders, and to show protected system files.<br />
- Start WMP, your library will have been reset and will be rebuilt. Check if the issue still occurs.

<p>Yes, you can see the following: <a href="https://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/how-to-rollback-to-a-previous-version-of-windows-from-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Throughout the history of Windows revisions, Microsoft has included an option to uninstall the operating system when you upgrade to a newer version. My recollection of this capability goes back to Windows ME which included the option to uninstall the operating system and restore to a previous version of Windows (I was running Windows 98 SE at the time). Microsoft has supported this functionality in its NT based versions of Windows too, albeit not in a seamless way. The ability to restore a Windows 8.1 installation to Windows 7 required knowing some command line operations that in some instances didn't guarantee the process would go according to plan. With Windows 10, it seems Microsoft has listened and has provided a welcome option to its recovery tools to make it easy to uninstall Windows 10 and go back t

            For Hard Drive, read PARTITION<br />
<br />
It is the size of the Partition that matters, NOT the total size of your Hard Drive!<br />
<br />
"It&nbsp;does not matter if you have a 1,000Gbs Hard Drive; it is the size of the Partition, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;free space on it,&nbsp;where XP is installed, that&nbsp;has to accomodate the Vista Ultimate upgrade install process.&nbsp;"<br />
<br />
The have been given the correct advice/options on what to do by both of us.<br />
<br />
Install on a smaller partition where XP is already installed, or re-partiiton your Hard Drive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck with it.<br />
<br />
Cheers.

                    <p>I have a HP Laptop that came with Windows 8. I have me not updates to it. I did check to see if all my USB / Com Port drivers were up to date and Windows has confirmed they are.

<h2>            HP 8620&#47;Windows 10 Printer Offline</h2>
                    <p>I'm an IT Admin, this Win10 Printer Offline issue has be completely baffled. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the hardware specs that a family member is using: </p>
<p>
</p><p>- HP 8620 All-in-One Printer</p>
<p>- ASUS laptop w/ Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially set this up for him a few months ago. Worked fine for a week or two, then I get a call saying that the laptop won't print. His phone and other devices continue to print fine. Go to printers in Win10 and it says "printer offline". Tried the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Disable SNMP</p>
<p>- Ran the HP printer troubleshooter </p>
<p>- Set static IP address</p>
<p>- Ethernet connection versus wireless </p>
<p>- Ran all updates on Win10 and from HP</p>
<p>- Went into printer "see what's printing" and settings in there do not make a difference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always works good for a few days then I get a call again. He is a normal user who is unable to uninstall/reinstall every few days. Seems like a common issue, which i'm hoping there is a fix for.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, </p>
<p>

<p>User Configuration/Administrative Templates/Desktop/Desktop/Desktop Wallpaper.</p>

 problem) the OEM recovery partition since it got the first Windows 8 and it was wasting 18Gb from the Hard drive so I preferred to get rid of it and partition the hard drive as usually do to one big primary partition with the system on it and the rest as a
 second partition for other stuff.</span></span><br />
</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><ul>
<li><span><strong>Detailed Explanation of the problem:</strong></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgba(127, 127, 127, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Well after a Clean install of Windows 10 Pro everything seemed to be working good I used it for some time installed necessary stuff and so on, until
 I tried to get My PC to sleep everything goes as normal screen turn black fan sound start to decrease, I wait to see the power light goes from on to blinking as it normally does but no it still on and I still hear the fan (a little bit) I waited for more time
 same thing it was stuck there so the only solution was to force the shutdown (5 sec pushing the power button)<br />
<br />
The same thing happens with shutting down it starts like normal .. shutting down screen .. screen goes black ... waiting ... same thing power light still on fan still on also keyboard unresponsive (caps lock stay stuck same before shutdown)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
same thing with hibernate option (after I enabled it) but it turns that the hibernate option was my first lifesaver when I want to get my PC to sleep without losing any open file I hit Hibernate the same thing again it got stuck as the other options so I force
 the shutdown (5 sec pushing the power button) but the only different thing between sleep and hibernate is that when I turn on my PC I have all opened file back as I left them, and it's logical because Sleep mode save all your open file to the RAM and since
 it's volatile, on power lose it get cleared. But the hibernation mode save the opened files on the hard drive and because it's non-volatile so all open file stay there until I boot up o this was just a workaround since&nbsp;<br />
So this was just a workaround since I didn't find a solution.<br />
<br />
I forgot to say the problem on happens when the pc stays on for some random time 10 minute 1 hour I'm not sure because sometimes when I just turned on the PC and I try to shut it down, make it sleep or hibernate it everything works well it gets shut down, sleep
 or hibernate normally as it supposed to do.<br />
<br />
Finally the reboot out from all the options was the only thing that works as supposed, and this was my secondary lifesaver when I wanted to shut down the PC normally (no forced shutdown) or make it sleep (I always leave it on sleep since I'm using the USB to
 charge my phone with it) when I'm using it for a time and I know that it won't shut down or go to sleep the normal way I restart it and then I shut it down or make it sleep.<br />
<br />
The only thing that I noticed about the Reboot process after the rebooting screen than the screen goes black, it completely shut down the PC turns off all lights for about 3 seconds then boot up again not like the normal reboot as I think and as I saw on other
 same laptops: it turns off the screen after a while it boots up again directly and you can still notice that that the pc didn't get turned off completely the booted up again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And this happens only if the PC was ON for some time (When I suspect that the shutdown/sleep will not work) but if I rebooted just after powering on the PC just after it, it reboots as supposed to do (like normal PCs) no 3sec completely off with all lights
 off.<br />
But anyway I just felt like I should mention this.</span></span><br />

<p>Hi Abdellah, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since that you have already tried some of the basic workaround, we just want to clarify if you were able to perform System file check (SFC) Scan? If you still haven't, you can check this

            <p>Hi Tecox45,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>I would like to inform you that Microsoft has discontinued the production of Digital Image Pro and there does not exist a store app for the same, too.</p>
<p>However, on the good side are several new software developed by Microsoft that outwit the capabilities of Digital Image Pro.</p>
<p>Have&nbsp;a look at this:</p>

            I would suggest contacting Yahoo support if this issue is only directed with Yahoo, as suggested by Gordon.&nbsp; But if you are having other issues then you would need to let us know what browser you are using.&nbsp; If its not IE then you would most likely need
 to contact support for that browser.&nbsp; ie Firefox

    <title>Epson All-in-One Printer Driver Runtime error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shannon fowler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Epson All-in-One Printer Driver Runtime error</h2>
                    <p>I am having difficulty with installing printer drivers for an Epson all-in-one Workforce 7520 that is shared on a network.&nbsp; When trying to install the software provided, I receive this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Runtime Error!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Program:</strong></p>
<p><strong>C:\Windows\system32\spool\DRIVERS\x64\3\E_YATIHDA.EXE</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>R6034</strong></p>
<p><strong>An application has made an attempt to load the C runtime library incorrectly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please contact the application's support team for more information.</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This error will continue periodically until I disable the print spooler in the services tab.&nbsp; If I use the print command in any program, that program will immediately freeze and require a force close through the task manager.&nbsp; To uninstall the software entirely
 the print spooler has to remain disabled, else it will give an error that it is in use.&nbsp; After uninstalling using add/remove programs I have to go into the system32\spool\DRIVERS\ folders to manually remove leftover traces of the software (including the offending
 .exe program).<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tell the machine to locate drivers on its own, it will bring up a window with the 'WSD Print Device' and an icon indicating it is busy, which will eventually turn into a red X indicating it failed to find a driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Epson's default software package includes bells and whistles like a utility that monitors ink levels and checks for firmware updates, which will invariably cause this error.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But Epson also allows you to download the driver separately from this package.&nbsp; When I install from just this driver, no error appears, the computer will communicate with the printer, and will use the scanner and fax functions without error (it will display
 its IP address, MAC address, and even send print commands), but it does not actually print a file.&nbsp; The job will appear in the printer's status screen on the computer, but eventually time out and error.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The machine giving me the error is an Acer with Windows 7 Pro installed by the manufacturer.&nbsp; It is a brand new machine.<br />
</p>
<p>These same drivers work with no error on an HP Windows 7 Home machine installed by the manufacturer, as well as several XP machines that we are attempting to phase out of use.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Both machines also have a Konica Minolta printer installed that they will print to with no issue.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After researching the issue, Epson insists there's nothing wrong with their drivers, however I will be contacting their support today as well.&nbsp; If they come up with a solution I will try to remember to post it for other people's benefit.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have been trying many suggestions available online with no change in results:
<br />
</p>
<p>Tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times from the provided epson CD.</p>
<p>Run windows update.<br />
Tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times with the newest drivers located on epson's website.</p>
<p>Verified I am using the 64 bit drivers and not the 32 bit.</p>
<p>Run 'scannow' which returned no abnormal results.<br />
</p>
<p>Deleted all files in the AppData/Temp folder<br />
</p>
<p>Reassigned the location of the temp folder.<br />
</p>
<p>Tried installing with Windows firewall disabled.</p>
<p>Removed the McAffee trial that came with the machine entirely.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I haven't tried uninstalling and reinstalling the C++software yet (as has been suggested in similar threads) as other users have reported it does not resolve the problem.<br />

            In my case this was caused by a conflict with Acer Proshield. I removed Acer Proshield and then the driver installed fine.<br />

<div><br />
<div>
<p>When did the problem start - did you recently add or remove any hardware or software from the system?</p>
<p>Start with this:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;<strong>Can</strong><span><strong>&nbsp;you
 upload the contents of c:\windows\minidump to&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>SkyDrive</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;and
 provide a link?</strong></span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span>Consider
 the following general guidance for dealing bluescreens. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Consider running chkdsk on all partitions. &nbsp;Let chkdsk complete on each partition and see if that helps.</p>
<p>Also consider running SFC /SCANNOW.</p>
<p>If you boot into safe mode, do you still experience bugchecks? What about if you do a&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean
 boot</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprohardware/thread/6115cb34-2890-46b5-8c1e-c934c56ecfe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">device
 clean boot</a>?</p>
<p>Consider testing memory with Windows Memory Diagnostic or memtest86. Note that memory that passes tests is not necessarily good memory - it just hasn't failed a test. &nbsp;Consider systematically eliminating RAM from the system - run with a couple of
 modules for a while, and see how things go. Then try the other modules.</p>
<p>Other common suggestions include ensuring drivers are up to date, as well as ensuring that you're using the latest BIOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be helpful to use Driver Verifier. &nbsp;To enable Driver Verifier... start-&gt;verifier.exe-&gt;OK-&gt;Create standard settings-&gt;Next-&gt;select driver names from a list-&gt;Next-&gt;sort by Provider-&gt;select all non-Microsoft drivers-&gt;Finish, and OK your way out
 of the dialog.</p>
<p>Then, reboot and use the system as you normally would, and wait for a problem. &nbsp;In the event that the system does not boot completely after enabling driver verifier, boot into Safe Mode and run driver verifier, and tell it to delete the changes.</p>
<p>Wait for a bugcheck to occur after enabling verifier as described, and then upload the dump to your SkyDrive, and provide a link.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>To see how to use BlueScreenView and MyEventViewer to troubleshoot Bluescreens see the methods<br />
indicated in this thread - top 3 replies.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/c675b7b8-795f-474d-a1c4-6b77b3fcd990" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/c675b7b8-795f-474d-a1c4-6b77b3fcd990</a><br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before these started? (Check<br />
Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there about the time this started)<br />
Main likely culprits are Video driver, other major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security<br />
products could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />
<br />
Use the troubleshooter below and refer to the next message for drivers and memory when you get to<br />
those sections and then return back to the troubleshooter as needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong><br />
<br />
The BCCode&nbsp;50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed<br />
hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM).</p>
<p>Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.</p>
<p>Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.</p>
Resolving the Problem
<p><em>Resolving a faulty hardware problem:</em> If hardware has been added to the system recently, remove it to see<br />
if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty component. You should run<br />
hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's<br />
manual for your computer.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a faulty system service problem:</em> Disable the service and confirm that this resolves the error. If so,<br />
contact the manufacturer of the system service about a possible update. If the error occurs during system<br />
startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at the character-mode menu that displays the operating system<br />
choices. At the resulting Windows <strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, choose the<strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong><br />
option. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</p>
<p><em>Resolving an antivirus software problem:</em> Disable the program and confirm that this resolves the error. If it<br />
does, contact the manufacturer of the program about a possible update.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a corrupted NTFS volume problem:</em> Run <strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong> to detect and repair disk errors. You must<br />
restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition. If the hard disk is SCSI, check for<br />
problems between the SCSI controller and the disk.</p>
<p>Finally, check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the<br />
device or driver that is causing the error. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS might also resolve it.<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer to see if anything is reported about those.<br />

<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Also do this so you can see the likely bluescreens.<br />
<br />
Windows Vista automatically restarts if your PC encounters an error that causes it to crash.<br />
(Windows 7 too)<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />

    <title>XBOX original 17th Anniversary Re-Release - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jazenox  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX original 17th Anniversary Re-Release</h2>
                    <p>Since we learned that XBOX original games will be in limited &amp; small numbers on XBOX&nbsp;ONE, S&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;X we are all disapointed already! As we learned the XBOX original DUKE&nbsp;CONTROLLER is being re-released we also MUST&nbsp;HAVE a XBOX original itself re-released with a better dvd drive that always reads/opens ect.). perhaps it would be more cost effective if Microsoft re-released as 17th Anniversary XBOX original much like Nintendo recently did with their old console (I would like to see this in 2018 sometime &amp; i would buy at least 2 of them (also the entire library of 800 plus games would play (not just the 70 to 150 we will get on XBOX&nbsp;ONE's if even that many! What do you guys think?</p>

 </blockquote> <p>there is no fuss (there is just a sigestion). indeed 17 years is a funny number but they are releasing XBOX&nbsp;ONE&nbsp;X on the 12/7/2017 so it goes nicely).&nbsp; a more logical release date for a re-released original XBOX would be the 20th anniversary of 11/15/2021 (this will complete 20 years of XBOX's as well &amp; would be a great way to celebrate). further more the real purpose of re-releasing the original XBOX is so we can have 100% of the 800 plus games playable without the need for backwards compatabilty and microsoft seeking licenses ect.). anyways many of us still game on XBOX original so we are happy about microsoft's effort with backwards compatable (it was a really nice gesture &amp; we appreciate but just give us the chance to own the old console again (i myself would buy 2 of them as i already own a new original XBOX that is more of collector's item than 1 i want to use alot). having a few more new 1's around would reduce wear &amp;&nbsp;tear so we can be playing for decad

 </blockquote> <p>let me help you understand the thinking of gamers who like backwards compatable games (or just older games in general). the desire to play older games is about good memories &amp; wanting to re-live that (it is also about wanting to re-visit the back-story of many of our favorite games series for example: HALO,. STAR&nbsp;WARS, TOMB&nbsp;RAIDER, ASSASSIN'S&nbsp;CREED, METAL&nbsp;GEAR&nbsp;SOLID to name a few). It is also about older hardware can age to the point your console or pc breaks down (you sometimes either need another console or pc or backwards compatable on newer machines). remember the games you love now will be old games one day soon (some people just live in the moment &amp; never look back &amp; this is ok but not ok for many of us). hope you understand the whole backwards &amp;&nbsp;retro gaming scene!</p>

 </blockquote> <p>that is another reason for backwards gaming (also as you say some people got the latest edition but missed some early back-story which was really important to them (sometimes games do not really have much of a story so it is more just curiosity and fun to see what the older games looked or played like! it is just a fraction of gamers who are into this (it is mostly die-hard gamers who are so into games they collect old games as well because they want to really have a grasp on anything they may have missed).</p>

 </blockquote> <p>i understand how you feel ElectroFlying (i have 4 original XBOX's &amp; only my newest 1 has no dvd tray/lazer issues but i still want at least 2 more XBOX's so i can play my library long into the future). this is why i would like to see a anniversary re-release of original XBOX but as you said a re-designed 1 that plays exactly the same (without the errors or at least the same xbox with a REALLY&nbsp;&nbsp;GOOD dvd drive! it is nice to see other XBOX gamers who like to hold onto the original consoles (there is tutorials on youtube as to how to fix those dvd drive errors (lazer alignment &amp; tray adjustments ect. but it is alot of work). because microsoft pulled original XBOX off the market so soon &amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we lost alot of our original DLC (also because the console had alot of error's microsoft owes us a re-release since backwards compatable requires so much work). i was thinking about the anniversary thing &amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it does indeed make more sense it should be the up comming

    <title>Windows 8.1 Update Bricked the ASUS Laptop 0xc0000225 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Update Bricked the ASUS Laptop 0xc0000225</h2>
                    <p>How do I fix my daughters barely used ASUS&nbsp;(X55U) Bricked BSoD laptop&nbsp;without buying a New Laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday (after MS `bricked` my daughters laptop [via the 8.1 updates]), I&nbsp;read of HUNDREDS of people having [the 0xc0000225 error]DESTRUCTION Bricking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it was the Windows 8.1 updates that caused it as&nbsp;we didn`t ask for Windows 10 on her laptop. I have no interest in it for my youngsters 2014 Laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My daughters ASUS&nbsp; 2014 `Windows 8`&nbsp;laptop (became W8.1 last summer [the last time any W8.1 `updates` were successful]) is now BRICKED after&nbsp;I again attempted&nbsp;a normal W8.1 `Windows UPDATE` (to W8.1 `Security [etc]` updates) just 2 days ago (for the first
 time in many&nbsp;months [there were over 100 "ESSENTIAL" updates on the Microsoft W8.1 Update settings]&nbsp;where I had not looked&nbsp;deeply into whether Windows 10 was trying to secretly worm its way onto it [where I and my daughter have no interest in Windows 10 `alleged
 spyware` being on her PC]), and it&nbsp;got stuck for many hours (no spinning icon/Nothing/Dead/Frozen); then (after 4 hours of inaction), when it was re-booted the laptop is now a constant `0xc0000225 F8 Blue Screen of Death`. IMPOSSIBLE TO GET PAST.</p>
<p>We called ASUS, (as there is a RECOVERY PARTITION), but after an HOUR of them trying to help (the usual fix procedures), they (essentially) said the laptop is bricked: "Send it in for `pay for&nbsp;Repairs`".</p>
<p>We would have to pay more than the current&nbsp;value of the laptop to get it fixed now.</p>
<p>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</p>
<p>I cant even get a Windows 8 Disc to boot/repair on it. NOTHING WORKS ON IT.</p>
<p>Thanks Bill &amp; Co.</p>
<p>A plague on your house.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Separately, my 2007 Dual Core 2007 Toshiba&nbsp;2007 laptop had zero problems updating from Vista to Windows 8,&nbsp;(then to Windows 8.1), then to&nbsp;W10. Its lower spec than my daughters Xmas 2014 laptop. So HARDWARE should not be an issue for a Modern laptop with
 higher specs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Separately again; Windows 8 used to BSoD&nbsp;my other Toshiba&nbsp;Windows 7 (2012) i7&nbsp;laptop every single time the Number-Keypad was touched after I paid to UPGRADE to Windows 8 from Windows 7.
</p>
<p>EVENTUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYY W8.1 fixed that. But it was EXTREMELY MADDENING in the meantime; as for weeks I was not sure how it was happening.. (accidentally brushing the laptop number-keys).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, there may be hardware issues; but any&nbsp;Update should be IMPOSSIBLE to do if there are likely to be issues. As for my childs laptop; she has learned that you cannot trust Microsoft; Ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT</p>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p>I cloned the failed Windows 8.1 drive contents to an SSD, and can look through the windows system and files no problem on a different PC; so no data is lost. But the laptop .... Sheesh... What can I do to fix it?</p>

<p>I decided to update my Dell 7737 to Win10 from 8.1. &nbsp;I did a full backup, then ran the update. &nbsp;The update went flawlessly and I spent the better part of a day checking out the new features. So for so good. &nbsp;I actually liked Win 10 very much because it was

<p>Yesterday (after MS `bricked` my daughters laptop), I&nbsp;read of HUNDREDS of people having [the 0xc0000225 error]DESTRUCTION Bricking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn`t ask for Windows 10. I have no interest in it for my youngsters 2014 Laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My daughters ASUS&nbsp; 2014 `Windows 8`&nbsp;laptop (became W8.1 last summer [the past time any updates were successful]) is now BRICKED after&nbsp;I again attempted&nbsp;a normal W8.1 `Windows UPDATE` (to W8.1 updates) just 2 days ago (for the first time in many&nbsp;months [there
 were over 100 "ESSENTIAL" updates on the Microsoft W8.1 Update settings]&nbsp;where I had not looked&nbsp;deeply into whether Windows 10 was trying to secretly worm its way onto it [where I and my daughter have no interest in Windows 10 spyware on her PC]), and it&nbsp;got
 stuck for many hours (no spinning icon/Nothing/Dead/Frozen); then (after 4 hours of inaction), when it was re-booted the laptop is now a constant F8 Blue Screen of Death. IMPOSSIBLE TO GET PAST.</p>
<p>We called ASUS, (as there is a RECOVERY PARTITION), but after an HOUR of them trying to help (the usual fix procedures), they (essentially) said the laptop is bricked: "Send it in for `pay for&nbsp;Repairs`".</p>
<p>We would have to pay more than the current&nbsp;value of the laptop to get it fixed now.</p>
<p>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</p>
<p>I cant even get a Windows 8 Disc to boot/repair on it.</p>
<p>Thanks Bill &amp; Co.</p>
<p>A plague on your house.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Separately, my 2007 Dual Core 2007 Toshiba&nbsp;2007 laptop had zero problems updating from Vista to Windows 8,&nbsp;(then to Windows 8.1), then to&nbsp;W10. Its lower spec than my daughters Xmas 2014 laptop. So HARDWARE should not be an issue for a Modern laptop with
 higher specs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Separately again; Windows 8 used to BSoD&nbsp;my other Toshiba&nbsp;Windows 7 (2012) i7&nbsp;laptop every single time the Number-Keypad was touched after I paid to UPGRADE to Windows 8 from Windows 7.
</p>
<p>EVENTUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYY W8.1 fixed that. But it was EXTREMELY MADDENING in the meantime; as for weeks I was not sure how it was happening.. (accidentally brushing the laptop number-keys).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, there may be hardware issues; but any&nbsp;Update should be IMPOSSIBLE to do if there are likely to be issues. As for my childs laptop; she has learned that you cannot trust Microsoft; Ever.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for the effort... But maybe you didn`t read that the Laptop in question DID NOT BOOT UP. So; using the ASUS suggestion is pointless, as the Laptop has to be running to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also: the Original Windows 8 Install is Japanese (we live in Asia), and you CANNOT download Windows 8/8.1 in Japanese from Microsoft or its subsidiaries for free. Everywhere else can have it, but we don`t have it here (we would have to buy a full copy).</p>
<p>The ASUS Laptop in question is Base-Japanese (Kanji) with English makeover. Also; the English "BOOTABLE" version has always never worked on Japanese Windows installs (due to the Kanji base). Conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also; we have NO INTEREST IN INSTALLING WINDOWS 10 on the laptop in question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your efforts in the post; and the other links which are useful.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for the effort... <strong>But maybe you didn`t read that the Laptop in question DID NOT BOOT UP</strong>.
<strong>So; using the ASUS suggestion is pointless, as the Laptop has to be running to do that.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also: the Original Windows 8 Install is Japanese (we live in Asia), and you CANNOT download Windows 8/8.1 in Japanese from Microsoft or its subsidiaries for free. Everywhere else can have it, but we don`t have it here (we would have to buy a full copy).</p>
<p>The ASUS Laptop in question is Base-Japanese (Kanji) with English makeover. Also; the English "BOOTABLE" version has always never worked on Japanese Windows installs (due to the Kanji base). Conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Also; we have NO INTEREST IN INSTALLING WINDOWS 10 on the laptop in question.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your efforts in the post; and the other links which are useful.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 pro to Windows 10 pro VL &#47; Educational Licensing model</h2>
                    I have 50 Lenovo T430 laptops with Windows 7 pro OEM. I am re-purposing these laptops to use in a different area of the school. I wish to upgrade them to Windows 10 pro for up to date security.<br />
Currently, we have a volume licensing contract and can order the Windows 10 Professional licenses via VL. I wish to create a Windows 10 image to deploy. Will the VL edition of Windows 10 pro image successfully, and activate, with the existing Win 7 pro keys?

<h2>            New Surface Pro i7 battery life</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased my Surface pro 17 with 8Gb Ram and 256 Gb SSD, the battery life is around 5 hours 30 min to 6 hours with normal use, is this normal ? I was really hoping it to be around 8-9 hours if not 13.5, this is a deal broker for me as was SP4.
</p>
<p>1. Can something be done to improve the battery life ?</p>
<p>2. If not then is the i5 version has more battery life than i7 and by how much?</p>
