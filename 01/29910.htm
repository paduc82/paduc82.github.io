    <title>Connecting with Ethernet. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justlnsane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting with Ethernet.</h2>
                    
<p>Ok basically i want to connect my xbox with a ethernet cord, but my xbox is in my room(upstairs) and my router/computer is downstairs. So using a cord to connect them would probably not work or might be too much work. I want to use a wired connection because
 im lagging/dropping out of games frequently. i have read about ethernet power adapters, to connect one to my xbox and into the wall and the other plug into my router and into the wall. Im not sure these will work though? and what ones people would recommend?
 there also quite expensive, so is there any other option to do this? Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi there. You are talking about using your powerlines as the cables to connect the two pieces of equipment. There are loads of horror stories, but to be honest they are mostly in the realm of urban myth than modern reality. Not sure which country you are
 in but if you are in the UK ebuyer.com (have branched in the US I think) have what you are looking for. They are Quickfind Code: 160665. his particular model has 65 reviews with some helpful info contained in them. Havent used them myself but know a lot of
 people who swer by them. Just make sure you have enough ethernet connections on your router for both the PC and a second piece, i.e. you x-box. Hope this helps :D</p>

<p>This is my problem :</p>
<p>I have an xbox360 In my room upstairs and my router/modem is downstairs. Now whenever someone logs onto the ps3 which is also downstairs it will sign out my xbox, than sign out the ps3 and when u connect again it works for both... Also someone can't be on
 there iPod on YouTube if someone is on xbox/ps3 or both because it lags the game really bad.
</p>
<p>Is there anyway I can stop this disconnecting and use the iPod and xbox at the sametime? My router is a piece of **** trendnet g router, which might be the problem. Should I get a new router ( N )? Should I make a static ip for my xbox? Thanks</p>
<p>Because I don't no I'd connecting with a Ethernet cable is an option ( or a really tough one to do).</p>

<p>Some routers have a setting that allows you to add more than one dynamic IP assigned at a time but you have to manually go into the software to do this. I only know from reading the FAQs as I am struggling to set up my network myself.
</p>
<p>My advice is to get a new router if yours does not support the latest g thing that allows you all to access to router with no lag. I use ebuyer and read the reviews. This often gives you more knowledge than reading the router info.
</p>
<p>So if you are lagging you either have to update your drivers (not likely to help) or get a new router. Sorry there is no magic fix. If the problem is in the bandwidth (lagging) and in the IP address going the wired route is not likely to help :(</p>

Device bans are not issued lightly, and occur when a particular Xbox console or Xbox on Windows device is used to violate the Code of Conduct in an egregious or repeated manner. Once a device ban occurs, no account can connect to the Xbox Live service from
 the affected device. Given the severity of this action we take each device ban extremely seriously, and only take action after a lengthy investigation.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Devices can be banned from Xbox Live for a number of reasons, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xbox console tampering, such as physically opening an Xbox console and modifying it to play illegitimate or unauthorized software</li><li>Online fraud, such as phishing, account theft, or other attempts to defraud Microsoft or other players</li><li>Repeated egregious violations of the Microsoft Services Agreement that establish a clear pattern of nefarious activity</li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Please note that banning an Xbox console or Xbox on Windows device does not disrupt the underlying functionality of the device, and it can continue to be used offline following the ban.

Notifications
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Upon receiving a device ban, any account that attempts to sign in to the Xbox Live service will receive a notification. The specific content of the notification depends on the type of device that received the ban.</p>

Frequently Asked Questions
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<span>Are all device bans permanent?</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
All Xbox Live device bans are permanent. However, some Code of Conduct violations that don’t rise to the level of a device ban can instead result in the temporary loss of specific Xbox One or Xbox on Windows device privileges. When this occurs, the device can
 still connect to Xbox Live, but certain functionality (such as communications or online multiplayer) will be restricted for a particular duration.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<span>If my Xbox on Windows device is banned, does that mean I can’t use that Windows 10 device anymore?</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
When a Windows 10 device is banned, the device will no longer be able to connect to the Xbox Live service. This includes use of the Xbox app and associated features. However, the Microsoft Account can continue to sign in to that Windows 10 device and use other
 apps and features online.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<span>How do you detect modified Xbox consoles?</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
There are many factors that lead to the ban of a console. However, in the interest of security and privacy we do not publicly disclose investigative methods.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<span>My device has been banned. Does that mean my Xbox Live account will be suspended as well?</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
The scope of any enforcement action is determined by looking at a number of factors, including the nature and severity of the violation and previous enforcement history. In some cases an account suspension may accompany a device ban, but it is not guaranteed.
 To avoid receiving an account suspension make sure to follow the Microsoft Code of Conduct.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<span>Can I still be banned if I purchased an Xbox console second-hand?</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Yes. The warranty on a second-hand Xbox console is void, and the purchaser assumes the risk for any previous modifications or unauthorized activity. Even if the console’s ownership has changed, the console may still be subject to a ban. If you purchase a console
 that has been previously banned you will not be able to connect to Xbox Live, and the ban will not be lifted as a result of the change in ownership. We recommend customers who believe they have not committed actions on the service to warrant a ban to contact
 previous owners or users of the console.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
If you have purchased or intend to purchase a second-hand Xbox 360, you can check its current ban status by entering its serial number into the&nbsp;<a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/Home/ConsoleCheck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Console
 Check Tool</a>. Please note that the current absence of a ban does not preclude the possibility of future enforcement action.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<span>If I have a banned device, can I still access my achievements and content?</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
If your account has not been suspended, you may still sign in to other Xbox consoles and Xbox on Windows devices. This includes accessing your purchased content and your profile, including achievements, as they existed prior to the device ban.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<span>Can I move my Xbox 360 hard drive or Xbox One external storage to another console?</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Yes. When a device ban occurs the hard drive remains functional. You can continue to use it offline, and may move it to a console that has not received a ban.</p>

<p>Hey there Rqrq, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are running into this problem. Now when you are trying to play online on your game are you receiving an error message stating that "Your console is banned..." If it is that your console is banned you should still be able to play your games
 while <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/using-xbox-one-offline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Offline</a>. </p>
<p>Of course as stated, these device bans are not issued lightly and occur when a particular Xbox console or Xbox on Windows device is used to violate the Code of Conduct in an egregious or repeated manner.
</p>
<p>I would advise going onto the <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Enforcement website</a> and logging into different accounts to see if there is any enforcement actions within your accounts.
</p>

            Thats so messed up. No one should have to go through this. A multi account rigirous enforcment action should be tooken against the console not a one profile thing i think all these issues will get resolved if we all just get a ps4 . Emforcement team have
 overall power over a persons gaming life and theres no way to contact them regarding things like this 😂😂not s simple “why” or “how”just a “screw yo, get a nintendo switch or a ps4”&nbsp;

            Purchase a USB card reader. They are very inexpensive, around $20. Plug the USB card reader into your computer and put your camera's SD card into the reader. Windows will see it as just another removable drive and you can copy your pictures from the camera
 card to your Pictures directory.

<br />
How do I change the download settings so that a file (e.g., pdf) which I download from a website not only is saved in the "Download" folder, but also spawns so I can see it immediately?<br />
<br />
Thank you.

            Teen geek is correct.&nbsp; Both cannot be done at the same time.&nbsp; You can Run the program and see it immediately (but then it is not saved).&nbsp; You can save the program to Downloads (or anywhere else you choose - I usually select the Desktop and move it to Downloads
 when I'm done with it), but then you need to go to it to execute the program and open it.&nbsp; It's your choice which you prefer.&nbsp; I also like to save my downloads (just in case) so I never use the Run command.&nbsp; I too would like to have what you're trying to do.<br />
<br />
I have experienced some downloads that actually opened once they were saved automatically (usually program files) but those were exceptions and I had no control over what happened (except to cancel the opening instead of hitting OK to continue).<br />
<br />
What you want to do sounds like a nice feature for the OS to have as an option - you should submit it to Microsoft as a suggestion (though they get many thousands of suggestions so chances aren't good it will be seen but it might - they do take some of them).<br />
<br />
Good luck!

You can't. You'll have to open it normally.

<h2>            Dark Souls&#58; &#38;quot&#59;Your Multiplayer Privileges are blocked. Unable to Access Network Play. Game Will start in Offline mode&#38;quot&#59; message.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I get on Dark Souls and right when it gets to the menu screen it says "Your Multiplayer Privileges are blocked. Unable to Access Network Play. Game Will start in Offline mode."</p>
<p>I had no problem when I started playing the game when i 1st got it. My console is not mod, I don't use profanity or break any rules. In fact, I don't even game online but my profile is sign in live each time I on the console.</p>
<p>Hope to get some reply.</p>
<p>Tks,</p>

<p>When you first connect to XBL you're entitled to a free month of membership. Hence why you were able to do and see multiplayer related stuff in Dark Souls (Bloodstains, messages, invasions all that jazz) without actually stumping up for a membership. Since
 that month ran out you can no longer see all the stuff you were seeing while you were gold because your account has defaulted to freebie silver.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As for bloodstain messages there's two types of them in Dark Souls. Player made ones which you can only see if you're online &amp; have a gold membership and tutorial ones you'll see dotted around the Undead Asylum and parts of the Firelink Shrine which'll always
 be there. Player made ones are marked with a skull in the text box that pops up when you read them while tutorial ones are marked with a knight's helm. These are not to be confused with bloodstains that show the deaths of other players.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Huge problem with ufc undisputed 3 </h2>
                    So recently my save file became corrupted which I have found to be a common issue, and a new save file for ufc 3 was created. When this happened it deleted the updates for the game and changed the characters stats back to their original levels. Now when
 I attempt to join friends online games it will not let me connect because our downloaded stats are of a different version. This message appears and I am sent back to the title screen. That's the problem, the solution is re-releasing the updates. I called xbox
 support on Friday and we tried to solve the issue but we could not do anything. He assured me I could have some luck if I posted on the forums. I am 100% sure I'm not the only person having this issue, and all of us would highly appreciate the effort. I told
 another bummed ufc player that I would get solve this issue for the community so please Xbl support make me an honest man. Somewhere in the xbox database the updates must exist, please xbox have one of your engineers take the ti

<p>Hi&nbsp;Fitz,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about the UFC troubles. Let's see if we can make you an honest man. : )<br />
<br />
<strong>Where are you storing your saved data?</strong> I'm thinking if you store the data in the "Cloud", we can avoid this corruption going forward.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Do you know if the other experiencing this issue are storing locally or in the cloud?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</strong>Let us know, and we can go from there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I store locally I'm assuming others also do. The problem lies in the lack of update being available. The last update that was released needs to be re-released so all of the characters stats are where they should be which would allow me to play with friends.my
 old save file is completely off my xbox and so is any update associated with it. When the file became corrupted and I signed into the game it made me create a new save in place of the old one. The same happened to others who are experiencing this same problem

<p>Hey there Fitz,<br />
<br />
Since the company that published the game has gone under and sold the licenses to EA Sports, there is slim chance of a patch or update release for this title.<br />
<br />
With the rerate of fighters stats, I would recommend:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete the game </li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear your system cache</a>
</li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/view-download-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Redownload the game</a>.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
<br />
If your save file became corrupt then I'm sorry to have to say but that data is no longer available.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please let us know if those steps get the fighters stats to show properly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I spoke to the xbox representative we went through your suggested steps , and no luck. To me this is how I think this should work. Thq gave xbox the update and xbox posted the update. I assume somewhere xbox has the last update in its database. Xbox
 needs to re-release the update it doesn't seem difficult to me. That's the only thing that is going to fix this game . I don't get why you can't release something you did at an earlier date . Doesn't that make sense ?</p>

<p>Hey Fitz,<br />
<br />
I understand where you're coming from and I know you're anxious to get back playing with your friends.<br />
<br />
Since the patch is handled by the publisher THQ, they would be the ones to contact about it. You can use this link to reach
<a href="http://www.thq.com/us/go/cmspage/contact_us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">THQ Customer Service</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
They announced that they have a patch in the works but that was around 4 months ago. EA Sports has absorbed the license to UFC so it might also be a good idea to contact their
<a href="https://help.ea.com/?sso_redirect=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Customer Support</a>&nbsp;though I feel that THQ would be a better avenue to pursue.</p>

<p>The installer requires more data to be downloaded </p>

<p>Translation: Whatever you're trying to install, your machine needs some other updates to be installed first.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Run the SFC /SCANNOW command</b>:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This will check and repair if necessary any critical Windows system files prior to installing SP1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Click on Start/All programs/Accessories then </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Right-click</b> on Command Prompt option and select 'Run as administrator'.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>At the command prompt enter: <b><i>SFC /SCANNOW</i></b></p>
<p>`~`</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Rename the 'Software Distribution folder'</b>:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>a) Click the Start Button, click 'All programs, and click on 'Accessories'.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>b) Next <b>Right-click</b> on the 'Command Prompt' option and then click 'Run as administrator'.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>c) In the 'Command Prompt' window enter: <b><i>net stop Wuauserv</i></b> and press the 'Enter' key.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>d) Next click the Start/Orb button in the taskbar, in the 'Search' box, enter:
<b><i>%windir%</i></b> and press the 'Enter' key.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>e) In Windows Explore view, search for and locate the folder named "SoftwareDistribution".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>f) <b>Right-click</b> on the folder and select the 'Rename' option and change the name to:

</p>
<p>g) Close Windows Explorer and in Command Prompt window enter: <b><i>net start Wuauserv</i></b> and press the 'Enter' key.</p>

<p>j) Reboot</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Try manually downloading and installing the problem update - The first thing I would do is make sure you are using Internet Explorer as your browser, at l<span><span><font><font>ə</font></font></span></span>ast for this download.

<p><span><br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. We appreciate your interest on Windows 10.<br />
I understand the inconvenience that you are facing. We are glad to help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to enable the built-in administrator account and then check if you are able to create and view the new user account.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open a elevated Command Prompt. To do this, press Windows key + X key together and choose Command Prompt (Admin).<br />
b. In the Command Prompt window, type net user administrator /active:yes and press Enter.<br />
c. Now, sign-out from your account and then, choose Administrator (built-in) account to logon to this account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, from the built-in administrator account, try creating a new user account and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. Feel free to get back to us for further queries. We will be happy to assist.</span></p>

            <p>Call yourself an support engineer, I would be surprised if you can support yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your advice managed to lock me out of my computer for almost an hour, time&nbsp;which I will never get back and I hold you totally responsible for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no the advise did not resolve the primary issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your advice to the letter which now I see was like leading lambs to the slaughter house.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I signed out of my account.............Windows spent ages setting up this new admin account (which you failed to mention) and when it was ready it&nbsp;had a fundamental flaw.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTHING WORKED NO BUTTON IN THE CORNER NOTHING AFTER SPENDING AGES TRYING ALL SORTS OF KEYS TO FIND SHORTCUTS,&nbsp;EVENTUALLY I PRESSED THE POWER BUTTON. THE COMPUTER SHUTS DOWN.......... PRESS THE POWER BUTTON TO SWITCH ON AND HEY PRESTO LIKE MAJIC THERE I
 WAS BACK IN THE USER ACCOUNT WHERE NOTHING WORKS...........I TRIED AND TRIED BUT EVERY TIME I WAS LOGGED INTO THE SAME ACCOUNT WHERE NOTHING WORKS..........I CONTINUED TO PRESS EVERYTHING EVENTUALLY AND&nbsp;AN NOT EVEN SURE WHAT I PRESSED I GOT THERE USER ACCOUNTS.......SO
 AGAINST THE SMART ALEC ADVISE OF WINDOWS I ADDED A USER PASSWORD&nbsp;TO THIS STUPID ACCOUNT&nbsp;THAT DOESENT WORK THE ONE YOU HELPED&nbsp;ME CREATE SO IT WOULDENT LOG ME IN AUTOMATICALLY.........EVENTUALLY AFTER THIS I WAS ABLE TO LOG BACK INTO MY OWN USER ACCOUNT.........................</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time you take to your keyboard to give&nbsp;)(*&amp;*&amp;)*&amp;% advice just think just a bit more&nbsp;because the advise you typed above&nbsp;is not only bad it wastes other peoples time, causes stress and doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder how the other people got on with this advice, maybe they still locked out of the computer!</p>

<p>i forgot to make a recovery partition on my dell laptop, my dell laptop now is hanging and freezing so i decided to repair and refresh it but some files are missing. So i find a friend that have windows 8 on it. i make one recovery partition&nbsp;media on his
 acer laptop. Now&nbsp;I try to use it on my dell laptop for refreshing it and fully clean it after waiting for more than 5 hours my dell&nbsp;laptop&nbsp;is now working but my&nbsp;problem is that&nbsp;the acer drive is now install on it.&nbsp;All on the acer laptop files like his&nbsp;acer
 back up, acer recovery, acer usb,&nbsp;acer update and&nbsp;all about acer is on it.&nbsp;i delete or uninstall all the files&nbsp;of acer and download and install&nbsp;the dell drives.
<br />
<br />
Is there anything wrong when using another partition from another brand like acer and use it on dell manufactured laptop? they are all the same operating system in windows 8.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks. i deleted all the acer that install on it and try to download all dell drives.</p>

            The Win 8.1 update KILLS ALL Bluetooth Audio drivers as well as Intel Bluetooth drivers! I've got the same issue. Device Manager indicates the error and there is no later driver yet. I guess you (and I and everyone else) must wait for Microsoft to address
 this (and many other) Win 8.1 upgrade issues... :(

            Hey, I searched &amp; found out that I have to install the Win 8 drivers even though I'm using 8.1
<div>At least for now.&nbsp;</div>
<div>8.1's drivers for my laptop aren't available for all the things.</div>
<div>So, 8's driver for Bluetooth &amp; new 8.1's driver for Audio.</div>
<div>So, I did. And, it worked. Same as before now.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest U do the same, unless the 8.1 drivers for your device are already available.</div>
<div>Cheers.</div>

<h2>            Does 82865G support DirectX 9&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Hello, All!</strong></p>
<p>I've Windows 7 Ultimate and have downloaded Windows Live Movie Maker 2011. It's not supporting my directX 9 version I think. You can see this here:</p>
<p><a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-2011-system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/windows-live-2011-system-requirements</a></p>
<p>But When I saw my DirectX model, it looks me 9 version. You can see this in photo. I find this by<strong>dxdiag</strong> command. You can see
<strong>DDI Version.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/4708/41445391.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/4708/41445391.png</a></p>
<p>So question is that have I not DirectX 9.0 in my PC or it's included but has not its drivers?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Look at the Video Driver date which very old 4-1-2006 so it needs to be updated.<br />
<br />
According to Intel Downloads there are no Windows 7 drivers for that chipset.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;DwnldID=18576&amp;ProdId=1044&amp;lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;DwnldID=18576&amp;ProdId=1044&amp;lang=eng</a></p>
<p><a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/SearchResult.aspx?lang=eng&amp;ProductFamily=Graphics&amp;ProductLine=Desktop+graphics+controllers&amp;ProductProduct=Intel%c2%ae+82865G+Graphics+and+Memory+Controller+Hub+(GMCH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://downloadcenter.intel.com/SearchResult.aspx?lang=eng&amp;ProductFamily=Graphics&amp;ProductLine=Desktop+graphics+controllers&amp;ProductProduct=Intel%c2%ae+82865G+Graphics+and+Memory+Controller+Hub+(GMCH</a>)<br />
<br />
So you could disable the on-board video and use an add-in video card that has the features you need.<br />
<br />
Wish there was better news.</p>
