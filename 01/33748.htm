<h2>            Windows 7 Versions</h2>
                    <p>How much difference or benefit is there in regard to&nbsp;security, language package availability, and extras between Windows 7 Pro 64 Bit and Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I add the extra items on Ultimate to an installation of Pro, by downloading them on
 a Microsoft Site, since Windows 7 is an older version,and Microsoft is now promoting Windows 8?&nbsp; Just curious, as I specifically need Window 7 64 bit for new audio/engineering software.&nbsp; I would like to have the best Microsoft security, language versatility,
 and multimedia features, after I change OS.&nbsp; I am aware of 34 Bit to 64 bit installation issues, as the community has helped me in that area recently.</p>

</p><p>As a reference, with Windows 7 Ultimate, you can take advantage of the following features that are not available in Windows 7 Professional:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * DirectAccess: Give mobile users seamless access to corporate networks without a need to VPN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * BranchCache: Decrease the time branch office users spend waiting to download files across the network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Federated Search: Find information in remote repositories, including SharePoint sites, with a simple user interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; * BitLocker and BitLocker To Go: Help protect data on PCs and removable drives, with manageability to enforce encryption and backup of recovery keys.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * AppLocker: Specify what software is allowed to run on a user’s PCs through centrally managed but flexible Group Policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) optimizations: Improved user experience for VDI with multimon and microphone support, which have the ability to reuse virtual hard drive (VHD) images to boot a physical PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Multilingual user interface: Create a single OS image for deployment to users worldwide.</p>
<p>* DVD Codec, Media Center, Subsystem fo UNIX</p>
<p>
</p><p>Security wise, there is not much difference between Windows 7 Professional and Ultimate, in fact, they are both the same. The features listed above are what separates the two functionality wise.

<p>
</p><p>If you need Ultimate, you will need to purchase a retail upgrade license and use the product key from the package with Anytime Upgrade wizard in Windows 7 Professional to upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate. Anytime Upgrade online purchases are no longer available.</p>

<h3> kebabs35  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changed microsoft account password but system restore only recognizes old password in windows 10</h2>
                    I have windows 10 on my computer which you now need your password to use system restore. I have just changed my microsoft account password as i suspected that someone has been using system restore without my permission which is causing problems with a
 &nbsp;security programme im using so it doesn't work properly. &nbsp;After changing the password my computer asked me to log in with the new password and i also changed it for my email. &nbsp;The only issue is that i checked to see if the new password worked in system restore
 but it says that it doesn't recognize it but i can still use my old password which obviously i dont want to use. &nbsp;Everything else seems to work ok with the new password. &nbsp;Can anyone help with this.

            <p>Hello Kebabs,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. I will certainly help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There could be several reasons for causing this issue such as corrupted user account, third-party application conflict or virus infection. Let’s work together to get this problem resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the above troubleshooter doesn’t help, then try method 2.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>

The laptop is connected to the internet on a regular daily basis, often for 5 hours or so in&nbsp; a session. Surely this is ample time to find updates. There has been no change in my usage that might explain this as far as I know.

<p>Windows Update became afflicted around the July 2016 time frame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some users in the community figured out how to get WU working again, Microsoft decided to create a KB article about it which you can see in this link:</p>

            Thanks for the advice. I followed the steps outlined by ElderN and so far seems to have helped. It is (slowly) downloading 22 updates....but it's been a long time since last summer.

            Thanks very much for your help. Apparently I already had KB3020369, but not the KB3176205. That has successfully been installed and the machine is now downloading a further 22 updates. Looks like being a long night. Thanks again.

    <title>Windows Experience Index File Corruption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> microkiller66  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Experience Index File Corruption</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>FYI: I am running Windows 7: Ultimate, 32 bit</p>
<p>I just updated my video card driver, and now Windows Experience Index is asking me to rerun the assessment to update my base score. I click on the button to run the update, it gets most of the way through (Like 2/3's of the way through) until it reaches
 the portion where it reads "Tuning Windows Media Decoding" and the assessment freezes, quits, and delivers to me and error message that reads: "Could not measure video playback performance".</p>
<p>
</p><p>From clicking and googling I have discovered that two of the video files WEI uses to test video performance are either corrupted or damaged. When individually attempting to play them in Windows Media Player they have both failed to play and displayed error
 messages. The two files are:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">"Clip_480_5sec_6mbps_h264.mp4" This file played for three seconds, then stopped and returned the error message reading: "Windows Media Player encountered a problem while playing the file."</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">"Clip_480p_5sec_6mbps_new.mpg" This file never began playing and returned the same error message reading: "Windows Media Player encountered a problem while playing the file."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) UPDATE DRIVERS: Yes, I am 100% sure all my drivers are updated, and that i have not installed any codecs that have not come with Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) INSTALL UPDATES: Yes, I am 100% sure my computer is completely up to date, and that if I run Windows Update or restart my computer it will do nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) RUN SFC: I have run the System File Checker (The command promt "sfc /scannow") four times. It returns the results that it found corrupted files and were unable to fix/replace them. See end of post for a copy of the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) RUN FORMAL TEST: I have run a formal assessment of Windows Experience Index (The command prompt "winsat formal") three times, and it too, upon examination, stated that the same two files listed above had some kind of issue. The errors stated were different,
 but present nonetheless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have also included the winSAT test log (C:\Windows\Performance\WinSAT\winsat.log) which also included some error messages.</p>

</p><p>Is it possible to receive these files from Microsoft and just replace them?</p>
<p>If I remove the files from the winSAT folder (C:\Windows\Performance\WinSAT) can I run the test successfully?</p>
<p>Noting that an error message above involved codecs, is there one I should have installed to perform this test?</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do to fix this?</p>

<p>If you ctrl-alt-del and choose switch user, you'll notice you are logged in. Then clicking on your user again, the Windows activation error screen comes back but for me flickered crazy with another weird window.</p>

            <p>It is malware. I ran system restore and went back to a recent restore point. It didnt remove the malware files but let windows open up again.</p>
<p>Run rkill to stop any malware processes running, then use malwarebytes to remove the files.</p>

            <p>Rkill is a good program I've used for years that stops malware <strong>processes.</strong></p>
<p>You'll need to stop any running processes so that you are able to have normal computer functions back so you can use antivirus software effectively.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find it at&nbsp;http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/rkill.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>Malwarebytes anti-malware is just my personal favorite antivirus program. I feel it does the best job and finds the most junk you want to get rid of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can grab your free copy (limited functionality but all that you will need to fix this and more issues) at&nbsp;https://www.malwarebytes.com/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are able to actually get into windows, you will run rkill and let it terminate what it wants. Then run malwarebytes and make sure it's updated and then do a scan. When it finishes, look through what it found and make sure some of them aren't things
 you actually want. Trainers for video games are often reported as malware but you know where they came from and what they're doing so you'd want to keep those in that case. Quarantine everything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you finish that process, restart your computer and do it once more (rkill then malwarebytes) and make sure nothing came back and that it really is all quarantined. Sometimes you have to remove things manually yourself, including registry entries (as

    <title>Windows 10 and network drive issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pulpocangrejo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and network drive issues</h2>
                    <p>For years Windows has had a chronic problem with reconnecting to network drives at startup, despite checking the box&nbsp; to "Reconnect at Logon"
</p>
<p>I had 1 Windows 8 laptop that could only see my NAS&nbsp; as a Media Server.</p>
<p>I've dealt with this by using a 3rd party tool called&nbsp; Netdrives. I consider it absurd that a 3rd party app is required to make Windows function as it should.
</p>
<p>I see in this forum and elsewhere that people are having some trouble with mapping Network drives. Posts dating back to January state people having issues, and apparently there is a security change in that Windows 10 requires Secure logins to a drive.
</p>
<p>I have no problem with that. I just don't want to get my blood pressure up trying to fix something that shouldn't be broken in the first place .
</p>
<p>What is the status of Windows 10 with regard to Network drives and NAS? Are people having trouble? Did MS finally fix this issue? I'd love to hear what your experiences are.</p>

            <p>That's odd, When I did the /query after a reboot it opened another window and listed loads of things.</p>
<p>I've since done /reset and now after another reboot nothing happens when doing /query. I also noticed considerable slowdown of my PC when it was supposed to be running so I think something was happening.

<p>

            Hi,
<br />Via <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4467702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4467702</a>
<br />
<br />After installing this update, some users cannot set Win32 program defaults for certain app and file type combinations using the Open with… command or Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default apps.
<br />
<br />In some cases, Microsoft Notepad or other Win32 programs cannot be set as the default.	
<br />In some cases, attempting to set application defaults again will succeed.
<br />
<br />Microsoft is working on a resolution and estimates a solution will be available in late November 2018.
<br />
<br />If you have 1803, please check for updates-the latest patch resolves this.

            Hi NK1966 
<br />
<br />Setting File Associations in Windows 10 is now impossible, a lot of users are reporting this at the moment, this seems to be a bug in Windows 10 since the last update.
<br />
<br />Microsoft are working hard to patch the bugs in the last couple of updates, this is one of the bugs they are working on and this should be resolved shortly
<br />
<br />Please provide feedback to the Windows Developers on this bug, press Windows Key + F to open the Feedback Hub, the more users that report this, the quicker it will be resolved . . .       
        </p>

<p>Thanks for the info. However, update KB4467682 did not resolve the issue. This is what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Installed update KB4467682 (checking for updates picked it up automatically)</p>
<p>* Restarted the Computer</p>
<p>* Set file associations to my preferred programs</p>
<p>* Restarted the Computer again</p>
<p>* All file associations are reset again to Microsoft apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop's OS build info. is given below:</p>

    <title>Downloading Patch 5.0.4 for WoW MoP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ma_bear42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Downloading Patch 5.0.4 for WoW MoP</h2>
                    So I'm having issues with the downloading of the newest patch for WoW MoP. I have already contacted the game's customer support but they are virtually useless. So I was wondering if anyone here could help me. When I try to download the patch, the in game
 text box says, "failed to download information about the newest patch. Please check your network connection and try again." I'm wondering if this has anything to do with my Windows 7 in general. I have a perfect internet connection at my house and my firewall
 and administrative rights all check out just fine to give the launcher a go ahead to download.&nbsp;
<div><br />
Is the issue with my PC itself, with my internet connection, or with Blizzard's newest game patch that came out Monday? ANY help would be MOST appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Best regards.</div>
                </div>

<p>it seem to be faulty patch. I am also facing the same issue. And the games customer support is useless. I uninstalled the game, I lost my precious time by talking to the Customer support.</p>

<h2>            Touchpad&#58; LOST OPTION to Disable the Touchpad when a Mouse is Connected</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am giving the Microsoft Community a serious challenge to solve my problem.&nbsp; I am using Windows 10 and the option to&nbsp;Disable the Touchpad when a Mouse is Connected is missing.&nbsp; I have searched the threads herein the community but there was no solution to
 solve my problem (uninstalling device and driver and reinstalling the driver does not work).&nbsp; Honestly, since there has been no satisfactory solution to this problem, I am wondering if the community can help me.&nbsp; I have uploaded the images of what the settings
 look like in my operating system.</p>
<p>

            What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Human Interface Device
<br />Right click HID Compliant Touchpad
<br />
<br />Click Disable
<br />
<br />Also look on your keyboard for an option to disable it
<br />
<br />Look for a block or lock symbol on any of the function (F1 - F12) keys. Mine is Fn + F7 to disable the touch pad. 
<br />
<br />In addition the latest touchpad software should include a setting which if chosen will disable the touchpad whenever an external USB pointing device is connected. This is the safest way to handle this so you have touchpad working if mouse dies or you leave it at home.
<br />
<br />Once the latest touchpad software is installed from the PC's Support Downloads webpage, look for this setting at Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Touchpad and also in the Additional Settings there at the right side of the page to open Mouse Properties and look at the last tab where the Touchpad software installs itself.

            Hey Dog.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update the touchpad software from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.
<br />
<br />Then check the controls to adjust as necessary at Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Touchpad.
<br />
<br />Also there under Additional Options click the touchpad (always the last) tab on Mouse Properties to adjust any settings needed there, including ticking the box to "Disable touchpad when external pointing device is attached" to avoid palm-drag on touchpad causing cursor to jump.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            New Skype version &#40;8.33, I believe&#41; gets stuck in infinite installation loop on Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>The other day, when I launched Skype, it updated itself. The installation ran smoothly, finished -- and then repeated itself, again and again and again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled Skype, ran CCleaner (who knows, it was worth a try), restarted my computer, tried reinstalling Skype, and the same thing happened.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I again uninstalled Skype, restarted my computer, installed a slightly older version of Skype (8.2-something), and upon the installation completing, it auto-updated to version 8.33... which again became stuck in an infinite installation loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not really sure how to proceed from this point. I've never had this happen before. Any assistance would be very much appreciated.</p>

<h2>            &#34;installing update 2 of 3&#34; running over 3 Hours</h2>
                    
<p>We have a Toshiba Satalite U305-S5077 laptop running&nbsp;Vista Home Premium.&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife shut the system down this morning&nbsp;and&nbsp;it started to install updates over&nbsp;3 hours ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has&nbsp;"Please do not power off or unplug your machine. installing update 2 of 3" on
 the screen.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
What should we do?&nbsp; Is it likely to compleate on its on?<br />
<br />
There was a similar post, but it did not say if the system should be shut down or give any indication of what is a reasonable amount of&nbsp;time to wait,&nbsp; If this should take&nbsp;5 hours I would hate to kill it at&nbsp;4 and have to restore the system and do it again.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>

            It is not safe to shut down the computer while installing updates. Although if it freezes up you might have to. then you can run a system restore to a point before installing updates and then install updates that did not install again.<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

<h2>            Bitlocker has randomly locked me out of my Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>As per a very similar post about Surface Pro 3 and bitlocker locking them out. The same has happened to me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Purchased my surface pro 3 middle of last year and have not set up a bitlocker code! Hence why the email I receive from you guys states "there is no key associated with his account".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I can't format it, as it was purchased with Windows pre installed and gives me no option to do this otherwise apart from contacting my PC Admin (Which is me believe it or not).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously Microsoft have messed up here and laying the blame on the user! I've read through the previous post on this and nothing came of it so decided to start a new one, hopefully with new ideas!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>By default, the Windows 7 boot manager will start the default operating system after 30 seconds without keyboard input. If you change this value to 0, it will automatically start
 the default system without giving you a choice to select an entry. This is useful if you have only 1 OS, but even if you have multiple OS’s (multi-boot) you can take advantage of this.</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>
