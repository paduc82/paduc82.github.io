<h2>            Media Player &#38; Photo Viewer on Xbox One &#40;X&#41;...</h2>
                    <p>I'm really disappointed by the complete lack of ease using the media features my new Xbox One X, switching over from Xbox 360. There's no simple music player nor is there a simple photo viewer. There was a CD player app, but you couldn't do anything but listen to the CD. It automatically stopped playing when I tried to use the dashboard. Useless app. I don't want a subscription to any&nbsp;music streaming services, I just want to be able to listen to my music as I always have since the original XBOX, from 15 years ago, and the Xbox 360... There was absolutely no reason to take those functions away. I like having a music player with a visualizer on my console as well as the ability to view photos with zoom in/out functions. They may be small things, but I expected them to be on the new console, as well... The free Windows Media Player app which you have to download first, is absolute garbage, as pretty much everyone on the internet has stated on the subject. Please restore the simple con

    <title>How do I Get a drive letter for an old slave hard drive while keeping - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crobar  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I Get a drive letter for an old slave hard drive while keeping the existing data</h2>
                    
Hello, 

My master hard disk has failed and I have successfully replaced it with a 
new one and reinstalled windows XP etc. Before the crash I had a second slave 
drive with some data I would like to keep on it. When I connect this drive, 
it shows up in disk management, but does not get assigned a drive letter. How 
can I get windows to assign a drive letter to the drive without formatting it 
and losing all of my data? 

Both drives are IDE drives, the master is jumpered to cable select and is on 
the master cable, the slave seems to have lost its jumper, or never had one, 
but shows up in the bios as the secondary hard drive. 

Thanks,
Richard

            In 'Disk Management' you should be able to right click on the drives that don't have a letter assigned and go 'Change Drive Letter and Path...'. Then click 'Add'. Have the Assign the following Drive Letter clicked and to the right of it there is a dropdown
 box that should let you choose the letter for it you want. careful not to give two devices the same letter as it will only show one of them. eg. If you have a flash drive plugged in as F: and you set one of the harddrives as F: it will either show the harddrive
 and not the flash drive, or show the flash drive and hot the harddrive.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

<h2>            Xbox One won&#39;t read game discs at all</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;have two Xbox Ones in my house. In the past two days, neither one does a thing when I put in an Xbox One game. I can play Blu-Ray discs, and I&nbsp;can even play the backward compatible Fuzion Frenzy (both of which are recognized and boot up completely). My games are not scratched or fingerprinted, and since it's two separate machines with the same issue, I&nbsp;wonder if it isn't a software issue. Help!</p>

            <p>I noticed if I put in a disk while Xbox is booting and not fully up - then a game&nbsp;does not get marked as having disk inserted.</p><p>But if you know the game in question - you can start it just fine.</p><p><br /></p><p>I don't have the launch game when disk inserted or similar checked.</p><p>Maybe if you rely on that - this is no longer working.</p><p><br /></p><p>That you have to start manually - as a workaround until fixed.</p>

            <p>I started having this problem awhile ago, and found out blowing air into the disc tray helps... at least it did for 2 months, and now it's back to the problem again. I just got cod ww2 so not happy that it decided to show up again at this point in time.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you have them on the floor or in a TV Stand, anywhere where dust is&nbsp; bountiful&nbsp;and have pets running around, blow some air into each vent and use a knife or something similar to hold the disc tray open slightly, and blow air into it... may be that the reader needs a good cleaning.</p>

            <p>The problem is, some of the games I'm trying to play are new, and they spin and click about 7 times and then nothing. Just spinning. I'm going to try the dust can and see if that helps. I'd hate to have to send TWO&nbsp;machines for repairs!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Thin clients rdp to windows Server 2012 Server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wilvw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Thin clients rdp to windows Server 2012 Server</h2>
                    Hello<br />
<br />
I have a customer with a Windows Server 2003 Server 32-bit serving as a DC &amp; Mail Server, as well as doing nightly backups.<br />
<br />
The users are running desktops as well as laptops in the office, with some of them connecting (sometimes) to the office network from remote locations.<br />
<br />
I am currently looking at upgrading their environment, by upgrading the server to Windows 2012 64-bit, and add Thin Clients for the Desktop users so they can connect straight to the server which will help with reducing overheads (like HDD failure on the desktops).<br />
<br />
The question that I have is whether this setup will work? Basically I am looking at either Windows Server 2012 Server Essentials, or Standard 64-bit with the necessary amount of RDP CAL's. This server will run exactly as the current 2003 server in that it will
 be the DC, Exchange server &amp; perform nightly backups. On top of that I want to install MS Office with the required amount of licenses.<br />
However I would like to know if this will work or whether I am looking at a catch that will prevent the users from connecting to the server? Or Office giving problems in that if Word is open for one user, it won't open for the another user (the same question
 with Outlook &amp; Excel etc)?<br />
<br />
If there is any potential problem that will prevent this setup from working, can someone please point out to me what the problem(s) will be and if there is a workaround?<br />
<br />
TIA<br />

<h2>            Lenovo Windows 10 upgrade problem</h2>
                    <p>I appeared to successfully have installed windows 10 on my lenovo laptop (from 8.1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything worked fine until i finally got to the desktop. &nbsp;Now all I get is my previous desktop that continuously blinks on and off, the task bar has start icon, &nbsp;search the web icon and box, some other icon i don't recognize, my lenovo icon, and a menu
 icon. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on any these doesn't actually do anything. &nbsp;If I do a Ctr-Alt-Del key combination, i can at least get that menu but the Task list is empty so all I can do is sign off, restart, lock, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried restarting the machine via Ctrl-Alt-Del technique and try again. &nbsp;Now I get the same thing but my desktop doesn't have any of the original application short cuts on it.</p>

<p>Same problem here.&nbsp; Tried to follow your suggestion. Steps 1-3 work fine, but oddly, step 4 triggers the following response: "get-AppXPackage" is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The flicking ends, but the Program manager still prevents shut-down, and nothing else works. Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot help the suspicion that Norton 360 interferes, because it is the last icon displayed, but not displayed correctly.</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Sorry for the inconvenience. Could you restart the PC to Safemode and check if the issue still persists? Could you let me know the version of Norton 360 you have in the PC? Also, may I know if you have tried to uninstall and reinstall Norton and check?
 Let me know I could help you with this issue.</p>

            Hi Robert
<br />
<br />Unusually enough, that model does not have a Bluetooth radio . . .
<br />
<br />You would need to purchase a Bluetooth USB dongle, they are available online for as little as $5 . . .

            Hi xmasgirl,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Windows forum.<br />
<br />
Try the following methods and check if it helps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1 :</strong> <br />
&nbsp;<br />
First check if carlton cards creatacard gold version 2 is compatible with Windows 7 using the link given below since we do not have information on this.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</a>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2 :</strong> <br />
<br />
If it was working fine with your previously installed Windows Operating System, then I'd suggest you to install carlton cards creatacard gold version 2
<strong>Windows Compatibility mode</strong> by following the steps in this link :
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a>
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 3 :</strong> <br />
&nbsp;<br />
If none of the above steps work then, you may have to contact the manufacturer, install and download the latest drivers for carlton cards creatacard gold version 2<br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade glitchy on Asus VivoTab Smart Tablet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david-tcr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade glitchy on Asus VivoTab Smart Tablet</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone else having issues with upgrading Tablet pc's? I have an Asus VivoTab Smart (10.1) tablet. Upgrade process took almost 8 hours. Had to upgrade from external drive. Once complete, the touch screen started freaking out (acted like I was touching
 it but I wasn't).&nbsp; Kind of fixed this issue by downloading the driver pack from Asus.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chatted with Asus support. They told me my GPU was not supported for Windows 10. This was a shock considering MS said my tablet was ready and capable of upgrade. Had a couple of BSOD episodes but seems to be working fairly normal now. Still having
 issues with opening apps and then they disappear into background. Guessing this is part of video support&nbsp; problem. Hoping Asus comes out with tweak for GPU or Microsoft comes out with patch or tweak for this GPU.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contemplating reverting back to Windows 8.1, but will keep troubleshooting Win10 to see if updates or just time fixes the rest of the problems.</p>

<h2>            Unable to install Quicken</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem with the primary user account on Windows 10. I had to refresh windows 10 since then I am not able to install Quciken.&nbsp; Quicken tech support, after doing some detail checking has determined that my windows &nbsp;primary account may be issue. I
 am able to install and use quicken on a second local account in windows 10.&nbsp; Is there a way of determining the user account problem and correcting it.&nbsp; I feel that refreshing windows 10 will not resolve the problem.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>To be able to understand the issue better, let us know a few more details on the below questions.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What are the relevant error messages? Also, is the issue related to user permissions while trying to install the program?</li><li>How did Quicken tech support conclude that the issue is user account specific?</li><li>Do you face similar issues while trying to install other programs as well? <br />
This would help ascertain if the issue lies with the user account.</li></ul>

            <p><span>Hello Community,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Following are more details concerning my issue.</span></p>
<p><span>1. I did not receive an error message.&nbsp; In Quicken when you install the application the application displays a screen with fields to enter your Quicken ID and Password. This confirms that you have a legitimate copy. In my case I receive a
 screen requesting that I enter my ID etc. but there are no entry boxes for me to enter the information.&nbsp; I checked user permissions found in the programs Permissions section. All users including the Administrative user has full control. I believe that is the
 info you want.<br />
</span></p>
<span>2. Quicken determined that it is a user account problem when I was able to run the program in a second user that I set up as a test. I gave this user the name of Another User and has administrative access.<br />
<br />
3. Yes I ran across another program Zinio Reader 4 which when I access after downloading the displays a black screen with just the close (X), Maximize/Minimize Box and Minimize bar. I execute the program under the second user and it works as advertised.</span><br />
<span>Thanks Pete</span>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>Just spent the whole day yesterday with the Quicken customer service staff &nbsp;...both on phone and chat. &nbsp;i appreciate their willingness to hang in there for hours. &nbsp;Yes the problem is WINDOWS 1O. &nbsp;I had an updated copy of win 10. &nbsp;After many tries, installing,
 uninstalling, using qucleanuc, &nbsp;deleting files. &nbsp;Nothing worked. &nbsp;Could sign in but always got that dreaded "oops" screen. &nbsp;Added a new profile on windows....did not help. &nbsp;Disabled defender and firewall...didn't help. &nbsp;Finally today, reset computer to factory,
 turned off defender and firewall and &nbsp;Quicken and several other programs installed smoothly.</p>

    <title>How to copy the slideshow files in Windows Media Center&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edward cho  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to copy the slideshow files in Windows Media Center&#63;</h2>
                    Those slideshows that I created using Windows Media Center have practically disappeared and is unable to find in WMC itself. However, I'm able to right click the WMC icon at start menu and able to still open up the slideshow history and the slideshow plays
 correctly. How can I find those slideshows that I have created and make amendments to it? Since I'm unable to have the option to select my slideshows that I created previously in WMC, I also can't create new slideshows with the same name without deleting the
 old ones which I can't find anywhere in the first place.

<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Can you point to the file in File Explorer, right click it, click Properties, click the General tab, click Change, choose Adobe Reader DC then click OK.
<br />
<br />Try printing again or if you don't have Adobe Reader DC installed, download it, try opening the PDF from there then attempt to print it.

            Hi Arthur.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Can  you right click the file, choose Properties, then Open with and choose your .pdf reader?  
<br />
<br />If not and it's stuck as wrong format then you can convert it by right clicking to Print, choose .pdf Printer which will convert it so you can open it as a .pdf.  
<br />
<br />You can also try downloading it again using another browser to see if it properly downloads as a .pdf if the original source file is for sure a .pdf. 
<br />
<br />I would have several browsers on your task bar so there's always one that's best for the task.  I use Firefox, Edge and Chrome in that order of preference.  It's easy to share bookmarks between all of them in their settings under Import Favorites from another Browser, and Firefox and Chrome let  you sign in to sync your Favorites on any other device you sign into.  Set the preferred browser as Default in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps.  
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>&nbsp; When I downloaded it from the original site I wasn't given any chose of where to send it.&nbsp; I just assumed it was going in a the PDF file it came in. When I opened it in documents again with a right click&nbsp; I was only offered :&nbsp;</p>
<p>Share Picture</p>

<p>

<br />The day has long passed where we only use one internet browser.  This is like having a toolbox with only one tool.  I would have several browsers on your task bar so there's always one that's best for the task.  I use Firefox, Edge and Chrome in that order of preference.  It's easy to share bookmarks between all of them in their settings under Import Favorites from another Browser, and Firefox and Chrome let  you sign in to sync your Favorites on any other device you sign into.  Set the preferred browser as Default in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps.  
<br />
<br />What told you this was a .pdf when you downloaded it?  Can I see the download link?  
<br />
<br />If it downloads even as a picture it should have more on the right click context menu when you right click on the file in Explorer (not the picture).

</p><p>When i have tried to update this current Windows 7 laptop to Windows 10, the Get Windows 10 app shows a compatibility issue but when i check the compatibility report it says i'm good to go.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have done all of the Windows updates and also used the HP to ensure all drivers are up to date. I have also re-run the Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser through Task Scheduler to refresh the report. Nothing has worked. I've never seen this problem before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone encountered this before please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any help and ideas to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks.</p>

<h2>            Dx12</h2>
                    <p>HI...</p>
<p>I am having A Pentium G4560 and Gpu Gt 1030</p>
<p>Running with Windows 10 . Now when I disable My Internal Gpu and use My Gt 1030 I can play games with no lag, Issue starts when I wanna stream or record My game The Gt 1030 doesn't have any encoder And hence I have to enable my internal Gpu which supports
 stream 72p@30 . BUT When I enable both the Gpu The game first uses My processor's Gpu then With dx12 it is also using the 1030 which at last makes my pc lag like hell... I wanna play game with my external Gpu and stream with my internal Gpu at same time without
 mixing up things.. Really I tried The nvidia control panel did every setting but same condition ..If i want to disable my Internal 3d graphics the intel graphics control pannel is not showing in the right click menu... stuck here..Please Help..</p>

            Nope Nothing helped.. Both igpu and egpu are getting upsed at the same time when playinh game . Actually I am playing game on an emulator which does make sense that it is going to use more cpu but i want it to use my egpu rather than igpu as it takes my
 framerates . Today i installed the new Dch drivers for intel but done selecting every where that use egpu but it still uses both and the fun fact is it uses igpu more than the other. GOD THIS IS KILLING ME

            I can open programs just fine, RINALDONAPOLI. My error is the same exact thing but instead of saying "ExpressTray.exe", it says "SelfService.exe", so it must have to do with something else. But I hope that "something else" isn't important. I've had my
 PC for about 4 years and my last PC malfunctioned with something on Windows XP. I don't remember the cause. I'm scared that something like that will happen on this computer. :P

<p>1. Were you able to update Defender's Definitions prior to the scan?</p>
<p>
2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer

<p>
</p><p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">when</span> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. How have you determined that the computer is no longer infected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Did the computer come with Win7 32-bit preinstalled or...?</p>

            <span>I didn't upgrade the computer to Windows 7.&nbsp; It was that way when I started working here.<br />
<br />
I ran the McAffee Consumer Products Removal Too and it didn't help.<br />
<br />
I've been running AVG anti virus, and Malware Bytes Anti Malware.<br />
<br />
I checked and all the installed updates seem to have been erased and when I try to upload any of the current update packages I found on the Microsoft Website it comes back as not applicable to this computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
The windows defender deleted the only virus called "Rogue" it found on the computer in safe mode full scan so I am assuming the computer is no longer infected.</span>

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />If you are very sure that your mic is okay the first thing that i would try is update Windows and see if the issue persist.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work try the following:
<br />
<br />Right click the Speakers icon on your system tray and select Recording Devices.
<br />Right click the Microphone and select Properties.
<br />Switch to the Advanced tab.
<br />Under Default Format drop down menu, select: 2 channel, 16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD quality).
<br />Uncheck “Enable Audio Enhancements”
<br />Press OK and OK.
<br />Restart the PC and try again.
<br />
<br />Regards.       
        </p>

            Hey Megan<br />I have the same problem with my microphone and the way I fixed it was disabling and reenabling my microphone. To do this push windows + R and type mmsys.cpl<br />Click recording devices, right click your mic and click disable then right click it again and click enable. If it disappears right click on the window and click show disabled devices.
