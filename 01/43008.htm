<h2>            can I run a 64 bit windows 7 on 2GB RAM plus 4GB added with a readyboost enabled flash drive&#63;</h2>
                    I had windows 7 32 bit on this computer, then I had to change hard drive&nbsp;(corruption cause unknown)&nbsp;and when reinstalling windows I accidentally installed 64 bit. The processor is compatible but I only have 2GB RAM. Do I uninstall and use 32 bit or can
 I just do a reboot with the 32 bit and partition the drive. Will this affect drivers? Will it affect startup files since I've read they use the earliest version on the computer?&nbsp; IE still runs on a 32 bit version somehow and it also downloaded 32 versions
 of Adobe and Jave. But&nbsp;I'm already having issues with program crashes(even Norton). Any suggestions besides the obvious upgrading of RAM. The flashdrive is actually 8GB but you can't use all of it.

            <p>ReadyBoost can speed up your computer by using storage space on most USB flash drives and flash memory cards. When you plug a ReadyBoost-compatible storage device into your computer, the AutoPlay dialog box offers you the option to speed up your PC using
 ReadyBoost. If you select this option, you can choose how much memory on the device to use for this purpose.</p>
<p>When you set up a device to work with ReadyBoost, Windows shows you how much space it recommends you allow it to use for optimal performance. For ReadyBoost to effectively speed up your computer, the flash drive or memory card should have at least 1 gigabyte
 (GB) of available space. If your device does not have enough available space for ReadyBoost, you'll see a message telling you to free some space on the device if you want to use it to speed up your system.

<p><span>Please note, if you want to run 32 bit WIndows 7, you will need to purchase an additional license, you cannot install it on a blank permission and have Windows 7 64 bit installed at the same time.

</p>
<p>Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you are experiencing stability or performance issues, I suggest you downgrade to Windows 7 32 bit which works great with 2 GBs of RAM:</strong></p>
<p>If you have the Windows 7 32 bit DVD, you will need to do a custom clean install. This requires that you either start the installation from within Windows 7 64 bit or boot from the Windows 7 32 bit DVD.</p>
<p>Please note, you should go to the manufacturers website for your computer and make sure that you have downloaded all the necessary 32 bit drivers for your system, since the drivers that are being used now are for 64 bit Windows. You will notice that some
 devices do not work. Also note that if you have 4 GBs of RAM in your computer, this will not be recognized by Windows 7 32 bit.</p>
<p>How to downgrade from Windows 7 64 bit to Windows 7 32 bit<br />
There is no in place upgrade path from from Windows 7 64 bit to 32 bit. This means you will need to backup whatever personal files you have accumulated since you started using your Windows 7 64 bit PC to an external hard disk or burn them to a blank DVD. You
 cannot use Windows Easy Transfer program when migrating from 64 to 32 bit, it is not backward compatible with the older architecture. This means, you will need to copy and paste files into a folder on an external hard disk or thumb drive. You need to gather
 all those application and driver installation disks and prepare to reinstall all of them.
</p>
<p>Obtaining 32 bit Installation media</p>
<p>If your computer came with Windows 7 64 bit preinstalled, then you will need to contact the manufacturer of the computer about obtaining a alternate recovery Windows 7 32 bit disk set to reinstall Windows 7 on your computer. The manufacturer might charge
 a small shipping and handling fee.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers will include the ability to choose either 32 or 64 bit Windows 7 at installation time. This will require that you boot into the Recovery Environment, most manufacturers require that you press the F11 Function Key when you start your computer.
 Please consult the documentation that came with your computer about how to reinstall Windows 7.</p>
<p>If you bought a retail box license (upgrade or full version) then you should have both 32 and 64 bit DVDs included in the box.</p>
<p>If purchased a digital download of Windows 7 from the Microsoft Store, then you will need to go to the Microsoft Store website (<a href="http://store.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.microsoft.com</a>), log in with your store account, select Download Options
 and select Windows 7 32 bit and proceed to download.</p>
<p>If you have an Anytime Upgrade license, you will need first reinstall the base Windows 7 32 bit license, activate it then do the Anytime Upgrade to the particular edition and then reactivate again.</p>
<p>Starting the Installation<br />
Boot to the Windows 7 64 bit desktop, insert your Windows 7 32 bit DVD, click Run setup.exe when the Auto Play dialog appears. If you want, you can also boot from the Windows 7 32 bit DVD and also do a custom install. Its just that, it’s a bit more elegant
 when you simply boot to the desktop and start the installation from there.</p>
<p>Click Yes when the User Account Control window appears</p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p>Unlike the Windows 7 64 bit disk, you can start the installation from within Windows 7 64 bit because the Setup program in Windows 7 32 bit is a full 32 bit application.</p>
<p>When the setup menu appears, select the custom (advanced) option, select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 32 bit. Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. It is still recommended you do a manual backup, because you might explicitly format the drive during setup which will delete all information on the drive. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers. Persons running Windows Vista 64 bit, can also use this method when contemplating whether they should upgrade to Windows 7 32 or 64 bit. If you decide to go the other way around by migrating from Windows 7 32 bit to 64 bit, the same principles apply
 with some exceptions. You can use Windows Easy Transfer to backup your personal files and settings and you will need to boot from the Windows 7 64 bit DVD to start the installation.</p>

            When you scan as an editable document the IRIS program tries to convert the scan to text. &nbsp;When scanning to paint or powerpoint there is no conversion, the scan is simply done as a bitmap. &nbsp;

<h2>            sending mail via windows live mail using different accounts</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I use windows live mail to receive mail from several accounts. However, sending an email is only done through one specific account. Is there a way to change the sending account without having to reconfigure the whole software? (similar to the way this is
 done in gmail...)</p>

<h2>            dvd shrink 3.2,  suddenly refuses to work, on windows 7  32bit,</h2>
                    Previously dvd shrink worked very well, until it suddenly refuses to run/launch when double-clicked, the egg-timer would show for approx. 30 secs, then cancel.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Tried Malware, Virus, System-Restore, Un-installed latest programs going back 3 mths. of installations, " still no luck ".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Could an update to &nbsp;(dot net) .net framework, or conflict with a media-players or something similar be a possible cause.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Appreciate any practical suggestions on correcting and repairing this problem on windows 7 with some applications.</div>

            <p>Hi, K2000p,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to refer to the link provided below as for windows 7 compatibility center<b>Shrink DVD</b> is not compatible on Windows 7:</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;s=DVD%20Shrink&amp;type=Software&amp;os=32-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;s=DVD%20Shrink&amp;type=Software&amp;os=32-bit</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try running the program in windows compatibility mode and check if it works:</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Try the Methods provided below and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>If the issue is confined to the Windows built in games then you may perform SFC scan as the troubleshooting step.</p>
<p>Refer the link provided below to perform SFC scan.</p>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310747</a></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>This issue could also be caused by a virus/malware, I would suggest that you download and run a full system scan using Microsoft Safety Scanner.</p>

<h2>            Connect SB-keyboard unit over bluetooth</h2>
                    Hello @all,<br />
<br />
I&nbsp;know that it is not possible to use the keyboard-mouse-unit when the tablet-unit is disconnected. But imagine the keyboard-unit had a Bluetooth transmitter so you could also use it in disconnected state like a desktop or so. Is there a way to make this possible,
 like using a usb Bluetooth transmitter?<br />

            I may be missing something here, but surely any proper Bluetooth keyboard will work with the SB Clipboard once it's separated. By 'proper' I mean one that is truly&nbsp;in-built Bluetooth compliant, and does not need a dedicated USB dongle - I have a Logitech
 one that works with both my old Surface Pro 2 and SB. The Bluetooth radio is in the Clipboard unit after all...

            Thanks for the reply! &nbsp;<br />
I don't want to take an extra keyboard/trackpad unit with me when I already have the surface one at hand, that's why.<br />
So, what a pitty that I can't use it like this for example. Although I think some little hardware hacks could make it work.<br />

    <title>personalized date format on the welcome&#47;lock screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> juancarlos iii  say:</h3>
<h2>            personalized date format on the welcome&#47;lock screen</h2>
                    Hello, I'm wondering how to change the time/date format on the welcome/lock screen. I've made a personalized format in the control panel:
<div>Short date: ddMMMyyyy</div>
<div>Long date: ddd, ddMMyyyy</div>
<div>Short time: HH:mm</div>
<div>Long time: HH:mm:ss</div>
<div>and applied it to the current user account, system accounts, and new accounts. It works in all software and in the start menu, just not the lock screen. Is there any way to apply these formats to the lock screen?</div>
                </div>

            The date/time is already correct (it is synchronised with "time-nw.nist.gov") but the format is not what I specified. The lock screen shows "Saturday, January 5" when it should be "Sat, 05Jan2013"

<p><br />
My guess would be that it is using a different profile in each case or perhaps it could just be a difference between HKCU and HKLM registry values.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could try running ProcMon to see what registry values are being accessed in each case.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think ProcMon
 will keep recording even when you go into a different account but if not you can at least turn on its Boot Logging option and see what it captures about this scenario then.</p>

Good luck</p>

            <p>Everyone answering this question to date is incorrect. No matter how one sets the date for Australia, the date on the lock screen presents in US format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get around this I set my Language &amp; LocaleName&nbsp;in the HKLM registry values to New Zealand which presents the correct format. Microsoft needs to fix this - there's a lot more Aussies than there are Kiwis!</p>
<p>

            Hi,JocelynGunia 
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br />The following command will do a full scan of the protected system files on your computer and fix any file that are causing issues while Windows 10 is up and running.
<br />1.	Use the Windows key + X keyboard shortcut to open the Power User menu and select Command Prompt (Admin), as you will need administrator permissions to run SFC.
<br />2.	In the Command Prompt type the following command and press Enter:
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />1.	Once the scan completes, you will see one of the following messages:
<br />o	Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations:This indicates that your system doesn't have any missing or corrupted files.
<br />o	Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation: This message means that there was a problem during the scan and an offline scan is required.
<br />o	Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them. Details are included in the CBS.Log %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log: You will get this message when SFC was able to fix the problem. Now, you can move on or you can view the logs to get more details.
<br />o	Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log: In this case, you'll need to repair the corrupted files manually.
<br />Quick Tip: You may want to run the command around three times to fix all the problems.
<br />
<br />Please see this great 3rd party link for a complete step-by-step guide

            Hello, Jocelyn,
<br />
<br />I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />Are you using a Linux Program? (i.e. Computer Aided Investigative Environment (CAINE) Computer Forensics Live Linux Distro 7.0 application?)
<br />
<br />The errors related to QT5Core.dll can be caused by a faulty application, corrupted software present on your PC or a damaged Windows registry. 
<br />
<br />1. Run the following scans then verify if the error is gone.
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-update/troubleshooting-component-store-system-files/8acbd614-678d-42b9-859c-56d3e6f8342a">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>?
<br />
<br />2. Does this occur when running certain applications?
<br />Re-register Q55Core.dll
<br />
<br />Right click on Start &gt; Select PowerShell (Admin)
<br />Type the following command: then press Enter
<br />
<br />regsvr32 /u Qt5Core.dll.
<br />
<br />This will UN-REGISTER your file.
<br />Type the following command: then press Enter
<br />
<br />regsvr32 /i Qt5Core.dll.
<br />This will RE-REGISTER your file.
<br />Type Exit &gt; Press Enter to exit PowerShell
<br />Re-start the program associated with Qt5Core.dll error.
<br />
<br />3. Use Windows Defender Offline to run a full scan for Malware.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17466/windows-defender-offline-help-protect-my-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17466/...</a>
<br />
<br />4. If using Linux application, uninstall/reinstall it.
<br />
<br />5. Go to Manufacturer's website and update drivers or use Device Manager to install updates
<br />
<br />6. Run Windows Updates &gt; Scan for Updates several times to ensure the device is up to date.
<br />
<br />7. If still experiencing issues, perform a Clean Install of Windows 10. Ensure you upload important files to your OneDrive account prior to performing the install. Follow this easy guide.

<h2>            Broadband Connection&#58; Unavailable - device missing - no MS programs see the internet, other programs do see internet</h2>
                    <p>I am having a heck of a time trying all sorts of things to find out why all my Microsoft items don't update or download or, in any way manage an internet connection. IE just says it can't reach the page. Chrome and Firefox find it just fine as do a number
 of applications I use. Anything works except Microsoft products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: I'm not able to click on the "Settings" Button directly. I have to right click and do a round-a-bout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note: I am sending this using Chrome because IE just flat stops cold, won't even go directly to the router locally)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just moved from Kansas City (with Google fiber) to Hays Kansas, This is a new provider (with Nex-Tech on fiber) and a new router (LinkSYS ea8300). This particular machine is a Windows 10 machine. The other two I have are Windows 7 machines and they are
 fine. IE, updates and so forth work just fine. The laptop is WiFi and both this WIndows 10 desktop and the other Windows 7 desktop are connected via Ethernet to the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here is my hash list set of notes (following) which I wrote as I tried various options and guesses:</strong></p>
<p>
Did a network reset. No Change visible.<br />
<br />
Could not click on and get a response from the "Settings" button from the main menu (Windows key). Instead had to go to right-click, More, App Settings. Then hit the "home" icon to back into the settings panel.<br />
From there to "Network Status"<br />
THEN&gt;&nbsp; Set up a new connection. / Connect to the internet / Create a new connection. / BB PPP0E / and it fails.<br />
<br />
The "Get Help App" can't work, again, saying, "It looks like you're not connected to the Internet. Let's fix that.. Start the Network troubleshooter now."<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Been there, several times.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Winds up with Problems found: Possible Solution: Networking Reset.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I've done that. Nada.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saved diagnostics, but can't find it.<br />
<br />
In "Network Connections"&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Broadband Connection:&nbsp; &nbsp; Unavailable - device missing<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ethernet:&nbsp; &nbsp;Enabled:&nbsp; NVIDIA nForce Networking<br />
<br />
I am connected in this machine with an Ethernet cable to the router.<br />
<br />
We couldn't check for updates, because you aren't connected to the Internet. Make sure you have a cellular data or Wi-Fi connection and try again.<br />

No network so no updates<br />

    <title>Replaced HDD with an SSD, but now the hybrid drive feature seems to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bellyer2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Replaced HDD with an SSD, but now the hybrid drive feature seems to have stopped working</h2>
                    <p>I installed a &nbsp;2 TB Crucial MX300 SSD in my Surface Studio to replace the terribly slow 5,400 RPM SATA II physical hard drive that came pre-installed. I had attempted to clone the hard drive to the SSD, but the clone didn't work properly, so I had to reinstall
 Windows 10 using the Surface Studio recovery media. All of the drivers appear to have been installed correctly, but for some reason, it seems as though the drives are no longer in a RAID configuration and it seems as though the PC cannot "see" the 128 GB M.2
 SSD that came with the Studio for caching through the Intel Rapid Storage Technology (IRST) feature.&nbsp; I did not disconnect the 128 GB M.2 SSD in the process of&nbsp;upgrading the primary hard drive to the SSD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Might anyone have any idea why that might be and what I can do to get the RAID configuration set back up for caching through&nbsp;IRST?&nbsp; I'd love to still be able to take advantage of the speed boost from that M.2 SSD if at all possible.&nbsp; I have seen some mentions
 on other posts or sites that people who tried downloading the IRST application essentially broke the ability that Microsoft leveraged to allow 128 GB of caching from the M.2 SSD and they were only able to use 64 GB because the application caps out at 64 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if anyone has any ideas as to how to get the PC to recognize the M.2 SSD again.</p>

            <p>I haven't tried upgrading only the slow HDD and leaving the fast SSD in the Surface Studio, but I imagine that you would need to do it as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>BEFORE</strong> replacing the HDD, install the latest version of IRST and use its SRT feature to "<em>disable acceleration</em>" on the stock rapid hybrid drive. Doing so will write all of the cached contents from the rapid hybrid drive's SSD&nbsp;onto&nbsp;its
 slow HDD. <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> After disabling the acceleration <strong>
DO NOT</strong> "<em>reset to available</em>" the SSD as doing so will destroy the 128/119 GB cache and you will
<strong>NEVER</strong> be able to get it back!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have disabled the acceleration, go ahead and replace the HDD with a faster/larger 2.5" SATA III SSD, and then run the Surface Studio recovery image (or restore the drive from backup, clone, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the Surface Studio is back up and running properly&nbsp;from the new 2.5" SATA III SSD, install the latest version of IRST and use its SRT feature to enable acceleration again. Doing that "should" get you back the rapid hybrid drive with its full 128/119
 GB cache using the faster M.2 SSD and the slower SATA III SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again though, I've never actually tested this, so I don't know for certain that it will work properly (i.e. proceed at your own risk!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for your particular situation, if I were you, I'd reinstall the stock 2.5" HDD in your Surface Studio and attempt to get the rapid hybrid drive back to working order again. Once you're there, I'd then follow the above steps to "properly" upgrade the
 HDD to a SDD. I realize that's a PITA seeing as&nbsp;removing and replacing&nbsp;the 2.5" HDD is the most difficult part (seeing as you have to remove the CPU/GPU heat sink), but it might be the only way for you&nbsp;to get your Surface Studio back to the way you want it
 to be (i.e. with the 128/119 GB rapid hybrid drive working with the stock&nbsp;M.2 SDD and your new SATA III SDD).</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>NOTE:</em> If you, at any point, used IRST to "release" the M.2 SSD from the rapid hybrid drive, then you are just plain out of luck as there will be no way for you to get back the full 128/119 GB cache (only 64 GB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps you out some.</p>

            <p>Thanks, OfficeMaven!&nbsp; Very helpful advice.&nbsp; I'm not looking forward to swapping the hard drives back to fix this though, especially since my photographer of a wife has already started editing new photos on the new SSD and adding them to her Lightroom catalog.&nbsp;
 No matter how many backups she makes of her files and catalog, she freaks out any time I start making major changes to our PCs.&nbsp; Guess I'll have to deal with her freaking out a bit in order to get things back how they should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I certainly appreciate the help!!! :)</p>

            <p>The freeware IrfanView can do the task you require.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Download IrfanView<br />
<a href="http://majorgeeks.com/IrfanView_d4253.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://majorgeeks.com/IrfanView_d4253.html</a><br />
(filename&nbsp; :&nbsp; iview432_setup.exe)<br />
(uncheck the box if you do not want Google Chrome)<br />
<br />
Get the plug-ins too...<br />
<br />
IrfanView Plug-ins<br />
<a href="http://majorgeeks.com/IrfanView_PlugIns_d4908.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://majorgeeks.com/IrfanView_PlugIns_d4908.html</a><br />
(filename&nbsp; :&nbsp; irfanview_plugins_432_setup.exe)<br />
<br />
When IrfanView is downloaded and installed...see the following<br />
instructions for joining your photos.<br />
<br />
Open IrfanView and go to...Image / Create Panorama Image...<br />
(this will open the "Create panorama image" screen)<br />
<br />
On the "Create panorama image" screen...left click the "Add images" button.<br />
(This will display the "Open" screen. Now...drill down to the <br />
folder that contains your saved Photos of the Vets.<br />
<br />
Now...left click (highlight) the two images you wish to join.<br />
(you can multiple select if you hold your Ctrl key) <br />
&nbsp;<br />
With the two images highlighted...left click the "Open" button.<br />
(Or...you can add the images one at a time...which ever is easier)<br />
<br />
Now you should be back to the "Create panorama image" screen<br />
and the file names of the selected photos should be in the<br />
"Input Images" field.<br />
<br />
Now with the two file names in the "Input Images" field...<br />
you can left click the "Create Image" button.<br />
<br />
(the left and right positions of these images can be reversed by <br />
selecting a file name and using the "Move Images Up" / "Move <br />
Images Down"...buttons)<br />
<br />
Now you should see a display of the combined image. <br />
Go to...File / Save As...<br />
<br />
Choose a save location / Enter a file name / Choose a format...<br />
Left click the "Save" button...<br />
