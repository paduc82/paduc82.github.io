<h2>            What is the DLC for Dragon Age Origins&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>How many are there, because I have seen at least 4.&nbsp; I even saw one for 2400 Microsoft points, which is more than I bought the game for, and didn't know if it was a DLC or for Games on Demand.&nbsp; Any information on this would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>There are several different downloadable packs for Dragon Age Origins. The 2400 Point download is for Dragon Age Origins Awakening. An expansion pack for the game. I never played any of the DLC for the first game, so I can't give much information on any
 of them. Just read the descriptions in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Also you may HAVE the DLC. If you have the Game of the Year edition(the two disc version) then you put in the second disc and it installs all the DLC for free.</p>

<p>The more expensive download is the Awakening add-on, which is an extensive addition.</p>
<p>Run a Google search on all the DLC packs. You will find what you're looking for.</p>

<p>I will try to sum it up as best I can. First off, if you buy the Ultimate edition, it comes with all DLC I believe. But if you got the Games On Demand version, or vanilla hard copy at a store, here are the DLCs you can get.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Awakening, you can buy it as DLC add on, or might be able to find a hard copy at a store, as it was originally sold for $40, it's a big expansion (but some might not think $40 was worth the price, a little steep). 2400 sounds like it is $30 now. I have seen
 it on the list of Deals Of The Week though, so if you are patient, might save more money, as big name titles get DOTW more than once. The expansion takes place after you beat the original game, so you just transfer save files once complete (it will ask once
 you begin the expansion adventure).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warden's Keep. If you buy this DLC, it's an addition to the main storyline, so you have to be on the look out for this questline while doing the main story. Once you beat the game, there's no going back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Stone Prisoner. New copies "should" come with this free, used copies won't. As for Games On Demand, I have no idea. But that happened when this game was a new release, don't know if they bundle this DLC with new games anymore or not. It's another addition
 to the main storyline, while playing the main game, and gives you another character.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Return to Ostagar. Also another DLC part of the main storyline, and gives you another chance to get the dog as a character if you missed the earlier chance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Darkspawn Chronicles. Is a DLC that is played seperately, no character transfer, as you play the bad guys, but once beaten, unlocks a weapon for used in the main game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leliana's Song. Much like Darkspawn Chronicles, is played seperately. Also unlocks equipment for the main game when beaten, but not directly beating it, as you have to find all the pieces first. Explains Leliana's past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Golems of Amgarrak. A DLC that occurs after the main game, and I highly recommend, after Awakening as well, but before Witch Hunt. (That is my recommendation, can be played before awakening, but characters from Golems cannot be transfered to Awakening.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Witch Hunt. The last DLC, uses character transfer. I highly recommend main game --&gt; Awakening --&gt; Golems --&gt; Witch Hunt for the best experience, as character transfers between different directions might not be used, and there are no character transfers from
 Witch Hunt to any other DLC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Awakening is an expansion pack to it, and continues the story after the events of Dragon Age: Origins, and it allows you start as a new Grey Warden or play as your Grey Warden from the game if they lived after the events of the main story, and it's a pretty
 good and lengthy piece of DLC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only DLC I'd say aren't worth a purchase, if you aren't going to get the Ultimate edition, are Darkspawn Chronicles and maybe Leliana's Song, the former being pretty boring, and the latter adding nothing to the story but explaining more of Leliana's story
 before the events of the game.</p>

<p>You can import your Warden into Awakening even if they died at the end of Origins. At last you could on the PC, I assume it will be the same for the 360.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I'd very much say that Leliana's song is a must buy. Not only does it flesh out her character a lot more and really acts as a prologue to the main game, but you get a decent suit of light armour as an unlockable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd say that it actually just depends on what you did in the main game in relation to whether or not Witch Hunt is affected by the main game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Warden had a romance with Morrigan and did the ritual, so it was greatly linked to the main game and gave some much desired closure&nbsp;to what happened after defeating the Archdemon,&nbsp;and then it opened up new possibilities&nbsp;regarding Morrigan and the Warden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll agree Leliana's Song is good for more backstory, and yes the Battle Dress is a good piece of armor, so it does have some worth to it as DLC. Now I think of it, I'll say Golems Of Amgarrack is the bad DLC along with Darkspawn Chronicles, even if it does
 offer the hardest boss I've faced&nbsp;for the game.</p>

<p>[/quote]Well I romanced her and did the ritual as well, but when I spoke to her in witch hunt she gave me a generic conversation about how she was surprised I was alive and wondered how I survived killing the Archdaemon. Everyone else I knew who played it
 had the same experience, the conversation with Morrigan at the end didn't reflect any of the actual choices made in the game with regards to her. So I felt witch hunt was a huge let down and a cop out. But after playing Dragon age 2 and having the exact same
 thing happen with the mages in the final chapter where nothing I had done for them in the previous 10 years mattered. suddenly I was working for the Church and wanted to kill them, It was pretty clear they were now short cutting the game to meet EA's deadlines.</p>

<h2>            WIndows Easy Transfer XP to Windows 8</h2>
                    I am trying to use Windows Easy Transfer to move data from a Win XP machine to a new Win 8 laptop. I have downloaded Easy Transfer from the web onto the old machine but it just won't run. When initiated, the hourglass icon appears briefly then disappears
 and the program just halts - no error message or anything. Task Manager doesn't show any program running. I then bought a Belkin Easy Transfer cable and reloaded the software from the accompanying disk onto the XP machine. The same thing happens - it simply
 won't run. I've tried disabling all active programs, including Norton Antivirus and the firewall, to no avail. I have also tried running it in Safe mode, only to receive the following message from Windows Easy Transfer&nbsp;- 'Your computer is currently running
 in Safe Mode. Start Windows normally and try again'. Help!

            <p>Easy Transfer has other issues besides what you are experiencing, including failure to transfer all your files as some file types are excluded. My suggestion to use the tried and true method of coping your files to an external USB drive (yes I know it takes
 a while, but its safe) and then move them&nbsp;to the Windows 8 laptop.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It's the hard and slow way. &nbsp;Ycopy, Xcopy, Robocopy - perhaps the latter might do the best job.</p>

    <title>How to get Windows update back to be normal&#63; Windows Updates - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to get Windows update back to be normal&#63; Windows Updates fails, troubleshoot tool fails, manually install update fails</h2>
                    <p>Let me emphasis the issues development path , </p>
<p>1, I run into the update fail and stuck with KB4462919, --&gt; </p>
<p>2. then reset windows update components, --&gt; </p>
<p>3. then the error: "<strong>We couldn't connect to the update service. We'll try again later, or you can check now. If it still doesn't work, make sure you're connected to the Internet.</strong>" --&gt;
</p>
<p>4. manually download updates kb4462933, and install, "<strong>The update is not applicable to your computer</strong>"</p>
<p>5. the internal troubleshoot tool find Windows update components must be fixed, but it fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, let me explain more on details. First, update fail and stuck with KB4462919, even if I downloaded later updates (kb4462933), the error code which I searched on the internet is related to Microsoft Store issue, the tips said you should reset microsoft
 store cache or so, I did, nothing helps. I tried manually download KB4462919 and install it successfully, but after that I check new updates manually, it still want to download and install KB4462919, the Windows Update components doesn't know that I've already
 installed this KB4462919!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I followed other steps from Microsoft community, to manually reset Windows Update components:</p>
<p>net stop wuauserv</p>
<p>net Stop cryptSvc<br />
net Stop bits<br />
net Stop msiserver<br />
ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old<br />
ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old<br />
net Start wuauserv<br />
net start cryptSvc<br />
net Start bits<br />
net start msiserver<br />
net start TrustedInstaller<br />
</p>
<p>after that, check updates, but still doesn't work. error:&nbsp; "<strong>We couldn't connect to the update service. We'll try again later, or you can check now. If it still doesn't work, make sure you're connected to the Internet.</strong>"&nbsp; I'm pretty sure that
 my FTTB broadband works flawlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I thought that I could install the updates manually, so I downloaded updates KB4462933, and install, but it appears that "<strong>The update is not applicable to your computer</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last thing I can do is to use the internal troubleshoot tool to scan and fix the issues. I did, and it could not fix Windows update component problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone has solution? Thanks!</p>

            Good day! I apologize that you are having this issue and I am hoping we can work through it and fix it.
<br />
<br />As stated here, there are a few different reasons why your update may be failing: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/windows-update-troubleshooting#the-update-is-not-applicable-to-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deploy...</a>
<br />
<br />Please go through all possible resolutions on this page for your error. 
<br />
<br />Is there any certain point where the PC stopped working how you wanted to? You could possible do a repair and then a restore if that does not work 
<br />
<br />To fully reset update components, try this: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058...</a>
<br />
<br />Start your PC then just as Windows loads - press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a shut down. Do it 3 times. You may only need to do it twice, but on the third start Windows will boot into the recovery environment.
<br />
<br />You can also hold shift &gt; press restart in the start menu to do the same
<br />
<br />1:
<br />Go to Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Option &gt; Startup Repair
<br />This will try to make Windows repair itself.
<br />____________________________________________________
<br />
<br />2:
<br />Also try to go to Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Option &gt; System Restore
<br />You can check to see if you have a restore point here where you can go back to before the issue started.

            Hi,
<br />Try updating to 1809 using Media Creation tool and if it fails let us know.
<br />
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

<p>Not really. &nbsp;I know my cell phone has an option to disable charging when in USB connection mode or something, but I don't know if it's available as a setting. &nbsp;It might be worth exploring Device Manager (type that into the Start menu to find it) and see
 if the USB Hub controller has such an option (it'd be&nbsp;dependent&nbsp;upon the driver, it's not really a Windows feature).</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>You cannot turn it Off on the computer since it uses the 5V power that always exists on any computer's USB port and it needed for the data exchange of the USB port and the peripheral device.</p>
<p>Some peripheral devices might have some control on the battery charging per-se.</p>

<p><br />
Does that mean if the device (driver) been written to charge the connected device, it will draw more than 5V power?</p>
<p>or its always limited/fixed to 5V?</p>
<p>if its fixed, then looks like doesnt matter there's an option to turn off the device charging or not, as it will continuously draw that much power to maintain that connection.</p>

            I have few points to share:<br />
1) Once the &nbsp;mobile device is fully charged, it will not take further current from the source/laptop. Usually laptop will deliver 5V/0.5Amp power&nbsp;while charging,&nbsp;equal to 2.5 Watt. once fully charged there is no or negligible current, approx &lt;0.5 watt.&nbsp;
<div>So there is no need to disable charging.&nbsp;<br />
<div>2) USB connector has 4 pins, PWR, GND, D+, D- and it needs atleast GND pin along wiht D+, D- for data exchange. It may be possible to disconnect PWR pin to avoid charge. &nbsp;But no need as per my point #1 above.</div>

 will help me fix the problem. I have never believed this was real and today I pretended I was going along with them and asked if they were going to access my computer to fix it and they said yes. I then got mad and told them what I thought of them.&nbsp; They have
 called me in the past and I tell them not to call but they continue to do so. Is there anything that Windows can do about this?</p>

            <p>As Patrick has already noted,&nbsp;<br />
unsolicited Phone calls, for support saying virus infection and/or similar thing, are always scams......Giving control of your pc to unknown party could be pretty much harmful.. They can do&nbsp;<strong><span>anything</span></strong>&nbsp;to your pc.&nbsp;</p>
<span>You cannot stop these things, Instead be, aware and ignore these calls at the first place you receive ..</span>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As you noted, this is a very long time running and well known string of scam calls. Do not ever listen to any of these people, and the major clue is usually noting they are from Windows and not Microsoft. Windows itself is not a corporation and/or company,
 but simply an OS developed by Microsoft. When someone who works at MS is asked where they work, they would reply with their job position at
<strong>Microsoft</strong>, not <strong>Windows</strong>.<br />

            As I was pretty desperate, I had been trying to reinstall Reader multiple times. I know I had tried killing all the processes, cleaning registry keys with CCleaner software and performing multiple installations with multiple restarts. Nothing seemed to
 help. Yesterday when I started my laptop again, Reader was working!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I am only sorry that I cannot tell the others what helped, it seems to me from a half like magic.

<h3> zachjackson1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Fall Creators 1709 Update fails on 45&#37; then reverts to version 1703</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade from Windows 1703 to 1709 has been driving me insane. I cannot get my home PC to update to 1709. Every time I attempt the update it fails on 45% with an error code saying "Windows could not configure one or more of the system components. To install
 Windows, restart the computer and then restart the installation". So I did a fair amount of Googling and it seems it's a fairly common issue (plenty of others with the same issue). I looked at some of the suggestions offered, with most saying that using the
 Media Creation Tool and manually installing the update would work. Incorrect. I ran the installation via the Media Tool and it fails with this error:&nbsp;</p>
<p>0xC1900101 - 0x30018</p>
<p>The installation failed in the FIRST_BOOT phase with an error during SYSPREP operation</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then read about that and how it could have been an old, old driver. I updated all the drivers, I deleted programs I didn't need anymore.<br />
Thought it could have been a driver for my old WiFi USB dongle, deleted it. Still fails.<br />
<br />
Unplugged all my USB devices, fails. Deleted more programs, fails. Tried, command prompts that were suggested online, fails.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have no idea what is causing the confliction. I have two other notebooks that have both updated no problems. I really don't want to clean install. I have programs that I no longer have boxes and CDs for that I still use.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So far nowhere online has there been a solution. Surely someone has managed to overcome these obstacles? Or has defeated everyone in its path and forced everyone to clean install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update is a utility used to keep your Windows-based computer up-to-date with the latest patches. Errors will occur when there are issues with the Windows Update components. To resolve your issue, we recommend performing a system restore. This option
 takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, and it won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, select <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>control panel</strong> and then choose it from the list of results.</li><li>Search <strong>Control Panel</strong> for <strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Recovery, </strong>then click <strong>Open System Restore</strong>.</li><li>Then, select <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select
<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Lastly, click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Note: If you’re not seeing any restore points, it might be because system protection isn’t turned on. To check:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Control Panel</strong>, search for <strong>Recovery</strong>, and then select
<strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Select<strong> Configure System Restore</strong>, then click <strong>Configure
</strong>and make sure <strong>Turn on system protection</strong> is selected.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're done with the system restore, try to manually download and install the updates.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Update Catalog</a></strong>.</li><li>Search for the update's KB number.</li><li>Choose the version applicable for the device and click on <strong>Download</strong>.</li><li>Install the update.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the status of the issue in this regards. Your reply is important to assist you better.
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi mate,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this issue has been on-going for almost a couple months I do not have a restore point that goes back that far. The only one I have is from 5 days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the Microsoft catalog but I have no idea what I am looking for. I can't find the 1709 KB number on my end. I can see previous updates KB numbers. I Googled it and found
<a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=windows%2010%20version%201709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a> which looks correct, but which ones do I install? Do I install all the available 1709 updates? How do I install them? Is it as simple as hitting run?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<p>We've already tried multiple troubleshooting steps and the same issue still persists. In this case, let's try to troubleshoot the issue by downloading and running the
<strong><a href="https://aka.ms/wudiag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update troubleshooter</a></strong>. This troubleshooter can automatically identify and fix issues with the update.

</p><p>If the issue still persists, we suggest to <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reset Windows Update components</a></strong>, then, manually download and install the update.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail Junk Folder showing 1 item in folder list</h2>
                    My junk folder is showing as having one item in it when I look at the folder view but it is actually empty i.e. no message shown. If I look online using a web browser or using Office Outlook (2016) they both show the correct status and empty folder. This
 is on two different machines and 2 different unconnected Microsoft Accounts. Both are running Windows 10 Pro.

            The Junk folder was actually marked as a "favourite" where it was showing one item but in the full list of folders it was not showing any items so I removed it as a favourite and then re-added it. That seems to have solved the problem.

<p>Do you mean the error <em>Send Meeting Failed.The meeting no longer exists on the server. Please create a new Skype Meeting.</em> happen when adding or removing an attendees from a previously created Microsoft Office 2013 Skype meeting invitation?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If yes, to troubleshoot this issue, I suggest you do the following troubleshooting steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Please log your account into Outlook Web App to check if the meeting is still there. If yes, Please check if you cana add or remove attendee in it.</li><li>If you cannot find the meeting request, which means the meeting doesn’t exist on your server. In this situation, please try to create a new meeting to see if he issue still happens.</li><li>Does this issue happen to all meeting invitations or just some specific one.</li><li>A screenshot of the symptom.</li><li>Are these invitations on your calendar or other user’s calendars? Did you assign any delegate permissions?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            How can I recapture my most recent downloaded pictures when the computer does an update and wants to reload every picture again from my camera...&#63;</h2>
                    When I have accepted automatic updates to my computer when available, several times the next time I go to load new picutes taken with my Sony camera - the computer requires me to load all the pictures again.&nbsp; One of the best things I love about Windows
 Vista is the fact that Vista automatically rotates my photographs, right-side up and saves the last photo uploaded so it doesn't have to start from the beginning.&nbsp; But, twice now, in the past several months, I've had to reload all of my pictues again.&nbsp; The
 bad part about it is that I tried to delete pictures loaded under previous "tags" to reload - so all of those pictues wouldn't be there again, but it started deleting the picture folders I had for them and I had to just reinstall everything again.&nbsp; There are
 WAY too many picutes on my computer from my camera - but I'm afraid to delete any of the folders (where I downloaded them before moving them to individual folders by "content") because I don't want to lose anythi

<p><span>Hi Jlc III,</span></p>
<p><span>Windows detects your newest pictures and videos and doesn't import duplicate versions of older pictures or videos that you've
 already copied to your computer, so you can import your pictures and videos in a single step. You can then review and organize your pictures in the Pictures library</span></p>
<p><span>Try to change the settings so that it there is no duplication of the pictures.</span></p>
<p><span>Connect your camera to the computer</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the option “Import Pictures”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You will see a small window “Importing pictures and videos”. Here you can enter a tag name if you want to.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the same screen click on “Options” which will open another windows “import settings”.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You can set options as to which folder to import and click “ok” and then “import”.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>After the importing is complete turn off the camera and remove the connection form your PC.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If you have all your pictures in one folder you may delete the photos which are repeated and after you change the settings
 you can make sure that the photos are not duplicated.</span></p>

<p>Hi Sandra,</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you receive any error messages when you tried to connect your camera to your PC?</li><li>Have you seen any light indicator when you connected your camera to your PC?</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>I realized my problem.&nbsp; Canon Powershot ELPH 190 SI &nbsp;has no built in internal memory and didn't come with a memory card therefore has no storage whatsoever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Walmart website forgot to mention <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">the necessary and required</span> additional purchase of a memory card. &nbsp;The USB cable was not included either.</p>

</p><p>I'm having the same problem, (when I've been watching in Task manager,) I've seen that my computer memory has gotten to 99% and my disk has gotten to 75-85% and then I USUALLY get a blank, black, still back lit screen, sometimes with the white pointer that
 tracks correctly but doesn't change the screen when clicked. I'm afraid to know how many times I've cold booted my computer bse of this black screen.</p>
<p>I am NOT a computer literate person so please "speak slowly and avoid big words" lol. I'm learning.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm running the "sfc /scannow" in admin command prompt, following the directions on this *https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833#bookmark-use%20the%20system%20file%20checker%20tool*</p>
<p>page, hoping I don't break anything, In the screen shot you can see (other than the jumping goats) Windows Performance Recorder and Task manager. When I started to have this screen pop up for about the 900th time today, I tried to make record but it says
 there's not enough storage (FWIW, I have over 300G of the machine empty/available)</p>
<p>Anyone have a brilliant idea?</p>

<h2>            Vista keeps dropping wireless adapter</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I have a desk top PC connected to a wireless network via a Netgear wgt11 network adapter.&nbsp; After a few hours or so Windows keeps dropping the connection and when I try to reconnect through network and sharing it says there is no adapter connected. I have tried
 a new adapter and the same happends, also if i use the software shipped with either card the same happends. I also have a laptop PC connected wirelessly to tha same network router and have no issues with its connection. Any ideas?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible solution? And I would<br />
update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are you positioned from the router? Are there
<br />
obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's tab - write
<br />
down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then<br />
Right Click on Wifi Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />

How to Install a Device Driver in Vista Device Manager<br />

<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions. (The<br />
ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated drivers as Vista loves<br />
updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests one just HIDE it as they<br />
are almost alway old and you can look for drivers manually as needed.<br />

<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Make sure you know the login details for your wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />
<br />
You will lose connection when doing this and have to redo your logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network &amp; Sharing Center - on Right Side click Customize - Set Network Locations page -<br />
on lower left click Merge or delete networks&nbsp;locations&nbsp;- DELETE ALL instances of your network&nbsp;(and any&nbsp;<br />
others you no longer use) - REBOOT.&nbsp;Start - Connect To to logon on to Network.<br />

            <p>Hi Paven,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply, I will try your suggestion soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried all other option from regedit to safe mode and all that , the actual profile is not there at all. There is only one profile in the profile list the main user and admin account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will let you know how I go with the clean boot option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will say this much though, it is very disappointing that I need to work hours and hours on an unfinished program. So far I have spent at least 25 - 30 hours of reading and testing back and forth. This is very frustrating and it seams that Microsoft is
 aware of the problem and still hasn't fixed it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly my laptop works well an upgrade from WIN 7 home to WIN 10 Home, the desktop is a HP with win 10 , but it behaves differently in &nbsp;a lot of ways. It may have been a factory upgrade from win 8.1.

            <p>As of June 4, 2016, there is NO version of Google Earth compatible with Windows 10. &nbsp;If you go to OFFICIAL Google Earth website, it states quite clearly that it only works for Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7. &nbsp;It looks like Google isn't
 going to continue providing Google Earth for newer Windows versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are getting scammed if you go anywhere else for Google Earth. &nbsp;Especially to softronic.com, which is nothing but a scam site that pretends to have software it can't possibly have. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Size of the Touch Keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Size of the Touch Keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>when comparing the size of the Touch keyboard of W10 14393.1593 vs 14393.2430 the new keyboard is about 30% higher.
</p>
<p>The single character key had a size of 54 Pixel and the new one has a size of 70 Pixel. This effects our software in a bad way.</p>
<p>Is there a way to change the size especially the height of the keyboard? In earlier versions of W10 it was possible to change the scaling by using a registry key, but this key is not present any longer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stefan </p>

<p><span>Hi Stefan,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Could you please confirm the make and model of your system?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are speaking about the ‘On screen Keyboard’ enabled from the settings, this can be resized just by moving the cursor at the corner of your ‘On-screen Keyboard’. Right-click when the cursor changes, and resize it to the
 appropriate size.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If this is a ‘Touch Keyboard’ for the tablet, you will be able to find a small rectangle button at the top-right corner of your ‘Touch Keyboard’ which can be used to enlarge or shrink the size of the ‘Touch Keyboard’.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it works.</span></p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>maybe I should have told you that I am talking about an embedded system. </p>
<p>It is not possible to change the size of the keyboard by picking on of the corners.
</p>
<p>The little rectangle top right of the keyboard switches only between the docked and floating mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an image of the two different keyboards, the left side shows the old one (1593) the right one the newer (2430).</p>
