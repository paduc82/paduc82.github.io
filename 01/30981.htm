<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I do not think that you will be able to connect the laptop as the monitor to a desktop as there will be no connectors
 available. You might check with the Technical shops if they can provide the connector, if the connector is available then you may go ahead and try connecting the laptop to the desktop and check.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may use the ‚ÄúPCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) card‚Äù or ‚ÄúPC card‚Äù to connect your
 laptop as a monitor to the desktop only if your laptop has the slot for the same.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>OK.&nbsp; You can "share" the Canon printer, which means that you will be able to print to it from your laptop when your laptop is connected wirelessly to your router.</p>
<p>This is called "file and printer sharing" and here's some basic advice on setting it up, courtesy MVP Malke (you've already completed Part A, so start with Part B). Read the part in the first paragraph that I have bolded.&nbsp; If you don't understand the final
 paragraph about sharing the printer, read one or more of the articles from the Google search.</p>
<p>You can also look at any or all of the first 5 links from this Google search: <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=xp+sharing+printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=xp+sharing+printer<br />
</a></p>
<p>If you want to share the scanning function of your Canon, you'll have to read its manual to see (a) if that's possible and (b) how to set it up.&nbsp; It usually just involves using the Canon CD to install the printer and its necessary software on your laptop
 and letting that installer know that the Canon is a shared network resource.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The best and easiest solution is to purchase a wireless router. That way you<br />
get Internet connectivity to both machines and the added benefit of some<br />
more security between you and the Internet. Then you set up your wireless<br />
network securely, and then you set up file/printer sharing. Below is<br />
information about setting up a router and also doing networking. <strong>It looks<br />
lengthy but don't be daunted. Setting up a router and Local Area Network<br />
sharing between two computers takes approximately 15 minutes.</strong>
<br />
<br />
A. Router configuration<br />
<br />
Setting up a router is quite simple. Normally you run the CD that came with<br />
the router and follow the instructions. If you're running Vista perhaps the<br />
CD that came with the router won't work; I don't know this. But you can set<br />
up the router without a CD. Note that if you have cable Internet, for the<br />
connection you just set the router to do DHCP (or there may even be a<br />
choice of cable for you to select). If you have DSL Internet, you usually<br />
select PPoe and enter the username and password which you chose when<br />
originally setting up the DSL connection. So:<br />
<br />
1. Turn off the power to your cable modem.<br />
2. Attach a cat5e ethernet cable (usually provided with the router) going<br />
from the router's Internet/WAN port to the cable modem's ethernet port.<br />
3. Attach a cat5e ethernet cable going from your computer's network adapter<br />
to one of the ports on the router. If you don't have an ethernet cable<br />
(because you were using USB), you will need to go to the store and buy one.<br />
4. Turn on the cable modem. After all the lights are on, turn on the router.<br />
<br />
To configure the router:<br />
<br />
Have a computer connected to the router with an ethernet cable. Examples<br />
given are for a Linksys router. Refer to your router manual or the router<br />
mftr.'s website for default settings if you don't have a Linksys. Open a<br />
browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox and in the addressbar type:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://192.168.1.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://192.168.1.1</a>
 [enter] (this is the router's default IP address, which<br />
varies from router to router so check your manual)<br />
<br />
This will bring you to router's login screen. The default username is left<br />
blank and the Linksys default password is "admin" without the quotes. Enter<br />
that information. You are now in the router's configuration utility. Your<br />
configuration utility may differ slightly from mine.<br />
<br />
Click on the Administration link at the top of the page. Enter your new<br />
password. WRITE IT DOWN SOMEWHERE YOU WILL NOT LOSE IT. Re-enter the<br />
password to confirm it and click the Save Settings button at the bottom of<br />
the page. The router will restart and present you with the login box again.<br />
Leave the username blank and put in your new password to get back into the<br />
configuration utility.<br />
<br />
Now click on the Wireless link at the top of the page. Change the Wireless<br />
Network Name (SSID) from the default to something you will recognize. I<br />
suggest that my clients not use their family name as the SSID. For example,<br />
you might wish to name your wireless network "CastleAnthrax" or the<br />
like. <span><span>;-)</span>
</span>
<br />
<br />
Click the Save Settings and when you get the prompt that your changes were<br />
successful, click on the Wireless Security link which is right next to the<br />
Basic Wireless Settings link (where you changed your SSID). If you have a<br />
newish computer, you will be able to set the Security Mode to<br />
WPA2-Personal. Do that and enter a passphrase. The passphrase is what you<br />
will enter on any computers that are allowed to connect to the wireless<br />
network. WRITE IT DOWN SOMEWHERE YOU WILL NOT LOSE IT.<br />
<br />
At this point, your router is configured and if the computer you were using<br />
to configure the router is normally going to connect wirelessly, disconnect<br />
the ethernet cable and the computer's wireless feature should see your new<br />
network. Enter the passphrase you created to join the network and start<br />
surfing.<br />
*****<br />
<br />
B. File/printer sharing<br />
<br />
Excellent, thorough, yet easy to understand article about File/Printer<br />
Sharing in Vista. Includes details about sharing printers as well as files<br />
and folders:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727037.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727037.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />
For XP, start by running the Network Setup Wizard on all machines (see<br />
caveat in Item A below).<br />
<br />
Problems sharing files between computers on a network are generally caused<br />
by 1) a misconfigured firewall or overlooked firewall (including a stateful<br />
firewall in a VPN); or 2) inadvertently running two firewalls such as the<br />
built-in Windows Firewall and a third-party firewall; and/or 3) not having<br />
identical user accounts and passwords on all Workgroup machines; 4) trying<br />
to create shares where the operating system does not permit it.<br />
<br />
A. Configure firewalls on all machines to allow the Local Area Network (LAN)<br />
traffic as trusted. With Windows Firewall, this means allowing File/Printer<br />
Sharing on the Exceptions tab. Normally running the Network Setup Wizard on<br />
XP will take care of this for those machines.The only "gotcha" is that this<br />
will turn on the XPSP2 Windows Firewall. If you aren't running a<br />
third-party firewall or have an antivirus with "Internet Worm<br />
Protection" (like Norton 2006/07) which acts as a firewall, then you're<br />
fine. With third-party firewalls, I usually configure the LAN allowance<br />
with an IP range. Ex. would be 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.254. Obviously you<br />
would substitute your correct subnet. Do not run more than one firewall. DO<br />
NOT TURN OFF FIREWALLS; CONFIGURE THEM CORRECTLY.<br />
<br />
B. For ease of organization, put all computers in the same Workgroup. This<br />
is done from the System applet in Control Panel, Computer Name tab.<br />
<br />
C. Create matching user accounts and passwords on all machines. You do not<br />
need to be logged into the same account on all machines and the passwords<br />
assigned to each user account can be different; the accounts/passwords just<br />
need to exist and match on all machines. DO NOT NEGLECT TO CREATE<br />
PASSWORDS, EVEN IF ONLY SIMPLE ONES. If you wish a machine to boot directly<br />
to the Desktop (into one particular user's account) for convenience, you<br />
can do this. The instructions at this link work for both XP and Vista:<br />
<br />
Configure Windows to Automatically Login (MVP Ramesh) -<br />
<a href="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/Autologon.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsxp.mvps.org/Autologon.htm</a>
<br />
<br />
D. If one or more of the computers is XP Pro or Media Center, turn off<br />
Simple File Sharing (Folder Options&gt;View tab).<br />
<br />
E. Create shares as desired. XP Home does not permit sharing of users' home<br />
directories or Program Files, but you can share folders inside those<br />
directories. A better choice is to simply use the Shared Documents folder.<br />
See the first link above for details about Vista sharing.<br />
<br />
F. After you have file sharing working (and have tested this by exchanging a<br />
file between all machines), if you want to share a printer connected<br />
locally to one of your computers, share it out from that machine. Then go<br />
to the printer mftr.'s website and download the latest drivers for the<br />
correct operating system(s). Install them on the target machine(s). The<br />
printer should be seen during the installation routine. If it is not,<br />
install the drivers and then use the Add Printer Wizard. In some instances,<br />
certain printers need to be installed as Local printers but that is outside<br />
of this response.<br />

<p>Hi Robin,</p>
<p>The Microsoft 6to4 adapter encapsulates IPv6 packets by using an IPv4 header. This functionality enables the client to transport IPv6 traffic over an IPv4 infrastructure. This approach lets organizations slowly migrate to an IPv6 infrastructure without having
 to spend excessive time and financial resources to convert to the new infrastructure.</p>
<p>In some cases, you will see the error code 31 or even error code 10 for this adapter. One reason is your adapter does not support this feature.</p>
<p>Follow these steps and check if it helps resolve the issue</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>You can try to update your Network adapter and your chipset to see if that resolves the issue, please look on the hardware provider‚Äôs website for updates for your components.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>Uninstall and reinstall this component.</p>
<p>A. To uninstall the component, right-click the item in Device Manager and select Uninstall.</p>
<p>B. To reinstall the component, in Device Manager.</p>
<p>a. Click Action</p>
<p>b. Add Legacy Hardware ‚Äì Next</p>
<p>c. ‚ÄúInstall the hardware that I manually select from a list‚Äù</p>
<p>d. Network adapters ‚Äì Microsoft ‚Äì Microsoft 6to4 Adapter ‚Äì Next ‚Äì Finish the wizard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>If the steps above doesn‚Äôt solve the problem, your network adapter is not a supportive one for this component. You can completely ignore this error, if there isn‚Äôt IPv6 network deployed in the environment. The error won‚Äôt affect your system.</p>
<p><strong>To remove the error message, </strong></p>
<p>a. Click start and type "<strong>CMD</strong> " in the search box</p>
<p>b. Please right-click the Command Prompt and run as administrator,</p>
<p>c. Type the command "<strong>netsh in 6to4 set state disable</strong> ", press Enter. The component will be disabled and hidden.</p>

<h2>            OG Timesplitters 2 and Timesplitters Future Perfect&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Seeing how OG games are making a strong comeback, is there a possibility Timesplitters 2 and Future Perfect could be revived? I know there is a dedicated team of passionate fans that have been working on "Timesplitters Rewind" since 2013 and that there is still a strong, anxious community amongst us. This series really stood out and provided hours of fun and hilarious gameplay, not to mention a compelling soundtrack and memorable characters. The "mapmaker" feature was awesome and allowed players to create their own multiplayer maps as well as challenges and story missions. </p><p><br /></p><p>In my opinion these games were ahead of their time and in a league of their own compared to the more serious shooters of the time. I'm still hopeful I'll live to see Timesplitters 4 become a reality along with "Timesplitters Rewind." I know it's a longshot seeing how the former developer "Free Radical" no longer exists, but if it is possible, would the Back Compat Team consider these games?&nbsp;</

<br />
You can *probably* preserve the contents of the current hibernation file by pulling the plug on your system. To be sure you would need to test this on a different system. You could then do this:<br />
<ol>
<li>Boot the machine into Repair Mode, using your Windows Repair CD. Alternatively you could boot it with an Ubuntu boot CD or USB flash disk.</li><li>Use some advanced console commands to unprotect the hibernation file.</li><li>Rename the hibernation file to h.sys.</li><li>Reboot normally. Windows will create a new hibernation file.<br />
</li><li>Use some character extraction script to extract all ASCII characters from h.sys.</li><li>Search the resulting file for some keywords that existed in your lost writeup.<br />
</li></ol>
It's a lot of work. Redoing the writeup might be faster. Alternatively, if you used an app such as MS Word for your work then its AutoSave feature might contain parts of your work.<br />
<br />
I have never seen any reference to a flag (probably a registry flag) that forces a reboot from an existing hibernation file.<br />

                    Hello. I`m using&nbsp;Skype version 8.39.0.180 and the person who i`m calling uses Skype version 7.36.0.150. First of all, weirdly it says that version 7.36.... is the newest one. But ok. So the problem is that When i call they are not receiving my call. And
 other way around. tried to reinstall, still nothing. But chat part works.

            Hi KlƒÅvs,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Can you chat with them and find out whether they have been receiving calls from others but not from you only?
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>Hey. Yeah thanks for the answer, no she hasn`t cause she only uses skype for us to talk, and at this time i don`t have any contact online as well, cause i`m not using skype that much myself. So if you have any ideas, what might be the problem i would truly
 appreciate it.</p>

            Problem should be on her side as she has been using a very old version of Skype which is out of support now. To determine this, I wanted to know whether she has been receiving the calls from other or not.
<br />
<br />She can install latest version of Skype from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>

<p>Yeah but the thing is that when opening update in the program it shows it`s the newest one. As she is older (my grandmother) she has no clue how to do all that. but i`ll try the link tomorrow. Thank you very much. Could it be that it shows it's up to date
 cause she has Win xp? I`m not that smart in all of this myself.</p>

<p>Hi, same issue ! Since MS took hands on Skype, the situation has become ... Well !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't talk to my Mom, using an XP SP3, as since this morning no way anymore to connect ! After loosing all the day for a solution, asking on @SupportSkype which doesn't care, my best bet has been to switch to another software !</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Klavs, the issue is not the PC, XP SP3 or I don't know what. They have propably locked out the 7.36 XP Users... Don't bother loosing time or searching for a fix... Switch to another easy to use software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Michel.</p>

<p>1. In which application or program do you want to use the Spell Check feature?</p>
<p>Windows 7 operating system does not include a spell checker. If you have applications like Windows Live Mail or Microsoft Office, then these applications have the spell checking
 functionality.</p>
<p>Windows operating systems do not use the spell check; it‚Äôs the applications that use it. However, you can use your favorite search engine and find one.

<h2>            Windows 7 Home Premium Troubleshooting issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Toshiba Satellite U505-SP2916R with Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I change the original hard drive for a new 1TB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed the Windows with the original installation discs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the installation was completed, I tried to connect to my network but I was not able (even with cable). the icon indicates that there are no available networks.</p>
<p>at the moment I try to run the troubleshooting, I receive the below error message</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pack ID: Unknown</p>
<p>Access Route: C:\windows\diagnostics\system\networking</p>
<p>error code: 0x8E5E0247</p>
<p>Context: Restricted</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another error I am having is at the moment I click on the sound icon: a message show up:</p>
<p>Program Name: msdt.exe</p>
<p>Edit: Unknown</p>
<p>Source: Hard Drive on this computer</p>
<p>Program Location: "C:\Windows\System32\msdt.exe" -path</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "C:\Windows\Diagnostics\Index\AudioPlayback-skip yes -elevated yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>According what I have been reading, I would say the problem is related to the new Hard Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate your support on how I can fix this problem.</p>
<p>

            <p>It is unlikely that your problem connecting has anything to do with your new hard drive, but rather with the drivers that you did or did not install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your only safe source of drivers is the Toshiba support web site.&nbsp; Go there and find your model.&nbsp; Download all the drivers they offer there.&nbsp; Obviously, you will need a working computer to do this, so use someone else's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install all those drivers.</p>

                    <p>Hi. Getting BSOD a number of times a day now - <strong>bad pool caller</strong>. Sometimes every few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried my best to do some diagnostics based on other posts I've read. Not a great computer techy. Not sure how to analyse the results from memory dumps though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if what apps I had open at the time or what I was doing is relevant? But I normally have Spotify open, Google Chrome, VLC when it happens. The last but one BSOD I was just opening a music vid in VLC. But then after it rebooted and I only had Google
 Chrome open and it crashed again. I had clicked on Restore Pages, due to previous crash. I had about 8 tabs open. One of them YouTube music/audio playing. I think I have seen it get unstable with 6+ tabs open and audio playing. But not for the first 10months
 of buying this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've completed a hardware test on the memory, using USB bootup stick. All 16GB ok after 9 passes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run debugDiag, on minidumps (last 3) and main memory.dmp. Can give output if required. This&nbsp;ntkrnlmp.exe keeps appearing as a possible issue, but I've no idea :( Also&nbsp;Failed 0x80010105.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can please help and give me directions I will provide all info that is required.</p>

<h2>            Device Manger is empty on Windows XP.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> Device Manager Recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enabling plug and play and editing the registry permissions and allowances. All seems to be in order. But the Device Manager is still empty.&nbsp; Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me if you can. I have been struggling with this problem for 10 day's now. I am using Windows XP Every thing seems to work apart from the Device Manager. I thought at first that I had a problem with the DVD/CD units and possibly the wireless mouse
 and keyboard, but then I discovered that the Device Manager was empty. I have tried to recover it using what I thought to be the appropriate Windows Fix it solutions. I also triedthe solutions suggested by Members in the help desk history. ie: Method 1 ;&nbsp;Enabling
 the&nbsp;Plug and Play Service and Method 2;&nbsp;Checking the&nbsp;Edit and registry permissions. No change, the Device Manager is still empty. I also tried to use the recovery system but that will only go back 5 days. I can't reload Windows as the DVD player will not run
 the disc. Thanking you in anticipation. Regards</p>

    <title>Index Card App for Research Papers&#63;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ak360  say:</h3>
<h2>            Index Card App for Research Papers&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>For the past year, I have been searching for an index card app to fit my needs for a Windows tablet, to no avail. HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Index Card Method:</p>
<p>Typically, as I review research, if I find something that I think will be helpful, I put a topic, the source, and the information (paraphrased) on an index card (see https://www.gallaudet.edu/tip/english-center/writing/pre-writing-writing-and-revising/note-card-system.html).
 When I am done reviewing all helpful resources, I usually have enough in a stack to start writing, and I organize my notecards accordingly, and then start typing. I also keep a separate stack of full citations only, to help with the works cited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to upgrade to an electronic version of this, as it reduces clutter, and I can write/type notecards as I am reading them (ex: on the bus, waiting in line, etc). However, I cannot find an app that works with this system. Most of them are only
 available for iPads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have tried:</p>
<p>Flashcards Pro</p>
<p>MyFlashCards Beta</p>
<p>Ultimate Flash Cards</p>
<p>Ultimate Ink Flash Cards</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem is that when people are using index cards, it's usually to memorize, and not to organize. Anyone have suggestions? I have looked up tons of app lists, and have come up with little. I'm willing to pay, since it'll save me money on supplies
 in the long run.</p>

<h2>            Move back to Windows 7 after Windows 10 upgrade in Safe mode</h2>
                    Been spending many, many hours on trying to revert back to Windows 7 after upgrading to Windows 10. &nbsp;The Windows 10 upgrade got to the point where I would have a black screen with a mouse pointer only visible. &nbsp;There are many nice folks out their including
 on this forum who have been able to fix this issue. &nbsp;I have tried all of the solutions presented and none have worked. &nbsp;I have come to the conclusion that this is a video driver problem. &nbsp;Going to the Dell site I'm being told their is no driver update so essentially
 I'm stuck. &nbsp;I can get into Safe Mode however, I cannot seem to move back to Windows 7 from Safe Mode. &nbsp;Does anyone know of anyway I can revert back to my Windows 7 from SafeMode. &nbsp;I'm kicking myself for doing this upgrade to 10 as my Windows 7 machine was
 working great.

            Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends)
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this(one if you have already run activation troubleshooter)
<br />
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below or use the chat support link(weekdays only)
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/405170...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            Hi LargeSoup,
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new PC or Motherboard, if it is OEM it will not . .. 
<br />
<br />
<br />What you can try is this:
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 10 Product Key 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a> 
<br />
<br />Go to Settings - Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />Try entering that product key there to activate Windows 
<br />
<br />Otherwise, have that product key at hand and contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Choose a local Phone Number:

<p>Hi, Since Silent Hill 4: The Room was never released on the Xbox 360 (it was released on the original Xbox), then I highly doubt that it will become compatible on the Xbox One. &nbsp;If you would like original Xbox games to be compatible, then make a new post
 asking for it on the Xbox feedback website here <a href="http://feedback.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
