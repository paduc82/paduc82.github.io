<h2>            &#34;System Fix&#34; malware corrupted Windows on my PC. What now&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My PC was infected with the malware known as "System Fix,"&nbsp;a trojan which bombarded me with pop-ups threatening that my system would fail if I didn't immediately buy their $80 full-version&nbsp;software.&nbsp;I downloaded SpyHunter and removed the malware, but my
 desktop is now black, my desktop icons are gone, and my programs and Internet Explorer take longer to load. I'm assuming that the Windows on my PC was corrupted. Any way I can fix this? Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Remove System Fix<strong> (Uninstall Guide) &lt;-- read this link for removal instructions<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-system-fix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-system-fix</a><br />
<br />
Use the methods in the above guide FIRST and those in the previous troublshooter<br />
to be sure the malware has been totally removed. Those may also restore your system<br />
back to its normal working order.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If needed :<br />
<br />
All your files and programs should still be on the computer. Be sure you are logged on<br />
as ADMIN and use Start - Computer&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Explorer to naviage to <br />
<br />
C:\Program Files&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for your programs - you can put shortcuts back on the Start Menu.<br />
<br />
C:\Users\Your User Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for your files.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>You can try a System Restore HOWEVER make sure it is back to a point before you
<br />
contracted the malware IF you have those points available.<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
These help is some cases - you need to ensure the date on the files is before you<br />
contracted the malware.<br />
<br />
There are backups in the C:\Windows\System32\Config\Regback folder.</p>
<p><br />
Use these methods to replace the registry with a backup.<br />
<br />
Boot with a Windows 7 disk. Both of the below accomplish restoring<br />

(This is Vista and Windows 7 is the same)<br />

<h2>            How to add individual games to &#34;Allowed Apps and Games&#34;</h2>
                    <p>We are using the current Microsoft Account with family options.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it seems that you can only allow or block games by age rating.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>We want to allow our child to be able to play Halo without being able to play Grand Theft Auto.</p>
<p>On the Xbox there is a way to allow single games to be played, but this permission does not allow the same game on Windows 10.&nbsp; How do we allow individual games on Windows 10 without changing the global setting to allow all games?</p>

            Yeah, I have read a TON of stuff on your forum before posting my question, and that does NOT answer my question.&nbsp; There is not a way for him to ask permission to play a game on Windows (unlike Xbox which does).&nbsp; We are able to do it fine on the Xbox platforms.&nbsp;
 Looking for a way to add individual games (not age limits, but specific games) to the permissions on Windows 10<br />

            Hi Cassie, if the reset operation is not completing, then the Recovery Image is corrupt, your son's best option is to clean install Windows 10, which will also repair the Recovery Image . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

            When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hello scottyw,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Try rebooting your computer to see if this helps. If your&nbsp;having&nbsp;trouble with a file/folder then try taking ownership of it, here are the steps below:
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Here are the steps to modify ownership and permissions:<br />
</strong></span>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li><span>Right-click the file or folder, click
<strong>Properties</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</span>
</li><li><span>Click <strong>Advanced</strong>, and then click the
<strong>Owner</strong> tab.</span> </li><li><span>Click <strong>Edit</strong>, and then do one of the following:</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>·To change the owner to a user or group that is not listed, click
<strong>Other users and groups </strong>and, in <strong>Enter the object name to select (examples)</strong>, type the name of the user or group, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><strong><br />
To change the owner to a user or group that is listed, in the Change owner to box, click the new owner.</strong>
</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to take ownership of the contents of the folder, select the
<strong>Replace owner on subcontainers and objects</strong> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>
OK</strong>, and then click <strong>Yes</strong> when you receive the following message:
</span></p>
<p><span>You do not have permission to read the contents of directory
<em>folder name</em>. Do you want to replace the directory permissions with permissions granting you Full Control?</span></p>
<p><span>All permissions will be replaced if you click
<strong>Yes</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: &nbsp;</strong><em>folder name</em> is the name of the folder that you want to take ownership of.
</span></p>
<p><span>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>
OK</strong>, and then reapply the permissions and security settings that you want for the folder and its contents.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Additional considerations:</span></span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>An administrator can take ownership of any file on the computer.
</span></li><li><span>Assigning ownership of a file or a folder might require you to elevate your permissions using User Access Control.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Hope this helps you.&nbsp;Let us know either way. Make it a great day!</strong></span>&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p><br />

            What Bing icon? How did it get there? Having a Bing icon on your Desktop isn't part of Vista. It either came preinstalled, with some program, or you put it there. More details please so you can get the focused help you want.<br />

            Thanks very much for your reply, but I'm trying to remove an icon for the shortcut to Bing. It's not a file or a folder. I can't even change the properties of the icon. Microsoft is trying to force me to leave it on MY computer and I want it off.

<p>Hello scottyw,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Have you tried to removing the Bing Search bar thru the add and remove programs? I thought you meant left over reminents, which would be in files and folders. Icons are part of the program as you know. Try to remove it there and you should be good to go. Microsoft
 is not making you keep the Bing Search bar! Hope this helps you. Let us know either way. Make it a great day!<br />
<br />

<p>Thanks again for your reply, but it's not the search bar it is a icon, like you would have for a shortcut. Just a small icon and when I try to remove it or delete it or do any thing else to it a box pops up that says permission denied. I am in the administrator
 log on. I still think that microsoft is doing this to try to force me to keep Bing on my desktop.&nbsp; Thank you very much for your help.</p>

 Bing search tool bar or any type of file or folder just the icon on my desktop.&nbsp; Thanks and sorry if I double posted this question.

            The Bing icon got on my desktop because I thought I would give Bing a try when Microsoft came out with it. Everwhere I turned there was a add for it&nbsp;from Microsoft. Well I tried it and I don't like it but now I can't get rid of it.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.

<h2>            N7 Class Discussion</h2>
                    Alot of us have had some time with the new characters so I just wanted to know what you guys think about certain ones. Who is your favorite so far? Which ones would you feel comfortable with on Gold/Platinum? Which one do you least enjoy? Share your builds
 &amp; weapon choice as well. I was really excited about this DLC and so happy I unlocked everybody right away so I'm interested to hear other players thoughs. CAMAROBOY already touched on the Demolisher in his thread so cheers for that.

<p>I got on late and only bought a couple premium packs last night. Luckily&nbsp;I unlocked the N7 Demolisher Engineer on my 2nd pack&nbsp;and I LOVE that character. &nbsp;Not only does his cone drop out ammo and grenades every couple seconds IT ALSO HEALS YOU!! &nbsp;I was hoping
 they would have another character that heals people and here it is!! Then on top of that I can hold 7 grenades (homing rockets). &nbsp;So technically I can shoot out 14 grenades (homing rockets) and get resupplied every few seconds!!!! The cone also does a little
 bit of damage. I mainly specd it&nbsp;to&nbsp;produce more ammo and grenades. But it could be specd to work as a defense&nbsp;cone to heal people.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I actually think this character could have a pretty good chance on at least gold. Not sure about platinum. &nbsp;I would plant
 the cone right behind the person with the decoy. That way it heals them and everyone gets free ammo along with free grenades. &nbsp;Love this character!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this character combined with the Geth Engineer would be sick. Especialy if the geth turret was set
 up to heal people.</p>

<p>Right now I'm leaning towards the N7 Shadow (6-6-6-0-6) with Harrier 3 &amp; N7 Fury (6-6-6-4-4) with Hurricane I as my favs. For the N7 Shadow I play her like stealth ninja lol. I spec'd for duration so I can Shadow Strike twice or use the other power. I sort
 of play from a distance and pick my targets to assassinate (thats why i equipped the Harrier).I think I'm going to try the new Piranha with her tonight tho. She did great on Gold and I think if a player is skilled enough she can be used on Platinum as well.
 The character I'm least interested in as of right now is the Paladin tho, I spec'd into everything and decided to leave out Incinderate. Will see how he does with the Harrier today.</p>

<p>I only have the Paladin, but Snap Freeze is absolutely amazing. &nbsp;It hits through cover, and even thick walls (like those on Firebase Glacier). &nbsp;It's range is deceptively long as well. &nbsp;I have been playing him with just a Hurricane equipped, and between the
 burst of that gun and a Snap Freeze every 2 seconds, it has been a blast to play him on smaller maps. &nbsp;He's not so hot on wide open ones though.</p>

<p>The DESTROYER is awesome. The armor ability with the N7 Typhoon literally sweeps up all weaker enemies in sight. With the magazine upgrade and accuracy upgrade on the armor you can keep a steady stream of bullets on an enemies head. Two clips kills all big
 enemies on Gold.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The missile launcher ability with the multi-missile upgrade is really good on unshielded enemies because it stuns them briefly. They also fire while your running so they can keep a pathway open for you. It is also helps sweep up those pesky swarmers. I think
 they fire while reviving and doing objectives but I'm always in the middle of bullets and explosions so I could be wrong. I wish the lock-on was a bit more controllable.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The multi-frag move could have been better. As of right now I really don't like it so I respec'd him to have zero points on it. If it had a set spread I would have been a whole lot better. Plus I wanted as much shields and health I could get because the
 missile launcher ability drops your shields 45% when active.</p>

<p>I had 2 friends last night that unlocked the Destroyer and he looked like a lot of fun. I like how the rockets just shoot out every couple seconds. Its exactly like a turret but attached to your shoulder.

<p>This guy thought I was doing the missile glitch because I just let the rockets finish off swarmers. It was hilarious. I plugged my mic in to tell him to come check it out and he was so upset he didn't have it yet. They also help weaken the bigger enemies
 but you must have cover when using it against them.</p>

<p>I didn't like the Missiles at all, I respec'd him with only 3 points in missiles. I just use it to clear swarmers lol. The MultiFrags were way better to me. But he is a MONSTER! Probably my 3rd fav and will become my top fav when I unlock the Typhoon. I
 saw what it can do on Platinum and it's INSANE! For now he has to use the Harrier 3 (which isn't a bad replacement at all. Oh an the build I use for him 6-3-6-6-5.

<p>I'll have to try it out again. I was exhausted when I got home from work yesterday and he was the 1st I tried out so I wasn't all the way focused lol. Anybody have any thoughts on the N7 Slayer? I had high hopes for him but unfortunately I experienced the
 Vanguard glitch for the 1st time while using him, it was hilarious but it SUCKED! I want to like him so I think I'm going to try the 6-3-6-5-6 build with a Talon VI (or maybe with a sniper and play a laid back vanguard).</p>

<p>The Destroyer is nice, people are saying the rank 6 homing missles are great against phantoms. Have yet to try that. I reeeeally want to try the typhoon on my AJ lol I hope its not too heavy @ rank X (plus i have the extra weight capacity and the decrease
 AR weight by 30% on my AJ) I just like equipping big guns on her. </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 reset</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10 from my 8.1 and was facing a few driver issues, so I decided to reset my machine. Its been 3 hours now and it still says its just 6% complete. It is not stuck but progressing very slowly. Is there a problem or does it take
 this long? How much time does it normally take? I'm afraid of power failure in which case the whole thing will be screwed.</p>

            <p>Hello Vedvrat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the issue description, I understand that you did a system reset and it is stuck on 16%. I will certainly help you with the query.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to the reply posted by “<strong>Malacath</strong>” I would like to suggest you to upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 by going to the Windows 10 Software Download page to download the Media Creation
 Tool. The Media Creation Tool can be used to create a USB or DVD media to upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 or install Windows 10 on a different PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the instructions on Windows 10 Software Download page:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10</a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <span>When upgrading to Windows 10 using media, you must run setup.exe from within your Genuine and Qualified version of Windows 7 or Windows 8. If you want to boot from media, you must
 have upgraded to Windows 10 previously. Boot from Windows 10 media directly without upgrading to Windows 10 previously is not supported and will have activation issues.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Neha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully the thing wasn't stuck and I'm now using my PC. Please let it be known though that it took 12 hours for the reset to happen, and considering the powercuts in my area, it is very dangerous and might result in me having to manually install the OS
 as you had mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer. Using the windows 10 now. :)</p>

<h2>            Video Error - Files needed to display video are not installed or not working correctly. Please restart Windows Media Center or restart the computer</h2>
                    I have Vista Version 6.0.6002.18030 (vistasp2_gdr.090429-2357) &nbsp;SP2 installed during an auto update. &nbsp;This box is only used as a Media Center
<div>I now get this error when attempting to watch any HD broadcasts - I get a few seconds of viewing before the picture starts freezing, the sound breaks up then the error message.</div>
<div>On recorded SD stations I'll often get towards the end of the program and it too starts breaking up.</div>
<div>The scanning utility I found for the Hauppage 500T tuner I have reports that all networks have 70+ strength and 100% quality.</div>
<div>The performance tab of Task Manager shows the processor cores ares running at ~25% capacity</div>
<div>I had a lot of trouble getting the Pioneer BD drive to work - it turned out to be a very minor error, a slider maxed out on the Graphics card 'overlay' tab - but before I found this it prompted me to re-install the OS from the original DVD and the problem
 remains. &nbsp;</div>
<div>The system used to work fine and there have been no hardware changes apart from the Pioneer BD drive.</div>
<div>I have had ffdshow installed from the beginning, so I don't think this is the problem.<br />
<div><br />
<div>DVDs play back OK</div>
<div>BluRay disks play back ok using the Cyberlink plug in fro VMC</div>
<div>Downloaded files of various type play OK using VLC. &nbsp;So I conclude that the (integrated) video card&nbsp;(latest drivers installed)&nbsp;and the rest of the hardware are fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Looking through the forums this seems to be an old problem, but its very curent fro me and SUPER frustrating.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any clues anyone?</div>

            Hello Chethan,
<div><br />
<div>Many thanks for the reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I had already downloaded the Tuner card driver from the website yesterday and installed it (it was the same version as I already had but there seemed no harm in re-installing it). &nbsp;No change.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I really do not understand codecs well enough! &nbsp;- presumably what you're alluding to is that the software coding the incoming signal may not be doing its job properly? &nbsp;Are the codecs part of the tuner driver? I couldn't see them on the tuner website (http://www.newmagic.com.au/Support/Hauppauge_Vista_Drivers.html)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can you please point me in the right direction for the codec pack (btw, I though 'codec packs' were notoriously bad new!? and since I've recently done a fresh install would not all the right codecs be there as they must have been before when everything
 worked fine?)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have an integrated graphic 'card' on the ASUS P5E-VM HDMI, an Intel GMA x3500 and there too I have the latest driver from Intel's web site.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think I found found the 'MS decoder checkup utility' you mention &nbsp;(http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=DE1491AC-0AB6-4990-943D-627E6ADE9FCB&amp;displaylang=en). &nbsp;I have both red crosses and green ticks for various decoders but the 'Microsoft
 MPEG-2 Video' &nbsp;decoder (msmpeg2vdec.dll.)&nbsp;is compatible with MCE but not with MP10. &nbsp;When selected the 'Update now' button is dimmed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>thanks again</div>
        </p>

<h2>            ALT is not working</h2>
                    <p>Condition:</p>
<p>ALT doesn't seem to work. </p>
<p>I always use Alt+Tab and when pressing that the action of my machine is similar to when I only press Tab.</p>
<p>ALT + F4 doesn't work either</p>
<p>
</p><p>When did this start occuring:</p>
<p>This only started few days ago after an apparent Windows 10 forced update.</p>

<p>Windows built-in troubleshooter didn't detect a problem (never does)</p>
<p>Tried different keyboards / Laptop keyboard (I use a laptop but usually use an external KB)</p>
<p>Allowed machine to restart several times (hoping for an update to fix the issue)</p>
<p>Looked for a rollback Windows version (none available)</p>
<p>Looked for a previous driver (current driver is HID keyboard device 6/21/2006 v 10.0.16299.15)</p>

<blockquote>Let’s try to update the ChipSet and the BIOS...<br />
<br />

</blockquote>
<p>I downloaded the files (they seem to come from the manufacturer's website) and proceeded to do the following:</p>
<p>A) updated/installed the chipset drivers</p>
<p>-restarted - problem persisted</p>
<p>
</p><p>B) updated the Bios (Bios updated from v 1.11 to 1.14)</p>
<p>-restarted - problem persisted</p>
<p>
</p><p>C)&nbsp;updated/installed the chipset drivers again (in case the Bios update might affect outcome)</p>
<p>-restarted - problem persisted</p>
<p>
</p><p>After restarting I open up 2 folders and attempt an Alt+Tab. However, doing so has same result as just using Tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried Alt+F4 after 2nd re-install of chipset drivers. That didn't work either (didn't close open folder)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I’ll do whatever I can to help!&nbsp;</span><br />

 vote it up because I have only seen this in a preview build (which come to think of it is the only 1803 that I use).&nbsp; I can't even reproduce this on your build with Narrator running.</p>

            What version of windows are you running? Click start, and type “winver” and hit enter, a box should pop up. 1709? 1803? 
<br />
<br />If it’s only been a few days, we can entertain rolling back to the previous build (not a perfect solution I know) but hopefully the issue would be fixed by the next update in the fall, and you’d have use of your ALT key again.

<p>'Ctrl+Alt+Tab' doesn't work either - still acts like a simple 'Tab'</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>

<p>Win+Tab works differently - it just shows the open windows but doesn't scroll through them.</p>
<p>BESIDES THAT, I don't personally find that to be an ideal solution. I like to play games, and always disable the Win key. In fact I have physically removed the Win key on my current (external) keyboard as I cannot seem to disable it through the registry</p>

            There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<h2>            No internet, secured. Then media disconnected.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, at first I had this yellow warning mark on the connection (wireless).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did fix that, setting the DNS server addresses to specific ones.</p>
<p>Though, I think I caused the media to disconnect in the process, while executing some&nbsp;<strong>ipconfig&nbsp;</strong>(/flushdns, /release, /renew) and&nbsp;<strong>netsh int ip reset.log&nbsp;</strong>orders in CMD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I try to renew my IP address it says:</p>
<strong>No operation can be performed on Local Area Connection* 10 while it has its media disconnected.</strong>
<p>
</p><p>I use Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.15063].</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How can I reconnect the media?</strong></p>
<p><strong>And, is the DNS problem caused by my laptop NIC or the ISP?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>It seems, even though I have Internet, there is still a problem with the DNS.</p>
<p>I had done this before I changed the DNS addresses with the same result.</p>

<h2>            May have accidentally uninstalled something, now getting &#39;We can&#39;t sign into your account&#39; message when starting up laptop</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure if I've selected the right topic to post this question in, hopefully it is!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night I attempted to uninstall a program that I no longer needed, and realised it was still there so I uninstalled it again. I realised in my first attempt, &nbsp;I may have accidentally uninstalled something else.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am trying to start up my laptop, and after typing in my password, my whole desktop looks different and I get a message saying 'We can't sign into your account. This problem can often be fixed by signing out of your account and then signing back in.
 If you don't sign out now, any files you create or changes you make will be lost'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, I thought I had lost all my files as everything looked empty. When I open file explorer from my task bar, and open my downloads/documents/desktop folders, they're all empty. However, if I go to my C drive &gt; user &gt; my user folder &gt; documents/downloads/desktop
 etc folders, everything is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what has happened. Does anyone know how I could fix this? Help would be greatly appreciated! (I also haven't backed up my files recently so I wouldn't be able to do a restore to an earlier time).</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've tried the system restore, and it seemed to have worked (everything appears like normal). But I also received a message saying 'System restore did not complete successfully.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also states that the source is 'AppxStaging' and 'An unspecified error occurred during System restore'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything seems fine though. Would it be okay to just continue to use my laptop and ignore that message?</p>

    <title>QC35 II connection with PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grudutu  say:</h3>
<h2>            QC35 II connection with PC</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a PC lenovo ideapad and I just acquired the noise cancelling headphones Bose QC35 II.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to be able to connect via bluetooth to listen to music on my computer.</p>
<p>When setting the device, I changed the name to 'Elena BOSE'.</p>
<p>The computer recognises and paires in bluetooth a 'LE-Elena Bose' device BUT in the 'other device' section of the bluetooth instead of the 'audio' section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, there is another device called 'Elena BOSE' (which exactly the renamming I did) that is detected, but for that one, I get the message that connexion is not possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I have some help on that? I have been going through a few forum pages but cannot find the answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!!</p>
<p>Elena</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, I did all the steps you indicated but situation exactly identical.</p>
<p>One 'Elena BOSE' not connectable.</p>
<p>One 'LE Elena BOSE' paired but in 'other devices'.</p>
<p>Further advice is welcome,</p>
<p>Best,</p>

            So I can connect trough my smartphone and the device is indeed called 'Elena BOSE'. Then I should put efforts in connecting that very one on the PC (the one that says that no connection is possible), not the other one that is in 'other device' paired list.

<h2>            Minecraft for PC won&#39;t work.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>I just installed Windows 10 this morning, everything worked fine untill I launched the PC version of Minecraft. It came up with an error telling me that if I recently installed Windows 10 I must update my graphics drivers. So I did whilst following the instructions
 Minecraft provided. However, when I installed the drivers an error message popped up saying they were not compatable with my PC. I may have installed the wrong drivers. Can someone PLEASE help me with choosing the correct drivers, my PC is running an intel
 pentium from around 2010 and is currently using the "Intel(R) Express Chipset (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM 1.1)" driver. My PC model name is "HP Pavillion Slimline S5000 Series".<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks<br />
</p>
<p>PS:&nbsp;I know there is a Windows 10 version of Minecraft, it's just that I moderate a server and I can't access it on the Windows 10 Minecraft. And I can't install mods.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the issue description you are facing issue in playing Minecraft. </span>
</p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the game in compatibility mode as well as in administrator mode&nbsp;and then see if issue persists. You may refer to the links provided below to run the game in compatibility mode.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Note: <em>The article is for Windows 8/8.1 but steps holds good for Windows 10 too.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The issue could also be related to the <strong><span>Display drivers and other updates</span></strong>. I want to inform you that&nbsp;updates will be released by Microsoft. So, I would suggest you to keep checking your Windows updates not only important
 one but optional too. If any available try to install them and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First try to install all of the&nbsp;Windows updates available and if issue persists, try to update the Display drivers by following the steps provided in the article mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to: Install and Update drivers in Windows

<p>
</p><p>We have a new Skype for Business user. He cannot connect via voice or video to other Skype for Business users. When I try to call him I get</p>

            Hi StevenMayer1 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />My apologies for asking you to seek help on Skype for Business Technet forum. SFB related question is best answered at Microsoft's Skype for Business Technet forum where Skype for Business experts answer the questions. I would suggest that you should post simultaneously (i.e. cross-post) to Technet forum also.

<p><span>Hello &nbsp;Steve,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your post in Microsoft Community. Regarding your description about “Skype - Call cannot be completed.”, &nbsp;glade to hear that after reboot the system, issue resolved. For this kind
 of error, the virus, network and system related issues cause the problem. It also depends on your organization environment like skype for business online or skype for business on-premise. This kind of issue is system related issue, so if issue persist, suggest
 you to configure affected user’s Skype for business account in different machine and check the result.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks and&nbsp;regards,</span></p>

<h2>            Is it possible to disable Media Transfer Protocol &#40;MTP&#41; in Windows XP&#47;7&#63;  Via GPO or otherwise&#63;</h2>
                    This is the protocol many Android phones, cameras and other devices use when connected to USB where it
<b>doesn't</b> create a drive letter but just shows the device itself in Windows Explorer. &nbsp;Need to know if this protocol can be disabled by GPO or another method without locking down USB ports or anything like that. &nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you want to assign a drive letter to USB device?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Can you see the device in device manager, when you plug in the device?</span></p>
<p><span>The purpose of this
<b>Media Transfer Protocol</b> is to facilitate the transfer of media files and associated metadata to/from devices. It is recommended not to disable the protocol.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the methods mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Uninstall and reinstall the USB drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>
Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>System and Maintenance</strong>, click <strong>System</strong>, and then click
<strong>Device Manager</strong>. <br />
<u>Note:</u> If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click System, and then click Device Manager.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Device Manager, double click to expand <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>, right click on the Host Controller, click
<strong>Uninstall</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
Check if at all there is an exclamation mark along the driver, it suggests issues with the driver installed.<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeat the <strong>step&nbsp;b</strong> to uninstall all items under <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.<br />
Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Change, add, or remove a drive letter</span></strong></p>

            Unfortunately, when you have controls on USB Mass Storage, they don't necessarily apply to MTP. &nbsp;It would be nice if it was possible to disable MTP over USB. &nbsp;It's kind of a gaping data loss hole.

            <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to restrict access to MTP device by removing Media Features under Turn Windows Features on or off. Of course this will remove Windows Media Player and Movie Maker etc. but since we are trying to disable MTP for official security purpose, it will
 not hurt removing these unnecessary components.&nbsp;</p>

            Removing Media Features did not help in my case. Also not sure if it would remove PTP as well.

            It appears that the phone selects the protocol. On my Sony Xperia ST21 Android 4.0.4 system, the "Settings-&gt;Xperia-&gt;Connectivity-&gt;USB connection mode" setting toggles between MTP and UMS modes. So from a security point of view it looks like you have to
 disable the negotiation from happening on the PC. Oh for a nice package management system, so we could just uninstall the dammed thing!<br />

</p><p>The primary requirement in Skype&nbsp;account deletion is account access. Given the scenario above, your friend needs to recover his account first, then close it after.
<span><strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-skype-account?q=close" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I close my Skype account?</a></strong></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, you can <strong>block and report</strong> his Skype account as the pre-cautionary measure. You can also reach out to the local authority regarding this incident.</p>

</p><p>The primary requirement in Skype&nbsp;account deletion is account access. Given the scenario above, your friend needs to recover his account first, then close it after.

<p>I saw this morning that a close friend who died two years ago was sending me a message, now in Russian not English. It invited me to look at some website. How can you you close and account of someone is dead and his details have been hacked and brought back
 to life by some crook.?</p>

<h2>            Right-click not working after upgrading to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: No Right Click</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey everyone, </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I just downloaded Windows 8.1 and had problems already with it, but fixed those. The only thing that I haven't been able to figure out is why my right click button does not work on my laptop. (BTW I have&nbsp;<span>Dell XPS Duo 12 convertible Ultrabook,
 if that h</span><span>elps</span><span>). I will give an example of how it doesn't work... EX: Say I simply want to copy and paste something to a word document, I will highlight it, then go to copy it by pressing the right click, but doesn't do anything. Another
 way of explaining of how it doesn't work, it simply just clicks as if it's also a left click. It's basically one huge left click. Now I've tried numerous things and looked up everywhere, but seems to not be happening to anyone else, but me. If anyone can help
 or give me advice in anyway please do so, it's just so frustrating. Any advice is appreciated!&nbsp;</span></div>
