<h2>            Can not get update &#40;KB2729094&#41; to go through.</h2>
                    I have tried Microsoft's site and the download troubleshooter and even tried to do this in safe mode but nothing works. How do I get this to work?

            <blockquote>And yes the computer IS haunted</blockquote>
<p>Assuming it <em>isn't</em> haunted, chances are there are two (2) primary causes for your ongoing IE problems: (a) injudicious use of registry cleaners and (b) the Norton 360 upgrades (e.g., N360&nbsp;v4.x &gt; N360 v5.x&nbsp;&gt; N360 x6.x).</p>
<p>Since you don't have any PC-Doctor backups, we can't "undo" the changes it made.</p>
<p>The multi-step fix I had you do <em>may have </em>resolved the problems if you'd never used any registry cleaners.</p>
<p>So at this point, I think your best bet would be staring over from scratch:&nbsp;Backup your personal data, format the hard-drive &amp; then do another clean install of Win7 (32-bit). See below.</p>
<p>TIP: Since your Norton 360 subscription's expiring soon, don't install Norton 360 (or any other Norton application or McAfee application) after completing the clean install. Try
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials/product-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Security Essentials</a> (free) instead which you'd install immediately upon completing the clean install and BEFORE installing ANY Windows Updates.</p>

http://experts.windows.com/w/experts_wiki/89.aspx</a></p>
<p>TIP: After completing the clean install, you'll also need to install the very latest versions of, e.g., Flash Player, Java, Adobe&nbsp;Reader, etc., again (assuming you need them).</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 1: Verify the BIOS settings</span> </p>
<p><span>Verify the computer's BIOS settings to make sure that BIOS lists and recognizes the USB. See the computer documentation or contact the hardware manufacturer for information about how to verify the BIOS settings. If not change the Boot priority to USB
 just below Hard disk or above Hard disk. <br />
<br />
After you verify that the computer's BIOS detects the USB, restart the computer, and then test to determine whether the issue is resolved. If the issue is not resolved, or if the computer's BIOS cannot detect the USB, you may have issues with your hardware.
 Contact the hardware manufacturer to inquire about how to resolve this issue.</span></p>
<p><b><span>NOTE:</span></b><span> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from
 the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can resolved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>
<p>Method 2: </p>
<div><br />
I would suggest you to run the Fixit Troubleshooter provided in the document</div>

<div>Method 2: </div>
<div><br />
Try to connect to a different port and check with the issue. If the issue still persists, try to connect the USB to a different computer and see if it is working.

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Bitlocker Recovery process</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 4 that was handed to me to restore due to the Bitlocker Recovery Process. I am not getting prompted to enter a recovery key and when I type in "manage-bde -status" I get the "ERROR: There are no disk volumes that can be protected with
 BitLocker Drive Encryption".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, nobody around here knows what he UEFI password is so I am just asking what a recommended course of action would be.</p>

<p>Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are few things you can try:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Try using another USB drive.</p>
<p>2. Try disabling Secure boot and try changing the priority of the boot order. Make sure that USB is the priority.</p>

<p>Every day it is getting harder and harder to find a good lobby on mw3. I keep running into players I cant see because they are using mods that make them god, invisible and or drop moabs. &nbsp;<span>I just ran into a group of them and this one guy kept shooting
 me with a shotgun, He was invisible and when I did get a chance to shoot him, I couldn't . He was bullet proof and when I asked him about it, he cussed me out and said there is nothing I could do but just die !!! This guy claims no one nor xbox can stop him
 &gt; [Mod removed]</span></p>
<p><span>I pay for my service and deserve fair&nbsp;gaming along with every one else.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The truth is the games are never going to be fixed, they are only going to get worse.</p>
<p>The developers don`t care,microsoft have reduced the punishment from a permanent ban to a 2 week ban for modding, just proving they don`t really care any more either.</p>
<p>The only way to play a fair game is to only play with friends, or not at all.</p>

<p>You can mark the person as an avoided player but all that does is reduce the chance of being matched up, it doesn't eliminate it.</p>

<p>THEOWENKILLER is right. Once a new game in the franchise comes out, old games tend to just be tossed away and forgotten. Past Call of Duty's will be like this because these developers focus on making sure the newest game is working good.
</p>
<p>Microsoft can't do anything to fix the game, but if you report the players hacking, they will look into it.

<p>I missed playing the older cod like waw, mw2, and cod 4. I would play them but MS seems to ban the people that join the modded lobby by the game putting them into it. I bet everything I own if you have a illegal copy of a game they would bend backwards to
 find you and ban you. They dont give a rip about modders on games anymore. If they did a new game would not be hacked in under a week.</p>

<p>They do crap on forza too. Ever raced a x class jeep or x class cobalt ? Hacking I think is here to stay as long as there is competition no matter what you play. I also see the new advance warfare being the worst cause you can go inadvisable as a perk and
 I am sure some one will make it where they stay like that whole game. Like cod 4 with the teleports all over even as the game starts. Unlimited uav and god mode. That was with mod menu and infections. I know playing with friends helps but, still they need
 to do something about the players no matter what game you play. That is why I say that should be xbox lives job when reported that if they keep getting reports on same people then ban them along with there xbox systems. Cause if you wanna stop some one , there
 wallets are the best place to start.</p>

                    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">windows 7 compatibility issues</span><br />
<br />
Programs dont seem to write virtualstore properly, like portal 2 if runs w/o Run as Admin it won't save anything, even screen resolution.<br />
But when run via Run as Admin it will save properly. (File and Registry Visualization is on)<br />
<br />
I moved the users folder to D: using registry hacks and Junction in case program didn't write properly.<br />
If a program attempts to write to users dir, it will. Borderlands game which write to Documents, wrote its save game properly.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: VirtualStore don't seem to working properly because Users Folder movement<br />
Please help me, i want to my programs to function properly even my Users Folder in D: in case my primary partition crashed.<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated.&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is the user profile that you are signing into is an administrator account?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it’s not an administrator account then there may be restrictions on the programs saving to certain locations, and that is why they function properly when run as an admin but
 not as a normal user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can also try re-writing the folder permissions of the folder in question by following these instructions:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Locate the file or folder on which you want to take ownership in windows explorer</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b>Right click</b> on file or folder and select “<b>Properties</b>” from Context Menu</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>Security</b> tab</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on “<b>Advance</b>”</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Now click on Owner tab in <b>
Advance Security Settings</b> for User windows</p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>Edit</b> Button and select user from given Change Owner to list if user or group is not in given list then, click on other users or groups. Enter name of user/group and click ok. You can
 even click on administrator here, if you are logged in as an administrator.</p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Now select <b>User/group</b> and click
<b>apply</b> and <b>ok</b>. (Check “Replace owner on sub containers and objects” if you have files and folder within selected folder)</p>
<p>
<span><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click ok when Windows Security Prompt is displayed</p>
<p>
<span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Now Owner name must have changed</p>
<p>
<span><span>j.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Now click <b>Ok</b> to exist from Properties windows</p>
<p>
<span><span>k.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Once you have taken the ownership of file or folder</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grant Permissions to everyone (or your user account) -</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to C: and then click <b>
right click</b> on folder and choose <b>properties</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Then go to <b>security</b> tab and click
<b>Edit</b> then click <b>Add</b> =&gt; <b>Advanced</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If you click on advanced now click on Find Now and choose everyone and click
<b>Ok</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Then again click <b>
Ok</b> and now click on <b>Allow</b> =&gt; <b>Full control</b> =&gt; <b>
Ok</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on permissions in Windows 7, please refer to the following link.</p>

<h2>            Wifi disconnect, and won&#39;t reconnect to home network without restart of asus laptop</h2>
                    <p>ASUS X553ma Laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sleep/Hibernation power off unchecked--all drivers updated and show functioning properly----Command prompt for Ipconfig,renew,release/all done ---flushdns- done. Home network shows available and 3 of 4 bars. Computer diagnostic after applying network adapter
 reset, then prompts for check ethernet connection as if wifi were not an option. Turning wifi on/off has no effect. It is so random also although started two months ago maybe once a week til now where it can occur 3 or more times a day and as little as minutes
 apart. Manufacturer and microsoft updates are completed. Is it possible that my ISP/Comcast is doing this to clear traffic to kick off long running users and somehow disabling auto reconnect? What happens at restart that I can't do without restart?</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Computer diagnostic after applying network adapter reset, then prompts for check ethernet connection as if wifi were not an option. as stated above. If you are suggesting network restart that requires laptop restart and doesn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for comcast Xfinity modem, well isp states reset maybe nessasary &nbsp;1x a week.</p>
<p>Reality is reset is at least once a day and a powercycle 1x a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Location of modem is not always available to access or at least no easier to get to than restart laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a critical thing, just frustrating. I understand the occasional drop from a wireless network, but how does my own network not recognize me unless I restart laptop or possibly modem?</p>

<p>Hi Geoff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most common reason why you're asked to update your account in Windows 10 Mail app is incorrect password. However, if changing your password did not resolve the problem, then it may have something to do with the security certificate. Please follow these
 steps to check:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open the Mail app, then click <strong>Settings &gt; Manage Accounts</strong>.</li><li>Choose the account that's out-of-date to display the account settings dialog.</li><li>Choose<strong> Change mailbox sync settings &gt; Advanced mailbox settings</strong>. You may have to scroll down in the dialog to see
<strong>Advanced mailbox settings</strong>.</li><li>Check the boxes for <strong>Require SSL for incoming email </strong>and <strong>
Require SSL for outgoing email</strong> and then choose <strong>Done &gt; Save</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me to provide you with appropriate recommendations, I would like to verify if you are experiencing the same issue as the main poster? If so, please help me verify the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What email account/s do you need updating with?</li><li>Have you set it up your email with Windows Mail app?</li><li>Does your password work when you access your email directly in a browser?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other information to add to help sort out this issue, that would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>

<p>Yes, those are the steps the mail app advises...only there are no 'Require SSL' buttons under advanced settings, and my 'Outgoing server requires authentication' and 'Use the same user name and password for sending email' boxes, the only two on offer, are
 already checked. In fact, other than the super annoying pop-up message that my account settings are out of date, everything is set up and working fine.</p>
<p>So, maybe you could just FIX THE BUG.</p>
<p>That would be great.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Martin,</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem, the origin was a locaI account linked with my Microsoft Live&nbsp;account, when I tried to link the same Microsoft account to my domain account Windows showed me the same error. I tried to delink the Microsoft account&nbsp;of my local account
 but didn't work, deleting the local account didn't work either. </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that the problem was in the registry and I found this key: </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-18\Software\Microsoft\IdentityCRL\StoredIdentities\*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>where *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is, obviously, my Microsoft account. Note than probably the user SID (S-1-5-18)&nbsp; will be different in your PC.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Just deleting this key I was able to link my Microsoft Live account with my Domain account. Do it at your own risk and only if you know what are you doing. If you finally decide to delete it you should make a backup of the key ;)</p>

<h2>            SD card not showing up in Windows File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>I cannot get my SD card to show up in windows file explorer, my computer is an HP Spectre x360 and I am using a Realtek card reader driver. I have tried multiple cards and none of them show up in the file explorer, however, they do show up in the partition
 manager so I know it is not a hardware issue. I have tried reinstalling the driver and that didn't work, so I am guessing this is either a driver issue, or, more likely, a windows issue.</p>
<p>

            The guys over on the HP support forum helped me out, they told me to assign a letter to the drive in the disk manager and it worked! Although HP's forums did solve the problem, I will continue to come back to the Microsoft Community because of your immense
 effort towards fixing my problem.

            Excellent question. Microsoft should have put a Windows Defender icon in the System Tray. The Taskbar and Start Menu are not the System Tray, and the Action Center flag in the System Tray does not tell you the status of Windows Defender, unless it is disabled
 and no other anti-virus and anti-spyware program is running.<br />

            <p>Going to the action center to check to see if defender is running is a lot of work. It would be just a easy to create a short cut on the desktop to defender to see if it was running. I don't know why MS could not have made Defender show in the system tray
 as they did with security essentials. But with windows 8 you can not run Security Essentials.</p>

            I pin&nbsp; Defender to the task bar, open it, minimize it.&nbsp; Now all I have to do is place the cursor on the defender icon and it shows the defender panel in mini form in real time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course each time the computer is shut down and restarted the procedure
 has to be repeated.&nbsp; A bit of a nuisance but better than having to open the panel every time you want to be&nbsp; reassured the computer is protected!

            lots of luck.&nbsp; Yes you can do it in Windows Security Essentials which is only up to Vista (I don't know about Windows 7).&nbsp; But for W8 and 8.1&nbsp; that is not an option.&nbsp; I am given to understand that Microsoft was following their own guidelines on this issue.&nbsp;
 It is a Notification area and if Defender has something out of the ordinary it will notify you by means of the Action Center icon.&nbsp; Same way as for updating the virus definitions it uses the same update system as for the rest of the system.&nbsp; Which is a nuisance
 if you do not wish to automatically install all updates.&nbsp; You run the risk of not updating the virus&nbsp; database file for a length of time.&nbsp; However, if you find out how to put the defender icon in the notification area I would love to read about it.&nbsp; Thanks.

            Hi Michael
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to System - Power and Sleep
<br />
<br />From there you can set the time interval for the Lock Screen and also for your screen to tun off . . .

<h2>            microphone-- &#34;no audio devices are installed&#34;</h2>
                    I have a Sony Vaio laptop, so I definitely have a microphone, but when I go into sound from the control panel, it comes up with the 'no devices' message. &nbsp;I remember awhile ago I did something to disable the mic (or something), but I can't remember what
 I did or how to get it back.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows.</strong>
<p>Fixing a customer problem: “No Audio Device is Installed” when launching sndvol on Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2009/01/06/fixing-a-customer-problem-no-audio-device-is-installed-when-launching-sndvol-on-windows-vista.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2009/01/06/fixing-a-customer-problem-no-audio-device-is-installed-when-launching-sndvol-on-windows-vista.aspx</span></a><br />
<br />
Also update or re-install the driver.</p>
<p>Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High<br />
Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version.<br />
Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers.<br />
Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on<br />
and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the<br />
reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot<br />
until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
</span></span></span><br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<strong>Also Right Click Speaker near clock - Playback Devices - right click in the box area -<br />

Right click Properties check settings for Device Usage enabled and so on. Also do<br />
same for Configure on Lower Left of that box.<br />
<br />
Right click Speaker near Clock -&nbsp;Recording Devices - right click in box - check Show&nbsp;<br />

<p>
</p><p>1) Are you trying to remove the Mozilla Firefox from the&nbsp;child account/&nbsp;admin account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check the User account control permission and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Type user account in Search box and open user account.</p>
<p>2) Click on Manage user account settings and check whether it is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also you have to login with administrator to uninstall any program and also you can give rights to child account to make any changes in the PC.</p>
<p>

    <title>MISSING&#58; Windows 10 Audio Driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reganb  say:</h3>
<h2>            MISSING&#58; Windows 10 Audio Driver</h2>
                    <p>Hi there. </p>
<p>It seems I have had problems with my HP Pavillion X2 since day one. Over the almost 2 years I've had the computer, I've had to do a hard reset (like back to factory settings) 4 times. FOUR.
</p>
<p>I've since downloaded Windows 10 from my school website (it gives us free updates every now and then). The computer was running alright. It was slow, but it's always been slow. I would only store apps like Itunes and word and stuff like that (all documents
 and files were saved to a USB).</p>
<p>The computer has progressively been getting worse in speed and storage. I would have hardly anything on the computer and it would tell me I'm using too much space (even after I've deleted files, compressed apps, and checked for hidden things). Plus I had
 problems within Powerpoint that weren't happening on window 8. I even tried the app on different computers and windows 10 seems to be the problem.
</p>
<p>After all of that, I decided I would just hard reset for a fifth time, go back to the windows 8 that came with the computer, and start looking for a replacement for next christmas.</p>
<p>I hard reset. But for some reason the computer loaded up with windows 10, not windows 8 like it has done the past 4 times I've reset. Then the volume button had an X over it and said "no audio drivers installed"</p>
<p>I've searched the internet multiple times and I can't find anything that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just need my computer to last one more year...even 6 months would be fine. </p>

    <title>External storage drive does not get recognized through USB 3.0 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> srikanthprasad  say:</h3>
<h2>            External storage drive does not get recognized through USB 3.0</h2>
                    <p>I have a Seagate external hard disk&nbsp;that is USB 3.0 Compatible (blue port, marked SS) and I use a Lenovo (G50-80) laptop that has one USB 3.0 port.</p>
<p>The hard disk gets recognized when connected to any of the USB 2.0 ports of the laptop. But it doesn't get recognized when I connect it to a 3.0 port. Any other hardware, such as a mouse or a pen drive work completely fine with the 3.0 port of the laptop.
 The problem arises only when I try to connect the hard disk to 3.0 port. The LED indicator on the hard drive also turns on, but the hard disk does not get recognized. I don't see any warning on the notification panel such as 'USB drive not recognized'. I also
 don't see any yellow triangles on the device manager. I want to enjoy the high-speed data transfer through the 3.0 port. Please help.</p>
