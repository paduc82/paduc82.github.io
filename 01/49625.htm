            Hi Tish.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What is the exact verbatim error message you're getting including number?
<br />
<br />2000 is pretty old for both a disk and a program.  That's about 190 years old in computer years.  Disks have a shelf life.  Programs usually update themselves, so can you go to the author's web site to see if they have a more modern download to install?  
<br />
<br />If not you can open the disk in File Explorer and try to install or run it in Compatibility Mode.  Right click the installer's .exe before installing, and/or the program .exe once installed, choose Troubleshoot Compatibility, follow the prompts to test a different Windows Mode and then set the app to install or always run in that mode.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Tish, if this is happening even in Compatibility Mode then it's probably too old to run.  Do you or anyone you know have an old Windows 7 or earlier PC who could loan it to you to play the disk (if it will play).  
<br />
<br />If not I'd contact the training program to ask how to get a disk that will play in Windows 10, or go online to the disk's software maker to see if they have a downloadable version as almost all do nowadays.

            Hi Tish
<br />
<br />Is there a shortcut for that application on your Desktop?
<br />
<br />If so, right click that and choose Properties
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, choose the Compatibility Tab
<br />
<br />Set that to run in Windows XP Service Pack 2 compatibility Mode
<br />
<br />If that is going to run in Windows 10, that mode will give it the best chance . . .

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I move my mouse when typing&#63; &#40;FIXED&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I just got a new Dell Windows 8 laptop for Christmas and have made my way around every preference I could get to, but the problem still continues. Whenever I press or hold down a key on my keyboard, my mouse will become unresponsive as long as the key is
 down and a second or two after I let go. On my old laptop, I had the same problem, but I fixed it eventually. I remember it was called "PalmProtection" or something like that. I had to go through like eight windows of settings but I did fix it. I can't remember
 how I did it at all and I can't find out how by search engines like I did last time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I play PC games and you have to use the keyboard and mouse at the same time. So I cannot play most games comfortably anymore because of the setting. It also becomes annoying when typing in multiple fields (because I do not use Tab very often) because the
 mouse stays unresponsive for a second or two after typing, like I said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using the Dell Touchpad for Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Thanks, Kinnis.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>**---------**</p>
<p>I've fixed the problem months ago. All I did was install a new touchpad driver. Synaptics works great.<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question on the Microsoft community forums.</p>
<p>I understand that you are unable to use the mouse for a couple of seconds when you have a key held down on the keyboard. Let me know if this is incorrect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It would help if you could let us know the model of the computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some manufacturers provide a separate control panel for Mouse, this could be the location where you had made the changes
 while using Windows 7. So check with the manufacturer if there is such an option available to get the fixed on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if you have any other question.</span></p>

            <p>If I'm not mistaken, you and I may have the same computer and same problem. I have fiddled around with everything I know to fiddle around with, and no pure solution has come up. However, I have found that if you press the space key while still holding another
 key, you can move the mouse as long as you don't press another key. Also, if you have a USB mouse lying around, you can use that with no problems.&nbsp;</p>

Thanks very much. This helped a lot. However, either you forgot a step, or your laptop is different. What I did was...
<div><br />
<div>-Open Control Panel</div>
<div>-Go to, Hardware and Sound</div>
<div>-Click "Mouse" under "Devices and Printers"&nbsp;</div>
<div>-Click the "Device Settings" Tab</div>
<div>-Then I i continued on with the steps you gave me. Thank you!</div>

<h2>            Setup has stopped working windows 7 Avaya OneX Agent</h2>
                    <p>Hello </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm trying to install a version of a softphone Avaya OneX agent version 2.5 service pack 2. I downloaded the software from the avaya support center
<a href="http://support.avaya.com/downloads/download-details.action?contentId=C2013521640128400_5&amp;productId=P0535" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.avaya.com/downloads/download-details.action?contentId=C2013521640128400_5&amp;productId=P0535</a>. When I start the installation an error box appears stating “setup has stopped working” "A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Please
 close the program" </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Solution Attempts:</span> </strong></p>
<p><span>1st attempt – rebooted</span></p>
<p><span>2nd attempt – ensured all previous version of the OneX were installed, rebooted</span></p>

<p><span>4th attempt – Disable/Enable Windows Installer</span></p>
<p><span>5th attempt – selected “run as administrator”</span></p>

            <p>Thanks Bill,</p>
<p>I was looking for software where I didn't have to enter all that information.&nbsp; With my Vista system I used ROXIO and I had separate ROXIO programs for each of the programs that I wanted to burn CD for.&nbsp; All I had to do was open ROXIO for the cd that I wnated
 to burn.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I checked ROXIO and they wanted $100.&nbsp; I'm looking for something FREE.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>There are several DVD Burning Programs there that are very good.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ImgBurn</strong> stands out</p>
<p><strong>CDBurnerXP</strong> is another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can search through SnapFiles free AND <strong>pay for</strong> list of Burning Software.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/software/gmm/cdburn.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/software/gmm/cdburn.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not happy using the built-in Windows Burning Software and nothing from SnapFiles suits you, there is not much more we can do for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you use google for the particular Burning Software that you are looking for, as what was given&nbsp;meets most poster's requirements in Burning software.</p>

Leave it off for a couple of minutes.</p><p>While that is being done, hold the power button on your Xbox One console, down for about 10 seconds until it completely powers off and the powerbrick (if you can see it) turns the white little light into orange/red.</p><p>After having been off for a couple of minutes, turn the Router/Modem on again and wait about a minute or two for it to fully function, and then turn on your Xbox One again.</p><p>Go into Network settings for your Xbox One, and see if you can connect to WiFi now.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you still are getting the same errors, make sure to unplug or power off anything in the vicinity that is using any sort of Wireless connection, ie Phones, Tablets, Computers, Headsets etc. Then restart the Xbox One and try to connect again. Some wireless devices may interfere with others wireless devices,

<h2>            Panasonic cf-51 windows 7 no brightness slider</h2>
                    <p>I have a panasonic cf-51 toughbook running windows seven. However, I'm completely unable to adjust the brightness on it. Every solution i've found online says that my drivers are out of date. I've checked with multiple driver updater softwares, and all of
 them tell me my drivers are fine. (No idea why i would need drivers to change the brightness anyway, which is a pretty basic feature). Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>The Intel drivers are not going to know anything about the brightness slider functions on a Panasonic system,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think your next move should be to ask in the Panasonic community where their experts hang out.</p>

            <p>Hi Gary, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the make and model of the computer? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many network connection problems are caused by hardware that isn't set up properly. It could also occur if the&nbsp;wireless&nbsp;adapter is not compatible with Windows 8.1.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would suggest you to perform the steps provided in the article. </p>

<p><font>I am having the same problem with 8.1 and my Intel(R) Wireless WiFi Link 4965AGN (Driver version:<span>&nbsp;

 no information is available on Microsoft’s compatibility network. It does work, I just have to reset it every day when I turn the computer on. I too am hoping to find a permanent solution vs. resetting my adapter each day.</font></p>

            Hi Winston
<div>Identical problem where wireless network adapter requires reset on every start up. &nbsp;Worked perfectly on Win 8. &nbsp;The web has a long list of complaints about this very issue. &nbsp;It seems unbelievable that a fix was not quickly found and the problem patched?
 &nbsp;DO you know when a solution will be found and distibuted by Microsoft?</div>

            Hi Winston<br />
I and many others have this identical problem. &nbsp;It is curious that an adapter that works perfectly well with Windows 8 is somehow incompatible with 8.1?
<div>I have had no response to my post and no success with suggested fixes. &nbsp;Is not this a significant issue that Microsoft should address?</div>

                    <div><span>Hi all,</span><br />
</div>
<p>
</p><p>since the upgrade to Threshold 2 I haven't been able to use Windows Update on my
<strong>Surface Pro 3</strong> in my <strong>home WiFi</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Error:&nbsp;0x8024401c</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update <strong>continues to work through a VPN as well as other WiFi-networks</strong>. While that would suggest a problem with my ISP,<strong> two other PCs in my network have no problem</strong> at all after the upgrade. One is connected
 via LAN, the other via WiFi, both to the same router as my SP3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps already taken to diagnose the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete reset using a SP3 Windows 10 <strong>recovery image</strong> by Microsoft:<br />
This leads to Windows Update working again, however after upgrading to TH2 the problem reoccurs.</li><li><strong>Complete wipe of hard drive</strong> and clean install via USB with an ISO made by the Media Creation Tool:<br />
The installation already contains TH2, Windows Update doesn't work from the start, not even for initial driver installs etc.</li><li><strong>Windows Update Diagnostics</strong> (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=231149):<br />
Found Problems:&nbsp;<strong>Service registration is missing or corrupt</strong>&nbsp;- Not fixed</li><li><strong>SFC /Scannow</strong>:<br />
The only problem that is found and not fixed has to do something with the GPU(opencl)</li><li>"<strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</strong>" and "<strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /RestoreHealth</strong>":<br />
Doesn't help</li><li>Complete reset of the router as well as using the guest WiFi of the router: No luck</li></ul>
<p>Can anybody help? I've exhausted my knowledge and I would really like to be able to update Windows on my home network without use of a VPN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance</p>

</p><p>Not in my original post, because I discovered it after posting and finding the solution, is the fact that my upload was almost indistinguishable from 0, which I suspect caused the issue with Windows Update. Also instantly fixed with the workaround.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have run some tests and have the following results:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without the Registry-workaround:</p>
<ol>
<li>5 GHz / n-standard: Extremely slow Upload</li><li>2.4 GHz / n-standard: <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Extremely slow Upload</span></li><li>2.4 GHz / b + g standard: Everything normal</li><li>It doesn't make a difference if I choose between 2.4 and 5 GHz in the router or the driver</li></ol>
<p>With Registry-workaround:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everything normal in all cases</li><li>Contrary to what I have read in some posts, the 5 GHz band still works with the workaround! I can connect to it, my router confirms I am connected to the 5 GHz band, and I have the corresponding speed (130Mbit/s / 5Mbit/s via speedtest.net)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>These results are with everything unchanged but the registry-entry and the variables detailed. After applying the workaround and deactivating/activating the Wifi-adapter the speed problem is instantly fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have already stated, I only encounter the problem with this specific router. In different networks everything works normally. Even if I just connect to a VPN while still behind the problem-router, everything works as it should.</p>

</p><p>This is a Wikipedia entry, comparing the various versions.</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz!Box</p>
<p>
</p><p>These routers by AVM are extremely popular in Germany, Wikipedia says that 2010 almost 70% of all DSL-customers had one (with DSL being by far the most popular connection type in Germany).<br />

            <p>Hi Joe. I hope you and your team are working on this issue. I can confirm what monvo described. As of yesterday there are still massive connection problems with windows update after the update to build 10586.14.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My setup is similar to monvo's:</p>
<p>Surface Pro 3 (i5) with a Windows 10 cleaninstall (build 10240) behind the router Fritzbox 7390 (no trouble with windows update till here). After updating to build 10586.14 Windows Update keeps returning error 0x8024401c repeatedly. Your registry adjustment
 fixes the problem instantly, whereas windows update troubleshooter and reinstalling network drivers won't help at all. All in 2,4 GHz environment.<br />

            <p>Hi Ali,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Does the computer restarts itself after shutting down?</p>
<p>2. Does the screen say it's shutting down?</p>
<p>3. Does the issue start as soon as&nbsp; you upgraded to Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see a black screen while restarting, please note that it's a normal process and not actually shutting down.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I would suggest you to try booting your computer in clean boot state and check if the issue persists so that we could identify if any third party programs are causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

</span></strong></p>

            Hi Andrey,<br />
<br />
One of the possible reasons why you're having issues opening the File Explorer is because of a corrupted user profile. For us to assist you, we suggest that you create another account and try to open File Explorer. Here's an article that you can visit to see
 how to do it: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            We appreciate the update with the results. Since we have clarified that the issue is being caused by a corrupted user profile, we recommend that you
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
perform a clean boot</a>. This will start your computer with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This will help us determine whether an installed program or an update is causing the issue.<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, we suggest that you use the <em>System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</em> and the
<em>Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM.exe)</em> to check and repair your computer. For the steps on how to use these tools, here's a link that you can visit:
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">

<h2>            Standard PS&#47;2 Keyboard randomly &#34;Freezing&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have recently been having a series of annoying issues with my laptop:</p>
<p>1- &nbsp; When I try to turn my laptop on, I have to shake it each time through each of these stages:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;a-black screen (Screen Completely Off) to Dell logo (No Loading bubbles)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;b-Dell logo (No Loading bubbles) to&nbsp;Dell logo (With Loading bubbles)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;c-Dell logo&nbsp;(With Loading bubbles) to Please Wait&nbsp;(With Loading bubbles)</p>
<p>Then the rest takes care of itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2- &nbsp; The keyboard and trackpad (and i think my built-in mic) will stop working after a random period of time. If this happens while I'm pressing a key or keys on the keyboard, they will be stuck on that key. However it is 'reset' if you will if I make my
 PC sleep then turn it back on. It's still very frustrating to deal with. The USB ports still work fine as well as my USB mouse, but that's about it.</p>
<p>NOTE: If the Caps Lock key gets tuck at that point, it won't show up on the OSK. (might apply to other keys.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Finally, I cannot get windows updates, when it searches it looks online for a sëcond then tells me nothing was found (I know that's not true and yes it's set up to download all Windows updates even recommended ones).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please help me if you can I'm suffering here!</p>
<p>I had to type this all with the On-Screen keyboard :(</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>

Update</strong> driver software.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: Uninstall and reinstall Graphics card:</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong>Uninstall the graphics card drivers and then try installing the drivers in Windows 7 compatibility mode and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Uninstall </strong>the Graphics card driver from Device Manager.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong> Install the driver in <strong>Windows 7 compatibility mode:</strong></div>
<div><br />
To install the <strong>Graphics card driver </strong>in <strong>Windows 7 </strong>
compatibility mode, <strong>right-click</strong> on the setup file of the Graphics card driver and then click on ‘<strong>Troubleshoot Compatibility’

<p>Got the same problem. Aparently the old Skype didn't died completely when I purged-it before installing the new one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find the old process:&nbsp;ps -aux | grep skype</p>
<p>Kill-it: kill PID_GOES_HERE</p>
<p>Do a kil -9 PID if it doesn't die.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start the new skype again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't work, try removing the ~/.Skype folder (preferably move-it somewhere else as a backup)</p>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we are really sorry for all the inconveniences. The Skype needs to be restarted after the update to new version (5.5.0.1), otherwise it keeps using the old resources.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've deprecated older versions of Skype for Linux Beta so you get all the important features and bugfixes, provided in the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are now investigating why the update process wasn't smooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>JonasT</p>

            OK, this error might be caused by Adobe Reader, Press Windows Logo Key and the R Key and type msconfig, Select the Startup Tab and then click Disable all, click Apply, click OK, put a check in the box don't show this message again, click Restart. Try installing&nbsp;again.
 If 4.0 installs or not go back to msconfig and Enable all, same procedure as before.

<h3> tomas498  say:</h3>
<h2>            User profile service service failed to load.....</h2>
                    
<p>I went to log into my computer last Saturday (7/31/2010), and recieved the "user profile service service failed to load" message, and it kicked my back to the log in page. The other family members are able to log into their profiles, except for one that
 ceased to allow shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>I have attempted to correct using all the suggestions, but my computer, while asking for my admin password, then either does nothing, or tells me the file is not avail (I am running 64 bit Windows 7 pro). Cannot get into the admin command prompt, safe mode
 (will not allow arrows to work to change selection. Have tried ps2 connection, usb, etc for keyboard). Will let me see whats on the windows disk in my drive, but when attempt to run tells me that my drive is not avail, and lets me explore the disk.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions, other than installing a new hard drive and setting my system up all over? There are pics I would really like to get, but can't access my files! Windows has pissed me off big time, and I am looking hard at a mac. This is
 pure ____!</p>
<p>Thanks for any assistance that you can provide!</p>
<p>Oh, and everytime I do something that asks for my admin password, I get a JAVA upgrade window pop up (even tho I have deleted the JAVA update from my programs!) Once I click no then it continues on to the admin window to enter my password.</p>

                    <p>I really don't understand what happened....





</p><p><br /></p><p>Got to 9th Prestige Lv65, finished the last game, 
choose the "Prestige", then got into 10th Prestige, unlocked a gamer 
picture and......no achievement.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>NO ACHIEVEMENT.</p><p><br /></p>





<p>?????</p><p><br /></p>





<p>I pressed the XBOX button and found my total achievement point were 0G.</p><p><br /></p>





<p>??????</p><p><br /></p>





<p>I guess there was a bug happened when I got into 10th Prestige....a bug about my xbox system.</p><p><br /></p>





<p>I ended the game and back to xbox main page, I found I was offline????</p><p><br /></p>





<p>Totally don't understand.</p><p><br /></p>





<p>After that cleared system cache, back into the game and played a game, now I'm 10th Prestige Lv7, still get no achievement.</p><p><br /></p>





<p>Can anyone here help me to deal with this problem?</p><p><br /></p>



<p>And
 Wanna ask if I level up to 10th Prestige Lv65...Can I Prestige again to
 get the achievement?? I guess the bug of my xbox main page cause me to 
miss the achievement....</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            Low battery notification</h2>
                    <p>I have tried all suggestions regarding this issue of " no notification for low battery." Some if the suggestions are not even available. I am running windows 10, and I used to get notifications at 12% now all of a sudden my Hp 15 notebook just shuts down.
 Any and all help would be much appreciated. Thanks to all.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>How old is your battery, if it's getting on a bit just leave it charging whilst your using your using your laptop. If your on the move set it to 50% or 60% until the battery saver kicks in. Sudden shutdown is a symptom of an aging battery. Have a read of

</p><p><span>In other words,,,,suppose you search for "image.jpg" for first time, maybe that search could last 20min .The &nbsp;results of the search wil be saved in the "searches folder" and the next time you search for "image.jpg"
 it will just &nbsp;take a few seconds to finish the search.</span></p>
