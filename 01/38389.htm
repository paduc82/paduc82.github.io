<h2>            Problem with high CPU usage and Disk usage when i connect to internet</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am glad to post here.</p>
<p>I have a problem since 1 month with my Laptop which is running windows 8.1, when i connect to internet (turn on WiFi or Ethernet) my laptop fan runs very fast which costs with low battery life, task manager show high CPU and Disk usage (almost 70% CPU and
 100% Disk). For more my laptop works perfectly even with this problem there is no freezing, screen problems, or something like this, there is no high heat, just a bit to CPU on Laptop all is with that high usage and low battery (before 4.5 hrs now 1hr). I
 don't run two or more antiviruses just Malwarebytes (Same problem was with AVG, Microsoft Essentials etc i tried all one by one).</p>
<p>By the way this happens sometimes without internet connection but it's just in short periods (maybe 1 minute) then goes normal, but with internet connection it is all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be very happy and thankful if anyone will solve this problem for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to all.</p>

            <p>Hi Albion,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to assist you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are facing issue with High CPU usage and Disk usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information.</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li></ol>
<p>Try the methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>I would suggest you to Run System Maintenance troubleshooter</strong> and check if it helps.
</p>
<p>Follow the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows and X</strong> key together and select Control Panel.</li><li>Click on <strong>Troubleshooting.</strong></li><li>Click on <strong>View all option on the left side of the Windows.</strong></li><li>Click on <strong>System Maintenance option</strong>.</li><li>Click on Next and follow the onscreen instructions to troubleshoot the issue.</li></ol>
<p>If the issue still persists, continue to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your computer in <strong>safe mode with networking</strong> and
<strong>check the CPU usage.</strong></p>
<p>Refer this link to start the computer in safe mode.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If it works fine in safe mode with networking, let’s perform clean boot.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>I suggest you to perform <strong>clean boot</strong> and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily
 lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is
 connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section
<strong>“How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”
</strong>to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Please let us know the results. We will be glad to assist you further.</p>

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>Thanks for replying i will give you answers for your questions.</p>
<p>1. No i didn't made any change in my PC.</p>
<p>2. I have Lenovo G580 laptop with 2x2.6 GHz processor 4 GB RAM and 500GB HDD</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to ask you something before i will perform second method because first one i tried, will i lose anything on my laptop such as files, photos, documents etc. I mean if i apply the second method with all steps.
<br />
Second question is if you can explain me this point.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to change the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft
 support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.</li></ul>
<p>And of course i will notice with the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much again for your time</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely Albion Shala</p>

                    <p>Some how a .eps file while was changed to open with Corel Draw. That's fine and dandy but I have other software I also use to import&nbsp;these kind of files and it is not allowing me to open/import in other programs.&nbsp;When you do try and open it with Corel it
 is now slow to open when it had not been that way. I tried to change the file association back to factory settings,&nbsp;I also tried to change&nbsp;open with but unable to do that also. I would like to get it back to a no default program so I can open it in all the

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you're having trouble with your game saves data not loading up on a new console is that correct? Do you have access to the original Xbox One at all? I recommend you try removing
 and redownloading your profile from the console. You can also try to manage the games saves by pressing the "Menu" button (the one with the three little lines) on the picture of the game in your Games &amp;&nbsp; Apps section and going to "Manage Games &amp; add-ons".
 Let us know with a&nbsp; reply how it goes. <a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>HI TJMONEY515,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. You may want to try clearing your local save games, which would then restart your console and redownload the latest saves from the cloud when you launch the game again. To do so, visit Settings&gt;System&gt;Storage&gt;Clear local save games.

            I got in touch with someone from forza(turn 10) but it seems like they are ignoring my request or just not looking into anymore. Is there any way to speak to someone who is in charge or a supervisor. This is ridiculous and i am not sure if im enjoying
 the Microsoft treatment? Never had this problem before and the professionalism is not there!&nbsp;

<p>Hello TJ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you tried what Ezra suggested and it downloaded the new save, then that is the one you are stuck with unfortunately. The cloud&nbsp; does not save multiple saves of a game like some games do in game. It overwrites each save. So in this case when you clear
 local save games it gets rid of them on the console. So when you start the game it gets your save from the cloud. Being you tried with turn 10 already, there is nothing that support or forums would be able to do at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

            <p>You've got a rootkit (as mentioned by Jose Posada) that morphs and changes on the operating system.&nbsp; And since you're paying McAfee for antimalware protection McAfee should help you remove it....that's why Jose suggested McAfee Support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the scanners recommended by Jose didn't remove it you're looking at a possible reformat/reinstall....and that would probably be your best solution.</p>

            I wish you had included that information from the outset.&nbsp; It's very significant.&nbsp; It sounds like a likely hardware failure.&nbsp; That could be in the drive itself or an issue with the USB adapter.&nbsp; If I were trouble shooting this I would connect the drive
 directly to a service computer and proceed from there.<br />

            Hi Elise
<br />
<br />What version of Office did you previously have installed on your PC, did you ever associate that with your Microsoft Account?
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in.
<br />
<br />Under Your Info, do you see your Office licence listed?
<br />
<br />If so, on the Office home page, select Install Office - Install

            Hi Elise
<br />
<br />The update will try to install again, so use the following to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

            Hi  Elise,
<br /> 
<br />My name is Alex. I am an - Independent Consultant.
<br />It is an honor to respond to your participation in the Microsoft community!
<br />
<br />I think is better to uninstall Office selecting option2 <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />After that go to portal.office.com and install again. This will fix the issue with office365.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this does not work or if you've tried this already.
<br />
<br />Best regards, Alex

<p>
</p><p>I fixed my Office issues (I think), so I left the update issue alone, since my computer was working.&nbsp; Then it did happen again.&nbsp; The update loaded again and sent my computer into recovery mode.&nbsp; I uninstalled the update and I followed your instructions to
 block it.&nbsp; The problem update showed up in the Hide Updates window - everything seemed to go as you described.&nbsp; I hope the security update wasn't that important, because I really hope this blocked the update from happening and bringing my computer to a halt.</p>

<p>Hi, all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I too have been getting the BSOD with stopcode:memorymanagement as the error. After running several memory checks, I decided to try uninstalling the KB4487017 update and no more BSOD. Every night my laptop tries to reinstall it and I have to go thru the
 same lengthy process. Even tho I set the update schedule for a future time it still updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows notes says a security service pack needs to have been installed prior to this update and I do not see this listed in my list of updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Called Microsoft support and they ran a dump which indicated a possible RAM issue, but I do not think that is the problem I am scheduled for a level 2 call today to hopefully fix this error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>That's what I had the tech do too. Sadly, I'm having other issues after what he did. Trying to install Windows 10 ver 1809 but it's taking forever. Google says it still has issues. Oh my. If you have any ideas about restoring the windows icon in the lower
 left I'd love to hear them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>trying to import backuped outlook express dbk mail files from desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cutie pie  say:</h3>
<h2>            trying to import backuped outlook express dbk mail files from desktop to windows 7 mail live not allowing me to do so</h2>
                    I have bought a new computer recently with HP Window 7. I backed up my files from an xp Compac computer. I have the backed up dbx mail files in a folder on my desktop that I recently backed up. When I go in to import files into window 7 mail live it will
 not allow me to do so.&nbsp;The files are outlook express old mail folders. I get a message "Outlook Express could not be started because MSO.DLL could not be found. Outlook Express may not be installed correcly".&nbsp; Please help me get these files imported in Window
 7 mail, I need them for my business. Keep it low tech, I am not a computer wiz. I have tried many suggestions in the discussion boards, and none have worked yet, I even had a tech from the back up company try without success.. Thanks for your help in advanced.

<p>Did you include Folders.dbx in your backup? The import will fail without it.</p>
<p>----------------&lt;Canned&gt;--------------------</p>
<p>Transferring data from Outlook Express to Windows Live Mail:</p>
<p>For Messages:</p>
<p>Copy the *ENTIRE* OE message store folder to a flash drive. (Folders.dbx must be included). Place this on the Desktop or other location on the machine using WLMail. Open WLMail and: File | Import | Messages | Microsoft Outlook Express 6 and point to where
 you saved it.</p>
<p>OE Message Store Location:</p>
<p>In OE: Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, Win2K &amp; Win2K3, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer
 | Tools | Folder Options | View.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Addresses:</p>
<p>Open the Address Book in OE and File | Export | Address Book (wab) and save it to the Desktop. Copy to a flash drive. Place this on the Desktop or other location on the machine using WLMail.</p>
<p>Open the Contacts list in WLMail, (Go | Contacts on the Menu Bar), and File | Import | Windows Address Book (wab) and point to where you saved it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: If you use a CD or DVD instead of a flash drive, after placing on the new machine you must remove the Read Only attribute in Properties before you import.</p>
<p>For Account Settings:</p>
<p>In OE: Tools | Accounts, select the account and export it to the Desktop. This will be a .iaf file. Copy it to the new machine's Desktop and in WLMail: Tools | Accounts and import the settings from the location you saved them.</p>

                    Win7 HP....a "Disconnected Network Drive A:" has just appeared in my Explorer.&nbsp; It contains files and folders that have meaningless gibberish names.&nbsp; I delete these and they reappear within minutes.&nbsp; There are also two folders appearing on my C: drive
 that behave similarly: they have gibberish names are full of gibberish files and folders and when i delete them they reappear again (with different gibberish names) within minutes.&nbsp; This sounds like a virus of some kind but none of my virus scanners can find
 anything.&nbsp; I am unable to remove drive A:&nbsp; Can you suggest anything?

            Hello Michael,<br />
<br />
Let's sort that out. Follow these steps to resolve issue: <br />
<br />
1. Open a <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/947-command-prompt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>command prompt</strong></a>.<br />
<br />
2. In the command prompt, <strong>type in</strong> the command below and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong>: substitute A: in the command below with the actual drive letter of the mapped network drive that you want to unmap (remove) from your
<em>Computer</em> window.<br />
<strong>net use A: /delete</strong><br />
<br />
3. Once done, close the command prompt. The mapped network drive should now be removed from your Computer window.<br />
<br />
Update us with the outcome.<br />
<br />
Regards.

            This is not a true disconnected network drive.&nbsp; It is some sort of malware posing as a "Disconnected Network Drive A:" in my Explorer.&nbsp; Trying to delete it using the suggested command results in "The network connection could not be found" wh8ich makes
 sense because it is not really a disconnected network drive, that phrase is just a disguise for whatever malware is causing the files to appear on my C drive.&nbsp; So I am looking for a malware removal solution. I have already tried Malwarebytes and AVG and these
 find nothing.&nbsp; Surely someone must have heard of this one somewhere....<br />

            Oh duh.&nbsp; Had I read the information about RansomFree carefully, I would have seen this: "the program placed some specially constructed files on your system that help RansomFree do its job. Eilat wouldn’t go into too much detail about what these files do.
 He would say they were there to be the “victims” of potential ransomware infections and to slow the malware down. "&nbsp; This also explains why my PC was behaving perfectly normally otherwise.&nbsp; Thanks again to duncanmorison and the rest of the community.

            Not sure what's wrong on your install, can you pass the error message to us? &nbsp;Given you've tried 14 times, I'd simply download the install files to a CD/USB stick and do it cleanly so there's no trouble. &nbsp;It would save you a ton of time, even including
 time to reinstall your favorite stuff.

            You can go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a> and click "download tool now" to make your own CD (or a USB "thumb drive") stick to install from. &nbsp;It's much more reliable because you just boot up from that USB stick or CD and install your upgrade without hassle, pretty much like upgrades have
 been for the past 30 years.&nbsp;

            <p>I'd like to know why I was able to clean install Windows 10 in 20 minutes and 28 seconds (timed it) and have it work perfectly from the get-go, and yet you have all kinds of trouble. We installed the same operating system. And my computer is 7 years old.
 Gotta be more than luck. And I'm no genius. (Ask anybody here.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if it were me, and I wasn't successful after the second try, I would do some research to figure out what I could be doing wrong, rather than installing another 12 times and making myself all frustrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe that's the difference: Before I installed, I did lots of research and preparation, so when it was time to do the deed, I was dressed for success.</p>

            Well it's worked well for hundreds of millions of people so far. &nbsp;But who knows... These aren't iPhones off the assembly line where every person's computer is 100% identical in every possible way.&nbsp;there's uncountable number of combinations of software,
 drivers, hardware, memory, and who-knows-what-configurations, it's mathematically impossible to guarantee it will be smooth on all of them. &nbsp; With a billion users, even a one-in-a-million problem happens 1000 times a day. &nbsp;Today, this was this poor user's
 day.

            Well, this kind of arrogant response is why I usually find so little support here - its filled with this kind of disdain for anyone who is not as good as you. &nbsp;I"ve spent a third of a century developing software based systems for aerospace and have never
 found it useful to denigrate a user for problems in the way they use it. &nbsp;That you had to do "lots of research" before hand tells me that you have been where we have been. &nbsp;When microsoft sends me a "click here to install" I expect a multi-billion dollar company
 to have done the research necessary to ensure that the software and loader and process has been adequately checked out to work, not 90% of the time, but 99.999% of the time or better. &nbsp;If that can't be achieved, then they're over-reaching. &nbsp;For myself, I did
 research at bit. &nbsp;I tried to make sure all updates to Win7 were installed, but MS"s Windows Update would only allow me to install win10. &nbsp;Now there are no instructions with their notices, nothing,

            <p>It's a common sense situation. &nbsp;Literally millions of others are fine. &nbsp;And millions of cars use our highways everyday. &nbsp;It sounds like you had a proverbial gasket blow and are steaming angry at Ford (or whoever built your truck in this analogy). &nbsp;Take a
 deep breath. &nbsp;Don't keep trying the same thing more than dozen times for no reason, use the advice and information that fellow experts who have done this thousands of times and are trying to provide you, and you'll be fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I did give you information including how to just install directly from a webpage, CD, USB stick instead (which are very reliable since that's how upgrades have worked for 30 years), you skipped over that post simply to complain more about my ego.
 &nbsp;Would you at least try the advice offered?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've replied on this site more than 80,000 times, and more than 16,000 separate people have come back to thank me. &nbsp;I'm trying to help you, but you ignored what I wrote just so you could complain about the fact that yes, something went wrong in your case.
 &nbsp;That's going to happen. Out of hundreds of hundreds of millions of installs, yes, you got the bad straw and something went wrong. &nbsp;That is life. &nbsp;But we're trying to help. &nbsp;Strangers, literally trying to help, and you didn't even want to try it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point if I get another complaint instead of actionable information, I won't be back. Maybe you can pay someone to help you instead. My prices are

            <p>Cmdr - I'm sorry for the "ego comment" above. &nbsp;I mis-traced the comment from BulldogXX's and thought it was yours. &nbsp; I did look at generating a CD based on your suggestion. &nbsp;By the time I downloaded the tool, suddenly the Windows Upgrade Assistant window
 popped up telling me it was Installing Windows10 and to Please wait. &nbsp;So I"ve been waiting. &nbsp;For the last 2 hours it has been sitting on 99% done. &nbsp;Task manager tells me it is running, and the disc access light flashes every now and then, but, except for trusting
 the message, I have no way to know why it is still on 99%, if that's normal or not, or whether I should stop waiting and try the other approach. &nbsp;As the original poster noted, it just shouldn't be so bloody hard.</p>

            <p>Well what a load of nuts having to research to download windows10 . it should be just one click and go, no matter where you are. Over the years we the users have paid out billions and still we get the same problems downloading updates new systems,that are
 all claimed to be the bee's **** and turn out to be just more complicated user unfriendly making pieces of hard ware like scanners and printers unusable as they are no longer supported by Windows ( I have had to replace 2 scanners 2 printer and a fantastic
 game controller ) &nbsp;We are not all Bill Gates and chucking away good kit is just waste.I've now done everything advised to dowload Windows 10 if it doesn't work this time.....</p>
<p>If something can't be made to work in 40 year's there's something very wrong. Good job Microsoft don't make cars or we'd still be riding around in model T's but they &nbsp;would be in different colours by now!</p>

<br />
<br />ALso, make sure you file a bug report:

<br />        Select Print Spooler and click the Stop icon, if it is not stopped already.
<br />        Navigate to C:\Windows\system32\spool\PRINTERS and open this file. You may need to show hidden files or enter an administrator's password.
<br />        Delete all contents inside the folder. Do not delete the PRINTERS folder itself. Note that this will remove all current print jobs, so make sure no one on your network is using the printer.
<br />        Return to the Services window, select Print Spooler, and click Start.

<h2>            Windows 10 Home - Instalation could not complete</h2>
                    I decided to perform clean windows 10 Home single language pack installation on Acer ICONIA W5 that had win 10 home via upgrade from win8.1.<br />
Aster the initial installation when first use setup should appear I get stuck with "Windows installation could not complete..." error message.<br />
<br />
I have tried:<br />
<p>Hit SHIFT-F10 to bring up command prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>type MMC</p>
<p>Click File -&gt; Add/Remove Snap-in... (Or CTRL+M)</p>
<p>Select Computer Management (Double click and Finish on Local Computer)</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>Double click Computer Management (Local) -&gt; System Tools -&gt; <strong>Local Users and Groups</strong> -&gt; Users -&gt; Double Click Administrator -&gt; Uncheck Account is disabled -&gt; OK</p>
<p>Now right click Administrator -&gt; Set Password...&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Set a decent password to get started.</p>
<p><strong>The Bold part is where I get stuck in this scenario as it is not present there</strong></p>
<p>I have also tried:</p>
<p>SHIFT-F10 to bring up command prompt.</p>
<p>type:&nbsp; CD C:\windows\system32\oobe</p>
<p>type msoobe</p>
<p>enter</p>
<p><strong>With no success... it gets stuck after it initializes screen with "Moment" and that dotty wait circle rolling for eternity.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to set administrator password for something more complex using command net user administrator
<em>password</em>. Even though I received "The command completed successfully." it didn't help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please help me with that?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update regarding this, I have tried to clean install the win 10 and then Reset PC again, just to give it another shot. It worked...
</p>

<br />
Any ideas how to deal with that?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advance.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. Since you are getting this user account that you did not create, we suggest you login to command prompt and key in the commands below. You may access command prompt by pressing
<strong>F8</strong> while your computer is starting&nbsp; up and choosing <strong>Advanced startup options</strong>. You will be presented with a list of options and from there, select
<strong>Safe mode with Command Prompt.</strong> Type the following lines and hit <strong>
Enter</strong> after each line:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>net user</strong> “Jack” xxyyzz <strong>/add</strong> – this will create new user called Jack with a password xxyyzz<br />
<strong>net localgroup administrators</strong> “Jack” <strong>/add</strong> – this will make turn user Jack into administrator</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Replace "Jack" with your preferred username and "xxyyzz" with your preferred password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you will need further assistance</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is what I have tried earlier, but with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still get the login screen with <strong>only possible option</strong> to login as
<strong>defaultuser0</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However while creating new account I get weird response. Instead of <em>the command completed successfully</em> I get:<br />
</p>
<p><em>"</em><em>The user or group account specified cannot be found.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The user was successfully created but could not be added</em></p>
<p><em>to the USERS local group.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 3774"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I proceed with exploring more help as described above I get:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><em>"</em><em>The user was successfully created but could not be added</em></p>
<p><em>to the USERS local group.</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However when I add the user to administrators group it says <em>the command completed successfully.</em><br />

Any other ideas?</p>

<p>I have the same problem on two of my Skype access numbers but not on a third number, to the same town in England, &nbsp;On one of the un-working numbers I deleted the contact and reset it up, it gave me the same access number, and when I redialed using both my
 mobile and landline (Telstra) it came back with the number you have dialled is invalid or incomplete, yet when I phone the number directly, ie. paying through Telstra the phone rings normally, &nbsp;ie. it seems the problem is with two of my access numbers but
 not the third, and I can phone directly all but with heavier phone prices, as I have chosen to setup with Skype instead of paying extra with Telstra to have reduced international calls.</p>
<p>Seems like a refund may be in order then I can set up with Telstra internationally,</p>

            To actually activate the disc for recovery, follow this guide: 
<br />
<br />1. Go to your BIOS and you need to find your boot order to boot from the CD first. You can get into BIOS in a few different ways. usually it will tell you when you boot up the PC. You may have to spam the DEL button or an F1-12 button. 
<br />
<br />2. Restart the PC and boot from the CD. Go to Troubleshooting &gt; computer recovery

            Hi Bunchy.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It depends on if you created it only with the repair tools, or if you selected to include System files so it will reinstall Windows.  See here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4200-recovery-drive-create-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4200-recover...</a>
<br />
<br />If only repairs then you can boot the media to perform any of these repairs: 
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If it includes the System files then it should offer an option to reinstall Windows.  
<br />
<br />If not you can easily create Windows 10 installation media on another PC using Media Creation Tool:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Then follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            I accidently deleted Microsoft Xbox 360 accessories software and cannot reinstall it.</h2>
                    When I was trying to install software to use my wired xbox 360 controller I had trouble trying to get it to work so being the idiot I am I delete it before restarting my computer, but now when I try to reinstall it keeps saying I have already downloaded
 the software and must delete it before reinstalling. Is there a solution?

    <title>Making &#34;Restore Media&#34; for two MAR REFURBISHED HP EliteBook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alan515  say:</h3>
<h2>            Making &#34;Restore Media&#34; for two MAR REFURBISHED HP EliteBook 840 G2 Computers</h2>
                    <p>I purchased&nbsp; two MAR REFURBISHED HP EliteBook 840 G2 Computers from Walmart. The first came from Joy Systems; the second from Arrow. New HP's come with a "factory restore Image" in a separate partition on the hard drive and a program, which will run only
 once, that allows the owner to create one copy of a "factory restore image." These MAR HP refurbished computers came with neither. What Joy Systems advertises as "restore media" is only a series of procedures that will restore Windows 10 to all of the default
 settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe Microsoft has a link, which will allow you to download the "update version" of Windows 10 for those who updated from Windows 7 &amp; 8.1, but I believe that does not include the HP drivers for the hardware. Getting the correct drivers is very difficult,
 and very time consuming if you know how, which I do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will not help should the computer become infected with serious Malware, where I have always been able to run a "out of the box - factory restore," then reupdate the computer, reinstall any added programs, and that totally corrects any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been told that the 1809 version of Windows 10 has built into it a procedure to create an "out of the box - factory restore" media on a flash drive, exactly like the "run only once" program on a new HP computer would create.</p>
<p><br />
If it is possible to create an "out of the box - factory restore" media on these two computers, would someone tell me how to do it, or where on Microsoft's website the instructions are for doing it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP EliteBook 840 G2's have no disk drives in them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would do it on the Arrow refurbished computer first because this computer has no added Programs or HP driver updates added to it. Will the restore media created on this computer (if it is possible) also work on the other HP EliteBook 840 G2 Computer, or
 should I create a second restore thumb drive for this computer too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I create one on the first computer, which has programs added, should I delete them before starting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very little is in the small amount of literature that came with these computers, and the HP online manuals are for new computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help. </p>

            Hi Alan, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />The same Windows Installation media can be used for both devices, the Windows 10 installation media works on all Windows 10 PC's or Laptops
<br />
<br />1
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />2
<br />When Windows is installed, it will automatically install most of the necessary device drivers, if there is any that Windows does not automatically install, you can get those form the support page for that laptop (linked below)
<br />

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c6f6d384-682a-4ad0-a4ba-aac6b3e884e5" title="GinnyTurner">
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the issue, I am requesting for the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li>The exact version of Skype that's installed on your device.</li><li>The exact Android version running on your phone.</li><li>Have you tried to uninstall, then reinstall the app?</li><li>When you're trying to make a video call, are you trying to reach another Skype user or a phone number?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your response.</p>

<p>My laptop will not boot correctly.</p>
<p>In a regular boot the screen flashes the dell logo then goes blank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will boot via f12 to a menu that gives the following options: Internal HDD, CD/DVD/CD-RW Drive, BIOS Setup, Diagnostics</p>
<p>OR to the Windows Advanced Options Menu:</p>
<p>If I select safe mode it is trying to boot then stalls at what appears to be part way through the config/sys.&nbsp; The last item it displays is:</p>
<p>multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(2)\WINDOWS\system32\DRIVERS\isapnp.sys</p>
<p>I can then hear the fan, ect still running and the screen is black with half of it filled with data like above, and the but no activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ok, when I run the&nbsp;"diagnostics" through the dell boot menu, it passes all the tests.&nbsp; Upon completion a popup apprears: "Booting Dell Diagnostic Utility Partition" "Press any key to continue."&nbsp; When I press it all the text dissapears and I am left with
 the blue screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am online through my Desktop now so I can respond immediatly.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any help</p>

<p>Maybe someday the XP forums "<em>Ask a question</em> " dialog will ask these questions automatically when a new thread is started so I do not have to ask them every single time.&nbsp; It might even be possible to resolve an issue in a single reply when enough
 information is provided.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That symptom often means your system is afflicted with malicious software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose to boot in Safe Mode, and the last thing you see on the screen looks something like this:</p>
<p>multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS\system32\DRIVERS\isapnp.sys</p>
<p>If your system hangs in Safe Mode on the isapnp.sys file, you need to look for a driver file of zero bytes in length in the following folder:</p>
<p>c:\windows\system32\drivers</p>
<p>Of course you are going to have to boot the system on something in order to access the hard disk to check for the suspicious file and get rid of it.</p>
<p>If you have no genuine bootable XP installation CD from which to boot into the XP Recovery Console or are not sure what kind of bootable CDs you have,&nbsp;make a bootable XP Recovery Console CD or a Hiren's Boot CD and be sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no XP media required to make either a bootable XP Recovery Console or a Hiren's Boot CD. &nbsp;Then you can access the folder and check to see if&nbsp;there is such a suspicious file and take action.</p>
<p>Once you are booted on the CD of your choice, navigate to the following folder (assuming XP is installed on your C volume):</p>
<p>c:\windows\system32\drivers</p>
<div>Look for a file that ends with a .sys extension and is zero bytes in length.&nbsp; The file may also have a curious name since it may have been generated at random.</div>
<p>If you are in the XP Recovery Console, issue the following command while in the c:\windows\system32\drivers folder:<br />
<br />
dir&nbsp; *.sys<br />
<br />
The files will scroll by one screen at a time.&nbsp; Look at the list of files with the .sys extensions and their lengths.&nbsp; You don't need to worry about the Directories...&nbsp; If you see a file(s) with a .sys extension that is zero bytes, that is the one to suspect.<br />
<br />
If you are using the Mini XP Mode of a Hiren's boot CD (which operates just like the XP desktop), just navigate to the folder from the My Computer desktop icon and locates the suspicious file(s).<br />
<br />
You will want to actually delete the suspicious file once you get running and have run some scans for malicious software, but if you are not sure what the suspicious file is or if it might be needed, just rename the suspicious file for the time being in case
 you are not sure.<br />
<br />
For example, if you found that the zigxrtml.sys file had a length of zero bytes, rename it:<br />
<br />
rename zigxrtml.sys&nbsp;&nbsp; zigxrtml.bad<br />
<br />
Renaming or deleting the suspicious file to get the system running is not fixing the problem.&nbsp; It is fixing the symptom of the problem.<br />
<br />
The problem is your system is infected with malicious software and you must still follow up with some scans to remove the infection.<br />
<br />
Once your system is running, follow up with MBAM and SAS to be sure the affliction has really been removed.</p>
<p>Reduce the chances of malicious software by running some scans.&nbsp;</p>
<div>
Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></div>
<div>
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a></div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
They can be uninstalled later if desired.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Reboot your computer and troubleshoot remaining issues.</div>
<hr />
<p>Do, or do not. There is no try.</p>
<p>I decided to save up points for a new puppy instead of a pony!</p>
