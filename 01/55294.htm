<h2>            Stuck on the &#34;Just a Moment...&#34; Screen</h2>
                    <p>So i just recieved this PC where when i first started it up, it asked me for my preferences (language, time zone, etc.) followed by me having to enter the Product Key which was given to me, and then choosing the option for all the express settings, which
 i chose. (I also tried doing custom settings but with no luck). 25% of the time, i am directly sent to a black screen where nothing is going on, and the other 75% of the time, I am on the "Just a Moment..." screen. The very first time I was sent all the way
 to a screen where it said "Failure to load defaultuser0" or something around those lines and i couldn't get in. from there, i restarted the computer and it brought me back to the beginning, where i have to choose my preferences, but never have i gotten back
 to the login screen.</p>
<p>I have tried this a total of 15 times to date.</p>
<p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul</p>

            Hi A.Kumar_951
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />This is a scam. Microsoft never calls on its own unless you have logged a call back. These are old methods to exploit the unsuspecting customers and sensitive information might be leaked including your computer and mail ID and other information being used for wrong purposes. 
<br />
<br />You should report this Scam to Microsoft @
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/reportascam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/reportascam/</a>

<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi Kumar, <br /> I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.<br /><br />This looks to be a scam. No worries, if you have given a proof of purchase of the licenses, they cannot do anything with it that harms your device. <br /><br />Nevertheless, in India Microsoft occasionally can ask for auditing licenses of an organisation but the concerned official would have proper MS affiliation. If in case they call back, ask them about how they are connected with Microsoft.

    <title>GTA Online Character lost&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> careersoldieruk  say:</h3>
<h2>            GTA Online Character lost&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hey guys, I have been playing GTA Online since launch and the game has been okay I guess till now (Patch 1.04). During the time playing GTA Online, I have experienced three highly modified cars being lost and appreciate that R* were giving a stimulus
 package. With Saturday 20th October, I came online and joined a room which everything was fine, due to not many people in the room I went to select for "find a new session" and appeared in someone else's garage with ridiculously modified high premium car.
 Finding that strange I then went to search another new session and things were back to normal with my regular cars in my garage and played the game as you would.</span></p>
<p><span>That day I came offline doing the procedures with what Rockstar said. (I have done this all the time) to prevent losing my data. Later on, I then returned online and selected "Join GTA Online" finding that it took me to the character selection screen.
 It displayed the rank on the character but with no 3D character displayed there and all special abilities were blank e.g.. Stealth, Driving. As soon as I saw this, I went back to the single player and tried again, with the same thing happening. I then went
 to check on the Social Club and all my rank/stats was still there.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have been speaking to xbox support on this situation, and&nbsp;they have directed me to Rockstar, The only problem is it seems Rockstar does not know what is going on and will not answer on their site. I then gave them a call&nbsp;and they told me "the servers
 are down" and could not give me any other information on this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Has this happened to anyone else? Does anyone know if this will be recovered?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Due to being a high rank and spending a lot of time on this game, with Rockstar only saying they are having problems with the cloud servers, but not mentioning about the recent character loss. It's quite worrying being left out with no information
 about it. With a game that stores your progress and stats, you should expect them to back up users data.</span></p>

<p>Hmm, is it possible you have a temp character as your save? If you have a temp character, your progress won't save. Further, i want to suggest trying to play online even though you don't see your character but at the same time I don't want it to be overwritten
 if that is a temp character.</p>

<p>I have lost two characters since launch. After the first time I only used the start menu to log on and off per R*. I wish I had some good news for you. If you read R*'s newswire you'll see there's nothing they can do to help. They said they were unable to
 recover your data. Level 24 and level 47... RIP. I lost my last character over this last weekend. I opened a ticket with R* support and have not gotten any response. Start a new character. As much of a pain in the @$$ as it is, if you enjoy the game you may
 find it fun to so. Your other option is to continue to wait, unable to play the game only to find there's no hope.</p>

<p>[/quote]That won't help him recover his lost data. It's like a corrupt save, it's incomplete. R* has already said they can't recover them.</p>

            <p>Both keys have the metal part on them. You obviously haven't put them back correctly.</p>
<p>Remove both, check for obstructions and carefully replace them.</p>

    <title>File system error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tummychow  say:</h3>
<h2>            File system error</h2>
                    
<p>Whenever I attempt to delete a particular folder, I get the error message</p>
<p>Cannot delete file: cannot read from the source file or disk.</p>
<p>If I attempt to open it, I receive the message</p>
<p>FOLDER is not accessible. Access is denied.</p>
<p>I have confirmed that the folder is not in use and that I have permission to access it, and I believe I know what the problem is.</p>
<p>I have encountered this problem before. As I understand it, it is because, in the process of deleting a file, the entry in the file system to which it corresponds (ntfs in this case) is not deleted as well. As a result, the entry exists but there is no data
 corresponding to it to be deleted. In other words, I believe the file system has become corrupted.</p>
<p>Windows, to the limit of my knowledge, has no device through which the file system can be resynchronized. As a result, the only means I am aware of to resolve this issue is to reformat the entire disk in question. This is not an option in my situation, as
 I do not have the resources to restore the disk. As a result, this file entry obstructs my ability to use the computer.</p>
<p>Does any solution exist for this problem, short of outright resetting the file system?</p>

<p>The last time I used scandisk on a volume, it created the error I have in mind. I will run chkdsk in read only to see if it even finds the error in question, but it was unsuccessful the last time i dealt with it.</p>
<p>EDIT: in read only it did find an error. I will run scandisk later in /f /r to see what'll happen, but I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if it propagated the issue rather than reducing it.</p>

<p>There is no Scandisk in XP. Scandisk was the disk-checking utility in Windows 9x/ME. Since Chkdsk found an error, you need to run it with the /f switch. Before you run Chkdsk /f, it is wise to have your data backed up to external media. (Of course, you should
 be doing this regularly anyway.) It couldn't hurt to test your hard drive, either. The Short Test only takes 90 seconds.</p>

<h2>            Apps greyed out and underlined in Windows 10 Start Menu</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed Windows 10 last night, and all seemed fine. At some point this morning when I open the Start Menu, many of the Apps are underlined in the side bar, and the tiles for those Apps are greyed out and do not automatically update. These apps include
 Calendar, Photos, TV &amp; Film, Music, Maps, Camera, etc ... essentially all the Apps that come with Windows 10.<br />
<br />
When I click on these apps, a window pops open with their icon for a split second, then vanishes from the screen and is closed.<br />
<br />
Anyone know why this is going on? Is there something simple that I am missing about this? I've tried to Google answers for this, but there is no information as to why Start Menu would underline an app.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

            <p>FIGURED IT OUT! :D<br />
<br />
Fix the Store:<br />
1) open cmd.exe (command prompt) as administrator and run<br />
<br />
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"<br />
<br />
2) Reboot, </p>
<p>run wsreset.exe to reset the store (you may not have to do this, i don't remember if i had to, but it won't hurt),</p>
<p>launch the store.<br />
Your Store will now update most of the apps that are stuck in limbo<br />
<br />
3) If some apps are still grayed out. Reinstall them:<br />
<br />
4) Run </p>
<p>PowerShell Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers &gt; C:\listofapps.txt<br />
Find the the apps you want to reinstall (Camera and Photos in MY case) in that text file.<br />
<br />
Use the PackageFullname of the app to uninstall the apps:<br />
<br />
PowerShell Remove-AppxPackage Microsoft.Windows.Photos_15.618.18170.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe<br />
PowerShell Remove-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsCamera_5.38.3003.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe<br />
<br />
5) Now install them again. This time use the app's "Name" not the "PackageFullname".<br />
the Photos:<br />
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.Windows.Photos).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</p>
<p>
</p><p>and the Camera</p>
<p>
</p><p>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsCamera).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Voila!</p>

            <p>Hey there, well I had the same problem and Figured this out was a video card driver problem and sure enough, i bet your using Nvidia Drivers??</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This is an issue with nvidia driver ver 357.57.</strong><br />
<strong>Updating your driver to 357.64 (newest) will fix the problem.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if this helps..</p>

<h2>            My laptop keeps dropping my internet connection</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Window's 10. Since I did my laptop keeps intermittently&nbsp;dropping my internet connection. I never had this problem with Window's 8&nbsp;. I have upgraded the driver. There seems to be no event that makes it do this. I have also&nbsp;unchecked
 the Let Windows control this device. Sometimes it will go for quite a while before dropping some times not. I am running&nbsp;an antivirus program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To fix it I go to:</p>

<p><span>Network Connections</span></p>

<p><span>Click on Wi-Fi ‚Äì Not connected- Dell Wireless
</span></p>

<p><span>Click on Disable this Network Device</span></p>

<p><span>Click on Enable this Network Device</span></p>

<p><span>Wi-Fi then starts working.
</span></p>
<p><span>Any idea what I can do to keep connected all the time?</span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + X.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select ‚ÄúCommand Prompt (Admin)‚Äù from the menu.
<br />
<br />2. Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the ‚ÄúENTER‚Äù key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver
<br />
<br />3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the ‚ÄúENTER‚Äù key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />
<br />4. Now, let‚Äôs restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Typethe following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                        net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />                        net start cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                        net start bits
<br />
<br />                        net start msiserver
<br />
<br />5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it and then restart the computer. 
<br />

<h2>            hp warranty checker</h2>
                    <p>I sent an email asking how I can fix the problem I'm having with HP warranty checker. A pop up states "the program is not working correctly. I was sent an email stating that I should uninstall this program and reinstall with the newest version for Windows
 10. I did this and the same pop up has returned. This is a new HP all in one that I've only had for a week purchased brand new. I have been using computers for over thirty years and at seventy-five years young this has become a problem! Please help with a
 new and better answer to this problem, or can I just delete it and it will not harm anything in the operating system? Or is it a mandatory program for smooth operations?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<h2>            2 Xbox&#38;&#35;39&#59;s in the same house, crazy lag. please help</h2>
                    
<p><strong><br />
</strong>Hey guys, thanks in advance for any help. i live with 3 people, 1 use PS4, and 2 use Xbox. whenever we play xbox together (gears at the mo) it lags so so bad, even though we have really good internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ive tried port fowarding, but then read that for 2 xbox's to work, it shouldnt be needed, so have removed it, and now only use UPnP</p>
<p>Im using Wired connection, hes using wireless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>and weve been alternating our xbox's between instant on and energy saver, as i heard that affects it. with not much luck though</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Country/State/Province do you live in? Plymouth, UK</strong><b><br />
<strong>Modem brand &amp; model number:</strong>&nbsp;BT Home Hub 4<br />
<strong>Router brand &amp; model number: BT Home Hub 4<br />
</strong>How many Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles are connected to this router?: 2<br />
<strong>Wired or Wireless (for each console): 1 of each, although my xbox sometimes doenst pick up the ethernet, even though its fine</strong></b></p>
<p><b><strong>Things you have tried:&nbsp;</strong><br />
<strong>Is UPnP Enabled? Yes</strong><br />
<strong>Do you have a NAT error? If so, what is your NAT type?: Varies between open and moderate. most of the time detailed stats say cone nat</strong><br />
<strong>Any Error Codes you encounter: none, just lag</strong><br />
<strong>Who is your ISP? (Internet Service Provider): BT</strong></b></p>
<p><b><strong>&nbsp;</strong></b></p>
<p><b><strong><br />
</strong>Again, thanks for any help, ill appreciate any tips at all</b></p>

<p>The BT Home Hub 4 your using is a modem and router or "gateway" &nbsp; you'll never have any luck with it for what your trying to do , get a Modem only (or see if yours can be put in "bridge mode" ) and get a gaming router that does UPNP well (netgear is good)</p>

</p><p>If you have an optical drive (CD/DVD), it should be on right side of the laptop.&nbsp; If it's capable of playing DVDs, there normally should be a DVD logo printed on it.&nbsp; Push the rectangular button (#5 in the image below) to open the tray.&nbsp;

            The answer is NO.&nbsp; Most laptops today do not come with a DVD player.&nbsp; Problem easily solved.&nbsp; You can buy a portable DVD player for about $30.&nbsp; Make certain the one you buy does not have a separate power supply.&nbsp; In other words, it gets its power from
 the USB port.&nbsp; They are light and small and work just fine.

<h2>            Edge message when playing videos Soure not supported</h2>
                    <p>A week ago this message started to show up when I try to view videos on fox news. It was not happening before.</p>
<p>If I switch to internet explorer they play.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi, whilst watching LiveTV, on the remote click the More info button, scroll left or right until you see the Zoom options and select one of the four options.</p>
<p>This will change the aspect ratio and fill the screen.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
