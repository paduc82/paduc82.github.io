<h2>            Fable 2 - I can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t access the ancestors treasure chests because the mini-game site no longer exists. Help please&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I just purchased Fable 2 to play on the new Xbox 360 I got for Christmas. At the beginning of the game there's a treasure chest in the guild hall. When I attempt to open it a message pops up saying to visit fable2.com to learn how to open chests full of
 ancestors treasure. It's my understanding from researching this that there used to be a set of 'hero's games', mini-games you played to win access to these types of chests and that inside these chests are five special items, at least one of which (the chicken
 suit) is required to get one of the game achiivements. The problem is that www.fable2.com no longer exists, nor does the site it redirects to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/splash/f/fable2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/splash/f/fable2/</a>&nbsp;.
 I realize the game is a few years old but it's not fair to just abandon an important facet of the game, making it impossible for new players to access it. If Lionshead/Xbox wanted to take down the site and make this in-game content free to everyone then there
 would be no complaint but I've effectively been cut off from a part of a game I payed for without any recourse. Please help me access this aspect of the game.<br />

I've already spoken to xbox support, who told me to post this here. The following is the chat transcript:</p>

<p>5 loot items is hardly an important facet of the game. &nbsp;Perhaps if you contact Lionhead support directly they can give you a way to unlock the items on your account. &nbsp;These types of promos were popular this generation as a way of creating social media buzz
 and promote the game but sadly, you're right, after a certain point in time the ability to get them goes away. &nbsp;Good devs (i.e. BioWare) release the loot to everyone after the sites are down but since they are "bonus items" most publishers don't bother.</p>

<p>You can get 2 of the items I think. </p>
<p>The tattoo and the doll are in the first DLC, the island one I think. </p>
<p>I don´t think you can get the chicken suit anywhere.</p>
<p>You would need to find someone that gives you that item. </p>
<p>But for the achievement you could go to the fable forums and ask someone to play with you while he wears the suit.
</p>
<p>This will also unlock the achievement for you. </p>

<p>You'll be coming across 'hero dolls' at some point, you need to collect all six for an achievement but there is only two in each individual character's game. I have a chicken suit if you want it then if you come across hero dolls I could do with some trading
 as that's the only achievement I have left.</p>

<p>The game would really be so much better without these dated achievements , should be like Halo 3 with the 7/7/7 achievement , although it was really cool to actually get it on 7/7/7.</p>

<p>Hello Linda Collins55,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern. I would be more than glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Skype number</strong> is for receiving calls from landline and mobile numbers only. People can call you from their mobile or landline and you pick the call up in Skype. A Skype Number is great option if you, or your friends and family live in different
 countries, or plan to travel abroad and want an affordable way to keep in touch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the two other subscription you purchased is for making an outgoing calls. However, the subscription that is bundled with Office 365 are offered in selected countries only.

Click here</a> to learn more about Skype subscriptions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if you're planning to cancel some of your subscriptions, just make sure to cancel the one you do not need the most. If you frequently make an outgoing calls and having Skype number is not really needed, you may cancel it. You may refer to the following
 links on how to cancel your subscriptions:</p>

<p>Salutations Mark!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yeah, we don't have that much troubleshooting steps on our site for third-party accessories like that, so if the previously posted troubleshooting steps don't work, you might want to go ahead and refer over to the Disney support page for that product.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest that you go visit <a href="https://support.disney.com/hc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Disney's support site</a>&nbsp;and see if they have steps to help that get going. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Give that a shot and let us know how that helped </p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks!</p>

<h2>            PC taking forever to boot.</h2>
                    <p>My PC has been taking a long time to boot. Whenever I press the power button, the power light blinks and the loading screen appears as usual, but it remains for a long time(the dots circling screen). I have waited for apmost hours but it doesnt start. I
 have to firce atop it using power button every time. I went in the <strong>Diagnostics&nbsp;</strong>and ran a full 3 hour process, but it shows no error. I am still not able to open my pc.
</p>
<p>P.S.: I ran an antivirus scan before this problem. There are no viruses. Also, my PChas been showing abnormalities after the recent
<strong>KB 4284874&nbsp;</strong>update(like settings app getting frozen for minutes. Edge, groove not working, etc.)</p>
<p>Sorry for the long question.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

            Hi Tejas,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<h2>            Update to Windows 10 1803 Getting TWINUI as Default Player</h2>
                    <p>Since I have updated my departments computers, many of my users are complaining that they are unable to play .wav files.&nbsp; They can click on the icon and nothing happens, the default (WMP) doesn't start and they do not get any prompts asking to select another
 application to hear the file.&nbsp; If I go into default settings and try to set WMP back to the default, the settings screen seems to freeze and then close out.&nbsp; The only fix I have gotten to work, is to right-click on the file, select open with, choose another
 app, select WMP, and check the box to always use WMP to play .wav files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix for this other than this?&nbsp; I'm sure that once some of my users get another A/V file other than .wav, I'll have to do the same process over again.&nbsp; Is there a way to set WMP back to the default music and video player?&nbsp; Again, every time I try
 to set it in the Default programs of settings, the settings screen freezes and closes on me.&nbsp; I have tried all options, file type, aps by protocol, and defaults by apps, and I get the same end results, the settings window closes without taking the changes.</p>

<h2>            Standard AHCI 1.0 Serial Controller - Out of date</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated my drivers on my HP laptop. After downloading a "driver detective" this driver
<u><strong>Standard AHCI 1.0 Serial Controller</strong></u> was detected as out of date.</p>
<p>In doesn't appear to affect the operating system other than an inicident in trying to view an mobile upload of a friend on one FaceBook, it only flashed, it would never stay on the screen long enough to view the image.&nbsp; In reading about it, it appears it
 is related to be part of&nbsp;image communication; unfortunately I&nbsp;have researched &amp; have unable to locate its origin to update.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for your time &amp; advice!<br />

            NEVER rely on the "all in one" driver update tools!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; They are not useful.&nbsp; Drivers never become stale!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove the program and only "rely" on the drivers provided by the manufacturer.<br />

<p>Umm, I don't know If you guys are aware of this and I also don't know If you guys are going to take me serious about this but you guys at Xbox LIVE do know that there Is a host booting problem don't you??</p>
<p>You know, using a program called Cain &amp; Able to scan someones IP address and send shells to their computer/router to block their internet connection??</p>
<p>This may seem crazy but this Is very very real.</p>
<p>I got host booted earlier for 10 minutes and It kind of pissed me off a little bit.</p>
<p>Which made me go on here and make a thread about It.</p>
<p>Personally, I find this very annoying and I don't know why you guys haven't done anything about It yet. I mean, I do PAY for xbox live you know.. If I'm going to get host booted, then maybe I shouldn't????.</p>
<p>This really needs to be resolved because when I called microsoft, they said that host booting wasn't possible.</p>

            Your best bet would be to reach out to Warner Brothers as well as Rocksteady, as the publisher and developer of those games, respectively, and let them know that is something you'd like to see.&nbsp; Encourage your friends that would also like to see that to
 reach out as well.&nbsp; Let them know that as a customer that is something you'd value.

            I don't see that happening anytime soon as there is already an existing version for xbox one of that game, yet you can always post at the game developer's page.

            I guess this wont happen as there are remastered versions of the game for the xbox one. If you have the gamepass you could play this game for free.&nbsp;

            Yeah like these others said, it probably won't happen since there's remasters, I believe there's a collection also of both games, I think you'd enjoy it more on xb1 anyways since you'll notice the huge increase of frames from the 360 version to xbox 1
 version! I think it'd be worth buying it again.

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>This request is really unlikely to happen as Warner&nbsp;Brothers have already provided the Xbox One consoles with remastered versions of both games.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might get some better reply on the developers page. </p>

            As others have posted, you will need to reach out to the developers/publishers of said games, and let them know you would like to see them become backwards compatible. Since there are already remastered versions it may not happen, maybe the developers/publishers
 can shed some more light on this.

            I had the arkham knight with xbox 360 Download asylum and city were there, so it stands to reason if you have the old&nbsp; 360 discs they should run too! Perhaps a bit cheaper to get?

<h2>            Sound but no picture when trying to view videos online</h2>
                    <p>I just installed windows 10 from 8.1, learning the new system as I go along,&nbsp; everything seems to be okay except for my videos.&nbsp; tried going into my control panel to find/fix problem, got totally lost and confused.&nbsp; The problem is when I try to play a video
 from one of my news apps, or even trying to see videos on this help page, there's sound, but no picture. All that appears is a green screen with colored speckles.&nbsp; When I'm playing games offline or watching something on you tube, or checking out my other apps,
 it seems fine.&nbsp; Thank You for your help.....I know it may sound so simple, but HEY!!!.....I'm just an amature......LOL !!!!</p>

</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>This issue could be caused due to some incorrect settings or due to a misconfigured driver. I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</span></span></span></p>

</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The built-in hardware and devices troubleshooter can automatically detect and fix most of the incorrect settings and errors that could cause issues with hardware. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check
 if there is any issue with the display adapter. Refer top these steps:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>a. Type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> in search bar and click it</span></span></span></span></p>

 driver. You have mentioned that you have already tried updating the driver. Sometimes if the previous driver is corrupt, updating the driver might not resolve the issue. So, I would suggest you to reinstall the driver and check:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>First, download and save the latest drivers available on the computer manufacturer's support website&nbsp;and
</span></span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>reinstall the driver by following these steps:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Press

 and other program. In this case, I would suggest you to boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists. If you don’t face the issue in clean boot state, then one of the program disabled is causing the issue.

</p><p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>

            Hi Philip,<br />
<br />
<br />
This issue may have been caused by the broken/missing components of Windows Update.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, to help resolve your concern, we suggest that you boot your computer in Safe mode.
<strong>Safe mode</strong> starts Windows in a limited state, where only the bare essentials are started. Check if you will encounter the same issue while in Safe mode. For instructions, you may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>. You can choose whether to boot your computer from Settings or from the sign-in screen.<br />
<br />
Should you need further assistance, feel free to get back to us.

            Hi Jennifer.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    i have used the add and remove software control panel to remove this software.&nbsp; once it is removed the entire system is unuseable.&nbsp; It is as if every file is lost it application that is tied to.&nbsp; Is there anyway of removing this software from my system

<p>I had the same experience.&nbsp;Fortunately, I have restore points set-up on my computer. I right clicked My Computer, selected properties. Selected the tab at the top called "System Restore". Then I followed the directions and selected a date previous to the
 day I installed "Play-It-All", and selected "Restore from this point". Once the system restore completed all of my links and applications worked. If this had not worked, I would have had to manually recreate the ".exe" file association, then I would have had
 to reinstall all&nbsp;applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This application "Play-it-All" does not show up as a virus, malware, or spyware because it is not, it is just a very poorly written installation package that removes all file&nbsp;associations when removed.&nbsp;I would not&nbsp;recommend this software at all. The only
 reason I was able to quickly resolve this issue is 25 years experience in the computer field.</p>

            As far as removing it if you don't have a convenient restore point to go back to, you can try removing the program directory from underneath "Program Files", then use regedit and search for "playitall", then delete every instance that comes up.

<h2>            System Image Backup Failed In Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Today I wish to share this solution that I found from this community credited by
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e5134e48-82b9-4826-8406-48a4e7324150?sort=LastReplyDate&amp;dir=Desc&amp;tab=Threads&amp;filter=undefined&amp;forum=allcategories&amp;meta=&amp;status=&amp;mod=&amp;modAge=&amp;advFil=&amp;postedAfter=&amp;postedBefore=&amp;threadType=All&amp;page=1">
Syed Abdul Jabbar</a> that he answered this issue long time ago.(Replied on September 21, 2015) In case you did not see it. However, First before you will do this step, I would like to share a trick to I have done and finally I can solve this issue :) &nbsp; Please
 follow me</p>
<p>1 open windows powershell admin &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7aa958d-06e1-4e0b-87d9-b7c9db27229f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>2 type chkdsk /r system will inform you that it will scan and fix disk when next restart</p>
<p>3 sign out and restart</p>
<p>4 I wait system fix about 3 house ago! however it have been fixed successful finally</p>
<p>5 I follow Syed Abdul Jabbar steo as below&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step by Step on how to fix the "The backup failed.&nbsp; New bad clusters were found on the source volume.&nbsp; These clusters were not backed
<br />
up.&nbsp; (0x8078007D)" error.</p>
<p>Close Backup and Restore.<br />
Delete the Image Back folder (WindowsImageBackup) located in the destination drive.<br />
Open Disk Management. (Start/Computer/Manage/Disk Management.<br />
Note the size in GB for the partition (typically C :) Windows is installed on.<br />
Right click on the Windows partition (typically C :) and select ‘Shrink Volume’.<br />
In the ‘Enter the amount of space to shrink in MB’ box enter the value:&nbsp; 1024 (1.0GB) as shown above.<br />
Click the ‘Shrink’ button. When the process has completed you will see ‘Unallocated’ space equal to 1.00 GB as shown below.<br />
Right click on the Windows partition and select ‘Extend Volume’<br />
Click on the ‘Next’ button in the ‘Extend Volume Wizard’ window. The ‘Maximum available space in MB’ value should be 1024 minus 1 (1023, see step 6 and image below). Click the ‘next’ button to reclaim the unallocated space.</p>
<p>Click the ‘Finish’ button.<br />
Disk Management should now report the size of the Windows partition equal to what you observed in step #4.<br />
That’s it, you’re done. You can now run the ‘Backup and Restore’ feature.</p>

    <title>Demanding an investigation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Demanding an investigation</h2>
                    
<p>This is a copy paste from what I wrote in the Xbos Rewards forum as they sent me here to explain the situation:</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm writing in behalf of thousands of spanish gamers who are really angry and annoyed right now.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago MS decided to reward their best customers and loyal fans with three different possible presents depending on their loyalty. These presents were not given randomly, as the mail that MS sent to those who were chosen stated that they were
 rewarding the loyal fans.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I've been doing an investigation for the past 48 hours (something that you should be doing) and have been able to figure out that noone in Spain has been rewarded, not even a Killer Instinct code. I'm part of a community were the best Xbox gamers and your
 most loyal fans (people with 10 years of gold, with high gamerscores and that have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in your products) gather to help each other and to enjoy with our hobby and passion, the Xbox.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I've also been looking at the most important videogame related spanish websites and noone has got an Email with a present.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I've asked for permission to all these gamers to talk with you and try to figure out what is going on.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Spain is one of the launch countries for the Xbox One and we were supposed to be eligible for this promotion but noone got a thing.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>We, and specially me, are really annoyed and angry right now. We are all cancelling our Xbox One pre-orders until you clarify what is exactly going on. I'm so tired and annoyed of being moved from department to department. I've already spoken a ton of times
 with the US Support and <span>
Customer Advocacy &amp; Exceptions Management Team and they sent me here.</span></p>
<p>.<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>If noone in Spain got rewarded, this would obviously be a fraud, and I'm in contact with my lawyer in case that we need to demand MS for fraud in a promotion.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You are about to lose a ot of money as I'm talking in the name of a ton of some of your best Spanish customers, just take a look at my gamertag to try to imagine the amount of money I've spent through this years in MS and Xbox Products and most of my friends
 have spent as much as me. We are really pissed of with MS not taking us into account and thinking about what to do in the next generation as Spain has been completely let down by MS. The
 support is almost non-existant here and people from MS Spain are just a big bunch of lazy ignorant people. I absolutely recommend to change the staff in here because I've never seen such a group of incompetent people.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>To summarize, I'm asking for an investigation to know if it's true and why noone in Spain has been rewarded. If that's the case, to fix and to reward Spanish gamers too as we are part of the promotion.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So please investigate this seriously and let me know what is going on so I can explain to the spanish community what happened.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>


<p>PD: Almost 24 hours have passed since I wrote that on the forums. Me and the people I represent have kept investigating and we are 100% sure that noone in Spain has been rewarded. We have spoken and have seen thousands of people saying that they didn't get
 a thing.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>We really want to know if the promotion has reached someone in our country, as we are one of the launch countries and it is completely unfair and probably illegal not to reward any gamers.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is MS fault or if it is a problem with the Spanish Department. But we demand an investigation and evidences that people in Spain also got rewarded.</p>

<p>You have to relieze that a not all promotions run in all countries right and you dont know the criteria for wining one</p>
<p>what if it is na only you dont know whar the contest is or whenever you even qualified since it wasnt even published</p>
<p>it is perfectly legal for a company to limit a contest and not every one will win</p>
<p>remeber it is a contest if 100k for the contest available anf over 50m xbox live users obviously not every single person is going yo get one and 100k is a generous number&nbsp;</p>
<p>you dont know what it was limited to even if its limitrd to 10 players do you expect someone in billions population of the world that everyone in every country will win?&nbsp;</p>

<p>First of all, do you think that I'm that ignorant not to realize that not all the promotions come to all the countries? Almost no promotions come to Spain, I've suffer that for too many years. But in this case, the promotion said that &nbsp;gamers from all the
 countries where the Xbox One is going to be released on day one are qualified for the promotion.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Did I say that they cannot limit the contest? Nope, they can do it, I know the rules probably better than you do.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And I'm not expecting everyone to win, but statisticaly is impossible that noone in Spain got a reward. There has to be a problem or a reason for this to happen.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also this promotion hasn't been random, because as far as I know, in the mail that people received from MS, it didn't say that they won it in some kind of raffle. Also, there have been 3 different rewards and they have not been given randomly. Let me know
 when you find someone with one year of Gold of Xbox Live that they have given to him the console with 5 games and 12 months of gold. They give the package just to gamers who have spent a lot on the Xbox. What they have given almost randomly have been the Killer
 instinct codes. But not even one of them has come to Spain.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And about your second post, well, I think that you have displayed yourself very well. I didn't say a word about Sony and you wrote that. And you are an ambassador? What about writting something constructive? Nobody is crying here and saying that we are moving
 to Sony or anything like that. It's just ridiculous what you have writen and I hope a moderator reads it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I'm going to put this really clear to you. This is not about money, not for me at least. I can buy 100 Xbox Ones if I'd like to. But this company has completely let down the spanish customers and all I'm asking is for an investigation and to change things
 a bit. Me and my friends have spent a lot on this company to be treated like poop.</p>

<p>I don't think that how much you have spent was part of the criteria, I believe it was based more on loyalty-meaning what you have done to help support the xbox brand itself, not just buying games, accessories, subscriptions and such. More about what you've
 done like maybe tenure, Gamerscore, beta testing, being an ambassador, EU member, member of the rewards program and such. I cannot verify this info, nor do I claim that it is fact. but being part of or doing said things is helping the brand more than just
 buying product so wouldn't it be likely to be considered more loyal? I am not trying to say that anyone is not loyal, but am saying that I have spent countless hours as an ambassador helping people because I love the Xbox and want everyone to have a great
 experience, would you not consider something like this to be at least slightly more "loyal" than someone just purchasing product? I mean I have given my time to help others for free, we don't get paid, we just are really loyal to helping the brand as much
 as we possibly can. Just my thoughts and in no way am I speaking for MS, Xbox or anyone else.</p>

<p>I had enough of this, not coming back to this forum, if any Mod or some real MS worker wants to contact me do it by Private Message.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Just a reminder: this promotion was for all the countries that support Xbox One launch day and the biggest problem is that, once again, MS is backtracking. The terminology used is what has annoyed people. Telling people they have been gifted something due
 to their dedication.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This was not described as a prize draw, but a REWARD.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And to all the "Ambassadors", I've worked a lot more than anyone of you for MS. You guys have no idea how much the people I represent and specially me have done for MS, and not just in terms of spending money and dedication as gamers. As there is almost
 not support in Spain we have done that job for many years absolutely for free and with no Badges at all.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You guys have no idea all that I've done to get that "?", something I never asked for, but to get those Badges in Spain you need to do a lot more than anywhere else.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between you and me is that I'm not a mercenay of MS, I'm a free will and can talk and say whatever I want. I rule in my misery.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I answer thousands of messages every year because I'm a well-known gamer (if you could see my Xbox message inbox...), not just in Spain but all over the world, and for example, a lot of people from South America also write to me as the don't have support
 there. I've always politely answered them and I'll keep doing it, but I'm going to start to add a line saying to all of them that I recommend selling the Xbox and to spend the money in something that won't let them down. I got the power and the right to do
 it. And even that I'm sure that most of them will do whatever they want, I'm infuential enough to make MS lose a lot of money. Not to mention that as a teacher that I'm, through the past years I've recommended my students to get a XBox, but obvioulsy not anymore.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As I said, I was very serious when I wrote the message, and we are really annoyed with MS. I've tried to talk with someone who can investigate this but all I find is a wall of ignorance built by ambassadors, support and every other department that are just
 a bunch of "Copy&amp;Paste" mercenaries. With the typical Big Corporation behaviour of trying to annoy the customer not giving him a correct answer and moving them from department to department till they get bored.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So this is it, me and a lot of people from Spain are not spending a single penny in MS products for a long time and I'll try to convince everyone that I can to don't do it, I've got hundreds of games already bought and for the next years I don't need to
 get anything else to keep me entertained. I'm not a hype junkie and happy playing retro games.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Farewell</p>

<p>I Sir am offended. There have been many promotions over the years that I too have not been a "winner" or whatever you would like to call it. Did I get on the forums and complain? NO &nbsp;Did I rant and say I will never buy another product or recommend against
 it? NO &nbsp;I too have helped countless people with their xbox experience from around the world as an ambassador, I also have helped countless people in my community privately "am known as the xbox guru in my community". I do it for the love of the xbox system,
 not for the recognition or rewards. I am not a mercenary of MS. I am just an average joe that likes the xbox system and wants to make sure that everyone has a pleasant experience with it. Please in the future refrain from putting others in a group just because
 you didn't like what they have to say. Also IMO a "loyal" fan as the promo said would not trash a promo and leave a product because they felt left out.</p>

<p>Thank you ngocphi for the reply, am glad that others see it the way I do. Even though the way it's worded I didn't know if you were with me or against me as I do not feel that any recognition is due to me for helping the xbox brand be the best it can be.
 We are volunteers which means we do it because we enjoy doing it.</p>

<p>I was intending on buying an Xbox one because my nephew wanted one when I received the email with my free console lol rewards are nice but truly not needed I totally agree with you :)</p>
<p>I agree that we don't need recognition or should require it I do it because I love helping not for a promise of something rewarding other then helping others :)</p>

<p>To the OP: While I commend your hard work and hours of research, according to <a href="http://worldpopulationreview.com/spain-population-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
World Population Review</a> Spain's population is over 46 million people. While I have no idea how many of those people have an Xbox, I'm sure that you cannot possibly have contacted every one of them that does in order to say for sure that nobody from Spain
 won anything.</p>
<br />
<p>The fact is Microsoft hasn't told us what criteria they used to determine who would receive a console or code, etc. The e-mail only comments that "Thank you. No, really. Thank you. You're a fan of us and we're a fan of you. Now we want to show you our appreciation."
 It could be tenure, Gamerscore, being active on the forums, how much you've spent, participating in their betas, ambassadors, or the new Community Level program. It could be people that had problems as a result of the Gold Family Pack being discontinued. It
 could be those who've pre-ordered from the Microsoft Store, people who pre-order games from stores. It could be a combination of all of those, or simply a random selection. We just don't know.</p>

            <p>These are unusual problems. Your display name would indicate that you've been suffering from an infection - are you quite sure that this is not what is causing the problems you're facing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If no emails are being displayed in the reading pane, you may have too many Temporary Internet Files. Depending on what version of Internet Explorer you have installed on which operating system, a simple cache clearance may help. In Control Panel, open the
<strong>Internet Options</strong> applet and click <em>Delete ... </em>Select the top two boxes and click
<em>Delete. </em>Reboot the computer, launch Windows Live Mail and test.</p>

            <blockquote>... I wouldn't have thought Temporary Internet Files related?
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Live Mail uses Internet Explorer to display messages. It creates&nbsp;two files in Temporary Internet Files every time a message is displayed, and it doesn't remove them afterwards. When there are too many files in TIF, Windows Live Mail can't store its
 temporary files and you'll see intermittent failure to display messages. I'm not saying that this is your problem, but it would be as well to rule it out.</p>

<br />
<br />
We would like to assist you with this concern, however, this issue is beyond the scope of this forum. I suggest that you contact your phone manufacturer for advanced assistance regarding unlocking your Samsung J3. They have the right tools to access your phone
 settings.<br />

<p>Bonjour,malgré les nombreux post mis par des joueurs, je trouve mon cas différent.</p>
<p>Voila la situation, je possède une xbox one depuis a peux près 2 semaines. Magnifique console, rien a redire, sa fais 5ans que je suis sur le live , jamais eu de problème sur 360. Mais c'est bien la 1er fois que je rencontre un problème comme celui la.</p>
<p>J'ai 26ans, je travail toute la semaine, je joue principalement le week-end entre collègue sur du Battlefield, Forza...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voici le message que j'ai trouvé en me connectant début de soirée:</p>
<p><strong><span>Avis d'application de mesures : Pour plus d'informations, vérifiez l'e-mail associé à votre compte Xbox Live, ou rendez-vous sur enforcement.xbox.com.</span></strong></p>
<p>Etonné je suis donc aller voir sur enforcement.com. J'ai trouvé un gentil message orange en page d’accueil me disant que j'étais bannis. en cliquant dessus voici le message recus:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Toujours autant étonné je suis aller vérifier ma boite mail:</p>

<h2>            How can I remove Thai language out of Language Bar&#63;</h2>
                    How can I remove Thai language out of Language Bar?<br />
there's no option to do that in Control panel on Regional setting, but I can do on English and other language.<br />
<br />
Why I need to do that?<br />
Just because Thai it took over English without no one do anything<br />
<br />
Could you email me<br />
<br />
Best regards

            <p>Hi Matchurath,</p>
<p>If you have the Thai language pack installed, you can uninstall the language pack. See this
