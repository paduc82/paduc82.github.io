                    One of my favorite games is Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 A Century of Flight. I loaded all four DVD's and they seemed to load completely even with the ICON, but when I clicked on the ICON, it did not play. I have a new HP Pavillon PC with a Terabyte
 HD, 6GB DDR3, and AMD QUAD Core Processor. It seemed as though it all loaded OK so&nbsp;I don't know why when&nbsp;I click on the ICON nothing happens. I tried it four times.. Please advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dave

            <p>I'm an FSX user, so not familiar with FS9. &nbsp; However, there have been several posts by FS9 users who haven't been able to get their Sim to load even though the sim installed okay using the 4 disks. &nbsp; Maybe there is an error about 'secdrv' in your Event Logs.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm unsure whether this is causing you to not be able to load FS9, but if you want to try it, go for it. &nbsp; FS9 no longer works since its disk #4 has a form of security that Microsoft no longer considers valid. &nbsp; To get around this, do the following:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp; Update FS9 to FS9.1 and you can get the update from: &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=9727<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp; Then download the FS9 No CD patch which allows FS9 to start without disk #4 to be inserted into the drive. &nbsp; You &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can get this patch from:<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; https://flyawaysimulation.com/downloads/files/15244/microsoft-flight-simulator-2004-v91-no-cd-patch/<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once installed, try to load the Sim. &nbsp; Hope this fix will help in your situation/predicament.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, depending on your Graphics Card/driver version, FS9 (as with FSX) may give some problems running in full screen mode (i.e. it will run but not all features can be used). &nbsp;You may need to Alt + Enter to switch to windowed mode and back again, if required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope something helps you here and you can get back into the skies again!<br />

            If you've done a fresh install of Win7 from your CD and your FS9 disks are not damaged, then it should install okay. &nbsp; Where is your problem with FS9: &nbsp;with installation or running it?

            Thank you for your response.<br />
<br />
But what about computers with XP &amp; Vista. OEM and custom, can I just use the original genuine Windows disc media and the key affixed to the case?<br />
<br />
I don't have loose COAs around and I know that I can not do this (Since they were ripped up and now long gone), my OEM PCs (IBM, Acer etc) have COAs as well as some custom builds that have a COA on the case.<br />
<br />
But in regards to Windows 7 - if it has the key (OEM and/or custom), I can use that link above, or use my genuine Windows 7 CD?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Shayne.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Besides the Manufacturer's OEM preinstalled Recovery disks which are tied to the particular machines (brand and model number), there are Microsoft Vista Retail&nbsp;disks and&nbsp;Microsoft Vista&nbsp;OEM System Builder's disks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can&nbsp;use&nbsp;a <strong><u>Microsoft Vista DVD</u></strong>&nbsp;as they&nbsp;contain the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition
 is installed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><u>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</u></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>
<p><span>"<b>How to Do a Clean Install and Setup with a Full Version of Vista"</b></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to&nbsp;the Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for&nbsp;the particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>

            Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
But I am still a bit confused. If I have the genuine CD and let's say either an OEM or Custom computer with a COA, can I install Windows using the product key (That states what version of Windows etc) and sell it legally?<br />
<br />
Or does this apply to OEM PCs only?<br />
<br />
Cause I am not just generalizing Vista and 7, I am meaning XP also.<br />
I need to know if reinstalling the PC with the genuine disc and COA then selling it (Without any discs of course) if this is fine or not.<br />
<br />
(I have done system builds for a while, but just needing to know how it works legally so I know where I stand).<br />
<br />
Thanks again. <br />
<br />
*Also, I am not a business, just doing this as a hobby. So as an individual I wish to take all the appropriate ways of doing this.

            I'm sorry, didn't mean to cause any dramas.<br />
<br />
All I wanted to know, from someone here, if I sell a computer with whatever Windows OS and use the genuine CD (Or the link provided) and the COA on the case of the PC I wish to sell if that is fine. That's all. I didn't want to select "Other/Unknown" and I
 am mainly doing XP Builds so that's why.<br />
<br />
Thanks and sorry once again. Just that I am getting a bit confused with it all.

    <title>Windows 10 Aero Shake - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dani cardelli  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Aero Shake</h2>
                    <p>Ok. As I never had seen this Aero Shake before, I just figure this out in Windows 10. Kind of by accident.</p>
<p>Now, I understood what was minimizing all other screens, why, and how to get them back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, one thing I couldn't find out by myself how to "fix" and I also could not find any answer in forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is, for some reason, the window I shake twice (first to minimize all other windows, second to bring them back) is getting "Always of Top".</p>
<p>If I do it with a second window, the second window gets privileges over the first, but both kept Always on Top of everything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is annoying me. Does anyone know how to set this to never change to "Always on Top"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>There's no feature to set a window to "always on top" in the Windows operating systems, so perhaps it's another utility that's been installed and providing this feature? &nbsp;Can you consistently reproduce it? &nbsp;And, does clicking away and then to the window
 not change the stack order at all?</p>

            <p>I don't have anything else installed to do this "Always on Top" feature.</p>
<p>And yes, I can replicate it every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open the window (not maximized) click somewhere else and thy to bring any other screen over it, the other screen will be moved behind the first window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was testing it today, and I managed to get a second windows always on top. I guess only re-starting them (by closing) would make them back to normal.</p>

<h2>            Web Browsers Keep Crashing in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Over the last couple of weeks my web browsers keep crashing on certain websites.</p>
<p>I've tried 4 different browsers. All crash on the same websites.</p>
<p>Reddit Yahoo Mail Turbo Tax and Ebay are the culprits so far.</p>
<p>I've tried uninstalling windows and reinstalling. That didn't fix it.</p>
<p>I've tried just about every troubleshooter this and that and nothing has fixed it.</p>
<p>I do a lot of business through Ebay and would love for there to be a solution to this.</p>
<p>It's super frustrating!</p>

<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide

<br />
<br />Option 3. Stop Windows Update From Automatically Rebooting Your Computer - Active Hours Option
<br />if you don't mind Windows 10 automatically downloading the Updates but you don't want your computer to be rebooted as you are doing something important. You can use Active Hours to set a 18 hours window during which your computer wouldn't automatically reboot.
<br />
<br />Windows Key+I to invoke Settings
<br />Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Scroll down and click Change Active Hours
<br />Here, you can set start and end time with a maximum limit of 18 hours duration

<br />
<br />Option 5 - For Windows 10 Pro or Higher only 
<br />If you are on Windows 10 Pro or higher, it's possible to retake control and prevent the OS from downloading and installing updates automatically using the Local Group Policy Editor or the Registry.

<h2>            Printer drivers keep getting removed automatically</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Vanishing Printer Drivers</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I work in an office where approximately 30 employees access the same network printers.&nbsp; Two HP LaserJet P4015N, and one HP Color LaserJet CP3525X.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're on Windows 7, (have been for the last 2 months).&nbsp; Suddenly (last week or two) printer drivers are vanishing, seemingly randomly.&nbsp; When this happens, the two of us with admin rights have to run around the office providing our credentials so the drivers
 can be reinstalled.&nbsp; Yesterday it was the HP Color LaserJet CP3525X, today it's one out of the two HP LaserJet P4015Ns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last seems an odd detail.&nbsp; If two printers are the same model, they should be using the same driver, right?&nbsp; So why does one of them work fine today, but the other needs a new driver installed?&nbsp; When they were initially added to our new PCs, the driver
 only had to be installed once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anybody explain why this might be happening?</p>

 compatible however I have no sound. Have uninstalled and reinstalled drivers. My understanding is there is no compatible sound drivers for this computer? Is this correct? If so are there any other options (inexpensive) for sound? Trying to get this going for

<h2>            All the files disappeared from a directory tree, leaving the directories intact. Why&#63; And how do I get my files back&#63;</h2>
                    All my old files and photos from the last couple of decades were kept in a folder in my user directory (C:\Users\Will\old files\). I went to find a file from there today, and ALL the files from inside that directory are gone.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The old folder structure with all the various nested subdirectories is still intact, it's just that there are no files in there at all. This has happened to a couple of the folders in my user directory.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried looking in the 'older versions' backup, but all the files are missing from them as well. I don't know how long the files have been missing for, since it's only once every few months I need to go digging around in that folder.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Edit: I also tried rebooting into Linux and looking in the folder. Again, all the files are missing, but the directories remain.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What has happened to all my files? How do I get them back?</div>

<h2>            Gears of War 2 freezing for one profile, but not others...</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp; Interesting problem here...&nbsp; I have 3 profiles (1 is Xbox Live other 2 is local only).&nbsp; My family has been playing Gears of War 2 and beat the story mode a couple times...&nbsp; no problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two weeks ago,&nbsp;one of the profiles (local) lost all GOW2 data
 attached to it like he never played and had to restart again.&nbsp; A week later the game freezes up whenever we try launching it, ie start game get to main menu then freeze.&nbsp; Tried clearing cache, installing game on HDD, nothing worked.&nbsp; Did more experimenting
 and discovered that it is only freezing when the one local profile is signed in, the same local profile that was reset&nbsp; a week earlier.&nbsp; The other two profiles can still play with no problems.&nbsp; So we did the only thing we could think of.&nbsp; Delete the saved
 game data for that one profile (not a big deal as it was reset earlier), cleared cache again, and tried to start up the game from scratch.&nbsp; Same freezing problem.&nbsp; Tried playing other 360 games on that one profile...&nbsp; no issues, just with GOW2.&nbsp; Now I am clueless
 as to how to proceed.&nbsp; My son does not want to start a new profile just for that one game as he wants to keep his gamer score when he finally gets xbox live.</p>

<p>Hey mate, is the game freezing on a black screen by chance? If so, the steps in

<p>I do not get a black screen, &nbsp;I actually get to the game loaded to where you push start button, then the game menu shows up and if his profile is logged in the whole thing freezes. &nbsp;I had him not logged in once while another profile started the game to be
 sure it worked, and after waiting to see if it freezes (it didn't) &nbsp;I let him sign in. &nbsp;It froze while trying to sign in.</p>
<p>Tried the steps in the guide you mentioned. &nbsp;Didn't work. Said Since new profile has been signed in it would return me to main menu press A o continue. &nbsp;Once it returned to the main menu it froze again. &nbsp;I should point out one of the steps required us to
 disconnect the xbox from the internet, but since this profile is a local one, I fail to see how disconnecting the internet would help. &nbsp;Did it anyway just to be sure...</p>
<p>Any other ideas?</p>

<h2>            Windows resume loader</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a Dell desktop with a Vista OS. I came to work today and my computer is stuck on the Windows Resume Loader screen. Of course, my keyboard does not allow me to select an option. From doing my research, I have found that this has happened because my
 computer has been on hibernate mode.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>I have read through all of the previous posts and have tried the following:</p>
<p>1) modified the BIOS info so that the comp will recognize my USB keyboard (didn't work, since that was the default, and I do not have a USB peripherals option in my BIOS).</p>
<p>2) Tried to hit F8 to go to advanced boot options (nothing happens since it just goes to my usual prompts - F2 takes me to BIOS and F12 takes&nbsp;me to boot up menu).</p>
<p>3) tried using a diff keyboard. No dice.</p>
<p>I'm at wits end and am losing hours of productivity. Can you help me out?! The tech guy is telling me that I'm going to have to re-image. That in itself is a major pain and takes a couple of days.</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

The crash took place in the Windows kernel. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver that cannot be identified at this time.

<p>
</p><p>So could it be a Microsoft Driver causing issues? Shall I re-run verifer with Microsoft Drivers enabled instead?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have a crash but it didn't Blue Screen it just Froze up after running fifa on a 4th monitor (TV) and I had the sound running through that as its HDMI.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Only one of the 4 most recent DMP files was verified and it referenced your video driver.&nbsp; There is a known problem with the April 2014 driver on some systems so as a work around I would revert back to a driver from 2013 until a less buggy driver is released.</p>

</p><p>I would also update this</p>

            <p>Yeah, I've just un installed 14.9.2 Beta as I had a feeling it may of been that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a Sound Blaster Live Card, I have a SB -X-Fi Xtreme Audio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Live Card is a 24 Bit Sound Card which is incredibly old, it was a long time ago installed on my Machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm guessing I should uninstall this? It doesn't appear as a Device on Dvmgr..&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            skype to go - when I call overseas my audio keeps dropping out</h2>
                    skype to go - when I call overseas my audio keeps dropping out and the other party can't hear me any more. Happens lately with every call. ... from different phones / providers, and only with the skype to go number - so the problem is skype. Any advice?
 It is very frustrating and I'm paying for this service.

<h2>            BSOD Memory_Management</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have 2 EliteDesk 800 G1s dating back to 2015 running Windows 7 and they have been very stable once I sorted some initial issues. https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/appcrash-explorerexe-windows-7/2f368f0a-825c-4a74-b53e-60af808a786f?tm=1435602957980<br />
<br />
I have not loaded any new software recently and out of the blue I got an BSOD on 31 August.<br />
<br />
BlueScreen View says Bug Check String: MEMORY_MANAGEMENT Bug Check Code 0x0000001a File Name: ntoskrnl.exe<br />
<br />
Mini Dump: https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApJg4xTBkyxXggkhvFHzFbIJnGuF<br />
<br />
I've run an extensive memory and hard drive test from the BIOS and everything checked out ok.<br />
<br />
I tried to analyze the mini dump but it is a little over my head. Could anyone lend a hand?

 help me?
