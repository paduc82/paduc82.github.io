                    <p>I&nbsp;cannot play Gears of War 4 that i downloaded onto my Xbox One S. &nbsp;&nbsp; I am trying&nbsp;to play primarily local splitscreen co-op campaign. &nbsp;I do not know if i need a gold account to play this game. &nbsp;When we both join it states Squad Offline above our screen names and receive&nbsp;error message &nbsp;"lost connection to host" when trying to initiate campaign. &nbsp;How do i fix this issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
This would mean that you're logging in with the wrong e-mail address. Please go to your Xbox 360 logged in with the proper gamertag. Once logged in, go to Settings &gt; Account &gt; 3rd Tab (Account Information) &gt; Account Security. Take a look at the e-mail that's
 listed, that is the e-mail you should be using to login to Xbox.com and to connect your gamertag to Rockstar's Social Club.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The title is misleading, needs a D at the end of compromise. Also people are using it weird, you guys make it sound like MS came to an understanding with hackers or something. Compromised and compromise have two different meanings. Sorry to nitpick but it

<p>I used to say the same about Sony. Look where that got people. Considering they couldn't get their hardware, or even their current forum, right I don't really have any faith in Microsoft either.</p>
<p>Better to be safe than sorry. Change your passwords on a regular basis. Never use the same information on other websites, especially the lesser secure ones, like Facebook, etc. Ignore/report any emails or PMs from anyone claiming to be staff and asking for
 details. If they were staff they would already know them before contacting you. Be careful of sites you enter details into. Some sites are fake versions setup to fool you into giving your account details away.</p>

<p>Trust in the digital age is naive. Nobody should trust any company as no company is bulletproof. Security will always be a step behind the people that know what they are doing. It may be easy to nab the throngs of wannabes but it only takes one serious hacker
 to say, "I told you so." Hotmail acct's are hacked often and often without user input. Hotmail is an MS property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What it comes down to is simply this; be smart, trust no one.....and you'll be relatively safe. ;p
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, Facebook isn't less secure. They have, I believe, changed over to secure servers and have been that way for a good number of months at this point. All info passed over the network should be using the https protocol.

    <title>What is wrong with UAC system permissions&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> llltrunkslll  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is wrong with UAC system permissions&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I've exhausted all the resources I know for this issue. The problem I am having is that my system USED to work fine with the UAC asking for permissions on the fly for a run program. However, now it gives me the error "extended attributes are inconsistent".
 It does not matter what program requires elevation, all get the same error response. Here is the weird part: it will allow elevation IF I type the password instead of using a fingerprint swipe!! Despite this, the fingerprint scanner works completely fine for
 booting up (selecting user) and logging into locked (win key + L ) workstation. Under these circumstances it seems the software for HP Protect tools is fine. I know one can argue futility about UAC and suggest to lower the UAC to "Never Notify" but this is
 not the answer I want. I think UAC is useful and want to retain this checkpoint, so please humor me on this point.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what is the subtle difference between manual password vs fingertip swipe, but I suspect it is a virus based on the thought that it seems easier to keylog a password rather than somehow trying to intercept a fingerprint scan. Of course the corrective
 steps I have taken have done nothing to fix this:<br />
<br />
1) I tried to update windows (everything is already updated)<br />
2) I tried several full system virus scans (no infection found)<br />
3) I tried re-install of fingerprint sensor drivers (issue still occurs)<br />
4) I tried re-installing HP protect tools (issue still occurs)<br />
5) I tried re-copying the dui70.dll and consent.exe files from win7 CD (issue still occurs)<br />
*** I forgot to add that I have also used the system file checker and gotten 'no errors' on the scan. Although I'm not sure if this is real or not.<br />
<br />
My system is an HP Elitebook 8740w running Win7 Pro 64-bit. I use a NON admin account for my daily needs and rarely log in as admin (I just elevate permissions when I need them on fly). In the event viewer I get the following error:<br />

            If you owned a Ford motor car with an automatic gearbox then you might be tempted to install a gizmo that offers a smoother ride and reduced petrol consumption by modifying the gear changing sequence. If that gizmo should then fail (intermittently or permanently),
 would you ask Ford for advice or the manufacturer of the gizmo?<br />
<br />
What I am trying to suggest is that the problem you observe lies most likely with your thumb print reader and the way it interfaces with Windows. Its supplier should be your first point of contact, perhaps through the FAQs on his web page. You might find, for
 example, that the device is not certified for operation under Windows 7. I too have an application that worked perfectly under Windows XP but crashes occasionally under Windows 7. The manufacturer is aware of the issue but can't be bothered to fix it.<br />

            Removal isn't terrible if you follow this method:
<div>[proceed at your own risk]</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) Open <b>regedit</b> and navigate to<b> [hklm\system\select]</b></div>

<div>2) Double click on the <b>Default </b>(<b>REG_DWORD,</b> <i><b>not the top REG_SZ one</b></i>) entry and change it to the same number that is shown next to the "<b>LastKnownGood</b>" key</div>
<div>............</div>
<div>For example, my computer shows LastKnownGood as 0x0000003 (3), so in my case, you would change default to says "3" (without quotes)</div>
<div><br />
<div>3) Navigate to <b>[hklm\system\controlset00X\control\session manager\subsystems\</b><b>],&nbsp;</b>where X is the number you found in LastKnownGood</div>

            <p>That message indicates a problem with your NT File System (NTFS) and you need to run a chkdsk with error correction (chkdsk&nbsp; /r) but you are going to have to boot on something in order to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a common error condition after a power failure, using the power button, plug pulling, aborted restart, ungraceful shutdown, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is usually not a problem to fix but we are going to have to know more about your system:</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the MS Answers forums implementation does not prompt for any fundamental system information when a new question is asked, so we know absolutely nothing about your system.<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues but that is the way they choose to run things here.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers owners, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please answer the following questions as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
If you have a Dell computer, what is the Service Tag Number?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; avast!. Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />

<p>It seems like I am experiencing a similar problem today, after my home computer worked just fine last night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i.e. there was a power outage overnight and when we tried to use it this morning it refused to start, tried to reboot continually, refused to start in Safe Mode, refused to start with Hiren's bootcd, and refused to start with a freshly downloaded windows
 boot cd. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The blue screen of death (BSOD) message I am getting now that I have been able to disable the automatic restart option reads as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the first time you've seen this Stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed. If this is a new installation, ask your hardware or software manufacturer for any windows updates you might need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If problems continue, disable or remove any newly installed hardware or software. Disable BIOS Memory options such as caching or shadowing. If you need to use Safe Mode to remove or disable components restart your computer, press F8 to select Advanced Startup
 Options, and then select Safe Mode.</p>

            Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends)
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this(one if you have already run activation troubleshooter)
<br />
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below or use the chat support link(weekdays only)
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/405170...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.

            <span>Since you are unable to boot into Windows, we recommend performing a<span>
</span><strong>Startup repair</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>using<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Media Creation Tool</strong>.
</span><strong><span>Startup Repair</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>is a Windows Recovery tool that can fix certain system problems that might prevent Windows from starting.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Startup Repair</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>scans your computer for
 the problem and then tries to fix it so your computer can start correctly.<span>
</span></span>
<p>
</p><p><span>We recommend Creating a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows 10 Bootable media</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(i.e. USB or DVD) using<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span>Media
 Creation Tool</span></span></strong></a><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>to repair the PC</span></span><span>.&nbsp;Once you're ready with<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Bootable Media</strong>, follow the these steps and check if the issue persist.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span>Insert&nbsp;the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows&nbsp;installation disc</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>in the disc drive or connect<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>USB media</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and then start the computer.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Press a key when the&nbsp;message<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Press any key to boot</span></strong>&nbsp;from CD or DVD appears.<br />
If your PC does not detect the media automatically:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>During the restart process, read the screen for any instructions that explain how to&nbsp;interrupt normal startup and enter the basic input/output system (BIOS)&nbsp;setup utility. Most PCs use the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>F2</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>F10</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>ESC</strong>,
 or<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>DEL</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>key to begin the&nbsp;BIOS Setup.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Look for a tab in the&nbsp;<strong>BIOS Setup Utility</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>that is labeled<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Boot&nbsp;Order</span></strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Boot&nbsp;Options</span></strong>, or<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Boot</span></strong>.
 Following the directions on the screen, use the arrow keys to go to the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Boot Order</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Enter.</span></strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Locate the CD, DVD, or&nbsp;USB flash drive (this might be called<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Removable Device</strong>) in the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Boot list</strong>.&nbsp;Following the directions on the screen, use the arrow keys to move the&nbsp;drive up so that it
 appears first in the Boot list. Press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Enter</span></strong>. The boot order sequence is&nbsp;now changed to boot from the CD, DVD, or USB flash drive.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>F10<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>to save your&nbsp;changes and to exit the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>BIOS Setup Utility</strong>. Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Yes</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>in the confirmation window. The PC will<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>restart</span></strong>.
 Allow the PC to restart&nbsp;normally. The scan will take a few minutes and remove any malware that&nbsp;may be infecting your computer.</span></p>
</li></ol>
</li><li>
<p><span>Select a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>language</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>time</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>currency</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>keyboard</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>or another input method and then click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Next</span></strong>.</span></p>

<h2>            Acer T231H LCD touch screen stopped working</h2>
                    Didn't use the touch screen for a while - now it doesn't respond to touch at all! Can I reset it?

<h2>            Windows Updates issue - &#34;Keep your PC plugged in until this is done.  Installing 8 of 80 ...&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Keep your PC plugged in.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased a new laptop [Gateway NE522 series] one week ago with Windows 8 installed. &nbsp;Yesterday afternoon, I walked into my office to see a message "Keep your PC plugged in until this is done. &nbsp;Installing 8 of 80 ..." &nbsp;The circle of dots continues to spin.
 &nbsp;It is twelve hours later and the message is still there. &nbsp;I've checked this out on my other computer and see that I am not the first person to experience this. &nbsp;The microsoft site gives four solutions, BUT.... I can't even get to a screen that allows me to
 do anything. &nbsp;I can't start in the safe mode, I can't do anything. &nbsp;The message remains and the circle spins. &nbsp;How can I attempt a fix if I can't even get to a functional screen. &nbsp;If I shut down with the power switch, the same screen opens up when I restart
 even if I hit the esc key a zillion times or hold Windows+F8. &nbsp;Help</p>

            <p>Hi Graham,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you get the stated error when you try to print a picture. I would suggest you to restart the Print Spooler service and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press Windows key + R, type
<strong>services.msc </strong>and click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Check if the <strong>
<em>Print Spooler</em></strong> service is <strong><em>Started</em></strong> &amp; <strong>
<em>Automatic</em></strong>.</span></p>
<span>Also check for the
<strong>Dependencies </strong>for the <strong>Print Spooler service</strong>: Right click on the service and click
<strong>properties</strong> and then click on the <strong>Dependencies</strong> tab. Make sure all the dependency services are running.</span>
<p><br />

<p>I think there is something missing after powershell</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a problem getting Cortana to work on a laptop, upgraded from 32bit Windows7. &nbsp;The problem appears to be that the Language settings are all for UK English - except speech which is set for US English. Trying to set this to UK English by selecting
 System - Time &amp; Language - Region &amp; Language - &nbsp;English (United Kingdom) Windows display language - options and selecting speech causes a download to start - but it always fails with a very transitory error message, something about needing to be signed in
 as an administrator, and then offers some other applications, not including the UK speech one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem may be related to the one where the user files are all made read only - reported by several people - which also occurred on this machine. I got rid of that by discovering that the upgrade had added a special permission which denied write access
 to the user directories. Deleting this got the file access back to normal. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I presume the speech installation problem is something to do with access rights to the directory in which speech is installed but how to fix it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;I tried the dism and sfc commands - but they did not find any faults. What was supposed to come after powershell?</p>
<p>

            <p>I have just encountered this problem after a promising start after upgrading from Windows 7. Tying in your commands has no result - they just sit there. I would like to go to windows Help and Support and use the chat, but don't know how to without the Start
 menu and app display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything else seems to work, but this is a very important gap. I rely on it to find things.</p>

<h2>            Malicious Software Removal Tool won&#39;t launch</h2>
                    Trying to run Malicious Software Removal Tool on my laptop because I have a virus - I can download the self-extracting file to my desktop, but when I double-click it the MRT.EXE does not start. Tried several times. When I search for it I found several
 files named "MRT.EX-4gfrbju8" (or similar random characters) in a folder called C:/WINDOWS/PREFETCH. I assume the virus somehow corrupted MRT.EXE before it could launch. I also tried this on my desktop and the MSRT app ran OK. But is there another way to get
 it to launch?

<p>Unfortunately I do not think there is any good news for you. Bitlocker is too good for the home environment and as far as I know nobody has been able to crack it without a keyfile after Windows is reloaded. Have a look here for full details:</p>
