<h2>            Can&#39;t add files to WhatsApp Web</h2>
                    Recently, I installed WhatsApp web on my Notebook. I tried t upload some photos from my notebook HD but nothing was uploaded. I tried to upload some pdf and word files but that didn't work either. I checked FAQ on WhatsApp but there was nothing.&nbsp;

<h2>            Skype Video Recording - Cut off Video&#63;</h2>
                    I recorded my video and when recording, I could see everyone in the frame of the video but when I ended the recording and viewed it, it cut the video to a smaller frame size. Is there a way to pull the original video recording of just one of the participants
 so I can see everyone that was in the frame?

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;express my regret to inform you that the video recorded and saved on the conversation would only be the one that you can download. I also would like to clarify how many are you on that video call and if your video feed is also included in the frame when
 the call is currently ongoing? Can you also provide a screenshot of the frame which all the members of the group call are seen. This would help us further assess what may have caused the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your response. </p>

            I have this same problem. The recording is cut horizontally, and so both the received video and sent video are more portrait than landscape.

<h2>            Windows 10 very slow startup &#40;approx 1 hour&#41; after big update</h2>
                    <div>Intel Core i5-3570K CPU (no overclock)<br />
16Gb RAM<br />
256Gb SSD system drive<br />
512Gb SSD gaming<br />
1Tb HDD storage<br />
approx. 16Mbits/s internet via 100Mb/s network with 2 other wired devices and around 6 wireless.</div>





<div>Was running Windows 7 (x64 Pro) for a few years before taking the free upgrade to Windows 10 earlier this year.</div>

<div><br />
All has been fine with 10 until the first major update earlier this month&nbsp; (Dec 2015 - I've seen this update referred to as 'Threshold 2').<br />
The update seemed to go okay and then asked me to restart. On startup, the system seemed to get stuck on the black screen with the blue windows logo and the spinning dots. I went away and left it for approx. 3 hours but it was still there. I figured it must
 have run into a problem so restarted it.</div>

<div><br />
The system again got stuck there and probably took another 2-3 hours before it finally booted back into windows.</div>





<div>The problem is that now, every single time the system turns on it is taking 30 minutes - 1 hour to get past that black screen with the blue windows logo.</div>





<div>Before this update I'm not certain how long it was taking because it didn't even register with me, certainly no more than a few seconds.<br />
I've checked the list of items that run on start up and everything is listed as either no impact or 'not measured'.</div>

<div><br />
I'm not certain this problem is due to the threshold 2 update but it does seem to be the leading candidate. Any ideas?</div>

<p><span><span>Your problem is hard drive related. Unfortunately due to reporting failures I cannot currently identify the drive responsible.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A simple test might be to disconnect two drives and see if the boot is still delayed with just the system drive connected.</span></span></p>

                    <p><i>Vista-7 Networking Issues</i></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have two laptops, one running Vista Home Premium the other Windows 7 Home Premium and I want to transfer files between them. When I am on the Vista computer I can go onto Network click on the Windows 7 laptop and then a login screen comes up where I type
 in the username and password of the Administrator account on that computer, it then lets me access the files on the Windows 7 computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I then try and do it the other way round a similar screen comes up but this time under username and password it also has Domain: Windows 7 PC in bold text with no option to change it. I have tried putting in the account details for accounts on both
 computers but none of them work and it comes up with ‚ÄúLogon failure: unknown username or bad password‚Äù despite both being right. Why wont this work and if I am not doing it the right way how can I access the folders on the Vista computer from the Windows 7
 computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already made sure all settings in regards to file sharing are right on both computers and there is nothing wrong there that I can see.</p>

<div>Since you are networking home computers running different versions of Windows, you cannot set up a homegroup, you will need to setup a home network.</div>

            <p>Hello Bhavesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>From the issue description, I understand that on start-up of your computer you see an
<span>anonymous account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand the inconvenience caused, b<span>e assured that we are here to help you with your concern.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>How many accounts do you have in your computer?</span></li><li><span>Have you ever deleted any existing accounts in your computer?</span></li><li><span>Are you able to see the unknown user account in <strong>USER folder</strong>?
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>The issue you are facing could be cause of a user account which is been deleted previously and the files from that profile may be still reflecting, perhaps now your computer is not able to retrieve the account information because the user account has
 been removed, either by you or by Windows. And also there are chances of</span> an incorrect settings under the User Account Options or it could even be a virus infection.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you perform the below methods to see if it helps,</p>
<p>

<strong>properties</strong>.</span></li><li><span>You have the option to <strong>disable</strong> the account from here, without actually deleting it.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>If the issue still persist, proceed with
<strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly follow the below steps to check and set the settings under the User Accounts correctly,</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press ‚Äú<strong>Windows Logo</strong> + <strong>R‚Äù</strong> key from the desktop to get the

</p><p>Try and install the disk offline. Go to network settings select go offline. Then insert the disk to install. This will just install the game, once the game is installed go back online and then get the update.</p>

<p>Hey there Tim!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to get the Witcher to install unto your console. I would say that if you haven't yet, to try the steps outlined in our
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/disc-error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to troubleshoot problems playing a disc on your Xbox One</a> article online. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Give those steps a shot if/when you get a chance, and let us know how that helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>

REGISTRY_ERROR (51)<br />
Something has gone badly wrong with the registry. &nbsp;If a kernel debugger<br />
is available, get a stack trace. It can also indicate that the registry got<br />
an I/O error while trying to read one of its files, so it can be caused by<br />
hardware problems or filesystem corruption.<br />
It may occur due to a failure in a refresh operation, which is used only<br />
in by the security system, and then only when resource limits are encountered.<br />

<h2>            How to view &#34;cover-art&#34; of mkv videos on Win10 &#40;thumbnails&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a small "thing" which troubles me a bit. I have quite big own movie library, mostly MKV files and additionally MP4s. To edit meta data and movie cover of MP4 is simple and easy by 3rd party SW and this cover is then nicely visible in File Explorer
 and in Films&amp;TV app as well. <strong>But when comes to MKV there is a problem with it</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For editing meta data, add subtitles, another audio stream and movie cover I am using 3rd party SW - "MKVToolNix GUI" and "MKV Tag Editor". Both apps allow me to add an attachment which I always named simply "cover". I was led by plenty youtube and web manuals
 for editing MKVs but I stayed without resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is MKV fully supported video container/file in Windows and if so why it does not show thumbnails as any other formats? Please help me to solve it - maybe I am&nbsp;just doing it not that way it should be done, or it does now work from totally different
 reason. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance to everybody who will read it and answer me!</p>

            <p>Win10 added support for MKVs so thumbnails show up too with the first frame of the video as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad070a25-73e9-4770-bbe6-986af1c7cd84" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad070a25-73e9-4770-bbe6-986af1c7cd84" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However probably embedded cover art is not supported. You can try a third-party thumbnail shell extension such as

            <p>While Windows 10 does support MKV video<strong>, it does not support showing the Cover Image that is inside MKV files</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As RoertJWin explains Windows 10 will only show the first frame of the video stream if you select Medium, Large or Extra Large Icons from the VIew Ribbon</p>

            Thank you guys! You confirmed me the sad truth I was little bit afraid of - that its not supported unfortunately. I will try to test it with Icarus and see whats gonna happen.

    <title>DNS Client Event Errors 1014, 1006 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kylejones  say:</h3>
<h2>            DNS Client Event Errors 1014, 1006</h2>
                    So for reasons that I cannot comprehend, I keep getting DNS Client Event Errors and each time they have appeared, my internet connection has dropped.&nbsp; I have ran every diagnostic I can think of and nothing has worked.&nbsp; I even had my ISP send a technician
 to see if it was a modem problem and obviously it isnt.&nbsp; After the technician got done doing his diagnostics, the connection was stable and was working great.&nbsp; One of the common patterns I have noticed with this though is that the connection drops at random
 times of the day so its really hard to tell when its going to drop next.&nbsp; I did a flushdns and I dont know if that really did much of anything either.<br />
<br />
When my connection drops because of these errors, it is usually down for 5-10 minutes.&nbsp; Eventually, the problem seems to solve itself but it is REALLY annoying when I am browsing and all of the sudden I have no connection for no reason.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Here is the 1006 error:<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">"The client was unable to validate the following as active DNS server(s) that can service this client. The server(s) may be temporarily unavailable, or may be incorrectly configured. 24.116.2.50"</span><br />
<br />
Here are the most common 1014 errors that I get:<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">"Name resolution for the name teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com timed out after none of the configured DNS servers responded."</span><br />
<br />
and<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic"><br />
"Name resolution for the name dns.msftncsi.com timed out after none of the configured DNS servers responded."</span><br />
<br />
I have run out of ideas on how to fix this.&nbsp; Ive googled these issues and there isnt really one definitive answer.&nbsp; I have ipV6 disabled thinking that would alleviate some of the problems but I dont think its working too well.<br />
<br />
At this point, any help would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp; <br />

            <p>I also experienced this issue just now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a new laptop so I'm still getting used to some things. When I last used it last night, I closed the lid out of habit without shutting down.&nbsp; I haven't changed the default settings of what it does when closing the lid, so I'm assuming it would sleep/hibernate,
 whatever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw the OP's issue when I first opened the laptop this morning to start using it again.&nbsp; I didn't recognize the icon next to the app that was preventing shutdown (looked like probably some pre-installed protection software) and I couldn't figure out any
 intuitive way to force it to shut down the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The password field just read "locked" in grey, so I had no way to enter my password or do anything else on the screen. I eventually hard-booted it and it's currently taking it's sweet time Configuring Windows features while booting back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I miss something obvious in how to force the problematic app to shut down?&nbsp; Are there some logs I can check to find out what the app was?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Bhavana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A metro app runs in one of three possible states, active, suspend, or performing some defined background activity. When an app is not on the screen, it‚Äôs either off or suspended in the background waiting to be waken up but will be forced to shut down if
 the system determines that more resources are needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Alt</strong>+<strong>Shift</strong>+<strong>Esc</strong> to bring up the Task Manager, find and select the app, and click
<strong><em>End Task</em></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Let's try these steps out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press and hold the power button until the Xbox One console fully powers down.</li>
<li>Power back up and check to see if the points show up in game. (Visit the Store within the COD: Black Ops III menu and check the top)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the points continue to not show up, we recommend reaching out to our phone support team specifically to inquire about refunding and repurchasing the points. Unfortunately we are unable to assist further with purchase issues publicly on the forums.</p>
<p>Please keep us posted on how it goes!</p>

<h3> gillian uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is the Windows 7 Starter OS compatible with the drivers for HP Deskjet F4580 series</h2>
                    I have an Acer Aspire One 522 notebook which was pre-loaded with Windows Starter 7 OS. I want to use my existing printer which is an HP Deskjet F4580 series but although I have tried all the advice available I can't get the printer to work. I have downloaded
 the drivers (32 bit) but once the file is extracted,the Installation Wizard fails to open.
<div>If I upgrade my Windows 7 OS will it allow me to complete the installation and use my printer or do I need to upgrade to a new printer ,or do I need to do both?</div>
<div>I would like some advice before I commit to spending on either or both.</div>
<div>I would be grateful for any help</div>
<div>thank you</div>

            Another option to install HP dirvers:<br />
How Do I Find the Best Driver for my HP Printer in Windows 7:<br />
<a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c02681060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10010.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c02681060</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To download the drivers yourself:<br />
<br />
The drivers are for all editions of Windows 7, they should work with Starter.<br />
<br />
Try redownloading the newest F4580 drivers:<br />
<div><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=3944758&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Software &amp; Driver Downloads&nbsp;‚ñ∫</a></div>
<br />
<br />
Install the drivers before connecting the printer to your computer. After installing connect the printer, if it‚Äôs still not recognized:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Install-a-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Install-a-printer</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Try the Printer Troubleshooter <br />
1. Click the Start button, then click Control Panel <br />
2. In the search box, type troubleshooter <br />
3. Then click Troubleshooting <br />
4. Under Hardware and Sound, click "Use a printer" <br />
<br />

            Thank you TrekDozer for your suggestions, <i>&nbsp;I really appreciate it but none of the suggestions solved my problem.</i>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>So far I have followed Microsoft recommendations and&nbsp;</i></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><i>uninstalled any hp software</i></li><li><i>disabled all microsoft services and gone to selective start-up</i></li><li><i>cleared temporary files and folder</i></li><li><i>disabled the firewall</i></li></ul>
<div><i>Then using TrekDozers suggestion I downloaded the HP printer Install Wizard for Windows 7 ,it downloads the driver and software,extracts but then reverts to an earlier page telling me there is a problem with my F4580 and I need to download the drivers.</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>I have looked carefully at the specification for the printer and I can't see Windows 7 starter edition mentioned at all ,although all the other Windows 7 are mentioned.</i></div>
<div><i>From what I can find out ,the Starter edition is quite a basic operating system. Could it simply be that the printer driver is not compatible with Windows 7 starter and the OS needs upgrading?</i></div>

            Thanks Palcouk but I have tried to install full feature software without the printer connected but it does not make any difference.
<div>I am using the built in default user account, and I have run Disk Clean Up and tried to re-install.</div>
<div>It does not work on either notebook.</div>
<div>Thanks for the suggestions I appreciate it but I think I might have to ditch my printer and buy a new post Windows 7 one instead!</div>

            I got the install to work with Windows 7 Starter using the full install package. I changed the install options. I unchecked all the optional install packages and only install the required printer package. The install worked.

<h2>            Desktop Access Denied</h2>
                    Hi, unfortunately I think this question is very similar to some others that have been asked , but I have a few small differences I think.<br />
I've had Windows Vista on my laptop (a dell inspiron 1525) for about 50 weeks, and when I logged on last week I was told immediately that Windows Calendar was unable to open, closely followed by one telling me that C/....desktop had access denied. I cannot
 open itunes or any of my folders, but Internet Explorer is running, albeit very very slowly. The layout on my computer has returned to the previous grey colour and older style&nbsp;toolbars, rather than the blue of the newer Windows (no idea if that is relevant)
 I have tried the other threads and attempted to do a system restore, but access is still denied.
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately&nbsp;although&nbsp;I'm fine with using computers, when it comes to technical stuff&nbsp;I'm completely illiterate,&nbsp;so many of the answers on this forum don't really help me at all. I'm sorry if I'm repeating what someone else has said!

            Hi - I think my information can help. <br />
<br />
This can be caused by two things, that I so far know. <br />
<br />
Have you downloaded anything from Internet? <br />
<strong>Reason:</strong> It might be a virus infection, by a type of trojan-horse.
<br />
<br />
You need also to check, ownership settings.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
How&nbsp;to?: <br />
<br />
&nbsp; 1. Click <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwindowshelp.microsoft.com%2fQueryWS%2fGetOpenContent.aspx%3fassetID%3d0c970446-1432-4ea7-b578-67cc2b5844ae%26amp%3bDocumentSet%3den-US%26amp%3bRenderKey%3dXML" />&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>
 and the choose <strong>Computer</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;Now <strong>open</strong> the <strong>Local Disk (C:\)</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; 3. Now open the <strong>Users</strong> folder, and open the <strong>folder with your account name</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A list with many different folders will appear.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; 4. Right-click on the <strong>Desktop</strong> folder and&nbsp;choose&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; 5. Now the properties dialog for the Desktop folder will appear, navigate to the&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Security</strong> tab&nbsp;and check the security&nbsp;and permission settings for your account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Save everything&nbsp;and&nbsp;restart your PC, to take good effect.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you need any further assistance, <br />
please feel free to contact me and let me know.<br />
<br />
I hope this information was helpful...<br />
<br />
Have a nice day...<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Fisnik

<h2>            3D Builder Crashing After Loading a Model</h2>
                    Recently I've decided to try 3D building,&nbsp;so&nbsp;it was great&nbsp;that Windows had an app for that! 3D Builder!&nbsp;However,&nbsp;if I click a model from the library, or even anywhere on the computer, it says "loading file..." for a few seconds, then crashes! Do you know
 how to fix this? It would be very helpful. Thanks!

 up as @{Microsoft.People_10.0.3450.0_x64_8wekyb3d8bbwe?n and isn't opening either!</p>
<p>Now what do I do!</p>

            <p>I also got the notice that the File History drive was disconnected. I saved the files from my laptop to an external hard drive (Passport), and because the laptop was needed elsewhere for about 10 days, the files were not saved and File History disconnected.
 I should have turned it off before disconnecting the external hard drive. I accidentally solved the problem in this way: I disconnected the hard drive, turned off File History, reconnected the hard drive where it had been (on a hub port), the clicked Run for
 File History. It told me to choose a drive, and I chose &nbsp;the Passport, the drive it had said several times it could not recognize. Then it asked me if I wanted to transfer files which had been saved in the meantime to the Passport. Before, I had said Yes (it
 seemed logical), and that always resulted in the File History being disconnected. This time, I said, No, and the File History continued on without any problems, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>I hope this helps someone else.</p>

 able to open and print a pdf file.&nbsp; Did Microsoft change something with an update that won't allow to download?&nbsp; Also, what the heck happen to my pdf reader from before?&nbsp; I used my home computer in April &amp; May for printing, but now I am totally disgusted with
 it.
