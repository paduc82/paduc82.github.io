<h2>            Pen problems on the surface PRO with both OneNote 2013 desktop and with the Metro Reader app</h2>
                    Hi there!<br />
<br />
<div>I have recently bought a microsoft surface pro ( updated to 8.1 ) and I mostly use it to take notes at university expecially on top of pdf files, so I usually do that in 2 different ways: I open the pdf with the metro Reader app and I take note directly
 on that or I "print to OneNote 2013" the pdf file so than images are inside OneNote "desktop version. Anyway both ways have difficoulties and bugs.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>1)</b> Metro reader app: &nbsp;The pen writing it's kind of annoyng because <b>
the text it's at low resolution while I'm writing and it become at high definition only once I have removed the pen from the screen,
</b>here's a video of what I'm talking about:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>http://www.mediafire.com/watch/8hg192320h0t8mm/VIDEO0022.mp4</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Also the metro Reader app is missing of the basic options related to the pen, I mean text color and&nbsp;thicknesses, also having the&nbsp;highlighter with the pen would be nice.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>2) </b>OneNote on desktop it's of course much more complete but it has some bugs too:&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><b>Very often the "print to OneNote" of a pdf files doesn't work; the print end but the popup on OneNote doesn't appear so you can't actually insert the images...</b></li><li><b>The scroll of the pdf inside OneNote it's kind of laggy with a lot of lag, something that a tablet with an i5 x86 processor shouldn't soffers</b></li><li><b>The pen sometimes start to write very strange, the only way to fix it it's to reboot the system. Here's a video of what I'm talking about:&nbsp;</b></li></ul>
<div>http://www.mediafire.com/watch/4ttmvecacsl24yc/VIDEO0020.mp4</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Microsoft if you are reading this you should really correct those bugs</b> as it's incredible that after so much time from the realese of the Surface tablet there still are those kind of bugs (
<b>which are very well know on the internet</b> )!!! &nbsp;Expecially the ones related to the handwriting with the pen!! Those are basic functions!!</div>

<br />
<div>I have of course reinstalled wacom pen driver after upgrading to windows 8.1 ( because without the driver the pen isn't even working after the update ), the &nbsp;problem isn't windows 8.1.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Regarding the pen writing bad this is happening from day one for all surface pro and has never been fully corrected and you can check on the internet as it's full of report like this. More specific I have underscore 2 different problem regarding the pen,
 the first is inside OneNote desktop and can be solved by rebooting the system, the second is inside the metro reader app which always act like that ( a little improvement here has been achived which windows 8.1 but it doesn't fix the problem completely. Take
 a look here: http://thingsthatmightinterestnerds.com/surfacepro_knownissuesbugsquickfixes/#reader just to link one.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also I have reported problem regarding the phinh to zoom inside OneNote which is laggy and the lack of pen command inside the metro reader app. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 &#43; Qualcomm Atheros AR9485 WiFi Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that this problem has been mentioned here before, but every solution I've tried has so far failed. I'm running an Asus V500C with a Qualcomm Atheros AR9485 wifi card, and for the last 8 months I've had extremely weak wifi signal on my computer, to
 the point that if I'm more than 5 metres from the router I will have "limited" internet or it won't display any available networks. If I'm in the same room, the most I will get is 4 bars, and anywhere else it drops down to 1 or 2. I know it's not the internet
 connection because it's happened in at least 5 different locations, and my partner's computer has worked perfectly fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Using the Google DNS.</p>
<p>- Updating network card driver (with every available software on my computer).</p>
<p>- Rolling back network card driver.</p>
<p>- Reinstalling the network card (through device manager).</p>
<p>- Resetting winsock and TCP/IP stack.</p>
<p>- Flushing DNS.</p>
<p>- Disabling "allow this computer to turn off device to save power"..</p>
<p>- Changing power settings to "maximum performance"</p>
<p>- Clean installing Windows.</p>
<p>- Disabling IP autotuning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going crazy! Is there anything I've missed, or has anyone had such a persistent issue with this? Windows says the network card is working normally. Thanks!</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My comp needs a new battery, so I have too keep it plugged in all the time. But when I accidently unplug while I'm in&nbsp;my WordPad document instead of removing the words I didn't save, it makes all the words disappear. It doesn't disappear as in all the words
 are gone, it just seems like it turns invisible.</p>

<p>Hi Annabeth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are different factors that can contribute as to why the text in your WordPad application turns transparent. One possibility is that the file got corrupted when the computer was shut down unexpectedly. For us to resolve your concern, kindly answer the
 questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any error messages that showed up when you attempted to open the document in WordPad?</li><li>Have you attempted to open the WordPad document in a different application such as Notepad to verify if the same issue occurs?</li><li>We would like to verify also what troubleshooting steps have you already completed and what were the results?</li><li>Which version and build of Windows 10 is installed on your computer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response to our queries.</p>

I understand the issue that the sound is not audible from the notification and when devices are inserted to the system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The issue could be due to the outdated drivers.</span></p>

            Hi Frank,
<br />
<br />Welcome to our community.
<br />This is Leocadia, independent community expert, and I am glad to assist you today.
<br />
<br />Usually a device like Bluetooth requires a software driver for the operating system to recognize it. In the meantime, let‚Äôs check if the Bluetooth device will still work. Follow the steps below:
<br />
<br />    On Ask me anything, type Device Manager then press Enter.
<br />    Click on Bluetooth tree to expand.
<br />    Look for the Bluetooth device, Right-click then select Properties.
<br />    Click on the Driver tab, look for the Roll Back Driver button, and click on it.
<br />    Restart your computer for the changes to take effect and check if the issue persists.       
        </p>

            Hi –í–ª–∞–¥–∏—Å–ª–∞–≤–ü–æ–¥–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />You should also report this to Microsoft so that Microsoft developers should look into this to consider this for a fix.
<br />
<br />Windows Key+F

</p>
<p>this is unforgivable, i swear if there was a half decent competitor for microsoft i would've switched to them before i sleep tonight, when i don't have a say on whether my computer is turned off or not.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Personally I never use automatic updates. I like to know what is coming down to my PC. If you want to use automatic updates I would suggest that you choose a more appropriate time and day than that which is currently set. The default is every day at 3am,
 most people's PC would be switched off at that time. You could change this to a specific day and time that is less likely to cause you grief.</p>
<p>Tricky</p>

    <title>Mouse sticking on a new laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ltfostercity  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse sticking on a new laptop</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased an Acer Aspire R7. I unplugged my Logitech M325 (3 weeks new) from the old laptop and plugged it into the new laptop. The mouse movement began to stick about once a second. In other words, when I move the mouse continuously in a circle,
 it would freeze about once every second for a fraction of a section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I unplugged the usb receiver and plugged it back in, no help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried another perfectly working mouse, no help. Same behavior.</p>
<p>I uninstalled the driver, no help.</p>
<p>I checked the device manager, when I plugged in the usb receiver, two HID-compliant mouse drivers are installed. (I don't know why.) I disabled/uninstalled one of them, still the same behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect something is interfering with the device driver. Your help is greatly appreciated. I hate to return the laptop for something so petty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>LT</p>

</p><p><span><span>I understand that you are facing some issues with the mouse on the pc. I will try to help you with this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sign out from the current user account, restart the pc and login to the Admin account or the MSA to test if that helps with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also suggest you to install any pending Windows updates on the pc to check if that helps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Further, you may also boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists. When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there
 are several programs that start automatically and run in the background that may interfere with the system. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting
 automatically.</span></p>

<h2>            &#34;Location is not available&#34; - pop-up error message hours or even days after intentionally deleting or moving a file or folder from the desktop.</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 Pro, Surface Book with performance base (1TB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since about 2 weeks I have frequently been receiving pop-up error messages after deleting or moving a file or folder from the desktop, hours or even days later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not clicking on anything, nor am I looking for any file or folder. No file or folder is missing.</p>
<p>The file or folder I am suddenly alerted to is one I previously deleted from the desktop, or moved from the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pop-up message say:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Location is not available</em></p>
<p><em>C:\Users\xxxxx\Desktop\File or folder name is unavailable. If the location is on the PC, make sure the device or drive is connected or the disc is inserted, and then try again. If the location is on a network, make sure you're connected to the network
 or Internet, and then try again. If the location still can't be found, it might have been moved or deleted.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is fully updated. </p>
<p>I ran full scans with Windows Defender, Malwarebytes - no viruses or malware. </p>
<p>I ran sfc /scannow in the command prompt - it says it found errors which it repaired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems my Surface Book is scanning my PC or desktop for files I have previously and intentionally deleted or moved, and alerting me via a pop-up of these deleted or moved files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            If you bought a retail Windows 7 Upgrade it should have included separate 32 and 64 bit disks. Each disk installs the bit type it is.<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span>If you bought Windows from the Microsoft Store you can log back into your account and select the correct bit level to download, then download it.</span></p>
<p>

<br />
<div>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Switch Bit Type</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>1) You'll need to use the correct bit install disk - 32 and 64bit come on a separate DVD.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>2) You must completely reinstall Windows when switching bit types (32/64 bit). You'll have to backup your files and reinstall all your programs.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Ôªø3) Upgrading or simply switching between Windows 7 32/64 bit is not possible.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>4) If you are moving to 64 bit make sure your computer can run 64 bit - you can use the Upgrade Advisor to check:</span></p>
<p>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</span></a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>5) Make sure 32/64 bit drivers are available for your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>6) The Windows 7 key will work with both 32 and 64 bit, but only one can be installed at a time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>7) If you want both 32 and 64 bit installed at the same time you will need two product keys.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>8) Installing the bit type you want (with a retail disk):</span></p>
<p>
<span>A. Insert the install disk, restart and boot from the DVD
</span></p>
<p>
<span>B. Click Install Now
</span></p>
<p>
<span>C. At the setup screen, click Custom (Advanced)
</span></p>
<p>
<span>D. Choose the partition to install Windows on</span></p>
<p>
<span>E. Continue with the install</span></p>

<span>Unless you have 4GB+ of RAM, or have programs written in 64bit, you won't notice much of a difference performance wise by installing 64bit. Make sure the computer has 32 or 64 bit drivers
 before installing the bit type you chose. Most 32 bit programs will run in Windows 64 bit.</span></p>

<h2>            Flight Simulator X with Acceleration pack  constantly crashing....</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon all.... I am having problems with my FSX Acceleration simulator. I have TACPAK installed which has worked fine for months, and now all of a sudden in the last couple weeks the Sim crashes constantly, any time I do anything aside from fly one
 particular aircraft. The Superbug works without fail, but default planes and other addons I have installed cause the sim to crash every time. I can't even change my flight plan mid flight without a crash of the program. I am at wits end and need a little guidance
 on what may be wrong, and how to fix it. Again, the only aircraft that works consistently is the VRS SuperBug. Some of the default FSX planes cause crashes too.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi George,
<br />
<br />Hope I can help you here. There are a couple of ways to create shortcuts on Windows 10. You can right-click the Desktop, navigate to New, then Shortcut. You can also go to the Start menu, find the app of your choice in the menu, and then drag and drop (hold left click to drag and drop it in there by releasing the left mouse button) it to the Desktop. Simple as that.
<br />
<br />If you need help with this, let me know. I hope this helps.       
        </p>

            Hi GeorgeBarley, this is the quickest way to create Desktop shortcuts in Windows 10 . . .
<br />
<br />In the alphabetical list of apps on your Start Menu, find an app, right click and choose 'Pint to Start'
<br />
<br />Drag the newly created Tile from your Start Menu onto your Desktop to create a Desktop shortcut
<br />
<br />Then delete the new Tile from your Start Menu

                    <font color="#666666">Hello!<br />
<br />
So basically, i managed to delete afc.sys on my computer. After that, i couldn't run any CD/DVD's on my computer. Sure, I heard the CD spinning but it never initiated a program.<br />
After that,&nbsp;</font><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">I also disabled and uninstalled my entire CD/DVD Device. I then restarted my computer found CD/DVD drivers but couldn't download them.</span><font color="#666666"><br />

Any solution for how i can find a download for a afc.sys or a driver for&nbsp;(Arcsoft(R) ASPI Shell (CD/DVD program) ?<br />

Thanks!<br />

            <p>I would consider that good news as removing the Afc entry should fix the issue&nbsp;with the
<font color="#666666">CD/DVD device.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To remove the&nbsp;Afc entry double-click&nbsp;LowerFilters and, under Value data,&nbsp;remove Afc&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt; OK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a system restore point beforehand and restart the computer after.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure why you deleted the afc.sys but the Afc value in registry is trying to load the afc.sys driver which no longer exists and hence the error with the CD/DVD device occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Removing the Afc value in the registry should fix the problem.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought a copy of Windows 7 a while back thru a MS student discount.&nbsp; I may need to replace my aging motherboard soon which will require a clean OS install and need to know if this version is like a retail version and good for 3 installs or is it considered
 an OEM version and good for only 1.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            Its equivalent to a retail license and permits 1 installation, its also an upgrade license, which means, you need a base qualifying license such as XP or Vista to use it. If you are replacing your motherboard, the previous qualifying license that came
 with that motherboard will be invalidated, this means, the upgrade version will not longer have a valid license to use.

                    I have a new laptop&nbsp;with Windows Vista installed.&nbsp; I down loaded the most up-to-date version of i-Tunes but when I plug in my i-pod it views the i-pod as a camera.&nbsp; I've gone into the control panel, selected autoplay and selected "take no action" under
 Devoces; however, this has made no difference - when I connect my i-pod, it still shows it as a camera and wants to download pictures.&nbsp; Also, when I run the i-tunes diagnostic, it shows that no i-pod is connected.&nbsp; I've been to the Apple store to ensure nothing
 is wrong or needs updated with my iPod and all is up-to-date and working properly (shows up fine with the apple computer).&nbsp; When I came home, I tried attaching my iPod to another computer which&nbsp;runs Windows XP and no problem - my iPod touch is immediately
 recognized.&nbsp; Computer technical support tells me this is clearly a Microsoft issue and won't help.&nbsp; I'm getting tired of the run around and many hours of unsuccessful online searches an

I've tried what you suggested.&nbsp; When I connect the iPod (step 7), it shows up as iPod but with a picture of a camera.&nbsp; I then get a notice from Corel Photo Downloader telling me new photos have been found on my Apple iPod and asking how I wish to proceed (e.g.,
 use Corel Photo Downloader to transfer the pictures).&nbsp; However, I went through and followed the other instructions in step 8 and 9, but when I open iTunes, I still do not see my iPod and when I run the iTunes diagnostic, it still tells me I have no iPod attached.&nbsp;
 Is there anything else to try?

<p>I've got the same issue on XP and it's also reported on Windows 7 so seems to happen on all windows platforms.On XP the iPod shows up in Scanners and Cameras, is not seen by Windows Explorer as a drive and iTunes can't see it.</p>
<p>I've posted on the Windows 7 thread also.</p>

<p>A solution to this from Microsoft would be very helpful as it must be a Windows related problem.</p>

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I have the same problem with my iPhone I tried this. However windows regognises the phone as a camera anyway so it doesn't change anything. It's not the phone as it is recognised by iTunes on another computer. However iTunes on the non-synching computer
 recognises my Ipod and synchs with that, no problems. help!!!!!</p>

            This did the trick for my Ipod touch 32 G 2nd generation! I tried several other ways that I had read on info boards (itunes included). I had the same problem as above mentioned where it was just a camera, and there was no way I could see that there were
 music files involved. I followed the above steps and I now had the sync and transfer purchased songs available in itunes. I had my daughters ipod touch which worked fine and then mine which didn't on the same computer that we have always used.

Thanks so much! <br />

            I am posting this because I realize the frustration that we are all going through with this. Fortunately, mine has been fixed today. Yay. What I did was I deleted EVERYTHING related to ITUNES. Yes, this will include Bonjour, Quicktime, Itunes itself, and
 all the "support" related to Itunes. Delete EVERYTHING. So go ahead and uninstall these programs through Control Panel. Once you do this, you will have to Restart your Computer. When it goes back on, Reinstall Itunes. Connect your Ipod.&nbsp;Voil√†!

<div>In my case, there was a notification saying that a new driver installation needed to be done. This was exactly what I needed since my Ipod was recognized as a different driver. A friggin Camera!!! So it installed the right driver and then basically fixed
 everyting! Grrrr. I honestly don't even know how this all thing happened, &nbsp;but I am glad that this is over.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Btw, on my computer, my Ipod's icon is no longer a camera,it is now gladly showing an actual Ipod however, on it's subscript reads "Digital Camera" which is nothing to worry about since my Ipod can now be detected and is currently syncing right now. &nbsp;YAYYYY!!!

    <title>Windows 10 Skype app BSOD CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Skype app BSOD CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a new laptop and wanted to use the fancy new Windows 10 Skype app because of the nice integrations like the fact that I can reply from notifications and don't have to keep Skype running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop: HP Pavilion Power 15</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't install any additional drivers, I let windows install everything through Windows Update.</p>
<p>Everything works as normal, even Skype Business has no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However; In the Skype Win10 app, as soon as I get into a call and actually start speaking, I get a blue screen of death with the following error code:</p>
<p>CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>
                </div>

            Hi Bernat, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a similar problem. I have the Skype App on my Laptop and my PC (pre-installed) and logged in on both devices with the same account. As soon as someone calls me, both devices get a BSOD simultaneously with "CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED" error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Minidump folder is empty. (show hidden files enabled)</p>

<p>You have many applications crashing on your computer. A blue screen generally points to hardware or driver failure. I highly suggest you update the drivers for your onboard graphics. The ones you have installed were not designed for the build of Windows
 10 you are using. You can try the latest HP drivers or the generic Intel ones, if those do not help.</p>

<p>Windows installed every one of my drivers by itself. Normally I wouldn't trust the operating system with this. But I
<strong>do not </strong>have anything crashing on my computer that I don't exactly know why. It was in the past few days that I've been trying some ""dangerous"" stuff out. All of those crashes are a result of the last few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is ONLY Skype for Windows 10 that is crashing. Nothing else. And not just crashing, but blue screening my computer.</p>
<p>Is there anyone at Microsoft who can actually provide some useful information, or everyone is just going to blame me for the faulty product?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is every other version of Skype working then? Business and the desktop app.</p>

</p><p>I looked at the dcom permission of {76BD748E-6280-4AA9-9242-7DE433CA49DB} and they look correct its set for read access only the installapp has read write. I looked at other dcom and they all have the same, so I assume that correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>since {76BD748E-6280-4AA9-9242-7DE433CA49DB} is trying to write maybe it should have write for all users. the only problem is the permissions are grayed out and i'm administrator.</p>

</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Are you installing Windows Updates related to .NET framework?</p>
<p>b) Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue generally arises if the .NET framework update packages have got corrupted. Other reasons include malfunctioning Windows Update service. I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Run the built-in Windows Update troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a) Press ‚ÄúWindows Logo‚Äù + ‚ÄúW‚Äù keys from the keyboard.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b) Type ‚Äú<span><strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>‚Äù in the search bar and press ‚Äú<strong><em>Enter</em></strong></span>‚Äù.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c) In the ‚Äú<span><strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>‚Äù window, click on ‚Äú<strong><em>View All</em></strong></span>‚Äù on the left pane.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d) Click on ‚Äú<strong><em><span>Windows Update</span></em></strong>‚Äù.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">e) Click on ‚Äú<span><strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>‚Äù and then click on ‚Äú<strong><em>Run as Administrator</em></strong></span>‚Äù.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">f) Click ‚Äú<strong><em><span>Next</span></em></strong>‚Äù and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
I would suggest you to run the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool and then check for the issue.
<ol>
<li><span>Open an elevated command prompt. Press <em><strong>WinKey + X</strong></em>, click
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li>Type the following command, and then press Enter. It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.<br />
<span><strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth</strong></span></li><li>After you get message ‚ÄúThe operation completed successfully‚Äù type second command and press enter. It will take some time to finish.<br />
<strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></li></ol>
<span><strong>Important: </strong>When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reboot your computer, check for the issue and post back your results for further assistance.</span></p>
