    <title>Visio 2007 hangs on Surface Pro 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mstory63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visio 2007 hangs on Surface Pro 2</h2>
                    <p>We just recently purchased a Surface Pro 2 with the intent of using Visio during field engineering. The Surface is using Windows 8.1 and we have loaded Office 2007 Pro including Visio 2007 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some unkown reason, while using Visio it will hang and can only be ended by using Task Manager. I have installed all available updates for Office and Visio, but I am still having issues. This is unfortunately rendering the Surface nearly useless for
 our application and it is extremely disappointing. Especially considering we have over $2K invested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen this issue before? I've searched and searched, but have been unable to find anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You may be able to try the compatibility mode for Visio. &nbsp;The program is most likely a 32-bit program and will be located in the Programs (x86) folder on the C: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8.1, I do believe you can access compatibility mode for an app when you display "All Apps" and navigate to Visio and right-click on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does, select "Windows 7 32-bit" if available (I do believe it is).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The video display standards in Windows 8 causes some issues with Windows programs (older ones). &nbsp;I don't have or use Visio myself but that has worked on some other older programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worth a try at least.</p>

            <p>Hi MStory63,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to us! I appreciate you posting the question on the Surface Community. I'd love to work with you until we can resolve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear that Visio 2007 isn't working on your device. When you say it "hangs," it freezes and stops working, correct? Also, do you see any error messages when the program hangs?<br />
In this case, my suggestion is to uninstall the program and reinstall it. Since you have actually purchased Visio and own the product key, you should be able to do that with no problem.<br />
James also makes a great suggestion of trying the compatibility mode for Visio. That's definitely worth a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if it worked!</p>

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some digging around, but was unable to find a command for running Visio as a Windows 7 program. I'm new to Windows 8 so it is entirely possbile it's there and I just can't find. I found how to run as an Admin, but I'm already and Admin on hte machine
 so it didn't seem like that would be beneficial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help and if you have any other ideas I would love to hear them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike</p>

            <p>Hi Shiho_P,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I say Visio hangs, it completely locks up and the only way to close it is with Task Manager. The only message I have ever seen is a Visio wrning saying it can't change the property of the object I'm working with. I've seen this before with a locked
 object, but in my case, it was not a locked object and so the error seems misplaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, even though I have never seen a Windows crash warning, I do find several error reports related to Visio which I can share if you like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did run updates again and found a few more, but Visio still locked up on me after the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is, by the way, an intermittent problem and I can get some work done, but it is very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for re-installing the program, I will do so when I'm back in the office, but which won't occur for nearly a month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Till then I'll keep plugging away. If you think of anything else, please let me know and thank you again for your reply.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi MStory63,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your confirmation.</p>
<p>So Visio randomly freezes and locks up without giving you any warnings; that sounds very inconvenient. Can you recall when this started? Was this an issue since day 1, or did it start after a particular update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should try re-installing the program, and if it doesn't work, I'd suggest you try a refresh. This is definitely something worth considering since you already have all the updates and are still experiencing the problem with Visio constantly hanging.<br />
<ul>
<li>Refresh from within Windows</li><li>Refresh from USB recovery media (make sure to have a USB recovery drive ready)</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>Try uninstalling &amp; reinstalling the program, then if it still doesn't work, try a refresh of the device.</p>
<p>Let me know if it worked!</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Hi Shiho_P,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Sorry for the delay in circling back on this, but I've been in the field a lot lately and I wanted to make sure I tried as much as I could before getting back to you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>At first I tried uninstalling and re-installing Visio which did not solve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Next I did a refresh of the Surface and loaded only Visio.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>This seemd to improve something as only once did Visio lock up where I had to restart it and lost data.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>However it is still freezing up on me. Looking at Task Manager I found that there is a process called "Touch keyboard and Handwriting" that appears to be the culprit.
 It shows it using resources and when I cancel it, Visio starts responding again. This is a nuisance, but I do not lose data. During a typical day of using the pad for work I have to cancel this process probably 20 times a day. The process starts again when
 I use the handwriting pad and works fine until it freezes again.</span></p>
 one instance of the process running. Before the updates, there would be two instances of it running, so it looks like something has been improved upon.</span></p>

</p><p>To clarify this, when you say "I just want my money back", are you pertaining to get a refund? If yes, we can only refund credits in accordance with the refund policy. You can check this FAQ link:
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12147/when-can-i-get-a-refund?q=refund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">When can I get a refund?</a></strong></p>

</p><p>Once you have confirmed that you are eligible for a refund, you can proceed to this FAQ link:

<p>
</p><p>For additional information, here are some tips that might help improve your chances of successfully using the Account Recovery form to regain access to your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer you previously used to access the account.
</li><li>Also it is much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred.</li><li>Even if your original information has changed, be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally.</li><li>You don't need to fill out the whole form; just the fields that you know apply to your account.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Note: While most responses will come within a few minutes, it can take up to 24 hours for a response to be received.</p>

<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 Edition Not Working</h2>
                    <p>So I recently found that I had a code to&nbsp;redeem Minecraft Windows 10 edition for free. So I followed the links and proceeded smoothly up until I got to the point where I was about to play the game. According to Minecraft, I do not have the full version even
 though I put the code in to get the full version. I have it in my order history here:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7f30c5d5-d9f4-46f9-bbd2-7f39260ae3b9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7f30c5d5-d9f4-46f9-bbd2-7f39260ae3b9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>But it seems I didn't the full game. I would appreciate any assistance given, thank you very much</p>

            Hello, in this case, you will have to login to Mojang on the official Mojang website. Now go to the Account section, then under Minecraft for Windows 10, click on Redeem. Log in to your Microsoft account. Now uninstall the current version of Minecraft you have, then go through the installation procedures.
<br />Hope this helps, and let me know if you have further questions! :-)

in the browser (i.e. word online), even when I try to use the "open folder" it opens the OneDrive folder in the browser. This is especially problematic with password protected documents, which cannot be opened online. The only solution so far is&nbsp;to open windows
 explorer and search there, making the whole process longer and more inconvenient.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behaviour renders Windows 10 search, however great it might be, utterly useless to myself. I want to edit and use my documents on my local machine in an instant, not being forced to do everything in the browser. If I wanted to do that, I would go for
 Chrome OS anyways. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to search, open &amp; edit&nbsp;local documents stored in the OneDriver folder in the normal Windows 10 search using local apps by their normal default, not the browser?

            Hi Ruizell, this is not helpful at all, at least for me. The files are already on my local hard drive. I configured my own Documents to be in the OneDrive. When I search for a file, also an executable, it will always open the browser. This behavior is
 ridiculous.

            Hey Guys, I'm having the same problem. &nbsp;Whenever I use Cortana to search my computer, it only opens files on Onedrive via the browser (all of my files are synced locally as well). This is completely ridiculous and, since the browser version of Office apps
 is, to put it bluntly, terrible, I end up having to manually search for things again and open them in my local version of office. &nbsp;If someone has found a way to prevent this from happening, please let us know. &nbsp;Thanks!

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some reasons behind this concern like search index settings, software conflict, corrupted system files and such. Let's try configuring your search index and see if this will rectify the concern:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open Control Panel.</p>
<p>2. Click Category on the upper right.</p>
<p>3. Click Large icons.</p>
<p>4. Look for Indexing Options.</p>
<p>5. Run the Troubleshoot search and indexing. See image below.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Roberto,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is NOT the problem. &nbsp;The system finds my local files, but when I click on the LOCAL file, it opens it in my browser on Onedrive online and not using my LOCAL Office programs. &nbsp;There does not appear to be a way to set Cortana search so that it opens
 Local files locally. &nbsp;This is extremely frustrating and it basically makes the Cortana search useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jim</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS--I did run the troubleshooter and it found no problems.</p>

</p><p>1. When did you notice the behavior?</p>
<p>2. Is it the same behavior if you try to open your OneDrive files using File Explorer or is it only happening with Cortana?</p>

<p>Hi Roberto,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has always been a problem with Cortana search and it only happens with Cortana. &nbsp;My local files open normally when I use Explorer. &nbsp;This has been the case on all of Windows 10 systems (currently running 3 different systems with the same issue) and it
 is quite honestly pretty frustrating.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#59; 4K screen&#59; Mouse Pointer</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping I can find some help for this. &nbsp;First things first:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lenovo Yoga 910</p>
<p>Windows 10 64 Pro</p>
<p>4k resolution 3840 x 2160</p>
<p>225% scaling&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that running certain programs, the mouse pointer on the screen becames extremely small and sometimes disappears. &nbsp;This doesn't seem to be an uncommon issue, but I haven't been able to find a fix for it. I have tried increasing the size of
 the cursor, but it always becomes the same tiny size with certain applications. A couple of examples:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Citrix remote desktop - too tiny to use anywhere on the screen. &nbsp;if I have it in window more, the cursor will be extremely tiny when moved over the window, and normal sized when moved over the task bar or outside the window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WPS Presentation - Cursor is normal size over the top bars, menus... but as soon as I move it into the actual edit area for the slides, the cursor shrinks to miniscule again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea how to fix this. &nbsp;Any help or suggestions would be great.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Java errors while updating it</h2>
                    <p>Trying to update Java for Windows &amp; it gives me 3 error screens. 1)neither command line parameter specified is an existing directory. 2)Java Update fails to apply changes to your system. 3)Error 1722. There is a problem with this Windows Installer package.
 A program run as part of the setup did not finish as expected. Contact your support personnel or package vendor. I have Windows XP with 32-bit version operating system and Service Pack 3 version 5.1. Current Java 6 'update 22' is on my system and I can't get
 to 'update 26'. What do I do next?</p>

    <title>Connect to Wifi network before user logon &#40;pre-logon&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> manoj kumarsatane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connect to Wifi network before user logon &#40;pre-logon&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 10 Pro on Surface Pro 4 which is joined to the domain. Currently upon login to Windows, the wifi gets connected automatically to the network using saved credentials.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My requirement is upon reboot, the wifi should get connected to the network using saved credentials before user login and should stay connected. Currently upon reboot, I see the Wifi is On, but in disconnected state. So i have to select the wireless network
 SSID manually and click connect and upon doing this it asks for the credentials to connect and upon providing the credentials it gets connected &amp; stay connected without user login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe there should be some registry setting to achieve this. Please share the solution to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another Windows 10 laptop which has this requirement working, but having hard time fixing the issue on surface</p>

    <title>Mouse pointer is both stuck and ghosting with mouse movement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ceebrown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse pointer is both stuck and ghosting with mouse movement</h2>
                    My mouse pointer is crazy. Well, they BOTH are. There are two. Schizophrenic. One is stuck in one spot on the screen, inside the 'touch bubble', the other one is blinky on/off but does follow my mouse movements. I've disabled, enabled, restarted with both
 scenarios, reverted, uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers, shut it off and restarted, and searched for this problem- to no avail. I have a wireless keyboard and mouse and installed Windows 10 on a Windows 7 touch screen desktop pc last year. Had this problem
 a couple times before, but restarting with the plug pulled did the trick. Now it doesn't fix the problem. Anybody know anything else I can try? Support suggested some of the things I tried already, but nothing works.

    <title>Corrupt explorer.exe in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasmine nagal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupt explorer.exe in Windows 7</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When my laptop (Windows 7) turns on, there is a slight ticking noise coming from the motor. A screen later pops up before going to the log-in screen. This screen says that one of my drives need to be checked for consistency. After I let that go through
 and do its thing, I am able to log in. While Windows loads up my desktop, a pop-up comes up that says that explorer.exe is corrupt. Once everything is done loading, my desktop is black and there is no taskbar to be found. I am able to run programs like my
 browser through the task manager but other than that, my laptop has become extremely difficult to use and manage.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be much appreciated.</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            Hi Jasmine,
<div>I understand that the problem still persist so try these steps and see if that helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Have you&nbsp;tried the suggesstion provided in the earlier post?&nbsp;</div>
<div>2) If yes then provide&nbsp;us the results for them?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>Try to kill the explorer process from <strong>Task Manager</strong> and create a new task (explorer.exe) and check if that helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: Try to run this antivirus scan from the below link.</strong></div>
<div>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968003/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968003/en-us</font></span></a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><font color="#000000"> </font><i><span><font><font color="#000000">Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</font></font></span></i></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>You may check if you face the same issue in different user account or new administrator account. You may create a new user account on your computer and then check.<br />
<strong>Create a new user account<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account</a><br />
If you do not face the same issue in a new user account then you may refer the below link and use the steps provided to fix a corrupted user profile

            <div>Hi again,</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried booting my laptop in safe mode and my taskbar and desktop still doesn't show up so the problem still persists. I'm running the antivirus scan right now. When I try to create a new task (explorer.exe) it says it cannot be found.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will try creating a new account later today and I will let you know.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Skype call</h2>
                    <p>I recently received an update to Skype and when I made a video call using the camera icon on the screen, all I could see was my video of me on my screen and not the video of the person I called.&nbsp; When I added an additional caller to the group all I could
 get was little pulsing circles and audio from each speaker but could not get their video feed. I can't see anywhere&nbsp;in the settings to correct this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 100 mbps internet connection and typically get speeds of 80+mbps. Can anyone advise me how I get my caller's video to come though on my device?</p>

            The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect is, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions.

<h2>             Deleted Recorded TV Icons Do not Delete in Windows Media Player 12</h2>
                    When I open Windows Media Player 12 I see Icons from Recorded TV programs that have been deleted from my computer. They are generic icons with the names of the tv shows that i have deleted. When I right click to delete these empty icons it does nothing.
 When I try to clearing the cache it does nothing. When i go to properties then to the folder they are supposed to be in they are not there. Of course they are not there because I have deleted them. Yet the icons remain. When I click on enough of the icons
 as if to play them I am told that windows can not find the file, which makes sense because i have deleted them. Then it asks me if i want to remove the empty icons.When i click yes to this last question it does&nbsp;nothing. I tried&nbsp; turning off the WMP12 service
 then rebooting and turning it back on. I also have tried clearing the history in Media Center since these programs work together. This did not clear these useless Empty Recorded TV Icons out of WMP 12. Also tried looking f

            I had already tried the second method and that does not work. Had not however thought about going into C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Microsoft\Media Player. I already had or should i say have the hidden files and folder option open. I find this convenient
 for cleaning up the remains of some programs that that I have uninstalled.&nbsp;Most programs when uninstalled will leave some kind of&nbsp;minor file behind. mostly in the Users section of the file table. Also of course in the registry. Anyways I did what you suggested
 and it worked. Method 1 i mean. Still i fail to understand&nbsp;why this would happen in the first place. These icons should have deleted the easy way. Anyway, thank you for your quick reply, and fix for my problem.

<p>Hi UrbanC,</p>
<p>How&nbsp;did you clear the cache?</p>
<p>Follow Method 1 to completely delete the Media Player cache. If that doesn't work, proceed with method 2.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;Enable windows from seeing hidden files and folders.&nbsp;<span>Read: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Show-hidden-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Show hidden files</span></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Now go to C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Microsoft\Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Youâ€™ll see a bunch of files in the folder.&nbsp;Iâ€™d advise moving all of these files to another directory somewhere else, but you could also delete them if you wish to.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Relaunch Windows Media Player for your changes to take effect.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Uninstall and reinstall the player by turning it off from Windows Features and then turning it back on.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer:</span></span></p>

    <title>Crazy BSOD Loop. Genuis Needed. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frychael  say:</h3>
<h2>            Crazy BSOD Loop. Genuis Needed.</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I'm having a unique issue with my gaming pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the middle of this computers life it would get unexpected restarts. So, I let the computer sit for a while. After months passed. I decided to turn the PC into a server. after uninstalling the preexisting hard drive and installing two 3tb hard drives and
 installing windows 10. the issue seemed to have resolved itself in the works. We decided to take the server in a different direction and let my PC become a gaming beast again. I'm using it and its running fine. Then, something really odd happened, a couple
 of days into using the pc again after the fix. My desktop background restored to the original one I had set...&nbsp; BACK BEFORE MY FIRST EVER BSOD. it came back out of no where without original hard drive to retrieve the file that it was from. Because I got new
 hard drives. After about a week of using it, I got a BSOD. I believe its reasonable to think it was CRITICAL PROCESS DIED.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>months pass..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am completely unable to reach my desktop. safe mode is not allowing me to reach my desktop either. System restore process wont complete without a new BSOD. Neither did Startup Repair, nor the sfc/scannow in Command Prompt. ive tried installing windows
 10 again, but it wont complete and I receive "Missing or corrupt files". All of my devices are secure and cables are connected properly. Ive update BIOS and arranged my storage devices properly. I restored my pc to an older restore point, which the process
 gave me a BSOD, however the restore point is now gone. There's no way to check drivers because I cant reach my desktop nor to run an anti-virus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>By trying to resolve CRITICAL PROCESS DIED, these are all of the errors I have received so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>*CRITICAL PROCESS DIED</p>
<p>*BAD POOL CALLER</p>
<p>*IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL</p>
<p>*BAD POOL HEADER</p>
<p>*SYSTEM SERVICE EXCEPTION</p>
<p>*PFN LIST CORRUPT</p>
<p>*MEMORY MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>*KERNAL SECURITY CHECK FAILURE</p>
<p>*NTFS.SYS</p>
<p>*FILE SYSTEM</p>
<p>*PAGE FAULT IN UNPAGED AREA</p>
<p>*CIRITICAL STRUCTURE CORRUPT</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or questions would be greater than greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing back and learning from the community </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time! :)</p>

            <p><span>Hello Angie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Does the issue persist only on Camera app or when using other applications?</span></li><li><span>Do you get any error code along with the error message?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may be facing the above issue due to some of the corrupted app files &amp; folders or missing app files on your PC. Sometimes running a simple troubleshooter will resolve this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since <strong>Camera app</strong> is one of the
<strong>Windows Store apps</strong>, I suggest you to run the </span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Windows apps troubleshooter</span></strong></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
 check if the issue is resolved if you havenâ€™t tried the method before.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if thereâ€™s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, this tool can automatically
 identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write to us with the answers to the above questions and the status of the issue on the same post for further assistance. Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft community. I understand the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span><span>Firstly, I congratulate you for your brand new <strong>Nextbook Flexx10.</strong></span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the below Methods and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1. </span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to update the Imaging devices from the Device Manager. Refer to the below link on<strong> How to update drivers.</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/how-to-update-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/how-to-update-drivers</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If your webcam or Camera app in Windows&nbsp;10 wonâ€™t open and you get an error message saying that we canâ€™t find or canâ€™t start your camera), the cause might be antivirus software thatâ€™s blocking the webcam or camera, or it could be an outdated webcam
 driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to refer the below article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Windows can't find or start the camera</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/can-not-find-start-camera-webcam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/can-not-find-start-camera-webcam</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, then I suggest you contact the device manufacturer for further assistance with the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us with more information and weâ€™d be happy to help.</span></p>

            When I refreshed the Nextbook, the selfie camera worked. But after installing Windows updates, the front camera is giving that same error again. I have read the same problems on the front camera with many other devices upgrading to Windows 10. Microsoft
 has got to create a fix/patch to this miscommunication between the Camera app and Windows 10. Yes, I am using your Windows camera app. I have tried rolling back the camera driver, did not work. I have tried uninstalling the camera driver and reinstalling it,
 did not work either. I even tried uninstalling the camera app and reinstalling it, did not work as well. If I have to keep resetting my Windows to get the front camera to work, then Win 10 may be deemed ****. So many people online are so frustrated with this
 error.

            <p>Hello Rajeshwari,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem with a NextBook Flex 11 where the front camera wouldn't work like the rear camera. The same error code appears.&nbsp;I already tried updating the camera driver from the device manager.&nbsp;Windows 10 also updated itself afterwards. But when
 I tried using the front camera, the problem was not resolved.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?</p>

<h2>            video chat crash due to Intelcameraplugin.dll error</h2>
                    <p>when I tried to use video chat with my friend by front camera, it suddenly crashed.</p>
<p>A message "Intelcameraplugin.dll error" appeared.</p>
<p>Is it due to the display driver issue? Any kind of solutions?</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

            Hi  TypicalNetUser 
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isnÃ¢â‚¬:tm:t fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. ItÃ¢â‚¬:tm:s possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you donÃ¢â‚¬:tm:t have any. If you donÃ¢â‚¬:tm:t have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=outlet+tester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=s...</a>). Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system wonÃ¢â‚¬:tm:t be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. SlackÃ¢â‚¬:tm:s Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.
<br />
<br />10. Replace Charger or Battery Module
<br />
<br />Ultimately, if you donÃ¢â‚¬:tm:t see any improvements after trying all the above, then itÃ¢â‚¬:tm:s maybe best that you replace either the charger or battery itself. This will require contacting your laptop manufacturer and placing an order. Batteries and the chargers are not necessarily cheap, especially if its an older system. But, if you have no choice, its something you will just have to do to get your system back in working order.
