<h2>            Each time trying to run Adobe Reader it is not Responding in Windows 8.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Adobe Reader ver 11 incompatibl[ty with Windows 8 is there a cure</p>
<p>I have downloaded &amp; installed Ver 11 of Adobe Reader and each time I try to run it I get Adobe not Responding. I have been through all the troubleshooting options with no success and some of them just freeze the process forcing me to end the task through
 the task bar manager.<br />
I previously ran Ver 10 on my Dell Desktop running Windows Vista with no problems at all but since converting to the Acer Aspire Desktop running Windows 8 I have had no end of problems.<br />
Does anybody know of a cure for the present problem please?<br />
Regards<br />
Chris<br />

<p>Hi Armanda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Having a corrupted game file is one of the potential reasons why keyboards shortcuts stop working on Microsoft Solitaire. To help you resolve this concern, I need to gather more details. Kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you experiencing the same concern with your other games?</li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps you have done so far?</li><li>Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the affected game?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I recommend that you run the troubleshooter for Windows apps. This can help remove problems with an app from Microsoft Store. To do this, you may refer to the link below:</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem. I tried going through the troubleshooter and nothing worked. I tried Resetting the app, and that didn't work. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and it still doesn't work. This changed when there was an update.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have tried all the suggestions (resetting, trouble shooting, etc.) and it didn't change anything. I am not having any problems with other games. As Genelle said, it happened with a game update in May. I have read other people who have mentioned changes
 to the game after that update that wasn't ideal, including a loss of using your keyboard, so it definitely isn't just my version/my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would love to heard if/when that feature is brought back to the game, since I used to play it everyday but haven't since the update.</p>

<h2>            Disc reader broken. Can i play download games&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>So i have had my xbox one for about 1 month and now the disc reading thing has broken (it makes a high pitch sound and won't play). so i only got it to play halo 5 and the remastered halo collection. I am wondering if I can just buy the downloadable versions
 of these games and bypass the need for the disc reader (can't be bothered getting a replacement or refund). will this work? Thank you all</p>

    <title>2 Surface Pro 3s stopped charging after system triggered changes on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shoaibbarry  say:</h3>
<h2>            2 Surface Pro 3s stopped charging after system triggered changes on the &#34;Microsoft Surface ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery&#34; drivers</h2>
                    <p>I have two MS Surface Pro 3s at home and both are not able to charge using the their old original as well as a new surface charger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife's Surface Pro 3 developed the issue first and thinking that the old charger had died we ordered a new one which also didn't work so we thought the tablet's port had an issue. Continuously trying to push the charger plug into the port cause
 the bottom plastic under the pins to break off and this unexpectedly allowed for her surface to be able to charge again (consistently) without issues although the charger LED would no longer light up. She's now been using the Surface Pro for a good 6 months.
 The old charger that has chipped its plastic from just beneath the pins allows the plug to slide up and down a bit while plugged in and a sweet spot allows the battery to charge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface developed&nbsp;<span>exactly the same symptoms last week</span>&nbsp;i.e. it stopped charging using its charger or the original spare I had from my wife's tablet issue above. Using my wife's chipped charger my surface would charge just
 fine (no LED indication but screen shows charging).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has made me come to the conclusion that either both of our charging ports have gone bad (highly unlikely) or some software driver configuration has caused this to happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On investigating further thinking that a system configuration might be the issue I checked the Microsoft Surface ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery's event logs under device manager and see events on the device while I was not using the tablet
 (suspended). On the day the issue happened I can see six event logs by&nbsp;<span>User: System</span>&nbsp;starting off with&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event 1:&nbsp;3/16/2018 3:41:46 PM&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I didnt use the tablet until later that night around 10PM when I discovered the issue and followed a few tips online to remdedy which included removing and reinstalling the drivers which are also visible in the event log executed under&nbsp;<span>user:
 my account</span>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event 1:&nbsp;3/16/2018 11:09:47 PM&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This leads me to believe that a system level change has occured and has disabled the surface's ability to charge using the intended charger.&nbsp;</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p>
</p><p>I have the event logs saved and would appreciated if someone could help.</p>

            Can you run
<br />
<br />winver
<br />
<br />on both devices and reply with OS Version and Build number?
<br />
<br />If these are running Windows 10, you can run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit, which can find and fix many software issues <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403723...</a> 
<br />
<br />Another thing to try, if you are running W10 build 15063 or higher is to go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a> and download SurfacePro3_Win10_15063_1801002_3.msi. Then go into device manager and uninstall and DELETE the drivers. Don't restart. Now run the MSI which should install clean versions of the drivers. Any change?

            One more thing, with respect to the ports, have you check for dirt/grit on the connectors? 
<br />
<br />Also, if you are in the US, you could go to the closest physical retail Microsoft Store <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations...</a> with your hardware and the techs could assist in diagnosing "eyes on".

<p>Regarding dirt/grit yes, made sure of all the obvious factors including verifying the chargers are properly connected, ports are cleaned, no physical sign of any damage, different power sockets etc. Unfortunately I am not in the US so taking it to a MS store
 won't be possible at the moment. </p>

            Also, if you still have the issue after installing from the MSI, please DO run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit mentioned above. 
<br />
<br />Are you using your Surface's with any kind of plug adapter or do you have a native power cord for your location?

<p>So uninstalling and deleting the driver then installing the MSI didn't help unfortunately. I tried with both my charger and the new spare. So I am left with no other choice other than to run the Diagnostic toolkit which seems to be a bit more intensive.
 I will report back when its done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the power cord, my charger cable is US type but the spare I have is native to Saudi Arabia (UK type).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are the results for when I had the new charger plugged in:</p>

<p>For the first part of the diagnostic (Store apps and windows repair) I had my wife's charger plugged to my device (I had to plug it in as it was low on battery). After the restart I plugged in the spare charger and resumed the battery, screen and sound test.
 So evidently it doesn't detect a charger plugged in.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the spare charger yes, it is MS genuine Surface Pro 3 adapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Very odd that it reports the charger issue under Display.....
<br />
<br />You mention Saudi Arabia. I don't know if you are in an extremely hot environment which might have an impact on almost anything electronics related. The Surface Pro batteries have certainly had their issues, and I wouldn't rule out the battery itself being the culprit for both of these. 
<br />
<br />A kind of off the wall thought - I've seen instances that when you reverse the direction of the charger so that the wire points in the opposite direction, sometimes the charging experience changes. You didn't mention trying this so I though I'd mention it. Have you tried this and does it make any difference?

            Does anyone at work have a Surface Pro 3/4/2017 Pro?  It would be good to see if their charger lights up and charges on your device. Next step is to try a different charger from another Surface .. OEM not after market/third party.

            Hi umeshsoni 
<br />
<br />Most likely your Windows 10 is not genuine . . .
<br />
<br />1
<br />Do you know the history of your PC or version of Windows? 
<br />
<br />Is your PC second hand or was Windows reinstalled by a PC Repair Shop?
<br />
<br />2
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Run or paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv 
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of the resulting dialog . . .

            Hi umeshsoni
<br />
<br />Thank you for the screenshots . .. 
<br />
<br />Your Windows 10 is genuine, in fact your have a full retail licence, which even has transfer rights to another PC in the future . . 
<br />
<br />The only issue seems to be is that is it not connected to the Internet in order to self activate . . .
<br />
<br />Is your PC connected to the Internet?
<br />
<br />If it is, and Windows is not self-activating, your best option is to contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you activate your Windows 10 Pro

            There was a time when you saw Notification pending it was because the Microsoft server was very busy or it had a problem and you had to wait for a result.<br />
As we post this there is a user in Turkey that is not getting the Windows Defender definition update and he is one of our regular Insiders.

<h3> migpol2008  say:</h3>
<h2>            Runtime Error when using bluetooth&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I'm getting this message every time when I close a Windows Explorer window after I try to connect to a bluetooth device:</p>
<p><span>"Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library <br />
<br />
Runtime Error! <br />
<br />
Program: C:\WINDOWS\EXPLORER.EXE <br />
<br />
This application has requested the Runtime to terminate in an unusual way. <br />
Please contact the application's support team for more information." </span></p>
<p>When I try to connect, it takes a while and then it displays a message box with an exclamation mark but no text or message at all. Then when I try to close the Explorer window for the device I get the message above and after clicking ok, Windows Explorer
 restarts itself.</p>
<p>What can I do to solve this problem?</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi Migpol2008,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Which Bluetooth device are you trying to connect?<br />
2. Do you get a similar error with any other devices like USB?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong><span><br />
<span>I would suggest you to perform a clean boot and check if the steps assist you identify if any services are interfering.<br />
<strong>To perform the clean boot follow the step 1 mentioned in the below article and then try checking in this clean boot state -</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue gets resolved check which non-Microsoft service is causing the problem; referring to the article and following other steps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>After you have finished
 troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong><span><br />
</span><span><span>You may even try reinstalling the runtime components from the below provided link and check if this helps resolve the issue -</span></span></p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We understand that you are unable to associate XShell application to URL: Telnet. You may go ahead and try
 adding the program using Registry Editor and see if that helps. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><em><span>&nbsp;
 Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,
 back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.</span></em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to take
</span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press Windows key + R, to open Run dialog box.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type regedit and click on OK.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Now, navigate to
<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\telnet\shell\open\command</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>On the right pane, double click on the (Default) value and change the file location with the location of the program that you want to associate.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Close Registry editor and restart the computer.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I suggest you to post your query in

<p>Красота - вот умеют же ж американцы. И видео шло лучше чем с ютуба. Жаль, что походу с русскими сабами в масс эффект 3 пролетаем - там управление голосом от киннекта, а русский он не поддерживает.

<p>Я вот посмотрел и понял, что прорывов в игровой индустрии ожидать наверное можно будет только когда выйдет новое поколение приставок, а это примерно год выпуска текущего + 10 лет. Так что в этом году и следующем индустрия будет выезжать исключительно на
 сюжетах и продолжениях хитовых серий таких как фэйбл, хало, гирз оф вар. Ну и будут делать упор на киннект и его продвижение, т.к. весь потенциал девайса в программном обеспечении. Кстати кастовать заклинания в фэйбл через киннект достаточно забавное занятие
 судя по презентации. Гоуст рекон - шутер с киннектом достаточно комично смотрелся - не думаю, что смогу запомнить все движения которые надо сделать для того что бы "припасть" к прицелу, прицелиться и произвести выстрел :))) припасть к прицелу - движение похожее
 на жест "стоп" в боевой обстановке:))</p>

<h2>            Scammers</h2>
                    <p>Received alerts from Microsoft advising someone was hacking my computer they advised to contact 888-558-3498 so we did to find out that the person taking our information was actually the scammer - he also used phone number 855-666-1992 as well. He was very
 convincing and had a lot of knowledge about Microsoft, IP address, ETC... they also used "Connectwise Control"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They shared case ID# 44712245 for the Microsoft representative and his name was Victor with ID# 426481. Sr approval representative was a Catherine (4421254) please beware of them they are scammers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They also showed a picture of the scammer (from Dayton Ohio) and Microsoft was located in Washington State. We have already reported this to Microsoft and please take note Microsoft will NOT send alerts or call you.
</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thank you - </p>

<p>It's a common scam that you could have ended with the Task Manager. Now you must consider everything on your computer has been compromised. Passwords, PIN numbers, financial account information. A clean install of Windows is the best option and what I would
 do myself. See the following and decide if you want to tempt fate not knowing what they may have installed on your computer.

<p>Actually that type of pc filtration should be reported to authorities.....Microsoft only has ability to check</p>
<p>hackers when youre Microsoft name &amp; password have been used by others,in this case,microsoft</p>
<p>uses youre e-mail &amp; requires a new user password..Microsoft is pretty good at this..Also,with hackers

            <p>OK. I've had a look around and see that the Legends of Aranna is a stand alone expansion for</p>
<p>Dungeon Siege which also includes the original Dungeon Siege&nbsp; vs the more common expansion pack</p>
<p>from that era that required the original game to be installed before you could install the expansion.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"it asks me to either express install or custom install. "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you chosen custom install and tried installing to a non default location as I suggested ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I don't have this game and don't know what it's peculiarities are, but as with many games you</p>
<p>are more likely to find fixes if you visit the Dungeon Siege fan sites.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Normally this following situation should allow you to install the game, but will prevent it from launching...</p>
<p>MS has created a malware called DRM Blocking. This is supposed to be a security 'feature' , but</p>
<p>it prevents disk based games with a file title&nbsp; <em>secdrv.sys</em>&nbsp; on the disk from launching.</p>
<p>Dungeon Siege uses SafeDisk copy protection.&nbsp; Some versions of SafeDisk and SecuROM use the</p>
<p>secdrv.sys driver. I have more details in my post in <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544">

You can possibly transfer some data, pictures, and/or documents to removable media such as ThumbDrives,<br />
USB External drives (my choice) or even CD/DVD (make several copies if using these).<br />

<br />
Info :<br />
<br />
System Restore usually reserves 15 % of drive space and updates that are needed to run computer<br />
use up some more. Backups - Recovery Options and even updates from MS and those from HP, Dell<br />
or similar makers use space if your system loads them. Also there is overhead so drives do not<br />
format to their max capacity.</p>

<h2>            Being charged for something I&#38;&#35;39&#59;ve never used</h2>
                    
<p>Not sure if this was the right section to put this in, but I can't see where else it would go..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've noticed I've been getting a charge of £8.99 a month for the Xbox Music service. The thing is, I've no recollection of ever using the app/service/what-ever-it-is and yet I've been charged for it. I may have accidentally stumbled upon it a while back,
 but I would never have agreed to pay £9 a month knowing I'd hardly use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On one side, I see that I should have been more vigilant and had properly checked my bank statements earlier so I would have noticed it and not been paying for something I've not been using. But at the same time, I thought it was awfully sneaky of Microsoft
 to not make it fully clear that I would have to pay £8.99, at a monthly cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I would like to know is, would there be any way at all that I would be able to claim at least some of this "lost" money back, as money has been taken from my account for quite a few months now, and I haven't used to service at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>- Zappy180</p>

    <title>&#91;Feature Request&#93; Verify Game Files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> father berman  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;Feature Request&#93; Verify Game Files</h2>
                    Hi, I would like to request a feature to verify the integrity of game and dlc files. I recently had to replace my external hard drive for my xbox one x, and while re-downloading all my games &amp; apps I lost power. There were around 40 items left in the queue,
 most of which were partially downloaded and paused (I had paused large downloads to try to lower the number of items in the queue more quickly), and when I turned my xbox back on, they all appeared to be fully downloaded but don't fully function. I don't know
 which 40 games or add-ons were in the queue, and there was around 4 Tb of total downloads. I don't want to have to re-download a ton of stuff just to try to find the 40 incomplete files, so I am requesting a feature to verify game files on Xbox One. I've seen
 several other posts on here and reddit requesting a similar function, but they didn't gain much traction so I figured I'd post too. Thank you.

            I would love to see this added as a feature as well.&nbsp; It would be nice to be able to have the files verified if there is a problem then only what is needed to be downloaded to repair the issue instead of the full game.&nbsp; Especially with games commonly reaching
 the 100+ GB range now.

            I could see them doing this but it wouldn't be high up on their priority. How often do people download 40 items or so at the same time while also losing power. That seems rare to me.

            My specific situation is rare, but there are many others where it could be helpful, such as failed updates, left over add-ons, corrupted game data, etc. Its not super high priority but it would be incredibly nice to have for when you actually need it.

            <p><em>[That's not the exact same problem - although the WL error code is the same, the problem is a different one as the error message shows. I'm splitting your question off to its own thread]</em></p>
<p><br />
It's best to use a different subject for each test message so that you can tell the error messages apart, and to remove any unsent messages from the outbox before carrying out a new test. You may have to select
<em>Work offline </em>to be able to empty the outbox.</p>
<p>After changing the SSL option, you should close down WLMail and wait a few minutes before re-launching and testing. Otherwise, the option may not be applied.</p>

            Since you're getting the same socket error (authentication failed) whether SSL is on or not, please check that you have
<em>Log on using clear text authentication </em>selected on the <em>Servers </em>
tab (although I would expect a different error if it weren't). Check also that <em>
My server requires authentication </em>is selected (same proviso), and click the <em>
Settings</em> button. Click <em>Log on using</em> and enter your full OWA address and password. Then try again.

<h2>            Where can I find a Win 10 driver for a Canon i950 printer&#63;</h2>
                    The driver that comes with Win 10 does not work with a Canon i950 printer.&nbsp; Is there anywhere where one can be found or is my only solution to go back to Windows 7.&nbsp; I have almost a new printer and refuse to let Microsoft force me to buy another one just
 to use win10 though I would like to use it.

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Tried the driver but it will not print anything in color, even when asking for only a black and white print.&nbsp; I guess I will have to go back to Windows 7, never use any new Microsoft apps and never buy another Canon printer.&nbsp; In fact I think I will change
 operating systems completely.&nbsp; I sometimes believe that Microsoft and many companies providing peripherals must be in collusion to force users to buy new hardware.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I sometimes believe that Microsoft and many companies providing peripherals must be in collusion to force users to buy new hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't buy that. It's in Microsoft's best interest to move as many people as possible to Windows 10, by any means possible. If it was up to Microsoft,
<em>all </em>hardware makers would support Windows 10 on <em>all </em>their hardware, no matter how old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it's not up to Microsoft. Hardware makers are looking at the bottom line, and they're figuring the costs of re-coding drivers for old hardware and then testing them and maybe re-coding and re-testing. And they're figuring how much extra money they're
 going to make for all their trouble. Plus, hardware manufacturers want us to buy their new, fancy shmancy equipment, not cling to old equipment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, sometimes old hardware just can't work with new technology no matter what you do. Unlike Star Trek, Windows 10 is not Windows 7 - The Next Generation. Windows 10 is very different in many ways.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>1. Does this happen only with a specific site?</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Since you are facing issues even after turning off the popup blocker, you may
 try the following steps and check if it helps:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>You may try resetting all the security to default level for Internet explorer
 and check if that resolves the issue. To do this, follow the steps below:<br />
a. <span>&nbsp;</span>Open Internet Explorer.<br />
b. Click on Tools and then click on Internet Options.<br />
c. Click on the security tab, then click on "<strong><span>Reset all zones to default level</span></strong><strong>".</strong><br />
d. Under the <strong><span>Privacy tab</span> </strong>
check if the turn on pop up blocker check box is checked, if it is checked uncheck it.<br />
e. You can also add your favorite and trusted sites by clicking on "<strong>sites"</strong>under the privacy tab. Type the name of the web site and then click on allow.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the above steps do not work, then you may have to reset the Internet explorer,
 to do this try the Fixit ot follow the steps mentioned in the&nbsp;below article:<br />
<strong><span>How to optimize Internet Explorer</span></strong><br />
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Note: Resetting Internet Explorer's settings is not reversible.
 After a reset, all previous settings are lost and cannot be recovered.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

            Hey MehranSarker,
<br />
<br />You could try the following:
<br />
<br />Hit Windows key + I, go into Privacy. On the left pane, click Microphone.
<br />
<br />Be sure that Allow apps to access your microphone is on, and the apps in the list under Choose which apps can access your microphone are checked on.

<p>It appears from the suggestion by Andria Maria Mendez that she does&nbsp; not understand the issue, or just posted the booked message for general issues. Not a sufficiently high standard of help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that there are many people having problems installing and activating Windows 10. I sincerely hope that these issues can be categorized and clear corrective actions offered by Microsoft. All conversations with those successfully using this OS seem pleased,
 but it is so easy to discourage people and turn them into advocates&nbsp;for the competition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to get my Win10 installed on a non-essential machine before I risk important service needs on main PCs.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Not sure this fix is your panacea for updating but some windows 7 users have found that their HDD drive may not have an active partition for "boot,page file, crash dump, primary partition" Take a look at this user post:</p>

            <p>I have tried pretty much all the ideas given: setup a clean boot, removed non-Microsoft programs, downloaded the upgrade to USB, run this as a bootable medium, run the set-up from within the USB drive - and I keep ending up back at this message. &nbsp;I don't
 doubt this Windows7 PC isn't in the greatest of shapes, but I should have thought that there would be a clear and concise set of instructions coming from Microsoft if it is as common as these threads suggests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It installed okay on my Windows 8.1 machine. &nbsp;Having said this, I then discovered that the anti-virus had been licked off and emails failed to send. &nbsp;Again, wouldn't it make sense that Microsoft issue a list of common problems and solutions? &nbsp;Perhaps I'm
 not looking in the right place?</p>

            Dave, I couldn't agree with you more. When someone asks a specific question the Microsoft people should be able to answer it directly instead of sending people on to another link that answers other questions and leaves the user hanging. It seems to me
 that Microsoft people don't really know their product.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Try using diskpart to assign a drive letter to the sisk and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start then type diskpart in the search bar.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 diskpart in results above &gt; click Run as administrator</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 diskpart loads type list volume, press enter</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>You
 should notice that you will see your partition that you use for your data, it should not show a drive letter assigned to it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type
 select volume 6 (replace 6 with the volume number assigned to the partition in question)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type
 assign letter Z (replace Z with the letter that you want to assign to it)</span></p>
<p><span>When you look in Computer, you should be able to see your partition.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also refer to the link provided below for more information on adding and removing drive letters.</span></p>

<p>It ain't even showing in diskpart.</p>
<p><strong>And</strong> this volume, G, showing up in free volume.</p>
<p>\My hard disk memory is 456 GB.And at that time: C:/- 75 GB and G:/- 98GB and rest 280 GB it showed free.</p>
<p>After making E:/ of 98 GB, &nbsp;&nbsp; it again showed free space = 280 GB i.e., it showed G included in free space.?</p>

<p>Sounds like you destroyed what was the G partition, which is now the E partition - no data backups I suppose?</p>
<p>If you had unused space it would have shown up in Disk Management as 'Unallocated' not 'free'</p>

<p><br />
Yeah, no backups</p>
<p>and the space is 'free', (maybe.......,, because quite previously I had all space used , then I deleted the other partitions which now show up as free, ? )</p>
