            It's a technology that allows your mouse to switch to another host. Say, e.g. you are using your desktop PC and next to that is sitting your Laptop. When you move to the screen corner, the mouse goes to the Laptop screen. That way you can use one mouse
 on multiple computers.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Rollback option will be only available when you've previously updated the driver. If you want to upgrade the driver to latest version, hit 'Update driver' button.
<br />
<br />Regards.

            Hi SMA.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The driver is not in error so it could be any number of other causes we see here, too.  
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Camera app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Camera &gt; Advanced Options.  
<br />
<br />Did you enable the Privacy setting to allow apps to use your webcam?  
<br /><a href="https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disable-camera-or-webcam-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disabl...</a>
<br /><a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-camera-and-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Hardware &amp; Devices troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the webcam driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  
<br />
<br />Also compare all other drivers including Chipset, display, sound, etc to make sure you have the latest on the PC maker's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Webcam device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br /> 
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows 10 Pro Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobselff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Update</h2>
                    <p>I know this has been a subject the has bothered many, even with all the posts and supposed solutions out there. Here is my question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the MS Trouble Shooter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't MS create an&nbsp;exe that would reset everything back to where it belongs from the install. I know it would have to reset all the GP policies back to default, but let the people know this in advance (Pop-up Info Box) and that should correct all the
 issues people are having with the update issues.</p>
<p>Even with all the info: DISM, SFC, Stopping Anti-Virus, ect. the update still fails for me. The error codes and update date show are not correct, so I have to manually download and install via the Microsoft Catalog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Bob</p>

            Hi Bob
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Because there are over 1.5 billion Windows devices, its difficult for engineers to make a one stop solution, since what works for one configuration, might not work for another.
<br />
<br />Could you specifically describe the problem you are experiencing with your Windows 10 Pro installation?       
        </p>

<p>Good Morning Andre,</p>
<p>I have 2 PC's both running Win 10 Pro Build 17763.348, on a Dell 8900 and the other is a built unit with a Intel D975xbx with an Intel processor (which is the one with the update issue. The software is identical, and both or running Bitdefender Internet
 Security 2018.</p>
<p>The built unit always&nbsp;gives me some error today it is 0x8024a21e&nbsp;, and yesterday, I ran DISM and SFC which all reported okay, not issues repaired. I made certain none of the group policies were changed, put back to default, I shut down Bitdefender and still
 have the issues. I have tried many of the solutions posted but none have worked and others appear to say the same thing. I do agree there are many installations, but MS knows their software and should be able to create a program to set all issues relating
 to updating to where they need to be for correct downloads.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Bob</p>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p>I am not in the mood to reinstall the entire system just to get it to update, I would rather just do manual updates through the catalog when I get them on the Dell unit.</p>

<p>You can already do that, and it's not hard either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you want to send your computer back to the way it was when it left the factory ... the way it was when you pressed the power button for the first time? That's called a
<em>factory reset</em>, and the procedure is described in great detail on the computer manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you want to send your computer back in time to <em>exactly</em> the way it used to be at any given moment in time? You can do that too if you have image backup software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An&nbsp;<em>image</em> is an exact copy of a hard drive. Image backup software can make an image of your hard drive any time you want, even automatically on a schedule, which is how I do it. When you restore an image, your computer goes back in time to exactly
 the way it was when you made the image. Doesn't take long either, just a few minutes. Everybody can do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give just one example: After I installed Windows 10 on my computer for the first time, I made an image of my hard drive. Now I'll never have to install Windows again.</p>

<br />See if these steps help:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed. 
<br />

            To attach an image to an&nbsp;email you would usually want to save it as a small JPEG.<br />
<br />
You need a graphics program which can open the type of image you have and can then reduce its size while or before saving it as a JPEG.<br />
<br />
Paint.NET&nbsp;<a href="http://www.getpaint.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.getpaint.net/</a> is&nbsp;a starting point.

            In additon to <em>DominicP's</em> comments...<br />
<br />
Another way, which is native to Windows,&nbsp;is to right click on the picture you want to send via email and select
<strong>Send &gt; Send to &gt; Mail recipient</strong> and select a size. See the screen shot...<br />
<br />
<a href="http://cid-25ab668da65c8fbe.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Windows images/SendTo.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cid-25ab668da65c8fbe.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Windows%20images/SendTo.png</a><br />
<br />
To select mulitple pictures press and hold the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key and hover over each picture until its highlighted. Next right click and select
<strong>Send &gt; Send to &gt; Mail recipient</strong> and select a size.<br />
<br />
Another option is to use a Photo editor like <a href="http://download.live.com/photogallery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Live Photo Gallery</a>&nbsp;to select and resize one picture or multiple pictures.&nbsp;Select the picture&nbsp;then right click&nbsp;and select
<strong>Resize</strong>.<br />
<br />
I tend to use <strong>Microsoft Office Picture Manager</strong> a lot to do that for individual pictures, ie. resize, crop, etc...etc. That comes with Microsoft Office if you happen to be running that.<br />

                    <p>hello, early thus morning I received a 14 day communication suspension for profanity. The person who reported me was harassing me and my friend playing GTA5 and using profanity at us in chat. Once we left the game he continued to message me and out of frustration I replied with some mean words however in the message I sent back I censored the profanity myself yet I still got banned. I submitted a review request and it came back the same. I have read all the terms of use and guidelines and though is does mention the use of profanity there was no actual profanity in my message because I censored it. In the guidelines it does not say I can't censor my own message and it still be a violation. If that is the case I would greatly appreciate the decision being overturned on the basis that the guidelines were not clear in this area and it will not happen again.</p>

    <title>Password box not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> italianamerikan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Password box not working</h2>
                    <p>My computer recently gave me the "blue screen of death" and restarted itself. After the restart, I tried to log into my computer, but the password box wouldn't work. I clicked on it and typed, but nothing showed up in the box.</p>
<p>I restarted my computer again, and then it let me log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened every time my computer went to sleep and logged me out since the blue screen. I've had to restart my computer every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>***Post moved by the moderator to the appropriate forum category.***</span></em><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:&nbsp;</strong>I changed my settings to not make me log in every time I open my computer. The password box isn't the real problem. The keyboard doesn't work at all after my computer sleeps.<br />

<span>The corrupted user profile does not function normally such as not launching Start menu, Cortana, Search bar, Store and other Windows applications. In such cases creating a new profile and checking for the same will help in identifying if the
 issue is specific to a corrupted user profile.</span></p>

<p>The original issue has resolved itself after my computer prompted me to "restart and update."</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the side account, it still has those problems, but no one else uses my computer anyway, so it's not a real issue for me.</p>

<h2>            how do I activate when activation wizard does not launch&#63;</h2>
                    When replacing my dead motherboard, my copy of Windows XP 64 bit would not boot, so ran a repair install. After the repair was finished, Windows prompted that there were significant changes to my system (correctly, as I was unable to get the same system
 board) and would&nbsp;I like to activate Windows? After responding Yes, Windows fails to load the activation wizard. Nothing happens. After a couple of reboots, Windows now no longer gives me the "3 days to activate" message. It goes straight to the activation
 prompt, but loads only my desktop background, and I can do nothing, including even shutting down Windows.&nbsp;How do I force the system to launch the Activation wizard?

<p>
I have had so many failed update attempts on all 5 of our laptops including my personal laptop. &nbsp;I called customer service yesterday and was hung up on. Called back today and was told they could not help me. This update makes my computer inoperable for 6-8
 hours then states failed and another hour to revert back. &nbsp;Is Microsoft gonna pay for my wages as I can't get any work done. &nbsp;CLEARLY this is NOT an issue with the computer itself but an issue with THEIR update MICROSOFT HAS PUT OUT.. WTH!!!&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I am having issues with various programs such as Google Chrome, AMD Catalyst Control Center, Internet Download Manager, and even Windows Explorer just to list a few. The issue I am having is that drop down menus, file name box in Windows Explorer
 and even the address bar in Chrome are all blacked out, such in a way that I can only see text if I can highlight it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made sure that high contrast settings are turned off and that I am not running and visibility extensions in Chrome.</p>

<h2>            Solved&#58; Internal SD card not working after clean install of Windows 10 64bit</h2>
                    <p>The reader worked in all previous versions of windows 32 bit (XP, 8 and10), by upgrading from one to another. Tha card reader worked fine in all, including in upgraded Win10 32 bit. I needed 64 bit, so I erase everything and have clean installation of W10
 64 bit. After a while, when I needed to read my SD card taken from my Canon Camera, after putting in SD slot, it didn't react.</p>
<p>I have Toshiba Satelite A100-TA7 laptop. I search the Toshiba site for drivers, they are not on site nor on original CD (There is no original specific driver for card reader - not for original XP nor for another OS).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I search internet for solutions, nothing help.</p>
<p>I do not know what chip is for my internal SD card, so I tried to install Realtek, it was installed ok, but nothing changed.</p>
<p>Usually, when insert a card, win make a beep and ask what to do or show new letter drive. Now, nothing is happen.</p>
<p>In device manager, I have Mass Storage Controller in yellow, try to disable/enable, uninstall/scan for hardware changes, nothing work. Driver update do not find good driver on internet, nor on my computer, even if tried with realtek drivers (from internet)
 or Toshiba card driver found on Toshiba site for another model of laptop.</p>
<p>Strange is that I have Mass storage controller, and in the same time, I have SDA Standard compliant SD Controller. Is this normal? I already tried to disable one and let the other one, hoping that I may resolve their conflict. Think of conflict, because
 both has the same Hardware IDS:&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Problems redeeming FAR CRY 4 Limited Edition DLC code - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jdelavara  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems redeeming FAR CRY 4 Limited Edition DLC code</h2>
                    
<p>I bought this game last week and after unsealing it and trying to insert the DLC code I get the system message that it is a wrong code or has already been used.</p>
<p>I have contacted Ubisoft twice and they told me that they can not solve the problem and it is Microsoft who creates these 25 digits codes and who has to give me a new one. I have contacted Microsoft too (by chat) and they have told me that Ubisoft it's an
 external developer and they can not do anything or give me another code.</p>
<p>My question is: I bought a game and paid for a content I can not access. Who is the responsible for solving my problem? I bought the game in Carrefour, and I visited them. They changed the game for another one and trying to redeem this second I get the same
 error code. I've read&nbsp;the paper where the code comes and nowhere appears expiration date: indicates that the validity is one year after purchase, and I bought last week...</p>
<p>As a customer, I demand a little attention and a sensible solution.&nbsp;Too much hassle and waste of time and movement to try to solve a very simple problem</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<h3> roken1  say:</h3>
<h2>            MTP USB Device </h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have recently tried to connect my Canon 50D Digital camera to my Windows 7 Professional 64Bit machine, but for it just can't recognize the camera. I've looked at my Devices and Printers folder and found the camera simply labeled as "Canon Digital Camera",
 and it is missing a driver. I dug deeper and found that while installing the driver windows had encountered a strange problem of "System cannot find the file specified" for the MTP USB Device. It appears that the MTP driver seems to be missing on my computer!
 Anyone have a way to solve this problem? I've seen some of the other threads talking about getting the MTP kits, and I have tried that with no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also suspect it might be a registry error, but I do not have the expertise to locate the right registry key or know how I'd go about fixing this issue. Much thanks for anyone willing to input on this issue!</p>

<p>Hello Sascha</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-power-supply-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reset power supply</a> it leave it unplugged for a while and then plug back in. Make sure it is in well ventilated area not under anything. Make sure it plugged directly into the wall not ext. cord or power strip. If still getting the issue you could always
 replace it if it bothersome. The Power supply should not be making any noise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps let us know.</p>

<p>Leider hat diese auch nicht zum gewünschten Erfolg geführt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Sobald das Netzteil am Strom angeschlossen ist macht es Geräusche, wenn die Xbox one noch dabei an ist, wird es sehr sehr laut.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Das Netzteil liegt auch komplett auf, so das der Lüfter sich gut drehen kann.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Sacha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/about-power-supply" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">About the Xbox One power supply</a></strong> article, it is explained that the noise of the fan within the power supply gets
 louder as it heats up, and in this case the power supply might be overheating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try a different outlet, to see if a different energy source produces the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this does not cure the noise, the power supply may need to be replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this out for us and let us know if this works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

<h2>            External WD Hard drive not recognizing after sleep mode.</h2>
                    I have a 1tb wd external hd which has worked with Vista sp2 and will recognize upon boot-up, but once the computer goes to sleep mode and comes out of it the drive is gone and won't come back until a fresh reboot. I have the drivers for the drive, I've
 also called wd and they said to run their diagnostic tool which stated nothing to be wrong with the drive which lead me to here.

            I have this connected via SATA, I've done a fresh install and went through the hoops all over again to get it working yet it still won't recognize after it comes out of sleep mode. I've forgot to mention that I have tried the suggested solutions. To be
 more concise It's a WD MyBook 1tb on a dell inspirion 530S connected via SATA to SATA /eSATA.<br />

The plug/unplug thing works but it's discussing, specially when you pay extra to have a 'good' brand like this one.<br />

            <p>Hi Rajith,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried all of suggestions listed in the link. I ended up search the registry for the applications that have been causing the issues and slowly removing all references to the older versions. So far this is working. Very time consuming but better than
 a rebuild!</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi Rajith,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have found the following registry path is the issue:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModel\Repository\Families</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are a number of the applications that are failing to launch after the update or new version installing from the store.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The previous versions in this intstance ZuneVideo, I have to go and edit the permissions on the registry to have myself as the owner and full access. I can then delete the old versions and the applications begin working.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once I have deleted the older versions from this location the applications work as expected.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any assistance in understanding why the updates are not cleaning the registry correctly would be much appreciated.</p>
<p><br />

            This solution worked for me when I got this error trying to start any of the communication apps on Windows 8.1 update 1. They all suddenly stopped working and would just collapse to the task bar. After deleting all but the highest version number, it worked
 fine. I too had to make myself owner and take full control to be able to delete those folders in the registry. Thanks!

            <p>This is fantastic, it worked for me as well. </p>
<p>I was also getting the same error when launching an app. so, I just uninstalled it and went to the registry path as mentioned above.
</p>
<p>I tried to delete that first, but it didn't work. then taking ownership and giving myself full control, enabled me to delete the key.
</p>
<p>next time, when I installed the same app again, it worked fine. </p>

<h2>            Excel crashes when entering data.</h2>
                    I recently started having trouble with excel 2003 on Windows 10. The spreadsheet would crash when entering data, copying and pasting, etc. I tried fixes offered to other users experiencing this problem, but none were effective. I noticed that the problem
 started after the last Windows 10 update to version 1803. I reverted to the prior version, and excel is now working fine again.

            I'm not a computer expert, just reporting the issue. You could try uninstalling the 1803 update on the machine that has the issue and see if it is resolved. My computer and excel is working fine with the prior version. When you consider that Microsoft
 tries to make all these legacy programs like Office 2003 (15 years old) work with their latest version of Windows 10, some glitches are bound to occur. It may get fixed in a later update.&nbsp;

<p>The next time the update installs go to Apps and Features and find your version of MS Office in the list of installed programs, select it and then select Modify. Run the Repair routine and then try Excel again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For information Office 2003 is not supported in Windows 10 but it often works without a problem, as it does in my Insider Preview build. As you have found that is not always the case.</p>

<p>Thank you for your precious time... but I already did the repair routine but no help. So I reverted everything with Macrium, and now edited group policy and in services.msc I stopped Microsoft Update forever. I just need this system, nothing new fancy. I
 am an oldschool guy not interested in updates, as those usually made things worse for me, just like now.</p>

<p>OK. The response wasn't specifically aimed at you but anyone here using Office 2003. I'm not sure you are able to put off updates in Windows 10 even using group policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to not receiving updates then this means you may not get security updates, (and fixes) which will leave you open to security issues and eventually you will lose support for your build of Windows 10. After that support will expire. The early builds
 of Windows 10 have already lost support.</p>

<p>I had the exact same problem after Windows Update installed KB4284835- the 2018-06 Cumulative Update for Win 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solution was to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open an existing spreadsheet.</p>
<p>2. Change the cell justification from left to right, or right to left.</p>
<p>3. Save the spreadsheet and close it.</p>
<p>4. Reopen the spreadsheet and change the cell justification back.</p>

            My HP just had a BIOS update.&nbsp; Not sure if that is causing the update not to work.&nbsp; The update gets to 100 complete then reverts back.&nbsp; The error is stating the Defender is not allowing an update to a file. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Since that is not a Rewards program issue, Rewards support will not be able to assist. The Microsoft point system ended in 2013 so at this point the cards have most likely expired.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the problem description, I understand that on startup it says windows 8 has been removed/cannot be found and receives an error code 0xc000014c.</p>
<p><span>This error occurs if the operating system is corrupt and needs to be repaired, this cannot be done without the recovery disk.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to contact the computer manufacturer to get the recovery disk and then you may try the steps in the following Microsoft Help article to refresh your computer without affecting your files. Refreshing your PC reinstalls Windows and keeps
 your personal files and settings. It also keeps the apps that came with your PC and the apps you installed from the Windows Store.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the following Microsoft Help article to refresh your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Apps you installed from websites and DVDs will be removed. Apps that came with your PC and apps you installed from the Windows Store will be reinstalled. Windows puts a list of removed apps on your desktop after refreshing
 your PC. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>
