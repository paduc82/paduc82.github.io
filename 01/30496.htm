    <title>Windows Product key activation message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gfxperson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Product key activation message</h2>
                    <p>As I resumed my laptop from hybernate mode, I got a message saying that my Windows product key is not valid, please enter a key and activate it. My Windows 8.1 came with my HP laptop and I have never reloaded Windows, this is an OEM copy. I got the Windows
 product activation window in PC settings up on the screen. I did nothing but went back to my desktop to check on the web what is going on. After about half an hour or so as I went back to the PC settings window, it said your Windows has been successfully activated
 without me doing anything. What just happened here? Is this a virus or someone else using my key?</p>
<p>Next I noticed that on the bottom right corner of my desktop there was the watermark saying</p>
<p>Windows 8.1</p>
<p>Build 9600</p>
<p>I never had the watermark displayed on my desktop before, so I don't know why this just suddenly appeared? Then after sometime, the watermark also mysteriously disappeared. What is going on here? How can the watermark appear and disappear by itself. I ran
 a virus scan on my pc and it found nothing.</p>
<p>I will really appreciate someone helping me out here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

</p><p>My best guess would be that your machine was having difficulty checking in with the Microsoft Activation server... Either due to your internet connection, or a problem with their server...</p>

            Thanks for the reply. I understand that it might be MSFT trying to authenticate the Product ID. Any idea why the Windows Build No was visible as the watermark and then disappeared by itself.

<p>

<p>That is how it verifies your key and product id.</p>

            <p>I had this same thing happening on my pc after an incorrect flash of the bios.</p>
<p>After getting the motherboard back and setting things up again started to run into issues.</p>
<p>Even though the settings where the exact same before booting after the mainboard fix.</p>
<p>My issue occurred on the first attempt to run call of duty ghosts, with a complete pc hang, forced reboot.</p>
<p>Next time running the game it crashed to the desktop with the usual software crash report.</p>
<p>Last time tried to run it and the pc did an automatic reboot.</p>
<p>That is when the pc started to not shut down all the way with no desktop </p>
<p>but the pc still running.</p>
<p>The errors in event viewer stated there was a kernel power issue about the cpu changing the memory sleep state of processor and that wake from sleep may be degraded.</p>
<p>I set all my pcs the same as far as power settings and only on this one with one with a 3tb boot drive and uefi bios do I have an issue.</p>
<p>None of my steam games are installed to the boot drive.</p>
<p>After installing hard disk sentinel on this pc, it reported the boot drive is continuously disconnecting ( going up on each boot or shut down) from the host and this happens no matter what sata port the drive is on or what driver is being used.</p>
<p>So I ran a version of linux to try and find the issue.</p>
<p>The drive was locked out with an error that it was in hibernation state and could not be mounted in full access.</p>
<p>Now the drive is becoming more unstable on every use even though it loads windows, reported as 75% healthy on a four month old drive.</p>
<p>Hibernation and fast boot are turned off as well as driver updates from microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I can gather this can be a few things that degrade the system, any slight user changes in bios, adding or removing hardware drivers, windows updates, windows attempting to change the way the hardware works, not loading correct or older drivers,
 overriding a user's settings, win10 can't work within itself.</p>

            <p>I installed and re-installed windows 10 seven times</p>
<p>it was running fine for few days </p>
<p>then it begin to degraded at any levelz </p>
<p>especially in gaming performance</p>
<p>plus moving around the desktop and clicking on things </p>
<p>it become slow and &nbsp;unresponsive some times I have to click on a folder or whateva I want to go</p>
<p>4 or 6 times to make it work.</p>
<p>I open Edge and 5 seconds later I have a message that EDGE is not responding</p>
<p>so I try Opera browser to make sure my Internet connection was ok</p>
<p>and I have no problem to surfing on the Internet at all&nbsp;</p>
<p>then I re-install windows 7 and I was shocking to how fast my computer was running</p>
<p>only then I really realize how bad and bugged windows 10 it is..!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>my computer was running WinVista,WinXP,then Windows 7 without any issues</p>
<p>windows 10 is soo bugged than I can't believe is coming from </p>
<p>the same company who produce all the previous Windows versions </p>
<p>I didn't try Windows 8.1 and I never will but Windows 10 </p>
<p>according to those who are running Windows 8.1 </p>
<p>is not a upgrade for them but is a downgrade&nbsp;</p>
<p>if Windows `10 stay in the way like it is</p>
<p>then is going to be the bigger failure in Microsoft History</p>
<p>you just wait few years then we can get some worldwide statistic</p>
<p>as now in 2015 windows 10 can't even match the % of Windows Xp Users</p>
<p>and I doubt that a bugged new OS like Windows 10 will fully replace Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/365d96d7-5c03-4b36-81ed-fde6296f4eb6" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>you want my advice?</p>
<p>forget that windows 10 even exist&nbsp;</p>
<p>just roll back to your previous OS</p>
<p>and stop to listen to Microsoft who try to brainwash the general public</p>
<p>by saying that windows 10 is better because is all BS..!!</p>
<p>oh PS Microsoft will try to blame your computer for their own failure</p>
<p>but don't fall on that either because there are people in this community</p>
<p>who buy a new computer for then run to the repair shop</p>
<p>and spend more money to fixed what Windows 10 break</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I don't hate Microsoft&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I do really want make Windows 10 work</p>
<p>but windows 10 is a product was made from incompetent people</p>
<p>and Microsoft Community is full of the consequences of those people incompetence&nbsp;</p>

<p>when the people realize how bad windows 10 it is</p>
<p>then they need to figure it out what are the alternative to windows 10</p>
<p>some will go with Linux and some will go back in windows 8.1 or windows 7</p>
<p>I do believe many of us already did that BUT LET'S WAIT 2 YEARS FROM NOW</p>
<p>if windows 10 can get around 10% or max 20% of market share by 2017</p>
<p>it will be a big surprise ..!!!</p>

            Other than the obvious? Nope. Can't think of anything. Sorry. What you are observing is a real occurance that has been observed over the last year. Some machines run fine with 10, many do not. Just read the rest of this forum for examples.<br />
<br />
You are doing better than me tho. Mine degraded to the point of randomly restarting every 3-5 minutes for no reason. Every single time without fail. I'm just waiting til I get so bored that I can be bothered turning it on again to reinstall for about the 5th
 time. Maybe next week. Or month.

            <p>I think the mandatory windows updates combine with the new OS instability is the reason to why</p>
<p>your or our windows 10 experience can drastically change</p>
<p>everything you need is an update than was bad coding </p>
<p>and you will have a system degradation or worst like a blue screen</p>
<p>I was reading a blog that try to explain why windows 10 is the last OS Microsoft will produce&nbsp;</p>
<p>basically windows 10 will constantly evolved and you will &nbsp;get daily updates&nbsp;</p>
<p>so your OS can change in better or worst all depend on the quality of the updates &nbsp; .!</p>
<p>
</p><p>final considerations;</p>
<p>with idea like than errors are inevitable&nbsp;</p>
<p>and lost of data are already part of your future..!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>so backup backup backup at least in 3 different locations</p>
<p>because windows `10 users are going to need that</p>
<p>and a lot especially every times they download and install new windows updates ....!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS if you can't handle all that</p>
<p>you still have the option to roll back to your previous OS like I did</p>
<p>and watch the windows 10 users spend must of their time to fix things than doesn't work</p>
<p>I let them to be the Microsoft guinea pigs to troubleshooting the mess windows 10 is causing right now</p>
<p>and maybe 1 or 2 years from now when Windows 10 is more stable and better&nbsp;</p>
<p>I may considering to try again but since then I just sit right here </p>
<p>and watch the mess windows 10 is doing!!! </p>
<p>to be honest is funny to watch especially if you consider </p>
<p>that all this mess is coming from a company </p>
<p>who suppose to have ton of experience in developing new operation system&nbsp;</p>
<p>probably a bunch of college students could have done a better job:-))))))))))))</p>

<h2>            Weak Signal</h2>
                    <p>I have not been able to call my brother and video chat with him since getting my new iMac November of 2018. &nbsp;I finally gave up several months ago, but decided to give it another shot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that a test shows a constantly weak signal. &nbsp;When he tries to call me or I him the call rings and then drops. Keep in mind until I upgraded Skype I had no problems. &nbsp;My wireless network is just fine and actually sits next to my computer so
 that is not an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My brother is in Madison, WI and is the only family I have left. &nbsp;We would really like to be able to see each other when we talk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me try to figure this out.</p>

            Hi there,
<br />
<br />To isolate the issue, we must know whether this happens across different devices using this Skype Account. Have you used this Skype Account on a different device with the same results?

            I'd first try updating your network drivers, and then by doing a speed test:-
<br />
<br />Updating Drivers 
<br />1. Search "Device Manager" in the search box, near the Windows Start Button, and select it. 
<br />2. Locate your Network Adapters, right click and select "Update Drivers". 
<br />3. Restart your PC. 
<br />
<br />Then if you could kindly perform a speed test:-

<br />Let me know how it goes!

<br />
<br />1. Click on the Apple in the upper left corner of the screen
<br />2. Select 'Software Update'

            It really does sound like a connection issue, on one of the ends. Could you please provide your connection speed results from:-
<br /><a href="http://www.speedtest.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.speedtest.net/</a>
<br />
<br />I would also reccommend that you try to kill all other instances of Skype before opening it again, for which a guide can be found here:-
<br /><a href="http://osxdaily.com/2012/03/02/force-quit-mac-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://osxdaily.com/2012/03/02/force-quit-mac-a...</a>
<br />
<br />I would also reccommend that you invest in an ethernet cable if you are using a router, as it provides a much more stable connection. I would urge you to notify your internet provider if after trying the above, you are still experiencing issues.

    <title>kindle fire problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ddenysee  say:</h3>
<h2>            kindle fire problem</h2>
                    Hey guys,<br />
my kindle fire has started to switch off by itself at like 50% but it's becoming worse and worse. It started turning of a 80% and today at 91%. I tried researching what this might be but no one has the question I have.&nbsp; My dad said it might be a battery problem-
 the more you charge it, the less the battery life you would have; so if you charge it everyday like my dad does, by the time he gets to work the battery is already dead, so he had to replace it, and he only works 40 minutes away! I was wondering if my kindle
 had a battery problem or a virus which makes it switch off and not turn on again even when the battery is full. When it does this I have to charge it until it reaches100%. If I take it off the minute it turns on, my kindle will repeat the process.
<u><i><b>Im sorry if it is hard to answer this question- since it has nothing to with Microsoft :</b></i></u>3 Plz help,<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<h2>            How do i stop automatic installation of keyboard driver&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Windows 7 keeps detecting two keyboards, even though I only have one PS/2 keyboard plugged in, and installs an HID keyboard device along with a standard ps/2 keyboard in device manager. this causes my characters to double from time to time and I have confirmed
 that if I uninstall the HID keyboard device it fixes the problem temporarily, but it keeps getting reinstalled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I stop the reinstallation of the HID keyboard device?</p>

<p><span>Hi aasmgoon,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To disable Windows 7’s ability to automatically detect and install drivers, here’s a step that may help.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to S<strong>tart</strong> &gt;
<strong>Control Panel.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type
<strong>Change device installation settings.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on the link
<strong>Change device installation settings</strong> under Devices and Printers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under
<strong>“Do you want Windows to download driver software and realistic icons for your devices?”,</strong> click on “<strong>No, let me choose what to do”.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><strong><span>Select “Never install driver from Windows Update”.</span></strong><span>
 The system will always ask you to provide the device driver.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Save the changes.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Via Group Policy editor.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> Group policy editor is available only in Professional, Ultimate and Enterprise edition of Windows 7. You will not have the
 Local Group Policy Editor available in the Windows 7 Starter and Home Premium editions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also note that you should have administrative privileges to perform these tasks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to
<strong>Start</strong> and then in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, type mmc gpedit.msc.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the navigation pane, open the following folders:
<strong>Local Computer Policy</strong>, <strong>Computer Configuration</strong>, <strong>
Administrative Templates</strong>, <strong>System</strong>, <strong>Driver Installation</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Double-click
<strong>Turn Off Windows Update Device Driver Search Prompt </strong>in the right side of the window.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to the
<strong>Setting </strong>tab of the dialog box. </span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the
<strong>Enable </strong>radio button.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Apply </strong>and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Close Local Group Policy Editor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cannot add an existing account on xbox one - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zer0flame85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot add an existing account on xbox one</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm currently having a very odd issue. I&nbsp;am trying to add an existing xbox account onto my xbox one. from everything i've seen from Microsoft support and google, i'm meant to go to guide, hit add new account, and put in the email and password for the account to sign in. This is however, not what's happening. When i hit add new account I put in the email of the account, and instead of asking me for the password like it's supposed to, it is instead going though the process to create a new account entirely. I made sure i did not select the option to do that, as support's page on the subject was very specific about, but it seems to only want to create a new account anyway. As far as i am aware, everything is up to date software wise, i'm not sure what would be causing this issue. Any help on solving this would be appreciated.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

If the system recognizes the e-mail address it will prompt for password automatically.&nbsp; Something is off here.<br /></p><p>Double check the e-mail address for the account.&nbsp; Make sure there are no mistakes/typos. (also that it's the right site, i.e. @gmail.com , @live.com, etc...)</p><p>You can always go to account.xbox.com and try logging in there FIRST, to verify the account info, then try again on the console.</p><p><br /></p><p>Let me know if you run into problems!&nbsp; You can always tweet me @Xbox_NNigel for quick help</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks for stopping in!</p>

Any ideas?&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The error is below</p><p><br /></p><i>Runtime Error</i>

<p><b>Description:&nbsp;</b>An application error occurred on the server. The current custom error settings for this application prevent the details of the application error from being viewed remotely (for security reasons). It could, however, be viewed by browsers running on the local server machine.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Details:</b>&nbsp;To enable the details of this specific error message to be viewable on remote machines, please create a &lt;customErrors&gt; tag within a "web.config" configuration file located in the root directory of the current web application. This &lt;customErrors&gt; tag should then have its "mode" attribute set to "Off".</p>

<p>There are various ways to resolve and escalate this issue, e.g. like so:</p>
<p>1. Find out who might be the gremlin in your house, and what password they set.</p>
<p>2. Log on under your alternative account, e.g. Administrator, then reset the password for your normal account. If you do not have an alternative account then this is a good time to review the benefits of creating one.</p>
<p>3. Use your password key disk. If you never created one then this is etc. etc.</p>
<p>4. Use your Windows 7 Repair CD or your Windows 7 installation DVD to boot into Repair Mode, then use System Restore to set Windows back by a day or two. If you do not have either of these disks then this is etc. etc.</p>
<p>These little problems are easily resolved with a little bit of contingency planning. There are more powerful methods to get back in again but they get progressively more involved.</p>

<h2>            Reinstalling Windows after using Linux</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dban my SSD and installed Debian Linux after using Windows for years. I had Windows 10 but forgot to write down the key from the free upgrade a year back. I want to install Windows 10 back (with a dual boot) so I can use both Linux and Windows. I heard
 the licence key installed on the mobo but I'm not 100% sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>When dual booting Windows and Linux, Windows must be installed first. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
It appears that you are unable to install tell me more application in your computer.<br />
<b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span></b><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As per the error, </span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Assembly binding logging is turned OFF we need to enable it, let's go to Method 1.<br />
<br />
</span></span>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1:</span></b><br />
</p>
<b><span>Registry Disclaimer: </span></b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that
 you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. Refer to these suggestions to backup the registry.</span>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Press Windows key+R, type “regedit”, hit Enter</span></strong></p>

<span>File name</span> box.</span></p>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></b><span>Click
<span>Save</span>.</span></p>
<br />
After you save the backup of the registry, browse through the registry and set the registry value [HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Fusion!EnableLog] (DWORD) to 1.<br />
<br />
Now try to install the application and check.<br />
<br />
<p>If the problem is not resolved, continue to Method 2.<br />
</p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Delete temporary files.</span></b></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Press <b>Windows key+R</b>, type <b>“%temp%”</b> (without quotes), it will open the temporary files folder, now select all the files by pressing
<b>Ctrl +A </b>keys, then press <b>Delete</b> key in the keyboard. Close <b>Temp</b> Folder.</span></p>

<div>Are you following the Netgear instructions to the letter?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ol>
<li>
<div>If you are upgrading from an earlier version:</div>
</li></ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>
<div>First select Uninstall to remove the earlier version.</div>
</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Shut down your computer, unplug the power cord, and open the computer case.
<br />
Contrary to popular wisdom, it is easy to damage exposed electrical circuits in ways that are not obvious. Ground yourself against electrical shock (for example by touching the metal frame inside the computer).</div>
</li><li>
<div>Unscrew the adapter mounting to the computer, and physically remove it, taking care to touch the silver mount, and not any of the circuits.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Replace the computer case. Plug in your computer and power it on.</div>
</li><li>
<div>After uninstalling, You need to relaunch the setup program once again to install the new version.</div>
</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Select the your Country Domain, click <strong>Next</strong>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Click <strong>OK</strong> at the Country Domain Selection warning.</div>

<h3> graphic dude  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error loading Photoviewer .dll system cannot find text for message number 0x&#37;1 in the message file for &#37;2</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Error loading C:\Program Files (X86)\..etc..\Photoviewer.dll</p>
<p>The system cannot find message text for message number 0x%1 in the message file for %2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's the error I get when trying to view any image of any file type in windows Photo Viewer in Vista 64.</p>
<p>I've run system scans, which always show up errors, always claims to have fixed them, always then closes down looking like it's configuring updates, always everything is successfull, and always in reality, nothing is fixed. Hurray.</p>
<p>Yes I could system restore, but then I'd lose loads of progams and functionality I actually WANT, yes I could uninstall all Vista's updates, but there are Hundreds of the bug-rs, I don't want to have to trawl through hundreds of official Microsoft updates
 to find which one screwed up my computer, and neither does anyone else!</p>
<p>If anyone knows which "update" is basically the virus-like cause, please let me know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Defender now only starts when User Account Control is turned on (congrats to whichever genius came up with that idea,) otherwise I get more errors.</p>
<p>Both these programs were working fine before I was forced to remove Vista SP3 beta, and had to install a billion individual updates to compensate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated<br />
Thanks</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Graphic Dude,</span></span></p>
<p><span>• Does this happen when you try to view pictures as a slide show?</span></p>
<p><span><span>Since you have tried a System scan, you may try to
<strong>rebuild the Windows Photo gallery</strong> and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1: Rebuild the Windows Photo Gallery</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click
<strong>Start,</strong> select <strong>Control Panel</strong> and go to <strong>Folder Options</strong>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click the Folder Options program and Select the
<strong>View tab</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. In the
<strong>Advanced Settings window</strong>, underneath <strong>Hidden files and folders</strong>, select
<strong>Show hidden files and folders</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Click
<strong>OK</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Navigate to the following folder ( %user% is the name of the account having the problem)</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Photo Gallery</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>6. Copy any files in here to another location as
<strong>a back up and then delete them from the Windows Photo Gallery directory</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. Once the files are deleted, try to
<strong>start Windows Photo Gallery.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> You may also temporarily
<strong>disable the third party security software and firewall </strong>and check if the error occurs.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> In order to prevent virus attack during this process, please first run a complete
 virus check and disconnect from the network before you disable the anti-virus. If the problem persists after you remove the programs, please enable them to keep the system integrity.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is useful.</span></p>

<p>Hi Praseetha,</p>
<p>Thank you for your suggestions, unfortunately I was asking about PhotoVIEWER, not PhotoGALLERY.</p>
<p>I did try your suggestion anyway, just in case, but with the same error message.<br />
I have also since tried restoring the system, unistalling updates and even installing the "Live" version of PhotoGallery just in the hope the files might sort out the PhotoViewer errors.<br />
All so far to no avail.</p>
<p>No 3rd party software is responsible, and I have double checked my firewall and anti-virus softwares.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>

<p><span><span>• Who is the manufacturer of the Photo viewer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• Did Vista 64bit came pre-installed on the system?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• Were you able to use the Photo viewer before on Windows Vista 64bit without any issues?</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> You may
<strong>check the compatibility of Photo viewer on Windows Vista 64bit edition</strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer the following link to check the program compatibility with Windows Vista:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> You may also try to
<strong>reregister the photoviewer.dll files</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click Start.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Type in regsvr32
<strong>"C:\Program Files\---(</strong>enter the exact program name<strong>)\PhotoViewer.dll</strong>" in start search and then press
<strong>Enter.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. You should get a successful prompt.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Try opening the program again.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is useful.</span></p>

    <title>Update &#38; Security Not Working Responding - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Update &#38; Security Not Working Responding</h2>
                    There is no moment in updates &amp; Security settings in Windows 10. Once we reach the display nothing happens no click works and the other options are not displayed properly. Nothing comes into display and the updates &amp; Security port seems to be not working
 at all. It doesnot navigate to other options also. It looks blunt with no change in windows display.

            <p>Hi Robear Dyer (PA Bear),</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made&nbsp;a PC reset. Presently everything is working fine. The right Click issue. One Drive login &amp; Windows Update &amp; Security are working fine. The WiFi issue I described below is still not stable. And I had the following previous installations. AllDup
 3.4.241, Google Chrome &amp; Canary, Google Drive Sync, McAfee Live Safe - Internet Security, Skype Click to call, Skype Web Plugin, SkypeTm 7 8, Team Viewer 11, VLC Media Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am scared to install any third party apps. As it is creating nuisance in the PC operation. Few below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The right click goes bizzare and keeps on rotating when I work on explorer, Chrome &amp; Chrome Canary takes 10 minutes&nbsp;to opening or uncalculated time. They don't open immediately. The inbuilt WiFi switches off suddenly and I am not able to switch to hotspot
 connections as there is no internet from main network. The WiFi itself switches off. It doesn't show any device within reach.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All above can be managed but the high troublesome is the right click not at all working. The menu just doesn't popup after any amount of time. It keeps on rotating blue one around the ring. Screen goes blank &amp; wont allow me to work on any file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please find below the replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a) This no upgrade. This is brand new Laptop PC purchased on 21st January 2016 recently only</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b),&nbsp;2 &amp; 3)&nbsp;This came with windows 10 &amp; other drivers. So this is not a upgrade. No Not upgraded from Win7SP1 or a win 8.1. The laptop came with Windows 10 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp;McAfee&nbsp;by February 20 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Don't know. Don't remember anything installed. Firewall may be McAfee only using</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. McAfee is installed with computer and about to expire. After expiration date will try to install Webroot Secure Anywhere to the PC as I received with the Laptop purchase as antivirus software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) Yes, McAfee free trial came preinstalled and is about to expire on Feb 20, 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8a &amp; 8b). KB3124262 is installed in update history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9) I have version 20,0,0272 installed on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10) I installed Google Chrome version before going for PC reset. I made a PC reset and not planning to install to Google Chrome or Chrome Canary as both are taking around 10 minutes to load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>11) No, I haven't done anything before resetting, I don't have those installed on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks &amp; Regards</p>

<p><strong>I installed Windows 7 64 bit recently. I usually work with ASPI drivers and devices which use ASPI . Previously everything used to work fine with winXP. But now I keep getting an error that the ASPI driver is not correct for windows 7. The saddest
 part is that I couldn't find any 64 bit version of the ASPI driver. So does it mean I will have to throw all my devices which use ASPI just because i installed windows7? Can Microsoft please help me find a suitable driver&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>No really good answers. <br />
<br />
Contact the maker's of the ASPI devices for solutions.<br />
<br />
Check for various Forums that work with each particular type of Device - such as CD would be MyCE.com<br />
<br />
MyCE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MyCE&nbsp;- Forums&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.myce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.myce.com/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://club.myce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://club.myce.com/</a><br />
<br />
Use Google to search for ASPI with and without using the specific type of device such as these.<br />

            Hi Net Danasti,
<div>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>As we understand you want to transfer windows 8 from E: drive to C: drive without reinstalling windows 8</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you could answer a few questions it would help us to assist you better.</div>
<div>1. Which operating system is installed on C: drive?</div>
<div>2. What is the make and model number of the computer?</div>
<div>3. What are the system specifications?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We would like to tell you that transfering an operating system from one drive to another in dual boot is not possible. The only resolution would be to format both the drives C: and E: and make it one large partition and freshly installing windows 8 which
 by default will install in C: drive.</div>
<div><strong>Note</strong>: Converting a hard disk partition requires that you reformat the partition, which deletes any data on it. Be sure to back up any data you want to keep before you begin.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this answers your query. You can write back to us for further queries/issues related to windows and we will be glad to assist you.</div>
        </p>

            I don't think I made myself clear in my original post. &nbsp;I have had this laptop for over 4 years and this pop up only started happening yesterday. &nbsp;When I bought the laptop it came with Vista as the operating system but I had to buy Windows and install
 it myself. &nbsp;This was a genuine copy.
<div><br />
<div>What I don't understand is why this is happening now. &nbsp;I've never had this before on other laptops or computers I've used and I don't know anyone else this has happened to. &nbsp;Could it be caused by some sort of virus? &nbsp;As far as I understood Windows is active
 on a machine forever so I'm concerned this message isn't a legit one. &nbsp;I once had a pop up saying Sun Java needed updating so I did this but it turned out to be a fake notification, and a very good one, and I got a trojan on my laptop.</div>

 on a machine forever so I'm concerned this message isn't a legit one. &nbsp;I once had a pop up saying Sun Java needed updating so I did this but it turned out to be a fake notification, and a very good one, and I got a trojan on my laptop.</div>

You made yourself as clear as you could.&nbsp; Now if you use the MGADiag that has been suggested, things will be clearer on this end as to what the problem and solution might be.

            <p>There's nothing obviously amiss in your report - apart from that 'Invalid License' line, casued by the 0xC004F02A error lower down&nbsp; - which probably indicates that there's some minor corruption in the Licensing Store....</p>
<p>Recreate the Licensing Store with the correct data.</p>

            Hi
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the reply. &nbsp;What is the COA sticker on the machines case? &nbsp;I don't know where to find this. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Today on the desktop on the bottom right hand corner it says -</div>
<div>Windows Vista (TM)</div>
<div>Build 6002</div>
<div>This copy of Windows is not genuine</div>
<div><br />
<div>I find things like this a bit scary as I know I've made no changes and also some people wouldn't know to come to forums like this one and would go to a repair shop and end up paying.</div>

<h2>            Change order that drivers load.</h2>
                    Is there a way to change the order in which your drivers load? I would like my mouse denabled sooner than it is now. As it is, I have to sit while other system tray items load. I have access to the desktop before everything loads but I can't do anything
 because I am waiting for the mouse to kick in.

<p><span>Hi SableAndWhite,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s the make and model number of the mouse?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Changing driver order isn’t possible. However you can fix the slow mouse startup issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are two possibilities here. Either certain startup items are preventing the mouse drivers to load slow or you<span>&nbsp;</span>don’t
 have the correct mouse drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Perform Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Most versions of Windows come with a utility called the System Configuration Utility, also known by the name of the executable that
 starts it: MSCONFIG. This is a handy, safer way of editing the startup options in the Registry; you can turn individual items on or off freely, trying various combinations until you narrow down the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer this article for detailed information on how to do this.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Update drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>For best performace and stability, device manufacturers release driver updates. Get the latest one by visiting the support section of
 the mouse manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For driver updates, refer this link:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Ensure
 that you put your computer back to normal startup mode after completing the troubleshooting steps. Steps are available in the article given above.</span></p>

<p>Sorry to necro this post, but I am having a similar issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was looking into a way to play my&nbsp;xbox&nbsp;one games on my pc,&nbsp;(since I prefer my pc over console) and seen there was in fact a way to do this. I did some research for an hour or two and couldn't seem to figure it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A day later, I was on my xbox&nbsp;app on pc, when my friend sent me an invite to play ARK. The popup appeared on my&nbsp;pc,&nbsp;and I was able to download and play ARK on pc (Using game pass [perhaps it was designed that way? But not farm sim 17?]) So I've tried a few
 attempts on reproducing this, but it just wont&nbsp;reproduce... anyone know&nbsp;a less lengthy workaround? Or none at all would be nice. Just some simple instructions.. lol. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Farming Simulator 17 is not on that List so you would have to purchase the PC copy if you wanted to play it on the PC.</p>

    <title>Change XPS Printer Settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lowedancer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change XPS Printer Settings</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 8.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Samsung service recently had to wipe and reset the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The XPS Printer is not printing now.&nbsp; It worked before.&nbsp; I use QuickBooks and it uses it to print and send invoices.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to change the settings on the XPS Printer to "Allow" "Everyone" to do everything that is checkable.&nbsp; However, all the boxes to check are grayed out and will not allow me to check them.&nbsp; I went into "Advanced Settings" and it did not allow me to do
 it either.&nbsp; I ran the computer in "Safe Mode" to change the security settings on the printer.&nbsp; But, in Win 8.0 (&amp; 8.1 so I found out), I can not view printers in safe mode.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I change the security settings in the printer properties of the XPS Printer running Win 8.0?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, simple terms.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>After resetting the computer, did you install all pending Windows Updates and update all device drivers?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you installed the latest printing software?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the error message you get when you say “The XPS Printer is not printing now”?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you able to change permission settings on any folder in the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Printing problems can be caused by cables that aren't connected properly, problems with wireless adapters or settings, damaged or incompatible printer drivers, or missing
 updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This tutorial is designed to help you identify and fix common printer problems in Windows. This tutorial doesn't cover printing problems related to specific apps.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To change the security settings on the printer, you may disable the UAC temporarily and check if this helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may disable User Account Control (UAC) and check if this helps. UAC notifies you before changes are made to your PC that require administrator-level permission. By
 default, UAC is set to notify you whenever apps try to make changes to your PC, but you can change how often UAC notifies you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>What are User Account Control settings?:

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> User Account Control (UAC) can help you prevent
 unauthorized changes to your computer. It works by prompting you for permission when a task requires administrative rights, such as installing software or changing settings that affect other users. We don't recommend turning User Account Control off. If you
 do turn it off, you should turn it back on as soon as possible.</span></p>

    <title>Good video recording app to use on tablet, Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maikori  say:</h3>
<h2>            Good video recording app to use on tablet, Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a Nextbook Flexx 11 installed with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking into using a video recording program/app to start making video diaries of my experience in an advanced study program, and am looking for any recommendations. I tried looking for a video recording program pre-installed in my tablet, but couldn't
 find anything. The program/app doesn't need to be anything fancy as I will not be doing a lot of editing, just something to pretty much hit the "record" and "stop recording" buttons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows app store doesn't have a wide variety of options to choose from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any good recommendations?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
