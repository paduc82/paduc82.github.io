                    I got a message that there was a new version of Java ready for download.&nbsp; I tried to download and got the message "JavaSetup8U131.exe couldn't be downloaded.&nbsp; After trying several times, I tried downloading other exe files with the same results.&nbsp; I am
 running Windows 10 with the latest updates installed.&nbsp; The only recent update was the "Windows 10 Creator" version which I installed last week.&nbsp; I am also having trouble running exe type files.&nbsp; One that I tried returned the message "SetUp was unable to find

            Thanks for the suggestions Acelyn Alc, but I was able to fix this problem by restoring my Internet Explorer 11 to the default options.&nbsp; As soon as I did that and restarted, the program downloaded and installed correctly.&nbsp; Thanks for your suggestion.

<h2>            &#34;There is a problem accessing &#92;&#92;localhost&#92;C&#36;&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I somehow wiped out user data from Chrome and I've been trying to find a way to get it back (bookmarks, history, stored email info, etc). After some researching, I discovered that Windows stores restore points for Chrome in \$USER$\AppData\Local\Google\
 and I can access them through Properties-&gt;Previous Versions. I successfully recovered my bookmarks file, but I haven't had any luck restoring the entire folder. It always gives me a "Network Error" window stating "There is a problem accessing \\localhost\C$",
 "Make sure you are connected to the network and try again." I don't have any network drives, local disk C is where most everything is. I've tried checking permissions and ownership of both the folder and the restore file but everything looks in order. I am
 Admin and the only user on the computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me with this error? I haven't found any help elsewhere. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
                </div>

            <p>The problem I'm having is with the "restore" feature of Windows, which is not working properly. It is not specific to Chrome - this could be happening with any folder. It just happens to be the Chrome folder that I want to restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already exhausted all help from Chrome and now know that all my data is gone from their servers. The only trace of my bookmarks, saved passwords, etc. is a 2-day-old backup in Windows Restore. That's why I'm here asking for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm about to quit trying to restore Chrome, but I would still like to know why I'm getting this error in case it happens when I try to restore something more important.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A "Network Error" window appears stating "There is a problem accessing \\localhost\C$" when restoring a folder using "previous versions" method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

            Easy: &nbsp;point to the item you want to delete, then press the Delete button on your keyboard. &nbsp;If you continue pointing and just holding down the delete key, it will delete the entire record of all typed entries in a few seconds.

<p>My professional laser printer (Tally T8016) is no longer supported by the maker and no WIN7 driver will be provided by them. &nbsp;Does this mean I will always have to have a WinXP computer for it to connect; or is there a WIN7 workaround solution?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maybe a "Generic" or "Generic Printer" driver would work? Or maybe the Tally T8006 or T8024 driver supplied in Windows 7 might be compatible with the T8016?</p>
<p>Go to Devices and Printers, click on "Add a printer" at the top of the page.<br />
Select "Local printer" then "Use an existing port" then click Next. When the "Install the printer driver" window comes up, click on&nbsp; "Windows Update" near the bottom. It may take a minute or two to finish, depending on your connection. Scroll down to "Generic"
 in the left pane, then pick one of the "PS" or "PCLx" drivers from the right pane. If the first one you pick doesn't work properly, try another one, going through the same process.</p>
<p>If the printer already shows in Printers and Devices, then highlight it and pick "Print server properties" at the top of the page. Go to the Drivers tab, then click Add.. at the bottom of the page. Then click Next, Next, then "Windows Update" and follow
 the same procedure as before.</p>
<p>You can also remove any driver(s) that didn't work from the Drivers tab using this method.</p>
<p>Try a few of the Tally drivers and see if any of them work.</p>
<p>If you already have it set up on a WinXP box, you can use it as a shared printer using the method posted here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/network-sharing/7527-networking-printer-attached-win-xp-pc-win-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/network-sharing/7527-networking-printer-attached-win-xp-pc-win-7-a.html</a></p>
<p>That is, if you don't mind keeping the XP machine around. I had my home network set up that way until my printer died two weeks ago and I had to buy a new one. I went ahead and got a wireless that's compatible with both my XP and Win7 machines.</p>

                    Yes, I've seen the tutorial, done that. A Strange issue on my part is, when SFC scan, found corrupt files. I don't get this, I mean what's the meaning of "clean" then? So, basically, what I am asking is "bare bones" ie start from scratch, no residue whatsoever,
 brand new, in other words.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>You would make selections similar to the picture on the link EXCEPT...</p>
<p>The Partition Scheme should be "GPT For UEFI"</p>

</p><p>The volume names don't matter, and will probably change...</p>
<p>Be sure to double check the settings... sometimes when you change one, it messes up another... Double Check carefully before hitting "Start"...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is on all the 116gb partitions ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best thing to do would be to delete all of them, but you need to get any important documents and stuff copied elsewhere first...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to use part of the drive for storage and not Windows, you could delete ALL of them...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then... Create a "NEW" 116-126gb or so partition for windows... then format the rest a another partition for data and stuff...</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's up to you... you could split that up anyway you want, or make the entire drive Windows...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess would be that either something went wrong during the clean install, or there is a glitch with the SFC /Scannow function...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a remote possibility that you have a bad spot on your HDD...</p>
<p>You could try a ChkDsk and see what it comes up with...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been issues in the past with false sfc /scannow error reports... I don't know if that applies to the newest Win 10 build or not...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andre and\or Greg may have some better info on that..</p>

    <title>Combat Flight Simulator will no longer save a new campaign - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> engrbill47  say:</h3>
<h2>            Combat Flight Simulator will no longer save a new campaign</h2>
                    I attempted to start a new campaign in CFS 3 after having defeated the HUN. I created a new American character and flew the 1st mission. I then dutifully saved the campaign as per the obvious instructions. After exiting the game, I attempted to continue
 w/ the new character. But NO! The bloody game had quietly refused to save this new character. It would only allow me to use characters that I had already defeated the Nazis before! Was gibts? Deutsch for "what happened?" I have already unloaded the game and
 reloaded it new. Thanks for ANY help.

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IP(Internet Protocol)&nbsp;Adress for two diffrent computer cannot be the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are unique numeric identifiers that are needed by every device that connects to the Internet. The are a shared common resource that must be managed carefully to ensure the continued growth and stability of the Internet. Most
 of the Internet is currently addressed with IP version 4 (IPv4) addresses. IPv6 addresses are also in use, but not yet to the same extent. IPv6 is a more recent protocol, offering a much larger address pool than IPv4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, you may try to reset TCP/IP of your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the link provided and check if the issue persists.</p>

<p>The only problem I have is that 'Games Discussion' and 'General Discussion' aren't created yet. Those were the two sections I hung out in. But in good time, I'm sure they'll be back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than that, I have no problem with the update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This week I unlocked a total of 6 achievement in CarneyVale, NIN2-JUMP, and Outland. Haven't had much time to play. :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hoping I'll have more time to game next week -- I'm looking forward to LA Noire. KMart is running a pretty awesome deal&nbsp;on it. ($20 coupon + free $19.99 game)</p>

            <p>Hi <b>Mary, </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft community and thank you for posting the question. I will surely help you to find a resolution regarding the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Which cloud applications are you referring to?
</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you tried to install any application which uses cloud computing?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Cloud applications are a sort of hybrid between traditional desktop applications and traditional web applications. They offer the benefits of both of these types of software without many of the drawbacks.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Like desktop apps, cloud applications can offer a rich user experience, immediate response to user actions, and offline mode. Like web apps, cloud applications do not need to be installed on a computer and can be updated at any time simply by uploading
 a new version to your web server. They also store their data in the cloud - offsite under your control.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Most often these application does not rely on specific operating systems.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is lot of cloud application available; I would suggest you to contact the program administrator/service to get more information about the compatibility with the specific operating system.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Please reply back if you have any more queries regarding Windows.

                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I currently have Windows 8.1 Pro and I'd like to reinstall it completely. So I tried to use the official Iso download tool but when I enter the key that's currently used on my system it says it can be used to activate Windows features, but not Windows
 itself. I'm sure it's related to the fact I activated the Media Center about 1 year ago(it was the same key), but I can't find any other key whether on my system or in my emails. My Windows is a download-only upgrade version. I had Vista before that. Is there
 anyway to reset it?</div>

    <title>Windows Media Player 12 won&#39;t find album info in Rip tab. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aswarr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 won&#39;t find album info in Rip tab.</h2>
                    <p>So my problem seems to be exclusively in the Rip tab. If I try to update or find album info it gives me a website not found message. I've already searched for resolutions and tried using the WMP utility that searches for issues, uninstalling and reinstalling,
 and someone else had posted that there was some system32 folder that had information in it but I couldn't even locate that so that might have been a Windows 7 thing as that was the OS the original problem was in. So my system is Windows 10 running the most
 recent version of WMP 12. If I manually type all the album info then I can search for the album info after I rip the disc, but it's a pain to do it that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any pointers would be appreciated.</p>

            That definitely is not my issue. I can rip CD's however prior to ripping them I want windows media player to find the album information. So i right click the album, which at this stage says unknown artist, unknown album, unknown genre, and unknown year,
 and I select update album info. Nothing happens. So I rick click it again and select "find album info" which launches a new window in which to manually search for the information. It opens the window and says that the website can not be found. So I type in
 all of the artist information myself and rip to my library. Once ripped I can then go to the album i just added and both update AND find both work.

<h2>            Skype paid number&#58; who to conact about poor quality&#63; Who will fix this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm paying for a Skype number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When people call me, the best case there is a serious lag between parties in conversation, like 2 - 5 secs before the other side gets the message.</p>
<p>Also, it takes a while for 'phone to be picked up' when I answer Skype call, with result that the caller may decide to drop call all together (or complain it takes long).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often however, the quality of the 'line' is so bad, that I cannot hear properly the other party: the conversation comes up garbled,&nbsp; words are missing or partial, or corrupt. All too poor to have a call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a paid service. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to contact Skype to resolve this issue?&nbsp; It's not just annoying, I paid for the service for work, can I don't find it usable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I prefer Skype contacting me to try fixing this, rather me searching through tons of Links on MS site about 'relevant' issues and FAQs, and how-tos, or , links for Live Chat.</p>

<p>Anyone else seen this?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            printing issues with HP laserjet 1020plus</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using HP laser jet 1020plus on a windows 7 home premium 64bit system loaded on a dell laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>recently the printer is giving issues with printing. Eralier it started with delay in giving prints and now has reached a level where it simply wont print unless I restart the system. The moment the laptop shuts the printer starts printing. After some time
 the problem again starts and I have to resatrt the system again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ahve tried :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) starting and restarting the spooler service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Uninstalled and reinstalled the printer (reinstallation was done with the system automatically loading the driver through windows update)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pls help.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have tried both- troubleshooter and reinstalling with the latest driver from HP website but the issue persists. However something worth mentioning here is that when i start my computer it displays a window saying " what program u want to use to open this
 file" and displays a list of programs like word, adobe, explorer etc and even if i select a program a blank page displays. When i try to find the file , search turns blank. Also when i shut down the system it usually shows " the following program is waiting
 to shut down-task host window" and then i have to use FORCE SHUT DOWN, to shut down .</p>
<p>
</p><p>is something wrong with the startup or there is some software error or virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>pls guide based on the above information on how to solve this printing issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sincere thanks</p>

<p>Neither the Windows troubleshooter nor Windows system file checker (SFC) is likely to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's marginally more likely that HP's Print &amp; Scan Doctor might help, so it's worthwhile trying that:&nbsp;
<a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03286146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03286146</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's pretty clear that there is something untoward going on with your computer, most likely the result of partially-removed malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say that you have tried to use search to find a file that something is attempting to open at start time.&nbsp; What is the name of the file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the name and version of your antivirus program?</p>
<p>What other security software is installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On general principles, I suggest that you --</p>
<ul>
<li>run a free antivirus scan with the ESET Online Scanner:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.eset.com/us/home/online-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.eset.com/us/home/online-scanner/</a></li><li>download, install, update, and run MalwareBytes AntiMalware:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a><br />
When you first install MBAM 3.0, it is a full-featured real-time antimalware tool. After 14 days, it changes to an on-demand only antimalware scanner (unless you pay).&nbsp; You can, of course, uninstall it at any time after you do the initial scan and before you
 pay for it.</li></ul>
<p>I also suggest that you download and run Autoruns:&nbsp; <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I don't know the name of the file that is giving a problem when Windows starts, all I can suggest at this point is to select the "Logon" tab and look for anything "unusual" there.&nbsp; Unchecking a line will prevent the item from running the next time
 Windows starts, but won't delete it (you can recheck it to get it back).&nbsp; You can right-click on any item and select "Search online" to see if you can find relevant info.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want someone here to give things a look, you can select File &gt; Save, then upload the saved file to online storage (e.g.,

<h2>            My new LG LED LCD monitor goes to sleep while in use, PC hanged the after restarting, Windows 7 wont start up after booting.</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought an assembled desktop PC running on Win7 64bit, i5quadcore, with 4gig RAM, and Nvidia Geforce video card&nbsp; 1gb ddr5, 750 watts power supply</p>
<p>Monitor goes to sleep while in use, I tried to adjust the settings to "never"&nbsp;in the power management so that in wont sleep ever. still it goes to sleep after a couple of minutes of use.</p>
<p>Second, Just last night my computer hanged so i was forced to restart it..after restarting in wont show the desktop anymore and hanged.. I called microsoft customer service since i thought it was OS related. the person from microsoft asked me to uninstall
 the video card driver and reinstall it.. it worked. but the problem is how to prevent it from happening again..</p>
<p>Or do I need to bring my desktop to a technician to have this problems checked? My PC is just 2 weeks old.</p>
<p>Your thoughts, opinions, suggestions&nbsp;and options would be highly appreciated.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 latest update has disabled my finger print scanner&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> helicaloptera  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 latest update has disabled my finger print scanner&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess other people have had similar issues but this is starting to get annoying for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP Envy Notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A previous update to Windows 10 disabled the ability to sign back in to Windows after entering sleep mode, which meant I lost all unsaved work after the update as I had to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, after the recent update, Microsoft has taken control of my fingerprint scanner and is forcing me to use Windows Hello to log in when I start my laptop. If I don't use Windows Hello, by not entering a pin, then my fingerprint scanner doesn't work at
 all. Also, if I use Windows Hello and I am not connected to the internet at start up I cannot use the fingerprint reader and have to enter a pin. In addition to this Windows Hello, once, apparently, set up, also doesn't read my fingerprint properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to reinstate my finger print reader so that I can sign on normally without all of this additional fuss and online check-in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am just a normal laptop user, I expect to be able to go to my device and access it with the security features that I select and not have some sign in system dictated to me by the company that makes the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, if anyone can help.</p>

            I would recommend that you should consider rolling back 1803 to 1709 and defer it from happening as there seem to be issues. Try to install this after a month or two when more cum packs are released stabilizing 1803 further. (Roll back can be done only if you were upgraded during last 10 days i.e. you are within 10 days roll back window)
<br />
<br />Roll Back - Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; Under Go back to previous version of Windows 10, Get Started &gt; Follow onscreen directions

<p>Hi E for Excel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your reply and help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your advise and uninstalled the update to Windows 10, unfortunately this left the finger print reader not working at all. Eventually, I have found that their is a new version of HP Simplepass, the program that used to control the fingerprint reader
 before the updates. I have since installed the new version of the program and updated the driver to the fingerprint reader and I am happy to say it is working fine now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any other reader has a similar problem with a HP Laptop/PC you can try the suggestions in the reply to this post on the HP website, which worked for me:</p>

            I was fortunate that running the HP support assistant found updated chipset and fingerprint scanner drivers (among others), and this resolved the problem.<br />
<br />
It is a bit frustrating that these effectively mandatory Win10 updates keep causing issues with my laptops; for my Dell, since 17xx it keeps reinstalling generic drivers that turn an i7 with dedicated graphics into a complete dog, until I reinstall the Dell
 drivers - then it repeats again the following month. I preferred being able to decline updates, but that no longer seems to be an option.<br />

            <p>Thanks for your reply @<span>Jose Antonio Ponton Posada CEO.</span></p>
<p><span>But I'd already tried this. The <strong>
troubleshooter</strong> just keeps on loading in <strong>stopping BITS service</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span>BTW I'd also tried downloading and installing a
<strong>standalone</strong> version&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=41578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;without any luck.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, Please consider the second error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Update:</strong>&nbsp;When I <strong>
force stopped</strong> the <strong>bits service</strong> from the services.msc and then ran windows update troubleshooter, it said the
<strong>update was fixed and repaired</strong>. Then, when I installed the updates it said
<strong>Updates were installed, 2 updates </strong><strong>not needed</strong><strong>.
</strong>Also,&nbsp;the same updates were found after I checked for updates once again. I'm extremely unhappy with the result. Any suggestions and/ help'd be appreciated. Thank You.</span></p>

    <title>Hardware Interrupts Heavily Impacting CPU Usage and Overall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> razwerkz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hardware Interrupts Heavily Impacting CPU Usage and Overall Performance</h2>
                    By using SysInternals Process Explorer, I am able to identify that the hardware interrupts process is consuming as much as 90% of my processor, at times, when not idle.&nbsp; So far I have tried defragmenting the hard drive, disk cleanup, checking the disk
 for errors, even restoring the system settings back to a date before this issue started occurring.<br />
<br />
Any and all help is most appreciated.&nbsp; If possible, I'd like to have someone offer remote assistance to help me resolve this issue in a more direct manner.

            I've seen that caused by a defective CD drive.&nbsp; Un-install the CD/DVD drives one at a time in Device Manager and see if the problem goes away.
