<h2>            WIN7 64 Ultimate freezing randomly.</h2>
                    I've had a history of my machine freezing up while I was working. The mouse would just stop. I would let it sit. Have a coffee - I even left it overnight in one case but it never came back. The only way out was turning the machine off. Turning the machine
 back on it would run for days without issue. ... and then it would happen again. Each time I would try to figure out the issue. check the logs- nothing conclusive. change the keyboard &amp; mouse, run sfc. Then the search functions stopped&nbsp; working, (I hadn't
 realized that all the crashes and rebooting were taking a toll on my drives. ChkDsk tried to fix things but I think it made them worse or the drives were getting hammered.
<br />
Still no amount of diagnostics helped find the error, There was nothing I did that would make the system crash or freeze. Ran memtest for 24 hours without error.<br />
Finally I broke down and bought a new machine. Installed a clean Win 7-64 Ultimate just a month ago. Installed my software and got data from backups. Spent a wonder week without freezes and THEN ... its baaaack!<br />
So far, it hasn't happened while working. It happens at 12:40am. I get that from the event logs. VSS is the last event log before my reboot causes a critical error to show up.<br />
Here is what I find in the Windows logs-<br />
-------------Application<br />
5/11/2013 12:44:21 AM - The VSS service is shutting down due to idle timeout.&nbsp; - This is the only event since an app hang event that was caused by a long response to a SQL request. at 9:52pm<br />
------------Security<br />
5/11/2013 12:41:21 AM - Microsoft Windows security auditing. Special privileges assigned to new logon. - (New LOGON?? at 12:41AM ??? - what's that?)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logon Process:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advapi&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Authentication Package:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Negotiate<br />
(and nothing for an hour before that which was the same thing)<br />
----------Setup - nothing since the system was setup 4/24<br />
----------System<br />
5/13/2013 6:52:52 AM - EventLog 6008 None System (After my reboot in the morning)<br />
The previous system shutdown at 1:53:03 AM on ‎5/‎11/‎2013 was unexpected.&nbsp; <br />
^^^ This is funny because the system was not shut down - it was running (lights on fans running) with black screens and not responding.<br />
The events just prior to my reboot are :<br />
5/11/2013 12:47:21 AM - Service Control Manager Event Id 7036.<br />
The Microsoft Software Shadow Copy Provider service entered the stopped state.<br />
5/11/2013 12:44:21 AM - Service Control Manager Event Id 7036.<br />
The Volume Shadow Copy service entered the stopped state.<br />
5/11/2013 12:41:21 AM - Service Control Manager Event Id 7036.<br />
The Microsoft Software Shadow Copy Provider service entered the running state.<br />
<br />
(This shadow copy pattern seems to repeat all the time - between 30 and 3 minutes apart.)<br />
<br />
I sure would like to get some feed back on this because this could put me out of business.<br />
<br />

            <p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Freezes mainly occur because the task or tasks being undertaken require more memory or CPU capacity than is immediately available. The solution is to increase what is available or to reduce demand. You can do both. How you
 do this is much more complicated. It depends on which item of hardware is causing the bottleneck. If memory is limited it can be simply remedied by adding RAM. If the problem is CPU capacity you will find that increasing capacity is often not practical as
 to replace the CPU processor often means replacing the motherboard, operating system and other hardware making the exercise expensive.. Changing the hard drive could help but switching to a solid state drive is also expensive. If the CPU is the problem then
 reducing demand is often the way to go.</font></font></font><font><font color="#000000"><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If you are intent on reducing demand it can dramatically improve performance if you remove browser add ons like toolbars and search engines which are not needed. Most times when you<span>&nbsp;
</span>install new software you will find recommended add ons. You need to learn to say no when they duplicate what you already have. Adds on can conceal malware, notably spyware reporting how you are using your computer. Do not believe bland statements like
 "quietly runs in the background". It's spin in more ways than one. Multi-tasking can be fine but it can bring performance problems. It translates into an excess of supply over demand!</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Another cause of freezes can be failing hardware, most commonly the hard drive, related cabling or defective RAM. These defects are often easy to detect but not always so. You should also ensure that you have the latest
 BIOS and motherboard drivers. They can be out of date on a brand new computer if the person selling you the computer has not updated immediately before handing you the computer.</font></font></font><font><font color="#000000"><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If the freeze always involves the same programme then you should uninstall and reinstall the programme and check that you have the latest updates. You can also use Google to find out whether others have or have had the same
 problem. Focus your searches using key words, extracts from Event Viewer descriptions perhaps, and limit results to those within 12 months.<span>&nbsp;

            Hi Gerry,<br />
This is Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 64bit, running on an i5-3570K cpu with 16GB memory, 128 GB Samsung 840 SSD main drive C: and 2TB Seagate drive D: for the data.<br />
nVidia Geforce CTX 650Ti graphics adapter with 2 monitors.<br />
A little iffy about running fdisk on an SSD. I could run it without the /f and send it to a text file if you think it'll show anything of any use. (No problems found - 62GB available)<br />

            Thanks, Gerry, Yes - all the memory was bought and installed at the same time.
<br />
I did run MemTest86 from a boot CD, but I will try running windows diag while I have dinner. Or maybe overnight. and let you know what happens.
<br />
I will check for the firmware - I am pretty sure it is, but I hadn't checked directly.<br />

            Gerry,<br />
Maybe I should've started the test while I went to eat. I left the machine on with some music playing. When I came back, the screens had turned off (expected) and the music was trying to play garbeld and slowed down so much that it was hard to tell what it
 was. Sounded like something from a Steven King movie. &lt;g&gt;<br />
So now I think rather than the machine falling over, something is running and hogging the processor. As good as dead.<br />
Is there a way to track processor usage maybe?<br />
Rebooted the machine and it ran perfectly. So I'm guessing not a heat problem.<br />
<br />
Any comments /insights are welcome.<br />
Thanks again,<br />
Chris<br />

            Try defragmenting the 2 TB Seagate drive. Also, open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)-&gt;go to Process tab-&gt;click
<i>Show process from all users</i>. Make sure CPU usage for the process <i>System Idle Process</i> is more than 97 percent. If not, click on the CPU column to arrange the process in descending order based on processor usage, to find the process that is using
 the maximum CPU usage. Also, monitor memory usage in Performance tab.

<h2>            Adding an email to Calendar and People doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently got my new Surface Pro (5th Gen). I works quite well, except for the email and Calendar. I have an Office subscription but I'd rather use the built in Windows 10 apps as they integrate better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I added my email to the Mail app. My email is with this ending: @mailbox.org. It is also linked to my Microsoft account. In the calendar app, I'd like to use the calendar which is supplied with the @mailbox.org. So when I want to add it, this happens
 (this also happens in the People app):&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4603506b-fd75-4275-ae50-47dfea976398?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4603506b-fd75-4275-ae50-47dfea976398?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, there is no option to add the native @mailbox.org calendar, only some Outlook calendar, which is weird, as I don't have anything to do with Outlook.com. If I add the account via advanced settings, it gives me an error without a tip to proceed

<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>P.S.: or is it just better to forget about these built in apps and use Outlook (Office version) instead?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Mail Program - Are You Kidding - Will Not Let Me Empty the Junk Folder</h2>
                    <p>The "new" Microsoft Mail program in Windows 10 just informed me:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>"The Junk folder couldn't be emptied. It's possible that your user name or password is incorrect, or that your email server isn't configured to allow this folder to be emptied. "</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's see:</p>
<p>1. I'm looking in the InBox and all of the mail is addressed to me.</p>
<p>2. I can delete or reply or move any of the mail in that folder.</p>
<p>3. I can look in my other folders and reply to, move, or delete the mail in there.</p>
<p>4. All of the junk mail is address to me.</p>
<p>5. I can "empty" the Trash folder.</p>
<p>6. I can click on the Calendar and go to my calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My assumption is that my user name and password is correct and that I am signed in to my email server which belongs to Microsoft. If their server isn't configured to allow this "Trash" folder to be emptied then how come I can empty every folder but that
 one and why in the world (belonging to Microsoft) would I want to hang on to the JUNK email (which probably contains some phishing or Trojan links)?</p>

<ul>
<li><span>Are you using Windows live mail app 2012 or Windows mail app? </span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to try configuring the Email server once again, it would be the Server issue also.</span></p>
<p><span>And I suggest you to follow the basic troubleshooting steps which would fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">App Troubleshooter</span></span></strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to run app troubleshooter through below link for issues related to edge and check if it helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If this does not fixes the issue, I suggest you to go to outlook.com using web browser and delete all the files from junk folder and then resync the mail app and<span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">

            <p>Thank <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">you</span> for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. No, I am not using Live Mail app. 2012. &nbsp;Ran the "pre-check" before installing Windows 10 and email saying it "wouldn't work". So I "obeyed" and quit using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Ran the troubleshooter and it found no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I will try "re-configuring" the mail server as per your suggestion and see if that does anything. Oh, I should add I don't use "Edge" and have no intentions of using it. Some of "my" key browser extensions won't work with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is my <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">impression</span> that Microsoft really, really wants me to only use the "web-based" applications for anything I choose to do. &nbsp;Offering me Office 365 for my Office in the Cloud and my pc-based Office 2007
 apps are beginning to have growing communication issues (including Outlook). &nbsp;Although I really doubt Microsoft cares....let me just say it won't happen, Microsoft. Primarily because I don't trust you and don't want some things being on your servers forever
 and ever. &nbsp;I want some things to disappear forever whenever I say "go away". &nbsp;In addition, I'm now in a rural area and have to rely on satellite connections for my internet service. &nbsp;Regardless of what the "wireless" providers say, it is not as reliable nor
 is it as secure and it is not as a "fast" as cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got that off my chest so now I'll go "reset" my mail server which I don't think I should have to do. &nbsp;Oh, and did I tell you that installing Windows 10 was such a blessing when I learned that I'd have to re-format my hard drive completely and wipe out all
 the data that I then had to restore from backup. Such fun.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand it's not your fault and you're just trying to be helpful which I do appreciate, just not real happy with the current trends from Microsoft and others.</p>

            <p>I appreciate the attempt to help. &nbsp;However, nothing worked with the Windows 10 mail program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Junk" folder refuses to empty and I get the message, mentioned in the original email, that states "<strong><em>that your email server isn't configured to allow this folder to be emptied"</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am being "forced" to go online to the Outlook web site and "empty" the folder after signing on to Windows Live. After emptying it there I get a really cool (not) message that states some like "You don't have junk here (hooray!)". &nbsp;Then I return to the
 Windows 10 mail program and refresh the "junk" folder because the original junk is still showing there and nothing happens. &nbsp;The junk is still there. &nbsp;I close the Mail program, wait a little while and reopen it and "magically" the junk is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can close this one, there is obviously no use in continuing this discussion. &nbsp;It's just typical "new" Microsoft operating system "Junk".</p>

            <p><span>Hi Horatio,<br />
<br />
</span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span><span><br />
<br />
I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.<br />
<br />
1. How many antivirus programs is installed on the computer?<br />
2. Which antivirus program are you using?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1<br />
</b>I would suggest you to disable and enable security center service and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
</span><span>a. Press Windows<span>&nbsp; </span>+ R<br />
b. In the Run box type ‘<b>services.msc</b>’ without quotes.<br />
c. Right click on <b>Security center Service </b>Click on Stop.<br />
d. Once again Right click on <b>Security center Service </b>and click on Start.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>Method 2</b><br />
If your computer is on a domain, your security settings might be managed by your network administrator, and Security Center will not display your security status or send notifications.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open Security Center by Pressing Windows + C , Type control panel, clicking Control Panel, clicking Security, and then clicking Security Center.<br />
b. Click Malware protection, and then, under Virus protection, click Show me my available options.<br />
c. In the Windows Security Center dialog box, click I have an antivirus program that I'll monitor myself.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<span>Security Center will display your antivirus settings as Not monitored, and you will no longer receive notifications about your virus protection software.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Hope this information is helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.</span>

            Slight correction above that step b should be 'services.msc' (plural) <br />
<br />
If you happen to be running ESET NOD32 Antivirus or ESET Smart Security, you can reference the following KB Article to resolve the issue:

            <p>Thanks Vijay..I'm a little pressed for time at the moment...so have simply turned off the offending three messages. When I have a little more time I will give your potential solution(s) a try.&nbsp; I imagine your approach is safer in the long term. Thanks again

            <p>Oops... I was a little premature with my last message...the erroneous error messages re-appeared after rebooting. Your method 2 equates to switching off the messages which is what I had done and have done again. I guess that's it then. Unless anyone is aware
 of a method to make the action centre see sense.</p>
<p>Thanks anyway.</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail keeps closing unexpectedly</h2>
                    Since I'm using Windows 10, my Windows Live Mail keeps closing unexpectedly. I didn't have any problems in Windows 7, so the problem came recently and I suppose it had to do with Windows 10. What could be the problem and the solution?

<h2>            Factory Reset on a Dell Inspiron 1545 with Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to factory reset my laptop because it has too much junk on it.&nbsp; I&nbsp;bought it with win7 preloaded from the factory and am attempting to reset it to that condition.&nbsp; I followed the instructions in the attached link:</p>

<p>
</p><p>However, instead of resetting, the boot manager comes up and tells me </p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows failed to start.&nbsp; A recent hardware or software change might be the cause.&nbsp; To fix the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Insert you windows installation disc and restart your computer.</p>
<p>2. Choose your language settings, and then click "next."</p>
<p>3. Click "Repair&nbsp; your computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have this disc, contact your system admin or computer manufacturer for assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File: \windows\sistem32\windload.exe</p>
<p>Status: 0xc0000001</p>
<p>Info: the selected entry could not be loaded because the application is missing or corrupt."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not now, nor have I ever had the disc.&nbsp; Also, all the other options bring me back to the windows startup without resetting anything.&nbsp; How else can I reset my computer and wipe my harddrive (while leaving the OS)?&nbsp; Is there a way I can contact Dell or
 MS and get the activation code which I bought as part of my&nbsp;pre loaded computer?&nbsp;

                    I have an Advent 6441 laptop (Vista). I think I may have hit a key to unlock/lock something.<br />
On starting up my laptop I have a padlock symbol withe the number 1 in it. Does anybody know what this is &amp; how I can get rid if it.<br />
I have not noticed anything different about anything on my laptop so have NO idea what this has done !!!!<br />
PLEASE HELP, it is beginning to annoy me. I have searched online &amp; found nothing to help.<br />
<br />
Can anybody help ??????<br />
<br />

I have just noticed that the symbol is on my task bar. When I right click in it a box pops up with a picture in; what I can only discribe as a memory card on a stand!!<br />
<br />
Next to the pic it has;&nbsp; OSD Ver. 1.17<br />
<br />
Does this help anybody to help me solve my problem ????

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Sorry I don't have an Advent, my Toshiba has a different symbol for Fn + F9 than yours though it is the
<br />
TouchPad On/Off toggle.<br />
<br />
Since it may be Systematic I would check with Advent Support and their on-line documentation.<br />
<br />
If it loads as the desktop does then I suspect its some program that protects something on the system.<br />
<br />
(Edited to change Acer to Advent.)<br />

<h2>            Xbox Live attaccato&#58; rubati Microsoft Points e usate carte di credito per acquistare su XboxLive</h2>
                    
<p>Leggete qui: http://www.webmasterpoint.org/news/xbox-live-attaccato-rubati-microsoft-points-e-usate-carte-di-credito_p43446.html.</p>
<p>Praticamente è successo anche a me: ieri sera non riuscivo a connettermi con il mio gamertag perchè mi usciva un messaggio d'errore che diceva di connettersi con un profilo d'abbonamento valido oppure tentare di recuperare il profilo su Xbox Live.</p>
<p>Ho provato a connettermi con il pc e subito l'amara sorpresa: i punti microsoft che avevo ottenuto riscattando un codice (carta prepagata di 4200 punti) erano rimasti 30 invece di 3600!!!</p>
<p>Sospettando qualcosa ho subito cambiato la password, poi recuparato il profilo tramite l'apposita funzione presente nella console. Non appena loggato dopo aver recuperato il profilo la conferma dell'amara sorpresa: soli 30 punti microsoft!!!</p>
<p>Praticamente qualcuno è entrato con le mie credenziali ed ha speso i miei punti comprando 4 giochi su Xbox Live, poi ha addirittura giocato (perchè dei giochi comprati mi risultano anche degli obiettivi sbloccati). Però nessuno di quei giochi è presente
 nella mia console, e nessun acquisto via internet è stato fatto in quanto nella coda dei download non c'è praticamente nulla (preciso che quando si compra via internet gli acquisti vengono automaticamente aggiunti alla coda download).</p>
<p>Poi telefonata all'assistenza, ed ora la mia pratica sarà evasa in 25 giorni. L'amarezza è che al telefono, prima di passare il mio caso all'ufficio legale Microsoft, hanno fatto di tutto per farmi dire che qualcuno della mia famiglia aveva fatto quegli
 acquisti al mio posto (mia moglie non sa neanche accendere il computer e mio figlio ha 11 mesi) oppure che avevo dato le mie credenziali ad un amico. Questa cosa, oltre alla vicenda, mi dà molto fastidio, posso capire che si devono accertare bene ma qui, come
 si legge dall'articolo, è successo a molte persone e secondo me sarebbe ora che Microsoft, invece di tacere, facesse un comunicato ufficiale sull'accaduto.</p>
<p>A chi altro è accaduto vedersi sottrarre punti o soldi dalla carta di credito per acquisti su Xbox Live?</p>
<p>Saluti</p>

<p>Se fosse davvero cosi vuol dire che neanche l'xbox live che è a pagamento è molto più sicuro del PSN; sarebbe proprio un duro colpo per la microsoft</p>

<p>Io pure facevo il ragionamento "Qui si paga allora è più sicuro" ma da oggi non la penso più così. Io non sono un giocatore accanito ma mi piace da matti tutto quello che c'è attorno alla semplice console da gioco, ad esempio acquisto non di rado films su
 zone... Ora con 30 punti microsoft non riesco ad affittare proprio niente e non ci penso neanche a ricaricare finchè non spiegano cosa è successo e c'è il rischio che risucceda. L'unica cosa certa, ad oggi, è che Microsoft si è presa tempo per verificare sospendendo
 gli account incriminati.</p>
<p>Stiamo a vedere.</p>

<p>Pagare non è sinomino di sicurezza.</p>
<p>Certo,da MS ci si aspetta comunque un certo livello in questo ambito.Può darsi che la casa di Redmond non abbia diffuso la notizia per non perde la clientela e mandarla alla concorrenza,ricordiamo che parecchi quando il PSN è stato bloccato hanno acquistato
 una 360.Quindi c'è la possibilita che il problema venga arginato senza troppi problemi e con discrezione.</p>
<p>È comunque una mia ipotesi,si può rivelare verà come può essere solo un mucchio di balle...ma io non mi spiego in altro modo l'accaduto.Certo c'è da tenere anche in considerazione la veridicità della pagina contenente le informazioni.</p>

<p>Si, come dici te pagare non è sinonimo di sicurezza, ma chi paga vorrebbe poter non preoccuparsi di queste cose; altrimenti potrebbero renderlo gratuito o almeno diminuire il costo se non danno la quasi certezza che certe cose non possono accadere</p>

<p>Quindi confermate tutti, come pensavo, che pagare non significa sicurezza garantita al 100%. Però un livello di sicurezza più alto quello si, ce lo devono. Riguardo al far passare in sordina la cosa, per non perdere clienti, è sicuramente come dite, quelli
 dell'assistenza telefonica erano molto ben istruiti al riguardo, come erano ben istruiti, nella prima parte della conversazione, a cercare di chiudere la telefonata con un "Non è colpa nostra, è stato lei che non è stato diligente, grazie e arrivederci". Quest'ultima
 cosa mi fa rabbia ma mettendomi nei panni di Microsoft è più che comprensibile.</p>
<p>P.S.: per la cronaca, nell'avatar qui di fianco ci sono 5 icone di giochi ma io possiedo solo Trival Pursuit, l'ultimo in fondo a destra, i primi 4 sono i giochi incriminati che non so chi ha acquistato utilizzando i miei punti... Ora che ci penso al telefono
 mi hanno anche detto "Ma perchè non scarica quei giochi che ha acquistato e la finiamo qui?". Ed io: "Ma perchè devo comprare qualcosa per forza che non mi interessa?".</p>

<h2>            The command line argument is not valid. Verify the switch you are using</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've searched for answers on this with limited success in other threads. My issue seems a little more complex.</p>
<p>I have a user with Windows 7 Pro laptop with Office 2010, our standard PC build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All application icons on his desktop are now the default Outlook icon and when he clicks on any it gives the message</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>"Cannot Start Microsoft Outlook, The command line argument is not valid. Verify the switch you are using"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going into the programs drop down menu none of the applications will start, same message.</p>
<p>But if you go into the C drive and find the exe then it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also applies to all the other appplications on his desktop, not just Office, same message. Yet if you check the Properties, Target&nbsp;shortcut it all appears to be correct for all of them. If you then press the button 'Open File Location' it goes to the
 correct exe file which can be opened. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A possible cause is that another user ( these are field engineers ) used this PC to print some test customer files from a USB stick. I am currently running a virus scan and hopefully it may find something but then the issue becomes how to repair it. I ran
 Office Repair but it did nothing. I can reimage and rebuild but the engineer will lose all his specialist software tools which can take weeks to sort out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on the cuase and a possible fix\repair procedure much appreciated.</p>
<p>If I find any answers I'll post them up for others</p>
<p>
</p><p>cheers</p>
<p>Brent</p>

            <p>Hi Anannya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the link but unfortunately it had no effect on the problem. I think my issue is more related to the Outlook symptoms thread posted elsewhere except it's a bigger, badder occurence and I don't know what specifically caused it.</p>
<p>The user requires the PC going so it's re-image time. At least the data is not corrupted so I'll pull most of that off for him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

    <title>Windows Media Player 12 only plays one song at a time&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> remy525  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 only plays one song at a time&#63;</h2>
                    I very recently had to upgrade to WIndows 7 (just got it back this morning) and along with it came WMP 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;I uploaded the huge collection of music (over 9K songs &amp; growing) that was on my previous WMP (I believe it was version 11), and&nbsp;was very sorry
 to see that the advance tag editor and having "songs" &amp; "recently added" views built in are gone. But these I can work around. What I cannot work around is the inability to play more than one song at a time when in the "all music" mode which is the mode I
 always use. I've been using WMP for at least 15 years &amp; never had this playback problem before switching to WMP 12.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Just out of curiosity I did check out the artist and album view modes &amp; both will play the next song in the list automatically. Unfortunately neither of these modes are of any real use to me, since the majority of tracks on my computer are from individual
 discs and artists and therefore I would still have to constantly go back in to click on the next one.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am not interested in the hassle of creating playlists or anything else just to get this thing to work properly, so PLEASE don't suggest that! At the rate that I add music it would be impossible to do. If WMP 12 does not provide automatic playback in
 the "all music" mode without having to click on each song, then is it possible to go back to using WMP 11?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for your help!</div>

            Perfectly.
<div><br />
<div>Personally i don't see the point but if you search the web (Google) you'll Find instructions about how to install WMP11 in &nbsp;W7. You might not get complete functionability.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Mp3Tag is a much better tag editor than any version of WMP, you can batch tag with it, something you can't do with WMP.</div>

            As I'm sure you can imagine, Jerry, I have no use for a program that does not provide complete functionality, already am experiencing this with WMP 12. I mentioned WMP 11 because it worked (near) flawlessly when I had Vista and I don't know if getting
 rid of 12 in place of 11 is a viable option with windows 7, so who better to ask than the Microsoft experts. And for the record I did spend several hours researching all of this on google before ever posting my initial question, but could not find anything
 consistent, and it's hard to know who's opinions and which links are trustworthy.
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Hopefully someone out there has experience with WMP 12 and can offer some help?</div>

            WMP 12 is playing all songs fine on my system, even in All music mode. How exactly are you starting playback?<br />
<br />
If you instead right-click on a song and select <b>Play all</b>, does that help?<br />

            I have exactly the same problem since a couple of days, and apparently, in my case, it has something to do with my library becoming larger than WMP can handle. My library went over 20.000 tracks last week, and that's when the problem you're describing
 started occurring. Very annoying! I've found other reports on internet of people who are having the same problem ever since their music collection expanded over 20.000 songs. One guy on the Anandtech-forum even narrowed it down to "19982 songs or 2193 albums"<font color="#000000">.</font>

<p>Thanks for this tip.&nbsp; As you say, it is a "workaround" and a lot of clicks for something so simple as the ability to continuously play songs from any point in one's library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had no problems with continuous play in WMP 12 (Windows 10) until the other day when my PC underwent a "major upgrade" which took considerable time and many re-starts.&nbsp; I suspect it was at that point that continuous play in "music" mode went away.&nbsp; Until
 I tried your fix, I could do continuous play ONLY in "artist" or "album" modes (left pane).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And thanks again to Microsoft for causing problems with your "upgrades"....</p>

I should have mentioned this.....<br />
<br />
I used to have C : D : and E: drives shown on Computer window. <strong>That's it. Nothing more.<br />
</strong>First time I inserted the flash drive, it assigned letter&nbsp;F: to my flash drive.<br />
One day I unplugged the flash drive, then later re-plugged it back.<br />
Since then I have this " ghost " F: drive. </p>
<p>And letter&nbsp;G: is assigned to my flash drive.</p>
<p>I hate to unplug my flash drive again. Might have 2 ghost drives if I do.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Hmmm, the plot thickens! :-)&nbsp; Two places I'd check would be Device Manager and Disk Management.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Device Manager, you could disable whatever USB ports it thinks the ghost drive is attached to, then re-enable it.&nbsp; Another alternative would be to use
 System Restore to go back before this happened.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I've never seen or heard of this happening, but then again that doesn't mean a whole lot.&nbsp; If you spend enough time with computers, you'll see a lot of things like that!&nbsp; I see you're a communiity star too, so I'm sure you know what I mean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Task Manager and System Administrator Disabled</h2>
                    greetings this is a 2 part. for some reason, I can no longer access my task manager. it says 'disabled by your network administrator'. Next up is a simple thing: I can no longer change my desktop background. Ironically, it also says, 'disabled by system
 administrator'. how would i go about correcting this? If i'm the system administrator, how is it disabled? i didn't do that lol<br />

<h2>            system restore not working</h2>
                    The system restore function is not working at all.. It is unable to create a restore point.. I can't install the latest updates because it has an error msg when creating restore point.. And when i tried to use system restore it couldn't complete and then
 deleted the point.. so now I don't have any restore points to go to.. Also, my utilities program System Suite professional by avanquest, when it tries to make a recovery point and access system restore there is an error, it goes to a blue screen (too quickly
 for me to read the screen) and then it restarts.. Also occasionally the computer will shut off when idle, and when i start it back up it goes to "startup repair" and then says it is unable to complete. but when i turn the comp off then back on, it starts up
 perfectly fine. and if i shut off in the middle of startup repair it also starts back up just fine..what is going on and how do i fix this?

            Hello and thank you..<br />
I followed step 1, the volume shadow copy service was set to manual and i changed it to automatic and started it..<br />
as per step 2, system protection was already on for the drive..<br />
<br />
I checked the system restore and I created a restore point successfully! and the updates installed all except for one..<br />
<br />
these are the details for the particular update which won't install.<br />
<br />
Security Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2724197)<br />
Download size: 4.9 MB - 5.0 MB<br />

            problem still persists<br />
<br />
although I was able to create a restore point. The system restore still won't work and does not complete..<br />
I ran system suite to see if the problem was fixed, and when making a recovery point it again went to a blue screen and shut my comp down.<br />
I then tried to use system restore to restore to the point i had created earlier, and again it would not complete and deleted the point..<br />
so the issue still persists<br />

            <p>What anti-virus software is installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Suite Professional is a registry cleaner. Registry cleaners provide negligible benefits and can readily create system errors that can only be resolved by reinstalling windows and all that entails. Optimisers (TuneUp tools) are not the best way to
 get better system performance. You need to make sure the installed hardware is adequate for the tasks you are asking your computer to perform!</p>

            System Suite also provides anti-virus and malware protection as well, as well as email and file scanner.. the registry cleaner is only one of the functions. and when i've run the registry cleaner, i set it that it does not fix automatically, and i've only
 used it for broken links in the registry. <br />
Also i should note, this problem with system restore existed before system suite was even installed..<br />

            Well, is Microsoft Security Essentials going to fix the issue with system restore and make it work? will it stop the need for the computer to go to Startup Repair after randomly shutting off when idle? Will it stop the system restore point error that is
 preventing Windows Update from completing the installs?<br />
That is the issue here and not a compare and contrast session of antivirus software. I only mentioned attributes of system suite related to your comment that it was only a registry cleaner..
<br />
I was using windows defender and windows firewall etc before this issue occurred and it still occurred..<br />

            That answer just doesn't cut it, sorry... I hardly see how switching antivirus software has anything to do with a system restore issue.. In fact, if I'm not mistaken even Microsoft Security Essentials will attempt to make a system restore point before
 removing any malware, as with any other a/v software, and again, it won't be able to complete the process.. A/V software is a matter of preference and after having used&nbsp; windows defender and windows firewall and the windows active protection for quite a while,
 i was not happy with them. obviously they did not prevent issues from occurring.. and i'm not going to sacrifice the extra features i get with my 3rd party program.. So please, save your sales pitch and unless you have troubleshooting information specific
 to System Restore then you aren't helping much..<br />

            <p>"I hardly see how switching antivirus software has anything to do with a system restore issue". What experience do you have of fixing malfuncting computers? Two common things that cause system restore to stop working are security products and malware.&nbsp; The
 choice of anti-virus can be the key to getting the computer working properly. Malware, once present, commonly targets the tools installed on the computer which would enable the user to regain control of a computer&nbsp;and repair &nbsp;damage. System Restore, Task Manager
 and Event Viewer are often not functioning on a computer&nbsp; infested with malware. Malware will also neutralise installed security products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain anti-virus software will not allow system restore to function properly. The most notable being Norton. There are others but I do not every one. You are using software containing a registry cleaner and which seeks to optimise the system so that the
 operating system can malfunction at any time. To get your computer to work properly you need to be able to investigate and fix what is not working knowing that insurmountable obstacles are not being put in the way. You need to be able to be able to carry out
 independent checks for malware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So please, save your sales pitch and unless you have troubleshooting information specific to System Restore then you aren't helping much." This is absolute rubbish. I have no connection with Microsoft. Read my profile. I can recommend alternative security
 software if that is required. On my own computers I use AVG Free but most users&nbsp;bringing problems here trust the Microsoft products. As for "hype", all registry cleaners are sold on "hype" and the seemingly easy way they are supposed to fix thousands of errors.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Firstly, you could try uninstalling and re-installing the network adapter.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>To do this follow the steps below:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>start</strong>, in the <strong>start</strong> <strong>search</strong> bar type
<strong>device</strong> <strong>manager</strong> and then press <strong>enter</strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the list of devices, right click the network adapter and then click on uninstall, if it prompts to remove the driver files completely, click
 on ok to remove.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Restart the computer once the uninstall is done.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Once the computer restarts it will automatically detect and install the drivers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Check if the issue is resolved.</span></span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>If the above steps do not help then you could try a
<strong>System restore</strong> to an earlier point in time when the issue did not exist.</span></span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><span><strong>To restore system files and settings using a specific restore&nbsp;point</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;1. Open System Restore by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button. In the search box, type <strong>System Restore</strong>, and then, in the list of results, click
<strong>System Restore</strong>.</span><span>‍</span><span>&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password
 or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>2.
</span><span>Do one of the following</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If there is a recommended restore point, click
</span><strong><span>Choose a different restore point</span></strong><span>, and then click
</span><strong><span>Next</span></strong><span>.</span></div>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If there isn't a recommended restore point,
 click </span><strong><span>Next</span></strong><span>.</span></div>
</li></ul>
<p>
<span>3. Click the restore point that you want, and then click
</span><strong><span>Next</span></strong><span>.</span><span>To
 view the programs and drivers that will be affected (which could include programs that will be deleted), click
</span><strong><span>Scan for affected programs</span></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>4.
</span><span>Review the restore point, and then click
</span><strong><span>Finish</span></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>Restore system files and settings</span></span></strong></p>

<p>Hello Rehman,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your help! But it won't help. I tried uninstalling the drivers and after the restart it did install them automatically, but the network icon remains the same.</p>
<p>As for System Restore, I don't use it. So, that option is not available for me.. Any other options you might think of??</p>

<h2>            After update Windows 8 running slow</h2>
                    I have dell inspiron 15r SE with i7 and amd graphics with Windows 8 core edition OEM<br />
<br />
I recently did a windows update and after restarting my laptop I noticed that my laptop is running a bit slow. The Boot up time and also the start up time increased, especially the booting time.<br />
<br />
It was my first windows update since i got this computer. I have now restored my windows before Windows Update now it in previous state&nbsp; before the update and its running same as before the update and I am happy now. I would wait for few months and then again
 update windows to see if it happens again.<br />
<br />
Why this happens is there any particular update responsible for this?<br />
<br />

<p>First of all, thank you for the taking the time to reply/help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the switch last night, from 8.1 to 10 Mobile. I assumed that it would be updated with the latest and greatest. How do I check that I have the 10 Mobile Anniversary? What numbered version is it? 10.0.xxxxx? How do I get it? I am relying on the automated
 updates (phone is updating as we speak)..</p>

<h2>            Windows Vista and Security Essentials won&#39;t update properly for months now</h2>
                    <p>Hello I keep seeing similar issues but not quite the same as mine so I thought i would post my own question. &nbsp;I am running Windows Vista Home Premium 32 bit SP 2 and haven't upgraded this machine because of some old programs i need to run that are incompatible
 with newer versions of windows.....I really don't want to upgrade this machine if i can help it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that i haven't been able to properly update windows or microsoft security essentials for many months now. &nbsp;I have the updates are available notification in my screen and click on it, choose the updates and then click download.....this is where
 it all stays....the end. &nbsp;I never get an error message and even if i let it continue downloading for days it does not usually work and if it does it only downloads one or two of the updates. &nbsp;I restart to install them and then have the same problem with the
 next crop of updates. &nbsp;there is no error message to look up it just stays at zero percent completion for downloading them and never gets to the installation part. &nbsp;The odd time it does work i only notice when i go to shutdown the computer there is the choice
 of install and shutdown in the power shut off options. &nbsp;Then it is usually only one update that successsfully is seen to be installed when i restart and check the update history. &nbsp;All the others will wind up being cancelled when i stop the download to turn
 off the computer. &nbsp;I have been letting this go for two days now and none of the updates security essentials or otherwise have been downloaded.....it still says zero percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For months i have had this problem and been reading various solutions and hoping it would just go away at the next update tuesday with some miracle from microsoft. &nbsp;Once or twice it actually did get better and then inevitably more updates are available and
 same situation.....sigh.....the fixit tools links i have found are discontinued i suppose because microsoft has partially abandoned vista now. &nbsp;Fabulous.....I thought only apple did this to its customers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any advice i would be happy to give it a go. &nbsp;Or maybe ....just maybe is anyone from microsoft listening? &nbsp;Perty please patch your patches already! &nbsp;And don't leave your customers hanging. &nbsp;From all the searches i have done i am not the only
 one and many windows 7 machines are having similar issues.....just not quite exactly what i am experiencing. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Bill,<br />
<br />
All of the attached dump files are of the <b>SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M (1000007e)</b> bugcheck.<br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that a system thread generated an exception which the error handler did not catch.</i><br />
<br />
We seem to be dealing with a variety of driver issues here, so let's analyze this closely:<br />
<br />
In a *1000007E bugcheck, the most important thing (generally) is the 1st parameter. In your case, the 1st parameter is always
<i><b>c0000005</b></i> which indicates an access violation occurred.<br />
<br />
If we run an .exr:<br />
<br />
<i>0: kd&gt; .exr 0xffffffff8291646c<br />
ExceptionAddress: 82c85781 (nt!__InterlockedIncrement+0x00000005)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ExceptionCode: <b>c0000005 (Access violation)</b></i><b><br />
<br />
</b>^^ See?<b><br />
</b><br />
Now that we ran the .exr, let's go one step further and run a !thread to get the call stack:<br />
<br />
<i>STACK_TEXT:&nbsp; <br />

Starting from bottom going upward, we have various <i><b>bcmwl6.sys </b></i>calls which is the
<br />
<div>Broadcom 802.11g Network Adapter driver. Going upward some more, we reach an
<b><i>hssdrv6.sys</i></b> call which is the Hotspot Shield Routing Driver (more than likely the cause here). I have seen it and solved many cases in which it was the cause of the crashes. Let's continue though.... if we go upward some more, we reach a few
<b>AMPPAL.sys </b>calls which is the Intel® Centrino® Bluetooth 3.0 + High Speed Virtual Adapter driver.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Overall, as I said, Hotspot Shield is more than likely causing conflicts here. I recommend removal for troubleshooting purposes ASAP.<br />
<br />

            Thank you all so much! Patrick I owe you my greatest gratitude.
<div>I uninstalled HSS and restarted but it didn't work, however I system restore'd and it worked after that point and I'm now happily surfing the web.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This website is awesome and so are the people, I shall definitely use this website before I take it to the local repair man and get charged £50-£100.</div>

<div>Thanks so much,&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            My Windows 8 Laptop has reset itself to factory settings HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I went to turn on my laptop one day and when i signed in, it was as if i had just bought it. A hello message came up and it said it was installing apps; then when the windows homepage came up, none of my apps or files were there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it has reset itself to it's original factory setting. What should i do?</p>

            <p>PC won't reset itself to factory setting, I believe it is due to corrupted user profile, try restart your PC and if problem persist, follow steps on:</p>
