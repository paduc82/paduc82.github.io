<h2>            How to fix driver failure with Intel Smart Sound Technology driver on Surface Book&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since taking the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update my Surface Book does not recognize the onboard audio and shows an error with the Intel Smart Sound Technology OED driver.&nbsp; In the event viewer, I can see the following error:</p>

<p><span>Okay so the apparently there's a glitch in fable 3? Does anyone know if there's a solution to this..</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>All I need is to get the book called " <b>The Extraordinary Homunculus of Baron von Orfen</b>" Which is in Sunset House near the statues. I went to go get it then went back the to library to donate it and get the quest for
 the last book. When I tried to donate it by going up to the book stand, a donate symbol wouldn't pop up?&nbsp; I even went back to sunset house to check if left it there by mistake but nope its not there and I can't donate it.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>This is so frustrating.</span></p>

<p>Same experience as GingerNoSoul85. Select the quest from the quest list. I had to do this for almost every single book even if I was carrying multiple books at the time. Irritating, but at least you can work around it.</p>

<h2>            System automatically turns on with tv&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I have had a Samsung 40" LCD for over a year now and used it primarily for gaming with my xbox.&nbsp; I did not watch cable tv at all.&nbsp; Just recently I moved into an apartment and now use the tv for cable, xbox gaming, and movies.</p>
<p>My problem is that when I am done gaming and shut everything off via my logitech remote, then turn the tv back on for cable, the xbox turns on!?</p>
<p>I have tried the tv on different inputs but it does not matter.&nbsp; The second the tv is turned on, the xbox turns on.&nbsp; I have talked to xbox customer support and they were clueless and said they had never heard of this problem before.&nbsp; The system is connected
 via HDMI.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions or have this problem?&nbsp; My xbox is about to take a trip out my window.&nbsp; It is extremely frustrating to continue getting up to shut off the system.</p>

<p>Thanks, tried using the system in different inputs and same problem. &nbsp;The tv goes back and forth b/w gaming and movies/cable so unplugging/plugging in every time is really inconvenient. &nbsp;Not to mention had knee surgery recently so getting up and down often
 is pretty uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Hey Drewberg11! Have you tried an alternate HDMI cable? Or does your television perhaps have a link or CEC protocol that turns on all devices? You might be able to disable this function, if so this could put an end to your automatic power on issue. :) Let
 us know what you find! </p>

<p>Possibilities:</p>
<p>1) Your TV remote is using a signal similar to the xbox's, so when it tells your TV to turn on, it tells your xbox to turn on as well.</p>
<p>2) Devices connected with HDMI ports (and VGA as well) can actually give each other commands. It may be possible there is a setting somewhere in your television that tells the XBOX to turn on.</p>

<p>I don't know the answer but you are not alone. My xbox just recently started turning on by itself as well. I had to unplug the damn thing to get it to stay off. I am using components so I know it cant be a sytem link thing. Hope they figure it out soon.</p>

<p>Your remote is probably set to control your 360 along with your TV and everything else. You will either have to reset the remote and reprogram everything or just unprogram the controls for the 360. Look in the manual that came with the remote to figure out
 how to do this.</p>

<p>My Xbox used to do this but the remedy for you could be different than mine. </p>
<p>1. Is you xbox the old style? Not the new slim xbox?</p>
<p>2. Do you have turtle beach or some other headset that requires Optic cable?</p>
<p>3. Do you have both hdmi and component cables plugged in at the same time?</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>If yes to all of the above then you more than likely have a "handshake" issue with your tv and one remedy is to power down the xbox and let it sit for a few seconds until the fans shut down. Or you could try and change to another hdmi port. This is not really
 a problem with the xbox or tv. The issue is is that the tv and xbox are trying to figure out which connection type you have and since both are connected the handshake fails and tries to reconnect..</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 on Surface Pro stuck in Restart loop</h2>
                    I have a surface Pro using Windows 10 and after the most recent update it is stuck in a Restart Loop. None of the Repair, Restore or Reset options are working. I have tried several solutions found online and none of them work. The device will not start
 in Safe Mode and none of the options to attempt from within Windows will work because it is not starting. The error log indicates that C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\acpi.sys is corrupt. Also receiving Error code Oxc000007b. I am above a novice but certainly
 no expert so any advise on resolving this issue without losing the data on the Surface would be greatly appreciated.

<p>Hi Brad, </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows Updates usually provide an updated version of your drivers. You can also manually check for available update for your drivers from the Device Manager.</span> Kindly follow the steps below to check it:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the <strong>Start menu</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Look for <strong>Keyboards</strong> and expand the drop-down arrow beside it.</li><li>Right-click on your keyboard drivers, then choose <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click the<strong> Driver</strong> tab, and choose <strong>Update Driver, </strong>
then click<strong> OK</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, if updating it from the Device Manager did not resolve the issue, we suggest checking your manufacturer's website as they have the latest drivers for your keyboard. You can also contact them for further assistance about downloading and installing
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need anything else.</p>
<p>

    <title>In Event Viewer is there a way to see Destination Path Too Long - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glitterb0mb  say:</h3>
<h2>            In Event Viewer is there a way to see Destination Path Too Long</h2>
                    I want to know if there is a way, in Event Viewer, to see the list of files with names that are too long. &nbsp;I am writing down each one that needs changing, but a log file that I could print out would be much faster. &nbsp;If I had CUT/pasted, then the lengthy
 named files would remain, but this is a copy. &nbsp;So I have to go back and find them one by one. &nbsp;Not having to write them all down would just make it faster.

<div>Thanks!</div>

                    <p>When I go to cast an image onto my TV it doesn't show up the right size. When I use the same image on my windows 8 laptop it shows up on the TV perfect. Is there a setting that I am missing in the "cast to" section?</p>

            <p>That didn't work. I am having the issue with all the images. Currently it now says device not working properly and I can't even get the image up. This feature works perfectly fine with my laptop running windows 7.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Cannot access account, SMS code doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t arrive</h2>
                    
<p>So I have two step authentication enabled, and I want to at least look at my account's region. Account.live.com asks for the last 4 digits of my phone number which I provide correctly, and it then says that it sent an SMS message to that number, which never
 arrives. I tried like 10 times, and I've hit this problem before in the past.</p>
<p>I have no problems with receiving SMS from all other places, a positive balance with my GSM operator.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me fix this somehow?</p>

<p>I chatted with support and looks like they cannot change the two step auth, I've started a process to change two step auth from the phone number to backup email, and this will take a whole month.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>

<h3> vikkidavis1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update 1709 and missing built-ins from start menu</h2>
                    <p>Good day everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stating the obvious, this update comes with irritations.&nbsp; I would like to know if there's a fix to the missing built-ins that were previously there when I installed Windows 10 long ago.&nbsp; I know it's trivial in the big picture, but I've become accustomed
 to having them at fingertip and would really appreciate having them back.&nbsp; In short, the built ins are, MSN News app, MSN Weather app, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection.&nbsp; Now, having said this, my attempts to fix this were going into the new apps &amp; features
 setting, seeing that Microsoft Solitaire Collection is there, but not displaying in the start menu.&nbsp; I uninstalled it, and reinstalled it from the store and while it did appear in start for a short while, it did not remain and I was unable to open it.</p>
<p>I was unable to find MSN News and MSN Weather in apps &amp; features, but checking for them in the store, it said I had them already downloaded.&nbsp; I did have a chat with Microsoft last night, who remotely accessed my desktop, applied some kind of fix, but in
 the end, it was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated, I know these are small things, but it would be nice to have them back.&nbsp; I am able to access them the long way around, through the store, but having them pinned to start again would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>V.</p>

<p>Hi V.,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corrupted system files is one of the possible reasons why you're having issues after installing the updates. To help you in resolving this, I would highly suggest that you
<strong>perform a repair upgrade</strong>. It is a process of installing Windows 10 over the existing installation of Windows 10 on your hard disk, using your installation DVD or ISO file. To do a
<strong>repair upgrade</strong>, you may check this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">Forum
 Article</a></strong> provided by <strong>Andre Da Costa</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Hi Julie and thanks for trying to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night, I did a system scan with the intent of looking for corrupted files and came back with a clean bill of health.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to an installation DVD, (and forgive me if I'm not understanding....non-tech person here) I took advantage of the free Windows 10 upgrade more than 2 years ago and as such, did not have installation materials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a little alarmed at the thought of having to go to this extreme.&nbsp; What I would like to attempt first, is something&nbsp;with my&nbsp;email and app accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;On my&nbsp;account page&nbsp;there's "Accounts&nbsp;using other apps" and that&nbsp;is my microsoft account.&nbsp; There doesn't
 seem to be a straightforward way to delete that account and then re-add it.&nbsp; It would seem I have to go through my Microsoft account, tell them why I'm deleting it etc. etc.&nbsp; It's been suggested to me that deleting my account name then re-entering it might
 be of assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have tried other things that may help in determining the problem.&nbsp; I've done a windows store apps troubleshooting&nbsp;which resulted&nbsp;in a couple of things popping up.&nbsp; One message was NET HELP MSG 2182, another was &nbsp;"Hanging or Crashing Apps" and&nbsp;a third was
 "Service Registration missing or corrupt".&nbsp; May I assume that since the scan showed no corrupt files, that possibility could be eliminated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Vikki</p>

<p>Vikki, performing a repair upgrade can repair&nbsp;broken operating system files while preserving your personal files, settings and installed applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you mentioned that you were able to upgrade Windows 10 for free, you are now entitled of a digital license which means that you can activate Windows 10 that doesn't require you to enter a product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To find the activation method that works with your copy of Windows 10, you can check this article:

<p>Hi Julie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well....................after a really long day of doing a repair upgrade, the same problem exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app for Microsoft Solitaire Collection says it's installed.&nbsp; It's not.&nbsp; I've removed it and installed it so many times,
</p>
<p>and nothing is resolved.&nbsp; I'm really glad I did this on my desktop and see the results because I have the same</p>
<p>problem on my brand new 1 month old laptop, which occurred as well right after the 1709 update windows installed.</p>
<p>I won't be putting my laptop through a day like today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what else to tell you, except that those 3 apps, MSN News, MSN Weather and Microsoft Solitaire Collection, no longer</p>
<p>will install.&nbsp; I've seen other people sharing this as well in Microsoft community.&nbsp; 1709 update is a windows feature update and (I know you know this), but it's difficult to navigate the new apps &amp; features in settings.&nbsp; It is extremely difficult to scroll
 through them, they get&nbsp;blocked out, then you wait for it to clear, scroll &amp; wait, scroll &amp; wait.&nbsp; I can't say&nbsp;1709 is the problem, but certainly this is when the problem began, for both my devices.&nbsp; I've installed several other&nbsp;apps from the Store in the last
 couple of days, and no problem with them at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just did a troubleshoot of Microsoft Store and there was an issue that was fixed.&nbsp; Something about licensing.</p>
<p>After that, I tried downloading Microsoft Solitaire and behold, there it was on the start page.&nbsp; As well, I did MSN News and it too showed up on the start page.&nbsp; When I tried opening them, the app itself did not open, what opened was Microsoft Store Download
 and Update page.</p>
<p>More and more curious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update January 25, clicked on Microsoft Solitaire &amp; Msn News today and except for being pinned to start, they had disappeared overnight.&nbsp; Didn't even open the Download &amp; Update page in Microsoft Store&nbsp;like it did yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Another update January 25..............received and installed the Windows 1709 fix updates today.&nbsp; Hoped they would solve the problem but still can't download those 3 apps from the Store.&nbsp; Have done a recurring troubleshoot of windows apps and it comes back
 with the same error, "cache or license corrupt" then proceeds to fix it, so it says.&nbsp; Nothing changes with the apps, so I troubleshoot again and always get the same message about cache or license corrupt.&nbsp; It never seems to fix it permanently.&nbsp; Just thought
 I'd let you know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If nothing can be done, would you please tell me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Vikki</p>

<p>With that, I would suggest that you reset Windows Store Cache. To do do, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Close Windows Store app, if it's running.</li><li>In the Start menu, type <strong>WSReset</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on WSReset and then, click Run as administrator option.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> button when you see the <strong>User Account Confirmation</strong> box.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, try logging out of your Microsoft account and login after restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do update us with the results.</p>

<p>Hi Julie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp; Earlier today, I had tried WSReset&nbsp; with no results.</p>
<p>Tried it again just now, same thing.&nbsp; I then logged out of my Microsoft account and logged back in after restarting to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a quick question?&nbsp; Under Programs &amp; Features in the control panel, I see all programs there except for the ones I've downloaded from the store.&nbsp; Should they be there, or will they only show up in the "apps &amp; features" setting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry this is such a problem.&nbsp; I've done things to my computer lately, that I've never dreamed of.&nbsp; Checking &amp; trying all the suggestions I find in the community etc.&nbsp; I had such high hopes for the fix that came through a couple of days ago, but maybe
 it won't ever be resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know what else I can do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Vikki</p>

<p>Yes, everything that is downloaded from the Microsoft Store should appear in the Apps &amp; features.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's get through these steps and see which one works for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing that we can do is to restore any missing application using the Settings app to repair or reset the application.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Open Settings &gt; Click on Apps &gt; Click on Apps &amp; features &gt; Select the application with problem &gt; Click the Advanced options link &gt; Click the Repair button &gt; (if the option is not available, click the Reset button). This will delete the app's data along
 with settings and preferences.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>After completing the steps, the app should appear in the App list and pinned in the Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, reinstall missing application.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Open Settings &gt; Click on Apps &gt; Click on Apps &amp; features &gt; Select the application with problem &gt; Click the Uninstall button to confirm &gt; Open the Store &gt; Search for the app you just uninstalled &gt; Click Get button to reinstall.</li></ul>

<p>If you don't mind me asking this Vikki, can you share me the link or thread where you got the PowerShell command? Have you tried the steps I provided you on how you can restore missing application using the Settings app to repair or reset the application?</p>

<p>I don't mind you asking&nbsp; Julie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have tried every step you provided me with more than once and when that didn't work, I looked for more options.&nbsp; I'm desperate to try anything.&nbsp; A www.intowindows.com website about how to reinstall store and other preinstalled apps in Windows 10 was
 where I heard about it.&nbsp; Please forgive me if I overstepped my bounds looking here, but I don't know what else to do.&nbsp; It's been weeks and I've done everything you suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone into the apps &amp; features, done multiple resets, multiple uninstalls &amp; installs, and nothing seems to fix this.&nbsp; I've done Powershell to find corrupt files, more than once, and I don't have any.&nbsp; I've done the Powershell repair as you suggested
 and it was successful but still no fix.&nbsp; 1 game Microsoft Solitaire Collection, 2 apps MSN News and MSN Weather.&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sticking with me Julie, maybe eventually we'll figure it out.</p>

<p>Sure Mark_N13.</p>
<p>After logging in with username and password I get this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1940cb2-7b52-42ab-b238-bed8b62d93fc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1940cb2-7b52-42ab-b238-bed8b62d93fc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I changed this email and phone number on my Skype many years ago. Here a screenshot from my Android Skype to see what I mean:</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/9b12ccff-b9c7-4947-afde-56770b29fdf9" title="ChristophEckert1">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing the screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since neither the email nor mobile number shown on the options to send the code is accessible, you may try the last option where it says "I don't have these anymore".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is, you will be asked to provide an email on where you can be contacted to provide you instructions on how to proceed with the account verification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try the last option and wait for a response via email within 24 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will wait for your response once you have received an email response from the account verification.</p>

<p>Other option,download the HD MS-DOS&nbsp; utility,install to cd,once done,on pc start-up,enter BIOS,set pc to boot to cd 1st boot priority HD 2nd,exit BIOS,run HD DOS utility,delete partition..</p>
<p>One problem,if Win 7 has a different letter than its default&nbsp; C:&nbsp; you can not change it,&amp; no updates will work as Windows looks for&nbsp; C:&nbsp; letter only..Best bet,in DOS HD utility,delete all &amp; start from scratch...And youre right, "Can not Fix" ...As it is

<h2>            Office 2013 RT Full Unlock&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a Surface w/ RT on Friday and I was told that it has a preview of Office 2013 and would be able to get the full version as well for free. I have updated my Surface and I still cannot seem to find out how to unlock the full version. Can anyone
 help me out with this? Would really like to use Word 2013 and Excel. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks ,</p>

<p><span>What AV/AM/AS software are you using (name, version)?&nbsp; Have you received any messages from them indicating an infection
 or an aborted attempt at infection?&nbsp; This could be the work of malware of some kind &nbsp;(but we'll do a good check and make sure your system is CLEAN before trying to resolve anything else). &nbsp;Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and
</span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></a><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time).<span>&nbsp;
</span>You may also want to try the free Avira at: </span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></a><span> and Avast at:
</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may also want to try the free OneCare at
</span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a><span> and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good
 maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).<br />
<br />
Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time <strong>
BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. If you have a restore point before the problem began, this option stands the highest chance of successfully resolving the problem.&nbsp; Have you installed anything
 new recently (hardware or software or update) and do you know if the problem started shortly after doing so?&nbsp; if so, what was installled (name, version, make, model, number, whatever needed to identify it)?&nbsp; System restore may undo some or most of those installations
 (at least the software) so we'll need to be careful reinstalling those items so as not to bring back the problem without knowing what exactly is causing the problem (so we can deal with it specifically).<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make
 the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted,
 push any key to boot from the CD.&nbsp; Startup isn't really your problem, but it checks other files and may resolve the problem which might be related to something happening at startup (or not happening at startup).<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a><span>&nbsp;along with burning software like:
</span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</a><span>&nbsp;and, of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).&nbsp; You can't just open CBS.Log, you need to use the procedure in the above link.<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It may require you to reboot if it says it will only&nbsp;run at the next startup.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential
 cause. I'd like to check your hard drive more thoroughly.&nbsp; To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:
</span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.
<span>
You can also test your RAM at </span><span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></a><span>.&nbsp; If it fails,
 test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning shutdown (Start
 / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>.
</span></span></p>
<div>
<p><span><br />
Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also
 conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (it wouldm't hurt to check all devices for updated drivers but that's a lot of work and probably isn't necessary but do as many as you have
 time to do - it may help in ways other than just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></a><span>.
 (Please do that now before you forget later,) &nbsp;Proceed as follows to get the drivers:
</span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Once you have the drivers, you can install
 them through Device Manager as follows: </span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span><br />
Let's try a clean boot to see if some 3rd party application is causing the problem.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><span>.&nbsp; If things run smoothly with the clean boot then
 it's a process of elimination to identify the culprit respoinsible for the problem by following the procedures in the above link - but we'll KNOW we have it nailed and it's only a matter of time before we find the source (then we can decide what to do about
 it - uninstall it or try to find a fix so it can continue to work).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE - and if we get to this point you should try HARD to find one since the next step will probably be
 a clean install and neither of us want to do that unless it's the only remaining option).&nbsp; It can't be an OEM Recovery Disk or Installation Disk - it must be the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Although this will not affect your data,
 settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had
 to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed&nbsp; (so they can't be uninstalled) and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></span>

<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-desktop/windows-explorer-crashes-on-right-click/719385e6-fff5-498d-807c-103bf0344f44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-desktop/windows-explorer-crashes-on-right-click/719385e6-fff5-498d-807c-103bf0344f44</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To stop the crashes you could try, as in that thread, disabling the SecuROM context menu for Explorer using ShellExView.</p>
<p>The following link has some info on bad context menu handlers and a link to download ShellExView:</p>
<p><a href="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/slowrightclick.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsxp.mvps.org/slowrightclick.htm</a></p>
<p>There could be other ways to fix the problem such as trying to obtain a fix from SecuROM:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.securom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.securom.com/</a></p>
<p>They may be able to provide you with an updated CmdLineExt.dll (the one now installed is dated Jun 11, 2008)&nbsp; or give instructions how to remove the SecuROM software.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>It is possible that the account logged in to the Skype application and on Skype for Web are two different accounts. Contacts are saved on Skype's servers, you can access them by logging in to your account across all supported platforms and devices.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype accounts were migrated to Microsoft October last year, although users with legacy accounts
<em>(Skype Name-created accounts</em>) still need to fully update their accounts to enjoy the benefits of a Microsoft account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the perks of having an updated account is that, you can sign in across Microsoft services and products by using either your Skype Name or your email address. You might have signed in to Skype using the associated email address of your account without
 fully updating it yet, which resulted in a newly created Skype account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to know if you have multiple accounts, please go to <strong><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong> and enter the email address and then click
<strong>Continue</strong>. After doing this, you'll be able to see all the active Skype accounts associated with your email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember to always sign in using the credentials you used to originally create the account. Check the
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10858/what-s-my-skype-name?q=skype+name" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype Name</a></strong> logged in to the application and make sure to sign in on Skype for Web using the same credentials.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>position of the external monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> francesco_moma  say:</h3>
<h2>            position of the external monitor</h2>
                    <p>hi&nbsp;, my today's question is: &nbsp;I connected an external montor (miniDVI to HDMI cable) to my beautiful surface pro</p>
<p>in charms Device I set up the SecondScreen-&gt;Extend.</p>
<p>my goal is to have the external monitor as&nbsp; 2' monitor and in the left position on my desk, while the surface display is the first screen and it is at its right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Microsoft decided that the relative position is the opposite, therefore if the surface is the first screen, then the external monitor is supposed to be located at its right. The problem is that to pass the mouse pointer to the second screen I have to
 go in the opposite direction of the surface, which makes me unconfortable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way to do it is to set the surface as the second screen and the external one as a first screen, but then the start screen, which is to be managed with touch gesture,&nbsp;will be&nbsp;on the external one that is not touch... hope is clear what&nbsp;I ask.... I
 think there must be somewhere something about it....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So is there a way to invert the default position&nbsp;for them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>thank you, but this doesn't work. It'll end up swapping the start screen, which will go to the external monitor, which is not touch anyway and the mouse must still go&nbsp;to the left part of the external monitor to pass to the surface, which is located&nbsp; the
 right side.</p>
<p>The only solution is the physical solution, which is change the desktop disposition of the surface and the external monitor. It seems quite weird to me there is no other way.</p>

            <p>Truthfully - it is not the computer that is not letting the device work.&nbsp; It is the device that is not working with the computer, more than likely.</p>
<p>Unfortunately - for you - it looks like the support for this device is non-existent - perhaps it is already a legacy product.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=116434&amp;page=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=116434&amp;page=19</a></p>
<p>For a while, this worked:<br />
<a href="http://www.literatireader.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.literatireader.com/</a></p>
<p>But that's gone now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In gerneral - it is supposedly compatible:<br />

<p>But I cannot find much proof that the device exists in accordance with the original manufacturer - and thus - no support.</p>

            No the device now activates a Not Recognized Hardware error so I think I will exchange the unit. On the bright side I have good news for you. I found the User Manual. The company that now handles the after market products and services is: MerchSource and
 the Liberati manual is available at mscustomercare.com. I was about to give up when I finally clicked on a Google provided link to a Michigan tax form for MerchSource concerning the Liberati. Boy was I glad to see that!!!! Thought you guys could use the info.
 Please share this information. Thanks for all of your help. Ms Dale Gallaway
