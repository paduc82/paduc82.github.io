    <title>Annoying noise - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Annoying noise</h2>
                    <p>I've just upgraded to Windows 10, and now I find that when the computer goes to sleep (either because I've stopped using it for a while&nbsp;or because I put it in Sleep mode), it makes 3-note burp about every 2 seconds and doesn't stop after a length of time
 beyond which I frustratedly wake it up to either turn off entirely or put the sound on Mute.&nbsp; I can't find any named&nbsp;application&nbsp;in the Sounds menu that seems to be relevant, to turn it off.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to stop this sound without setting speakers
 to Mute?&nbsp; Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, after waking the&nbsp;PC up from Sleep, I sometimes find the open document windows have shrunk to a couple of inches square and have to resize them. Another hassle is that my desktop icons now have a habit of migrating; the old "My Computer" icon has happily
 lived in the top left-hand corner of my desktop for many years, and now sometimes when I turn on the computer,&nbsp;I find&nbsp;"This PC"&nbsp;there but for example this morning it showed up&nbsp;in the 4th column from the left, 3 icons down (hidden, of course, behind several
 open documents).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Xbox One &#40;fan&#63;&#41; Noise - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mathy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One &#40;fan&#63;&#41; Noise</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I know there have been quite a few complaints about weird noises coming from the Xbox One. And although the noise I'm having sound the same, it still is different than with other situations.</p>
<p>First of all, with most people this only happens with the Kinectless version of the Xbox One, but I have the Kinect plugged in and it's still making that noise.</p>
<p>Secondly, for most people the sound stops when playing games, but when I play a game on disc, the sound is horrible and distracting. When playing a digital game, the sound is basically the same as on the dashboard or in an app.</p>
<p>When the Xbox One is in stand by mode, the sound is constant, while the sound I'm hearing when the console is on is more like crackling noises with pauzes in between them.</p>
<p>I've made 2 videos. One with Kinect plugged in and one with Kinect unplugged. You can view them&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LHLPut79l0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/5LHLPut79l0?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/5LHLPut79l0?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>&nbsp;<span>[1]&nbsp;</span></strong>and&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJWfynRg54w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/HJWfynRg54w?fs=1"></param><param n
<p>I'm aware the noise doesn't sound as bad as it actually is in the video, but that's because I started Forza which is a digital game. Dead Rising 3, which is a game I have on disc is basically unplayable because of the noise. I've also heard from friends
 that their X1 is whisper quiet and mine definitely isn't.</p>
<p>Could it be that I really have something wrong with my fan? It's as if it's hitting something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going to talk to Microsoft chat anyway, but I wanted to hear your opinions on my problem. Sorry for possible grammatical mistakes. Thanks in advance!</p>

    <title>SAFETY ISSUE&#58; shut down surface pro powers itself up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardgatethorn  say:</h3>
<h2>            SAFETY ISSUE&#58; shut down surface pro powers itself up</h2>
                    <p>After using Shut Down on my Surface Pro, the computer shuts down correctly (definitely not&nbsp;entering Sleep or Hibernate mode). Then, some time later,&nbsp;I'll hear the cooling fan&nbsp;and discover that the Surface Pro is powered up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update is set to automatically download and install all updates. And the Update History shows all download installs are&nbsp;Successful.</p>
<p>I've also verified my Surface Pro isn't entering Sleep or Hibernate, by attempting a Shut Down with an open file in textpad - which triggers a shutdown warning - as well as observing that the "Shutting Down" message is displayed while the computer shuts
 itself down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Shut Down, the Surface Pro is left&nbsp;with it's charger attached and Type Cover closed. Could it be an overcharging battery 'waking' the Surface Pro in order to cut in the cooling fan. Unlike older PCs, I doubt the Surface Pro ever totally shuts down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wider research suggests there may be a firmware issue, but, despite a lot of messages relating to the Surface Pro starting itself up&nbsp;without human interference,&nbsp;I can't find a resolution - just talk about some firmware updates with no download links nor
 any reference to the Update's code number (so no way to check if I have the pertinent update) - and Microsoft's help desk weren't able to advise either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the Microsoft Type Cover' which can, if opened/closed, be configured to&nbsp;use a magnetic switch to 'wake up' a Surface Pro that's in Sleep or Hibernate, but shouldn't cause a Power Up after a full Shut Down. That said, with the rapid startup of
 the solid state systems of the Surface Pro, there may be little difference between Sleep, Hibernate, and Shut Down, as versus older DOS based machines.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Pro has its&nbsp;'Settings' to configured to "do nothing" when opening/closing/attaching the Type Cover. This had no effect in preventing random self-start ups. More recently I've gone into the Device Manager, and unchecked the "Allow this device to
 wake computer" checkbox under the Keyboard&gt;HID Keyboard Power tab. This may work but, as the issue is sporadic, it'll take a while before knowing anything for certain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an important safety concern. Anyone from Microsoft got a resolution?? </p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Greetings&nbsp;richardgatethorn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about your experience with your Surface Pro. I'm curious to see if your Surface will power on by itself if you remove the cover. Also, do you still experience the same issue if you open Power Management and restore defaults (i.e setting Close
 Lid back to the default setting)?</p>

            <p>I too am having this problem with the Pro 3.&nbsp; I have all updates loaded, no cover, no keyboard, nothing.&nbsp; Just a bare tablet which I turn off with the power setting.&nbsp; It is most certainly being turned off completely.&nbsp; Place it down and invariably it starts
 up again.&nbsp; Sometimes it starts after a few minutes sometimes after a few hours.&nbsp; No rhyme nor reason as to why it is doing it.</p>
<p>

            I have not reset the power settings back to the defaults.&nbsp; This is going to be used as a field tablet which is controlling a UAV.&nbsp; The tablet cannot go to sleep or power down while it is being used so all automatic sleep and shut down settings are set
 to "never".&nbsp; We cannot use the default settings.&nbsp; Our fear is that the tablet will power itself on during travel and when we arrive at our destination the batteries will be dead.&nbsp; And since the pro 3 has no DC power input (Which is ridiculous since it is supposed
 to be portable, its portability is only to the next ac power outlet) we will be in trouble in the field.&nbsp; Speaking of which does anyone know why Microsoft chose not to add DC power to the Pro3?&nbsp; We are now thinking that the Pro 3 was a poor purchase for the
 field since it has limited portability with no DC power input.&nbsp; Cannot charge it in your car, with an external battery, or a solar panel.<br />

<h2>            Enabling drag and drop without disabling User Account Control&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm using version 1.5 of Adobe Audition which is an old program now, but it runs fine on Windows 8 aside from one thing - I can't drag and drop audio files into the program.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I disable UAC by setting the EnableLUA registry key to 0, drag and drop works in Audition, but obviously Metro apps won't work.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I run Audition as administrator with UAC enabled, drag and drop still does not work.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So how can I fix this?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi. Sadly not. I have tried running Audition in compatibility mode - and I tried each of the various compatibility options - but that didn't help unfortunately.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One thing I have not tried yet is installing Audition outside of the Program Files/Program Files (x86) folders. I read somewhere that that fixes the issue as only software installed in those folders is monitored by UAC in a way that prevents drag and drop
 from working, but I don't know if that's true. I haven't needed to use Audition for a while, so I'm yet to try it, but if you try it and it works then please post back and let me know. Likewise if you find another solution that works.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks. :)</p>

            Hi Guys,
<div><br />
<div>I probably have a better solution for you, not tested but might work so give it a try and let me know, I have the same issue with different software so I guess it will work for you too with Audition or any other software.</div>
<div><br />
<div>First of all you need to set your explorer.exe to run as admin, you can do this by ending the task from task-manager or if you use an alternative task-manager there some better options like (process hacker) you force it to always start as admin integrity
 level.... this will allow you to drag and drop the files in any software without issue from explorer... otherwise you can use an alternative file explorer (there is tons of them) and you run it as admin (you set the shortcut to it to run always as admin in
 properties compatibility tab) and that's it, it should solve the problem...<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of a better option to solve this problem (who keep the UAC enabled) as it's very important for security of the system to keep it enabled, but as it turn to be a source of annoyance then it should be improved in such way that it doesn't interfere
 with normal human interaction but still block malwares from having the admin privilege... maybe if I can make a proof of concept I will patent it (I don't have the money for thisunfortunately) and send it to MS :P</div>

<h2>            Constants DeviceSetupManager 201, 202, &#38; 203 Warnings in Windows 10 Version 1803</h2>
                    In Windows 10 Version 1803, I am consistently getting Device Setup Manager 201, 202, and 203 warnings.&nbsp; A group of 4&nbsp;warnings (202, 200, 202, 201) will immediately follow the last 4.&nbsp; I'm not sure when these&nbsp;warnings started, but they been going on for
 a couple of weeks at least.&nbsp; There are so many of them that it completely fills the devicesetupmanager\admin file within a day or two and my Administrative Events log file is virtually useless because of the large number of superfluous devicesetupmanager warnings.&nbsp;
 I've searched for these warnings on Google, but there is nothing recent and no resolution for the problem, however, many people have experienced the same warnings.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

            When the Event IDs in the low 200s are found in the Diagnostics-Performance Operational file they indicate poor performance, but I am getting them from the DeviceSetupManager.&nbsp; I don't think they have the same meaning.<br />

<h2>            Laptop stuck in automatic repair loop after update</h2>
                    Last night, I shut down and update my computer (to finish installing the latest windows update). This morning, I turned my computer on to find that it would not start up and is stuck in an automatic repair loop. I can't start up in safe mode, &nbsp;and I keep
 getting the error message 0xc000021a. I googled the issue to find several others in the same situation, so I tried some of their repair methods. I've tried a system restore to to different points in time, both to no avail. I've tried force the start up without
 a drive signature, and all I get is the blue screen that says windows can't fix my issue, and the help pages are absolutely unhelpful. My laptop is less than a year old, and this isn't the first time I've had issues after a windows update. I do continual scans
 for viruses and as of last night, just before I shut down my computer, I had none. I have no way to back up my files and no USB or CD to reinstall windows. I'm a student. I can't afford a new laptop or costly repairs, s

            Hello Erin,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Based on the issue description I understand that you are facing no boot situation on the computer after installing the recent windows updates.</div>
<div>I can imagine how frustrating this could be.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To understand this issue better, I would like to have the following information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;Do you have the Windows 8 installation DVD?</div>
<div>2.&nbsp;Are you not able to boot the computer desktop screen?</div>
<div>3. When you say "I can't start up in safe mode," what happens when you try to start the computer in safe mode?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The&nbsp;error:0xc000021a occurs when a user-mode subsystem, such as WinLogon or the Client Server Run-Time Subsystem (CSRSS), has been fatally compromised and security can no longer be guaranteed. In response, the operating system switches to kernel mode.
 Microsoft Windows cannot run without WinLogon or CSRSS. Therefore, this is one of the few cases where the failure of a user-mode service can shut down the system time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I suggest you to disconnect all the external devices connected to the computer except keyboard and mouse and then try to boot the computer, if you are still unable to boot the computer to Desktop screen, you would require a Windows 8 installation DVD to
 perform Method 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Booting to Recovery Environment with Windows 8 installation media.</p>
<p>
</p><div>This is an alternate way to boot the PC and run recovery tools when something goes wrong with the Operating system.</div>
<div>Please follow the steps given below. Insert the Windows 8 installation DVD in the DVD ROM and restart your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD". Press any key.<br />
b) Select the correct time and Keyboard type. <br />
c) Click Repair your computer in the lower left corner.<br />
d) Select Troubleshoot from Choose an option screen.<br />
e) Click Advanced options in Troubleshoot screen.<br />
f) Click Automatic Repair from Advanced Options screen.<br />
g) Next, choose the operating system by clicking on its button.<br />
h) Windows 8 will then looks for problems on hard drive(s) and verify that all required files are intact.</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Perform System restore to an earlier point of time before the Windows updates got installed.</p>

            <p>1) You should not need to use the Analyze function besides it's fairly flawed anyway and will probably do more harm then good,</p>
<p>2) See 1</p>
<p>3) Fine Tune is supposed to be for Manual corrections,</p>
<p>If you want to use a fairly good feature use Auto Adjust instead of Analyze.</p>
<p>All of these fuctions only take a few seconds to complete,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Just an update to your questions:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>-<u>Analyze</u> is just a part of the process of cleaning up noise (unwanted image capture by-product) in photos. To reduce image noise, you&nbsp;will have to click Analyze, and then use the&nbsp;Reduce noise slider and adjust it&nbsp;and see the changes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>-The&nbsp;process&nbsp;will only take a few seconds. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>-There is no notification that the process is complete. Changes will automatically be reflected when you move the sliders to the desired position.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For more information, please refer to the link below:<br />

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Just what dissed said on his post, <u>auto adjust</u> is used to automatically edit a photo or a batch of photos while
<u>Fine tune</u> is used for manual editing.<br />

<h2>            word 2007 and pdf files&#63;</h2>
                    I just received a new Dell&nbsp; Inspiron laptop loaded with Windows 7. Now I cannot read any PDF files. Word 2007 is the default program related to pdf files on this computer. Why can't I read pdf files? When I open them they appear as code. I am taking on
 line college courses and this is a big deal to me. Can anybody tell me how to convert pdf files using Word 2007?

            Hi Terry,<br />
<br />
What could be happening is that you dont have an acrobat reader installed. If that is true then what i could suggest you to do is to go download it. Another thing that might be causing this problem is that the default program that is assigned to open your pdf
 files is Word 2007 instead of adobe acrobat reader. You may want to set&nbsp;adobe as the default program in opening pdf files. Try these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Select the file, right-click it.<br />
2. Select <strong>Open With.<br />
</strong>3. Choose adobe acrobat reader. (if it is not part of the list just click on Choose Program)<br />
4. Once you have selected acrobat reader. Tick the box that says Always use the selected program&nbsp;to open this kind of file, then click on OK<br />
<br />
Hope this works for you,<br />
<br />

    <title>cannot turn off jump list - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rohit r  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot turn off jump list</h2>
                    <p>I never liked jump lists. I would prefer to navigate to the folder. </p>
<p>When I turn off jump lists, the setting seems like like it&nbsp;takes the jump lists off all the apps.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>As soon as I&nbsp;open any folder, it starts to repopulate the jump list on the explorer. After I open any folder it gets onto the recent list, and it works fine as a recent list, but I turned off that feature. When I go back to the setting, it shows that jump
 lists are off, but still shows the recently opened folders/files&nbsp;when I right click on the explorer app. Toggling the setting resets the recent list but it repopulates the list as soon as I start to access any folders or files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please tell me how to turn off jump lists so it actually stops displaying recent folders/files?</p>

            This looks like it turns it off... But when I continue using my computer opening files it starts to populate the recent list with the recently opened files. The toggle is set to off when I right click on Explorer and shows recently opened files(populated
 with files opened since I turned it off). Other applications do not show recent list.&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Is the computer on a domain?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Does the issue occur only while using standard user account with
<b>User Account Control</b> at maximum?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>UAC (User Account Control) - Filevirtualization</span></b></p>
<p><span>The way it works is that when you try to write to a protected zone, such as Program Files, without prompting for administrator
 rights, you are redirected to a mirror location of the program files folder in the
<b>%userprofile%</b> under the folder name <b>VirtualStore</b>, where you have write access. This helps many legacy applications work properly without user intervention.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer the link and try to run the
<b>Fix it</b>.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Important</span></b><span>: This section,
 method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before
 you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. </span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to create a new user account and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Create a user profile.</span></b></p>

            <p>Hi SkyWalker,</p>
<p>In addition to Sandeep's post, it's possible there may be a corrupt system file.&nbsp; Let's also try doing an SFC/Scannow:</p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type <b>cmd</b> on the Start screen.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right-click on it and select
<b>Run as administrator.</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type the following command and press Enter:
</span><b><span>sfc /scannow</span></b></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi SkyWalker,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting in Microsoft Communities. From the problem description I understand that you are not able to play Call
 of Duty Black Ops 2. Provide the following information:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the complete error message?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is the issue confined to this game?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow these methods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> Uninstall and re-install the game. Follow
 these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press
<b>Windows + R</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type
<b>control panel</b> in <b>run</b> and press
<b>enter</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to
<b>programs</b>, <b>programs and features</b>. Uninstall the game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> Perform a clean boot to see if there is any
 software conflict as clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Clean boot for Windows 8:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>a. Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click the
<b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d. On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e. On the
<b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f. On the
<b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the<b> Task Manager window
</b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></span></p>
<p><span>g. Click
<b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b><span> Enable half
 of the services.<b><br />
</b>a.<b>
</b>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the <b>Service</b> list.<br />
d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 3:</span></b><span> Determine whether
 the problem returns.<b><br />
</b>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until
 you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 4:</span></b><span> Enable half
 of the Startup items<b>.<br />
</b>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 5:</span></b><span> Determine whether
 the problem returns.<b><br />
</b>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the<b> Startup
 Item</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the<b> Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps
 until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing
 the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b>
 check box in either step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 6:</span></b><span> Resolve the
 problem.<b><br />
</b>Once you determine that the startup item or the service that is causing the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved.
 Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps
 to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click<b>‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>‘Restart.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

            You appear to have some sort of InfraRed device on your notebook and it's asking for the driver for the USB bridge to this device.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Doing a Google search reveals: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=USB+2.0+IrDA+Bridge+&amp;rls=com.microsoft:*&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;startIndex=&amp;startPage=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
And a search of the Gateway website reveals your notebook to have Sigmatel AUDIO chipset:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.gateway.com/support/drivers/search.asp?ref=step&amp;st=browse&amp;platform=10022&amp;model=12215&amp;os=10954&amp;type" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.gateway.com/support/drivers/search.asp?ref=step&amp;st=browse&amp;platform=10022&amp;model=12215&amp;os=10954&amp;type</a>=<br />
<br />
So updating your audio drivers from the Gateway website may correct this issue.&nbsp;
