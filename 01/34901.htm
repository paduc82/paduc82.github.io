<h2>            Windows Firewall  and Security Center won&#39;t start, Error 1068 and 1079</h2>
                    <p>I can't start my <strong>Windows Firewall, Error: 1079</strong>.....&nbsp;or the <strong>
Security Center, Error: 1068</strong>. Can you help with this issue? When I try to access the dependencies tab I get this Error:&nbsp;
<strong>Win 32:</strong> The account specefied for this service is different from the account specefied for other services running in the same process.</p>
<p>I have checked to see if the dependencies were of the same account before I got the "Win 32" message, and
<strong>WMI Service</strong> is running in the same account (<strong>Local Service</strong>) as firewall and security center but the
<strong>RPC Service</strong> is running&nbsp;on the <strong>Network Service </strong>account and cannot be changed through services console because the account fields&nbsp;are in gray and can't be accessed or changed. I'm trying to avoid using the
<strong>"SubInACL" tool</strong> because I don't want to reset the entire registry.</p>
<p><strong>Please HELP!!!</strong></p>
<p>From other post:</p>
<p>I've been having an issue with getting the Windows Firewall and the Security Center to start. The services account permissions were changed at some point, including the depedencies. I'm getting errors 1079 on Windows&nbsp;Firewall and 1068 on the Security Center.
 Both are set on Local Service&nbsp;but the dependency, RPC is set on Network Service and cannot be changed because the user fields are in gray. I'm trying to avoid using the SubInACL.exe because I don't want to reset the entire registry. Can&nbsp;you help please?</p>
<p>No I'm not on a Domain. I connect through an open wireless "hotspot." My main issue is; I haven't a Firewall OR the Security Center. Neither will start. I get Error: 1068, on the Security Center and Error: 1079 on Windows Firewall. When I try to access the
 dependencies on either, I get this window:</p>
<p>&nbsp;WIN 32: The account specified for this service is different from the account specified for other services running in the same process.</p>
<p>About a month ago I made the mistake of trying ACDSee's brand of security, "ACDOne" which includes "BitDefender" software. This is when I lost my firewall and security center. BIG MISTAKE! I uninstalled it and deleted any files I could find that were left
 behind.</p>
<p>My Security Essentials and Windows Defender work fine. I'm stuck and need help with this Please! Please! Somebody....HELP!!</p>

<h2>            Windows Stopcode - auto repair and restart loop</h2>
                    <p>This has happened in the last 2 days. The only error information I get is to search Microsoft for stopcode error for a fix. However, I don' have any information about what caused the problem I don't believe there was any downloads/updates happening before
 it happened. The computer just froze in the middle of checking email. I am unable to access reboot or restore functions because it's in a loop o blue screen, repair tool,and restart. Anyone have any suggestions please?</p>

            After reinstalling XP did you download and install audio drivers?<br />
<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span>Download Drivers
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Go to the website of the manufacturer and select your model (this is usually done in the Support section). You should have the option to download drivers for your model if
 they have drivers for your Windows version. Download the driver(s) and follow the instructions to install - the process can vary with different manufacturers so I can't give you exact directions.

    <title>Can I delete the AppData Folder after computer reset&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I delete the AppData Folder after computer reset&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey Guys,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So recently my computer had start up issues and I got my whole pc reset, all the software is now removed, apart from the basics (google chrome, IE). The shop who reset my computer created a folder titled 'MyData' with all my previous computer files backed
 up, I now have saved all my work data onto an external harddrive, and currently work with these files using my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was checking through the recovered 'MyData' folder, and the 'AppData' folder within it consumes a huge amount of memory (1.1tb) as it contains all of the software data from prior to the reset, I was wondering since this computer is back to new, with no
 software installed,&nbsp; and I have saved my work files onto another hardrive, can I delete the AppData folder from the recovered 'MyData' folder?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance, and I hope this made sense.</p>

            You will be safe deleting this MyData folder as long as you are sure you have recovered all your personal files
<br />
<br />This folder can have nothing to do with your system and is therefore safe to delete
<br />
<br />The AppData folder is probably a backup of your previous application data folder . . .

            As Dave recommends, as long as your data is safe recovered, you can safely delete it. 
<br />
<br />I would just move it to the Recycle Bin temporarily, just in case you remember something is in there you might need.

<h2>            Xbox 360 slim automatically opens and beeps randomly. </h2>
                    
<p>So I bought the 360 slim when it first came out about 2-3 years ago, and it's been fine since, that being said when I turned it on 2 months ago it began to do the eject sound and open up, but it doesn't happen the once it happens all the time now i don't
 even think I can turn it on without my Xbox wanting to kill itself, now I've tried dusting it and all the things people have said to do and the problem still persists and it's driving me crazy, can someone please tell me what the hell's going on and how to
 fix the danm problem, and I know the Xbox one is out in November but I cant trade in a smashed up 360 lol =]&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>The problem might be within the sensors, as I know the Slim has a sort of 'touch' thing going on rather than actual buttons. I think the sensors on it are bad, they're thinking something is on it. That or you've got something obstructing the way making it
 actually like that. In all honestly, I would take the Xbox 360 and send it into Microsoft for repair if it's a very persistent problem.</p>

<p>Hey there Scotty,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you're having issues with your disc tray opening.<br />
<br />
You may want to check out the steps in our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/disc-drive/disc-drive-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Disc Drive Troubleshooter</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
Something that I've read has worked for folks in the past is to block the IR receiver on your console using a little bit of black electrical tape. It's possible there's an IR open command being sent maybe from a media remote or harmoney, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please let us know how things go.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#34;Cannot play games online over steam and Origin&#34; in Windows 8</h2>
                    Hello I am a gamer on a Windows desktop I recently upgraded to Windows 8 instead of using Windows 7 and I love it but I have a problem. You see since I am a gamer I like to use Steam and Origin for playing games but when I upgraded neither one of them
 would connect to internet witch is weird because I am using Ethernet connection. I find it also weird that I have to use the new Internet explorer and Mail that comes with Windows 8 to access anything on the internet. I do not know how to fix this problem
 but I would like some feedback.

            <p><span>Hi BelthAllusis,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Have you made any changes on your computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. Was it working fine earlier?<br />
3. Does the issue specific to any program?</span></p>
<p><span>4. Have you enabled Proxy connection on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow these steps
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method: - 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>Disabling Windows 8 Defender Using Services</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Launch the Start Menu and search for
<b>Services</b> under the<i> Settings tab</i> and click on <i>View local services</i> to launch Windows Services.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Look for the service name
<b>Windows Defender Service</b> and stop it by right-clicking it.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now double-click on the same service to open the Property window and select
<i>disable</i> in the Startup Type dropdown list and save the settings.</span></p>
<p><span>Now your Windows 8 defender will be disabled
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> - Once you have tried with the Troubleshooting steps
 please re-enable the Windows 8 defender </span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Check for the Proxy settings in your computer
</span></p>
<p><span>Internet Explorer from desktop will work with Proxy connection. But Modern Internet Explorer and Modern apps will not connect with Proxy enabled.
 Windows 8 Modern Interface apps will not work if you are working on a proxy network. I would suggest you to disable the proxy and then check how it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope this Helps and if any issues please reply
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            MIcrosoft points conversion rate to local currency dosent add up&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>hi, don't know where else to post this topic so ill just stick it here. (by the way, its a bit long winded, but bare with me please :)".)</p>
<p>ok, I live in Ireland. we use euro's over here. and ive just been trying to figure out how the whole Microsoft points to local currency change has affected buying items from the marketplace, and I noticed something a bit off.</p>
<p>so, I went onto&nbsp; xbox and was about to stick on bf3, but decided, because I have 100 MS points left, i'd try buy a new t-shirt for my avatar. so when I clicked on the item. I got this screen telling me my points are now in euro, and xbox was giving me €1.44
 (exchange rate I guess?? don't know for sure.)</p>
<p>€0.96 for the man on fire T. sounds reasonable. I was about to buy it, but my brother jumped in a party with me cos' he just downloaded Toy Soldiers (Arcade), and he said it was savage, you have to get it, blah blah blah, so instead of going to the marketplace
 to look for the game I used the laptop instead just to be quicker, and went to xbox.com, searched toy soldiers, and it says its available for £4.99 Sterling. So I did a quick currency conversion on the internet, and for £4.99 sterling you get €5.89 euro.</p>
<p>I then clicked on toy soldiers to buy it,(download to xbox),&nbsp;just to see if the rate was in any way similar, and then when the screen popped up to confirm the purchase,</p>
<p>I s#%t you not, buy for €7.19, including VAT.</p>
<p>Now, I don't know about anyone else, but does this seem a bit over priced for anyone using the euro, compared to someone in the uk using sterling!! ok, €1.30 dosen't seem a lot on the grand scale of things, but that's only an arcade game, what about something
 like bf3 premium??</p>
<p>well here's the rate for that:</p>
<p>used to be 4000 MS points. (you can still buy 4200 MS points in Argos, here in Ireland for €46.99).</p>
<p>£33.99 sterling. conversion: €40.14. xbox marketplace price in euro: €47.99 including VAT. €7.85 in the difference from the conversion rate of euro to sterling.</p>
<p>I mean, come on, were being ripped apart here if those are the differences im seeing on just a couple of items I looked at and converted to "LOCAL CURRENCY".</p>
<p>id love to hear any one elses opinions on this.</p>
<p>by the way, sorry if something like this has already been posted in this forum or elsewhere. I didn't really think about searching through the forums before I started typing (raging) :) thanks</p>

<p>Taxes, man. &nbsp;You pay taxes when you buy points, but not when you spend them. &nbsp;Now with the new system, you pay taxes when you spend money on the item itself. &nbsp;The taxes have to come out somewhere. &nbsp;It's always at the point of monetary exchange. &nbsp;Microsoft
 doesn't control taxes, sadly. &nbsp;It's all local merchant rules. &nbsp;I wish taxes were calculated in the catalogue prices so I could know at a glance how much it was going to add up to be, instead of getting to the point of purchase and only then finding out how
 much I'll need. &nbsp;Like when I try to buy a bottle of soda at the store with exact change, and I always forget to add the $0.05 deposit to the price.</p>

    <title>zinstall ShadowStorage resize error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> newfi  say:</h3>
<h2>            zinstall ShadowStorage resize error</h2>
                    I had Windows 7 RC installed and been using it for quite a while (I know I was not suppose to 'really' use it).&nbsp; I just&nbsp;bought a new drive and Windows 7 Ultimate.&nbsp;&nbsp; I removed the 7 RC drive from the PC and install Ultimate.&nbsp; I then replaced the RC drive
 into the PC as drive D: and ran zinstall to copy my data, applications and settings from the RC drive to the Ulitmate drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; zinstall goes all the way to 99% then an error box pops up saying "vssadmin resize ShadowStorage /For=E: /On=E: /MaxSize=5242675
 failed with exit_code 2 ...."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Error: Specified number is invalid"&nbsp; Drive E: turns out to be the 100MB System Reserved area on the drive that the RC was installed on.&nbsp; The number is invalid because resize requires a min MaxSize of 300MB.<br />
<br />
Any workaround for this?

            If Zinstall is not working correctly contact Zinstall customer support. It's not very likely many people here will be familiar with that program.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Updates does not only update Internet Explorer; it also updates other areas of the operating system to make them more secure. So to your question 'do I need windows updates' the answer is a resounding Yes you do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incidentally support for Windows XP ceases in 2014.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>To go back to a previous version of Windows, simply follow these steps:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong>Start Menu</strong> then select <strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt;
<strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>Recovery</strong>. The&nbsp;period you have to go back depends on&nbsp;what version of Windows 10 your PC is running after the upgrade. For example, if your PC is running Windows 10 Version 1511, you have&nbsp;one month to go back
 to&nbsp;a previous version. </span></li><li><span>If your PC is running Windows 10 Version 1607 or later, you have 10 days to go back. (To see what version of Windows 10 your PC is running after you upgrade, select the

<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">If going back isn't available,&nbsp;try restoring&nbsp;your PC to factory settings. This reinstalls the version of Windows that came with your PC and removes personal files, apps and drivers you installed,&nbsp;plus any changes you made to settings.

<p>Yes, you can, please note, you can't use the OEM COA Key for Windows 7 to download the ISO file from the Microsoft Software Download Page. It does not accept OEM keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: You need to download the install files for Windows 7 if you are reinstalling it on a system where it was previously installed. You can use the following resources:</p>

The Media you choose to install from will depend on certain factors, such as the Boot Scheme used by your computer (BIOS, UEFI) in addition to the storage device (hard disk partitioning layout). Examples of partitioning layout include MBR (BIOS) and GPT (UEFI). In this article, we show you several ways to create a bootable copy of Windows 10 from an ISO file. An ISO file is a digital replica of a virtual disc, which users will have to make bootable on a blank DVD, USB thumb drive or SD card.">How

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Step 3: Download any necessary drivers you might need for Windows 7 from the manufacturers website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Step 4: Perform a custom install - see the Windows 7 section of the following article how to do that:</p>

</p><p>Step 5: how find your product key and reactivate:</p>
<p><span>Windows 7 came preinstalled on my computer,&nbsp;</span><span>how do I find the product key?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;product key is usually located on the COA sticker attached to the bottom of your laptop or in the battery compartment. In some rare cases it can also be found in the memory compartment. For tower systems, look at the top or the side of the system
 unit.&nbsp;It looks like the following:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker is damaged or letters or not legible, you will have to consider the following options:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Use a digital camera to capture a picture of the COA then enlarge it on your computer.</li></ul>
<span>
<ul>
<li>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 installation.</li></ul>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Based on the description, it appears that you are facing issues with selecting restore hidden updates. I will be happy to help you with this issue.<br />
<br />

- What is the exact/complete error message you are receiving when trying to install updates?<br />
- Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1:</b> I would suggest you to run the Microsoft FIXIT from the link and check if it helps.<br />

<p>To do so: Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps
 carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in
 the Microsoft Knowledge Base: </p>
<p>322756 (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/) </p>

<p>Hi Quen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question. This could be that it was taken down from the Xbox. I was able to find it for google play or Windows 10.</p>
<p>We recommend trying uninstall and reinstall of your profile.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Update Denies Permission to Internal Drive</h2>
                    <p>System: Windows 10 Pro on a new computer, 1TB hard drive, 500GB SSD, Intel Core I7, not connected to a network</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows did an update on Jan 10 at 2:20pm. After the update I cannot save to the internal data drive from any program other than a Microsoft program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked all my permissions for all my folders and users and they all have complete access. Primary user, the account I log on to, is the owner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday did a Safe Mode restore to prior to the update and it worked. This morning the computer re-updated, problem came back and now I can't restore to fix problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife just called from her office and, after her computer updated, has exact same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's up?</p>

<p>Many thanks Darwin. Here's some more info:</p>
<p>
</p><p>WINVER: 1709 (OS Build 16299.125)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a windows update Wednesday using the Windows installer module and Windows created a system restore point just prior. On Thurs I tried to restore from that point but couldn't, instead getting this message:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eca9cb43-6dbb-470a-8fa2-ee3fe97604e2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eca9cb43-6dbb-470a-8fa2-ee3fe97604e2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I went in to Safe Mode and tried the system restore again and it worked... at least until this morning when I took the computer out of hibernate mode and Windows updated again. I tried once again to restore to the same point but now it doesn't restore correctly
 even in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can save successfully to the SSD C drive (programs drive), an external drive or on the D drive (data drive) but only if not in my user folder. Any save to my user folder gets one of 2 error messages. Here's the error message from a Photoshop save:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/865498e5-b36e-46a1-86e3-5b89e667e1b9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/865498e5-b36e-46a1-86e3-5b89e667e1b9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft programs (Excel, Word, Outlook, Notebook) can save no worries. The problem is with my non-Microsoft programs (AutoCAD 2018, Premiere, Photoshop, Audacity, etc.) all of which are new versions. I do have an old version of Cute PDF that I migrated
 over from a Windows 7 machine that works properly. Weird....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Saves in Safe Mode work as they should, problem only seems to be in Normal Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent 2.5 hours on the phone with a Microsoft Windows tech and he couldn't find the problem either. One thing that did work for awhile was creating a new User folder, moving everything from my old User folder to the new one, deleting the old folder and
 correctly renaming the new folder. At least for 2 hours, then the problem reappeared. I've now done the exercise again but won't be renaming the new folder to the old folder name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We checked and rechecked all the permissions, ownerships, folders, programs and drives and according to the tech everything seems correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that Microsoft prorams can save but non-Microsoft programs can't is a real head scratcher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must say that in 24 hours I've learned more about windows 10 Pro than I ever thought I'd need to know (smile).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. A little history: I originally created a new User folder with a different name, copied all my folders from my regular user folder to it and deleted my old user folder. I made sure everything was back to normal and then renamed the
 new folder to the old name. This worked for a few hours, then reverted back to the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I went through all the same steps again but, once working, I didn't rename the new folder to the old one's name. That has worked to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure it continues to work I paused updates for 1 month until hopefully Microsoft will figure out what's wrong. No telling what will happen then but for now it's back to normal, although I've fixed the symptom but haven't solved the problem.</p>

<p>We appreciate the prompt response. Could you confirm if you're able to perform a clean boot? If yes, did you encounter the same issue while you're in the clean boot environment? This is to identify any software conflict which may
 prevent your system from functioning properly.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply and thoughts. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was all caught up on Friday with my design work so I decided to turn auto updates back on and see what would happen.</p>
<p>After everything Microsoft updated I went ahead and updated the NVIDIA and Intel graphics drivers as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After everything updated all is as it should be with no problems, rock solid. I guess there's no sense doing a clean boot at this point but I'll keep your e-mail handy in case the problem should reoccur.</p>

<h2>            editing option in windows photo viewer</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I installed windows essentials 2012, and when I restarted my computer, and opened up a image - the editing options are all gone!<br />
<br />
The editing tools that I originally had, looked like this:<br />
http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2370417,00.asp<br />
<br />
does anyone know how I can get this back?<br />
what do I have to install to get all these photo editng tools back?<br />
<br />
the version I have now is an old one with no options to edit.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Many people are reporting the inability to download Insider build 18875 and it looks like your case is similar as well.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            Hi Tersis
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed. 
<br />
<br />Try this additional tips to see if they work:

 the methods Microsoft had gave us but nothing work to fix this issue? Windows 10 Insider Preview 18875.1000 (rs_prerelease) (6)&nbsp;&nbsp;Last failed install attempt on ‎4/‎12/‎2019 - 0x80242016 [nothing worked to fix this issue :c I've been having computer issues
 since I've tried to fix the issue : such as slow performance,programs crash for no reason when they shouldn't,settings is slow and sometimes unresponsive,and the startup speed has been affected[its now slow and no apps are running during boot up to cause this,i
 really don't really want to do reinstall,but if that is the case,is there a way to save my files and maybe apps,and one last thing,i can get into safe mode etc...but my computer has been acting this way since day yesterday.OS Version : Windows 10 professional

<p><strong>Detailed Description </strong>about new driver<br />
WARNING: Failure to read the below may result in system instability</p>
<p>
</p><p>These new drivers labeled as either UWD (Universal Windows Driver) or Windows Modern graphics drivers aren't backward compatible with our previous graphics drivers we are now labeling Legacy.</p>
<p>This means if later you want to revert to a Legacy driver you will need to uninstall the driver via Windows Apps and Features and reboot the system before installing a Legacy driver.</p>
<p>Failure to do so may result in minor to major system instability.</p>
<p>DO NOT use the INF / Have-Disk method to install or uninstall this driver as it bypasses the Intel installer designed to install these new drivers, thereby possibly resulting in minor to major system instability.

    <title>Xbox One S crashing during multiple games and users - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bonzadams  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One S crashing during multiple games and users</h2>
                    My son has his own Gold account and plays on an Xbox One S.&nbsp; He started getting game crashes back the the home screen while playing Fortnite (digital game).&nbsp; We then tried a disc game (Rocket League) with the same result.&nbsp; We did all the reboot stuff with
 no change.&nbsp; I logged in with my account and had the same results. Other things like Mixer and U-Tube all work fine for hours at a time.&nbsp; I have an older non "S" Xbox that he used with no problems or crashes that works for hours.&nbsp; I haven't had any problems
 on my non "S" Xbox.&nbsp; I'm guessing that the problem is related to the console being an "S" model.&nbsp; Could others comment on their problems of crashing back to the home screen being on any model other than an "S".

Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button to open the guide.</li><li>
Select&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>. </li><li>

            It's not on launch.&nbsp; It happens anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes AFTER the game has been playing.&nbsp; It's both digital and disc.&nbsp; And it's different users.&nbsp; I've done several resets.&nbsp; I have 2 older Xbox Ones that are not having this problem only the "S" model.<br />

            Not sure exactly what you are asking but sitting flat on a dresser.&nbsp; If you are thinking heat, I have too, but its been in the same spot for at least a year and I've been streaming on Mixer for 5 plus hours just to test it.<br />

<p>Hello Bonzadams,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Forum support!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do recommend the <strong>Soft Reset </strong>as posted above by <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Ezra</span></span>,</strong> but if that does not resolve the issue then I recommend a full console reset. That
 will help to resynch the data and information listed in the console and set it to a default.

            I'm glad someone step up! I'm having the same trouble with my Xbox one S. It's very frustrating having this problem for 2 weeks straight. I tried everything, restarting my console, removing my account, and even changed my wifi cable.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything changed in the year since this machine has been located there? Any additional devices plugged in to the mains?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is this console connected to the power? Xbox consoles are suseptable to power issues.&nbsp; If it is connected to faulty power strip or a surge protector, this can cause console instability. Idealy the console should connected directly to the mains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is power, then it's likely streaming video won't cause a crash as the console won't draw as much power as it does when gaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a similar problem with an original Xbox One. Playing video was fine, but games would crash. Had a replacement, same problem. On the third replacement, I plugged it directly into the mains, no more crashes.</p>
        </p>

<p>I'm sorry about your issues here, but there isn't going to be a way of fixing it yourself.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've already tried resetting the console to factory and have the machine plugged into the mains directly, it's likely either a fault with the internal console hardware (such as CPU/GPU, motherboard or internal power supply) or a problem with the
 internal hard drive.&nbsp; None of which is user replaceable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're next option is to raise a repair request to have the machine repaired by Microsoft.</p>

<p>Thanks again for all the help.&nbsp; Just in case any info that I can give may help me or others: The Xbox itself is not crashing it's just the game.&nbsp; The game hangs and you can still "quit" the game and then start anything else (including the game that just
 crashed). When it hung/crashed I could still hear the music that was playing in the game as it hung all the way until I quit the game.&nbsp; I let it sit for a minute or so just to see it it would correct the problem with no luck.&nbsp; Just because others had mentioned
 power I even unplugged the USB that was charging the controller.&nbsp; Still crashed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obsessive Power thanks for the help.&nbsp; I'm holding out that it's a patch/update fix because I've seen lots of others having the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a pole to the others that are having the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Is it only on the "S" model that is having the problem?&nbsp; I have 1 "S" and 2 original Xbox One and only the "S" is having the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) When did the problem start? Mine started about a week ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Has anyone found a fix?</p>
