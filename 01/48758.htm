<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade from Windows 7 Ultimate</h2>
                    <p>I have downloaded and tried to install Windows 10 on my desktop several times. The "copying files" goes on for some time and when complete the system reboots. After reboot, the system thinks for a while and then reboots again. After a couple of seconds,
 I get the message "Attempting to recover installation" and then quickly goes to "Restoring your previous version of Windows." After the restoration process back to Win 7 I checked the update status and it indicates Error Details: Code 80242014 and then Windows
 Update Error 0x80070057, followed by "2015-08-01-T-07_59_40P. Looking at some of the help information it was suggested I try to download to an iso file and try to install from that. I enter in the required parameters and click Ok. I then get the very informational
 message that "Something happened" followed by 0x800704DD-0x90016. Can anyone please assist me with this issue? I sure would appreciate anyone who can!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the possible causes for this issue, please verify the following information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you experiencing the same issue with other executable files?</li><li>Are you getting the same error message when you open the executable file on a different PC?</li><li>Have you tried performing a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong> before opening the executable file?</li></ul>
<p>It is possible that an installed software is causing the issue. A <strong>clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            how to copy user account from windows 7 PC to windows 10 PC via LAN&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have set up a Windows 10 PC and now want to move a user account from another PC running Windows 7 to the new PC over the LAN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is permissions. How do I have to set up folder sharing on the source and/or the destination PC so that I can copy all files from one to the other?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to copy the content of c:\users\accountname, but I am not sure if everything is copied. Actually, it looks like AppData is not copied. This is an essential folder, as it contains all settings and all the mail folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a tool or a best practice how to move users from one PC to another?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Actually, it does seem to copy AppData. It's strange: It completed the copy of everything else, then it says there are 0 more files to copy, and 0 bytes, but it continues copying megabyte after megabyte.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, am I doing it right? Is there a better or more correct way?</p>

            <p>Hello Bernd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me confirm that there is no possibility of sharing User Profiles from one computer to another computer. Coping User Profile folders to different computer is completely different from moving User Profiles. As you said about App data, some other registry
 words/keys, data folder that are related User Profile are completely dependent. The same cannot be transfered to different computer installed with either same version or different version of windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, to share files with people in your homegroup, workgroup, or domain, select the file or folder you want to share, go to the<strong> Share</strong> tab, and check out the options in the
<strong>Share with</strong> section. The options that show up there depend on what type of network your PC is connected to.</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>

            <p>I moved a user to new Windows computers a few times in the past, and each time it was a huge amount of manual work. This is not acceptable in my view - Computers exist to automate work, not to add manual work. Thus my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know anything about profiles. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want is this: When a user switches to a new computer, the experience should be as similar to the old computer as possible. Things like mouse cursors and wallpaper are nice to have. Things like mail folders are an absolute must. Application settings
 are a must. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that possible?</p>

            <p>Hello Bernd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back with an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Syncing the User Profile information from Windows 7 to Windows 10 will not be possible. However, the thing you're referring will be possible with Microsoft account on latest Windows 10. Set up a Microsoft account to use a single sign-in to access all of
 your Microsoft services – from Office to Outlook to Skype. Your account keeps everything that you need on the device in hand, whether you use Windows, iOS or Android.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When sync is turned on, Windows keeps track of the settings you care about and sets them for you on all your Windows 10 devices.
</li><li>You can choose to sync such things as web browser settings, passwords, and color themes. If you turn on
<strong>Other Windows settings,</strong> Windows syncs some device settings (for things like printers and mouse options), File Explorer settings, and notification preferences.
</li><li>For syncing to work, you need to sign in to Windows 10 with your Microsoft account (or link your Microsoft account to your work or school account) on any device you want to keep in sync. If the
<strong>Sync settings</strong> option isn't available on your device, your organization might not allow this feature.</li></ul>
<p>Refer the below link to learn more about Microsoft account.</p>

            <p>Thanks. Meanwhile I fell back onto a Windows 7 PC - i.e. I am not moving to Windows 10, but both the source and destination PCs have Windows 7. So, that particular problem is solved as long as Windows 7 is supported.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other problems remain, but by the time I am forced to go to Windows 10 or something else, I will probably have found a way to move everything to a non-Windows operating system. I don't feel comfortable with Windows anymore.</p>

<h2>            Hammer Storage HS26042 60GB External Hard Drive Not Recognized by Windows 7 Ultimate</h2>
                    <b>Hammer Storage HS26042 60GB External Hard Drive Not Recognized</b>. &nbsp;Drivers cannot be found for this device; all web searches lead to dead-ends. (Manufacturer sold and apparently dissolved.) The Windows 7 Compatibility test says this device is compatible;
 however, it will not install. I've disabled relevant drivers, scanned for new hardware, all the usual steps, but to no avail. Does anyone know where to locate drivers or how to work around the problem in Windows 7? Thanks in advance.

</p><p>Maybe you could try the Google support forum.&nbsp; I found this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Many odd problems with Gmail's web interface are due to a corrupt copy of the code loaded in your web browser, and can be solved by "clearing cache and cookies". &nbsp;Have you tried that yet?"</p>
<p>
"In IE, you have to manually add <a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(17, 85, 204, 1)">google.com</span></a> to the list and make sure "include updated website lists from Microsoft" is checked. Restart the browser and the print button should now work.
</p><div>
<p>
</p><p>Google uses Google Docs when you click to "view" an attachment instead of downloading it. For some reason, when clicking the print icon when viewing, IE chooses to fail without error. Once the domain is added to compatibility view, the print button brings
 to to the printer friendly version of the document and brings up the printer dialog." &nbsp;</p>

            Windows 10 doesn't allow hiding updates as previous windows did. If you want to hide updates or refuse them reinstall windows 8.1. The only thing you can do in win 10<strong> pro
</strong>is delay updates but not hide them. Win 10 Home does not allow delays.&nbsp;

            <p>I have the same issue. The service already shows as disabled in Computer Management.
</p>
<p>When I go to Back up and Restore (Windows 7) there are no options to execute.</p>
<p>There was before and I have made a successful image backup in windows 10 but the option is no longer available.</p>
<p>I have removed the old windows 7 from my PC to free up space - is there a chance this has also removed this option in windows 10?</p>
<p>What would happen when windows 7 is automatically removed after 1 month?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I've restarted the PC with the Windows Backup service disabled, then gone back into services and reset Windows Backup to Automatic - so far all seems good. Options have returned and image backup is now in progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure why the service was disabled though.</p>

 image backup. &nbsp;This needs resolved as other people are having the same problem. &nbsp;I have not removed Windows 7 yet.</p>

            <p>Check the hard drive in disk management that you are saving the image to and see if it has an EUFI partition at the beginning of the drive. &nbsp;and if it has you need to delete it.</p>
<p>Google how to do this it will explain everything. I had this problem and once I deleted the partition it saved the image straight away.</p>

    <title>Removing My Dialup Connection&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steven. s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing My Dialup Connection&#63;</h2>
                    I have few computers connected on a small ethernet home network, via a residential gateway (i.e., router), that allow the computers to share files and printers, and share a cable Internet connection. Most of the computers on my network don't even have
 have dialup modems, and (mercifully) I haven't had the need to use dialup services in over six years. However, in my IE Options CONNECTION tab it shows that an MSN dialup connection has been set up.
<br />
<br />
At times, I have received a popup box with some kind of message regarding the dialup connection, and about working offline. Of course I'm not attempting a dialup connection. I've since changed my connections settings to NEVER DIAL A CONNECTION, but I would
 really like to just remove the dialup connection so as not to have any conflicts in my system or Internet access in the future.
<br />
<br />
My question: Would I be causing any problems for myself down the road if I just remove that dialup connection, and if removing it would not be problem, then how would I safely and properly do so? Thanks in advance for your help.

<p><span>I don't think that removing an unused dial-up connection can cause problems.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To be completely safe:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Make a system restore point.<br />
2. Open the Network Connections folder, right-click the connection, and delete it.<br />
3. In case of problems, restore the system to the way it was before the deletion.</span></p>

    <title>How to discover the source of micro freezes&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> midix  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to discover the source of micro freezes&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since I moved from Windows 7 to Windows 10, I started experiencing occasional micro freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is especially annoying when watching videos - once in a half an hour or so the sound gets stuck for a second and sounds like "overdigitized effect from the Matrix movie", if you understand what I mean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been living with this issue since the beginning of Windows 10. What I have done:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- scanned for viruses&nbsp;- none found</p>
<p>- scanned both HDDs for bad blocks - none found</p>
<p>- did a clean reinstall<br />
- regularly check for driver updates and install newer versions, trying both - Microsoft supplied drivers and directly from the software vendor, especially Intel, nVidia, Realtek<br />
- replaced video adapter (moved from AMD to nVidia)<br />
- replaced SSD</p>
<p>- applied both Anniversary Updates last year and this August</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, nothing helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system info:</p>
<p>Computer type:<br />
PC/Desktop<br />
OS:<br />
was - Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit 7601 Multiprocessor Free Service Pack 1<br />
is - Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 1607 OS Build 14393.51, 64 bit<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is there any reliable software tool I can launch and keep running in background while watching videos, so the next time when I experience a micro freeze, I can find out what has caused it (disk activity, network activity, CPU usage spike and from what program,
 Windows service or driver)?</p>

 network problem since I also had trouble downloading a specific zip file on a friends computer on the same network. I've tried other networks, to no avail. I'm stumped. Ideas?</div>

    <title>Windows 10 Update disabled my video cards - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chuckfair  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update disabled my video cards</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my W7 64 Pro to W10. I understand losing all my Internet Explorer bookmarks with the browser update, but my dual nVidia video cards were acting up after the original update.</p>
<p>Last night, the 12th of August, while turning off my computer, i noticed there was an update. I let the update go through the motions and my PC turned off like it should have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I switched to an XP HD on the same box to check a 2nd business email account, After finishing with email, I went to shut down and then XP needed to do an update. I thought XP was no longer supported...</p>
<p>&nbsp;This morning checking my W10 HD, I have absolutely no display. My monitor boots up then says no device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I switched to my XP HD and again, no display, no device found....</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have my personal information, my day job work and now my personal business information no longer accessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is costing me money, my business, my stress level is through the roof.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What have you done to my PC? I can't afford to build another box at this time...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance to anyone that can help me.</p>

            I am having nearly the same issue. I updated to Win10, had many display driver crashes; I was told to update drivers, they were, and then more recently asked to run a few 'FixIt' programs. I didn't think anything was found, but asked to restart so I did.
 NOW my display is black and the computer will not start in SafeMode, it is just blank black screen. HOW in the world do you expect our dead computers to go to Task Manager, etc with NO DISPLAY????&nbsp; I am livid with Microsoft at this point. You turned a decent
 working computer into a 20lb brick. All I want is my da%$ computer BACK. I am done with Win10, I want my Win7 that worked PERFECTLY to be reinstalled. I was told I had a month, but my computer informed me it was only 10 days when i tried to revert.

<p>Hi Mick,</p>
<p>You say you are running Windows 7 Vista - is it Windows7, Vista, or is it dual-boot with both systems installed.&nbsp; I'm going to assume it is Vista, but keep in mind that these procedures and programs may not work with Windows7 (in fact, they probably will
 be quite different) and that some of the suggested programs won't be compatible which could cause you further problems.</p>
<p>If you are using Windows7, just ignore all this and repost in the Windows7 Forums at;<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/windows7</a>&nbsp;where experts in Windows7
 will be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>=================================================================================================================================</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Can you boot into safe mode with networking or any safe mode - that would be a big help if it's possible.&nbsp; If not, many of
 these procedures won't be possible (just those you can do from the disk) - so just skip over them.&nbsp; I've arranged them so those possible from the disk (but not possible unless you can boot normally or into safe mode) are listed first.&nbsp; If no form of booting
 is possible, then stop after exhausting the disk options and reply back and we'll see what other options are possible (but it will be a short list indeed).</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><strong>First, let's try to just replace the file to see if the computer lets it be a relatively easy fix:</strong><a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5085175_replace-ntoskrnlexe.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.ehow.com/how_5085175_replace-ntoskrnlexe.html</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;
 If that doesn't work, then the system isn't going to let this be easy.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one
 you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps from a different computer).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).&nbsp; This has a good chance of fixing the problem if the file is corrupt and SFC can repair it.<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause. This also has a fair chance if the file is in a bad sector and is moved to a good one and thus becomes available again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;ntoskrnl.exe (Start
 / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.&nbsp; This is the first procedure where you need to be able to boot in some fashion.&nbsp; All the rest require that as well - so if you can't boot, reply at this point.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To
 fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for
 the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk
 (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE and only if you can stll boot normally).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

            Yes, this only happens with Google services, everything else works smoothly. And this only happens on my computer, I can access these things on my laptop and phone.

            I have tried both and none of them works. I have also tried reinstalling Chrome, but since this happens on all my webbrowsers(Edge, Chrome and Firefox) it's probably not a browser issue.

            I have not set DHCP manually that I know of. I'm using Norton but i haven't had any problems with it before. I have not installed any updates that I am aware of, this all started yesterday evening when I was surfing. When I do a problem search on my internet
 connection I get the error "can't identify proxy automatically". Could this have anything to do with it? My router have been acting weird ever since I plugged my new computer into it.

<h2>            Fix for boot loop error in Build 17101 did not work for my ASUS laptop</h2>
                    <p>This fix listed at bottom of fixes from Windows Insiders Blog Experience did not work for my ASUS LAPTOP:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/02/14/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17101-fast-build-17604-skip-ahead/#AUjdZdwKjGB5UIPL.97</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(95, 94, 94, 1)">"We fixed an issue during first shutdown/boot, or reboot, where for some users the device goes into a boot loop and the OS never loads"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had left insider program build 17093 because I got boot&nbsp;loop after build 17093 was installed on my very next attempt to power on my laptop. I clean installed public build 16299 and waited to see if MS would fix that issue in next build. So on&nbsp;2/14/18,
 I joined insider fast level. After Insider build 17101 completed I checked all my 3rd party apps. I shut down my laptop and a half hour later powered it up to do some backup storage. My laptop went into boot loop trying to access ASUS name on a black screen.
 I used USB with public build ISO file to reach fix support area of OS. Luckily I chose to go to W10 and I&nbsp;got my login page&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(95, 94, 94, 1)">To fix it I had to uncheck fast start-up in power options.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I used a USB key with a public build (not sure which exactly it was).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, it is pressing F11 during boot to bring up my UEFI's boot menu (ASRock motherboard).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue is apparently becoming more and more affected insiders, I guess that the fix of the original issue inadvertently introduced another one or similar. I was not experiencing boot loop or hang so far.</p>

<p>This will boot into windows where you than need to disable hibernation setting and fastboot, its in the power settings.&nbsp;</p>

            I had this happen with 17101 and the previous fast ring build on my Surface 1 Pro. I would power up, get the Surface splash screen, black, back to splash screen, and so on and so on and so on. When I first encountered the problem, I was worried I had bricked
 the Surface. But I build a bootable USB thumb drive and that works to start the system...and then I can removed the thumb drive and the system continues to run. Peculiar, to say the least!

                    <p>I somehow had the same pics both on my camera and on its disc.&nbsp; I then downloaded both sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I get these to combine, without doing each pic individually?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi CLEO'S CRAFTS &amp; CREATIONS,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community. Welcome to our Microsoft Family.</p>
<p>Pictures preserve timeless memories over the years. They are one of the most valuable things that one would store on a computer. You have an issue with deleting
 duplicate pictures from the camera and on the disc. It can be difficult when you are unable to do what you desire. It is pretty simple and we are here to help you fix the issue. We will work as a team and get this sorted out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer the questions-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What program are you using to open the pictures?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is this issue limited to the pictures on the camera and the disc?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any other changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like more information regarding the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method-</p>
<p>There isn’t a software or a method that could help you delete the duplicate files at once.</p>
<p>You can try a workaround for the same.</p>
<p>Refer the steps-</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Create a new <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-new-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">folder</a>
 on one of the drives and then copy the pictures from the disc to the new folder.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Now, copy the pictures from the camera to the same folder.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>You will be prompted if there are duplicates of the pictures.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When prompted, click on “Copy and replace” and then check the box next to “do this for all the current items”.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on “Ok” and verify the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If these steps do not work then, I would have you use your favorite search engine to look for third party software over the internet that might help you eliminate
 duplicate files.</p>
<p>NOTE: Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee
 that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be happy to help. We, at Microsoft strive towards excellence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
        </p>
