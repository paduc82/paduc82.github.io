            <p>I had the same problem which appeared after I installed an MS windows update.&nbsp; Please read what I have done to try and remedy it as I don't know if it has been successfulwithout success before telling me to run sfc and scanning for malware as I already have..</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Removed RSS feeds from IE 11 - rebooted and problem still exists</p>
<p>2. Removed IE 11 totally from my Windows 7 installation - rebooted and problem
<strong>still </strong>exists</p>
<p>3. In programs and features I removed WLM 2012 then rebooted</p>
<p>4. Went to MS Live essentials download site for Win essentials installer and ran it</p>
<p>5 Got message saying WLM successfully installed and re booted.</p>
<p>6 Opened WLM and still got message about RSS feeds.</p>
<p>7 Closed WLM, then reopened it, at last no more <strong>'Intialisation of RSS feed support failed. RSS feeds could not be updated'</strong>.&nbsp; But will this be the end of it?&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Unfortunately the problem has returned - please see screenshot. As you can see there are lo RSS feeds present to initialize.&nbsp; There shouldn't be as I have removed IE but this issue is still present.&nbsp; I am tempted to use a different E Mail client as WLM seems
 to be very processor intensive when it is loading.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for visiting this thread. I reviewed your post and we appreciate the steps that you took in resolving the issue. From the information, you removed Internet Explorer on your PC. With this, removing it might be caused the issue. Windows Live Mail
 might not run properly when Internet Explorer is not installed since Internet Explorer is the default browser for Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet Explorer provides the Common Feed List to other programs. This allows you to subscribe to feeds with Internet Explorer and read them in other programs, such as an e‑mail program like Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this, please reinstall Internet Explorer and make sure that your subscription to your RSS feeds is updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know more about this, please refer to this link: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/use-rss-feeds#ie=ie-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Use RSS feeds in Internet Explorer </strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have questions, please let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I have done the above steps prior to checking here (except installing Internet Exploder (Since I uninstalled it as part of my own attempt to fix this issue)) and still I get the RSS feed couldnt blah blah blah. &nbsp;I dont do RSS, have never done RSS and want
 nothing to do with RSS. &nbsp;But since this thread was started almost a year ago, and I am just now getting the RSS Message this must be an ongoing issue. &nbsp;I havent checked anywhere else for a solution but I will after this post. If I find a fix else where I will
 post a link to the solution here (as long as that solution isnt Uninstall Essentials 2012). My OS is Windows 7 Home Pro 32bit. &nbsp;I am hoping that when Windows 10 becomes available it isnt dumbed down even further than Win 7 is (compared to XP) It seems that
 Microsoft is getting closer and closer to becoming like America Online, that is to say, it is intended for people who have no business owning a computer in the first place.</p>
<p>If this post seems scathing, I apologize. &nbsp;Chalk it up to frustration to finding that the only solution given is from September 2014 as well as obviously what anyone would do if they installed the software themselves. &nbsp;Oh gee guess what? WE ALL DID! &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Annette,
<br />
<br />Try disabling Fast Startup and see if this issue persists. Here's a great Windows Central article on this: <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-disable-windows-10-fast-startup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-disable-wind...</a>
<br />
<br />If you're able to get into your BIOS or EFI settings (like F2 while booting), be sure to find a Bluetooth setting and see if it got disabled or not.
<br />
<br />Of course, you can try going to your original manufacturer's site to reinstall the Bluetooth driver and see if it does the trick.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you've made any progress. Good luck.       
        </p>

            Hi Annette.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            New Windows 10 Laptop at 100&#37; Disk Usage</h2>
                    <p>Hello, my Mom purchased a new computer a while back and always complained about it being incredibly slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally took it for her to try and fix and noticed that the disk usage is always at 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not seem normal, and as a result is slows down the entire system. Even trying to pop open the windows menu takes seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know how to diagnose what is consuming the disk usage, or how to resolve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on Windows Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.471)</p>
<p>
</p><p>System SKU: Aspire E5-575_115F_1.27</p>

<br />FIX : Windows 10 100 Percent Disk Usage Problem
<br />
<br />1. Press  Windows Key + R and type devmgmt.msc in the Run, hit Enter key to open Device Manager snap-in.
<br />
<br />2. In the Device Manager window, expand IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers and right click on Standard SATA AHCI Controller, select Properties.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />3. In the property sheet, switch to Driver tab and click Driver Details.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />4. If the Driver File Details window shows storahci.sys driver listed there, it means you’re running inbox driver and hence it is possible to disable MSI mode. Click OK.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />5. Back on the property sheet, switch to Details tab. Against Property, select Device instance path from drop-down and note down the Value mentioned there.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Registry Disclaimer: The further steps will involve registry manipulation. Making mistakes while manipulating registry could affect your system adversely. So be careful while editing registry entries and create a System Restore point first.
<br />
<br />6. Press W8K + R and put regedit in Run dialog box to open Registry Editor (if you’re not familiar with Registry Editor, then click here). Click OK.
<br />
<br />7. In the Registry Editor window, navigate to following registry key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\PCI\&lt;AHCI Controller Value&gt;\Device Parameters\Interrupt Management\MessageSignaledInterruptProperties
<br />
<br />*Substitute &lt;AHCI Controller Value&gt; we got in step 5.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />8. In the right pane of MessageSignaledInterruptProperties key, look for the registry DWORD (REG_DWORD) named MSISupported which should be corresponding to Value 1 as its Data. Double click on the DWORD to modify its value:
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />9. Finally, set the Value data as 0 and click OK. Close Registry Editor and reboot. After restarting your machine, the 100% disk usage problem should disappear.

            4GB is not much nowadays especially if Chrome is used. <br />
Sedlauncher usually works when system checks for updates or prepares check and it should not be long.
<br />
If it works for a long enough time you may kill this process. <br />
And please run system repair by DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth <br />
conmmand from Windows PowerShell (administrator) environment

            <p>I agree, this questions should be directed to the XP Forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep this in mind though. Most applications that "require" admin authority to run, implies that the privileges are NOT available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an owner of the device, the Admin profile password and other components would be available to the owner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that information is unknown to the user attempting to create a bootable disk, from a product that requires Admin authority, then the next question would be:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Are you a user of the device only, and have access to the system as granted by the owner?</p>
<p>2) Is the device a part of a domain managed by a business and admin rights are handled through the domain administrator?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Performing a build for a bootable drive does not require an ISO image. It does require that MS Windows be used to build a recovery drive or other off-line protection device. Normally ISO images are reserved for disk drives (or images), operating system deployments,
 DVD/BD images, or other areas that specifically need an ISO image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you move your inquiry to the XP Forum, please provide the additional information implied above. They shall be able to more rapidly assist with a more focused response.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a user that it's getting all kinds of errors - CCC.exe - Fatal error&nbsp; CLR error: 8007000e, Catalyst Control Center: Host application has stopped working, Onedrive for business needs to close because of hardware or configuration problem, manages the
 trend micro unauthorized change.&nbsp; I have looked and I don't see anything on the computer that looks suspicious but I did find where&nbsp; Windows Defender KB915597 update failed.&nbsp; Several of these updates worked correctly.&nbsp; Windows defender KB91597 (definition
 1.213.6634.0 - 1.213.6320.0 1.213.6009.0) worked fine&nbsp; the last security framework was 4.6.1&nbsp; KB3127233 also updated successfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user is running windows 7 pro and we have TrendMicro as security.&nbsp;&nbsp; My first thought is to start uninstalling updates.

<p>If that is the message you're getting when trying to buy Fifa points, I would recommend adding a payment option like paypal or a credit card to your account.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once the Windows Update components are reset, try installing the updates again by choosing two updates at a time as some updates
 need system restart for the changes to take effect. To do so,</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open Windows Update by clicking the Start button, clicking All Programs, and then clicking Windows Update.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on the Change settings option in the navigation bar on the left. You will now be at a screen where you will be able
 to set up how Windows Vista will download and install updates on your computer. </span>
</p>
<p><span>3. Select the option Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them. When you are done configuring
 the options as you wish, press the OK button to save these settings. You will now be back at the main Windows Update screen.</span></p>
<p><span>4. In the left pane, click Check for updates, and then wait while Windows looks for the latest updates for your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>5. You may then download the updates one or two at a time.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Click on install updates to install the currently selected updates.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Repeat the steps 5 and 6 till you get all the updates you want on your PC.</span></p>

<p>Wander around the DC area until you get a quest added about some Brotherhood of Steel soldiers in a spot of bother (this is on a save prior to completing the game). Go help them and that'll lead into Operation Anchorage.</p>

<h3> stealthy03  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 Anniversary Update FPS Drops</h2>
                    <p>Since the Windows Anniversary Update, I have had FPS drops in all of my games. For example, on CS:GO I would get 80-100 FPS, however I now get 30-40 FPS. I have tried everything, but with no resulutions. I have tried to update the graphics card and many
 more things. One of my friends can't even open CS:GO after the update.</p>
<p>I use a HP Pavilion Notebook 15-ab289sa. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate some support with this since it has crippled my gaming experiance,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>This is a recurring problem for many after the Anniversary update. &nbsp; I would suggest you open your Task Manager, then minimize it to Task bar. &nbsp; Launch your game and when frames begin to drop, go into Task Manager and find out what program or service is
 eating up your CPU cycles and/or causing high Disk activity. &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You could temporarily stop the service at that point, but better still, you will need to go to Services (type Services in Search Bar on Desktop, then click on Desktop App). &nbsp; From here you can alter what that Service does: &nbsp;ask if you don't know what to
 do. &nbsp; But first, identify what is causing the problem.</p>

</p><p>It kind of sounds like somehow you're running an older driver that's got way worse performance, something like that.</p>

            <p>To test, you may need to try booting your computer via Clean Boot (but tick Hide Microsoft Services), thereby disabling any non-Microsoft programs from running. &nbsp; Remember to go back to Normal Boot (or whatever boot configuration you had before).</p>
<p>

            <p>Clean Boot is the option to boot your computer without starting services that normally start at boot up. &nbsp; To do that, type msconfig &nbsp; in your Search box on desktop. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Click on System Configuration and you will go to a window that has tabs: &nbsp;General, Boot, Services, Startup and Tools. &nbsp; Click on the Services tab.</p>
<p>All the Services shown would be ticked. &nbsp;Click on Disable All and then go to the bottom and tick Hide All Microsoft Services. &nbsp; So what you're doing now will be to reboot your computer with Microsoft Services starting but all the other services disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After clicking Apply/Ok, reboot your computer. &nbsp; It will now reboot in the new configuration. &nbsp; Then launch the game that is giving you the FPS problem and see whether frames come back to normal. &nbsp; If they do, then you know that there must have been some
 non-Microsoft service that was in some way interfering with the game. &nbsp; This is only a test - it may not give you the desired result, but worth a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above didn't help, go back to &nbsp; msconfig &nbsp; and this time Disable everything (i.e. there should be no ticks in that window) and Apply/Ok and reboot. &nbsp; Now you are disabling both Microsoft and non-Microsoft services. &nbsp; Now launch the game and check
 the status. &nbsp; After these tests, you will need to go back to &nbsp; msconfig &nbsp; and Enable All Services and reboot.</p>

<h2>            Lock screen has no login dialogue</h2>
                    <p>When I lock my computer, the lock screen contains no quick way to log on. The only way to log on (as far as I can see) is to click one of the links, after which I can log on and the link opens in Microsoft Edge. See screenshot of the lock screen below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems odd, because the main thing anyone would do from this page is log in. Is there a setting I can change to correct this behaviour? And why would this be the default behaviour?</p>

            hi Tom, sure, you can get rid of that extra screen (Lockscreen) so your pc only shows the login screen . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor 
<br />
<br />In the left pane, navigate to: 
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows 
<br />
<br />Right click the Windows Key (folder) and choose New - Key 
<br />
<br />Name the key Personalization 
<br />
<br />Click the new Personalization key 
<br />
<br />In the right hand pane, right click and choose New - DWORD 32bit 
<br />
<br />Name it NoLockScreen 
<br />
<br />Double click NoLockScreen and set its value to 1 
<br />
<br />Close the Registry Editor and Restart Windows for the change to take effect 
<br />
<br />That's It!       
        </p>

            Thanks. Updating also fixed the main problem - clicking on the screen now takes me to a login box (whereas before the update it didn't, and I had to click through one of the links).

<p>Hi Elijah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One possible reason as to why you're being asked to enter a PIN code is due to an outdated device driver. For us to determine the root cause, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you trying to connect the controller via a wired or wireless?</li><li>Have you made any changes to your device before encountering this issue?</li><li>Have you tried connecting a different controller on your Windows 10 PC and check if the same issue occurs?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The default PIN codes are <span>"0000"and "1234". We suggest that you try those combinations. You may also
</span><span>find the PIN on the accessory itself. </span></p>
<p>If you're connecting the controller via Bluetooth, kindly run the Bluetooth troubleshooter. Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Select the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Start</strong> button, then select
<strong>Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Find and fix other problems</strong>, select<strong> Bluetooth &gt; Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We also recommend running the devices and driver troubleshooter. See <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2970908/how-to-use-microsoft-easy-fix-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Laptop keyboard doesn&#39;t work&#63; How to fix&#63;</h2>
                    <div>Hi, I was wondering if anyone can help me on this&nbsp;dilemma.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My laptop keyboard doesn't work. It worked just fine this morning, but after my younger sister went on it, it stopped working. None of the keys work when you push them, none of the letters or numbers. The keys aren't falling out or anything of the sort,
 it just doesn't work when you press them.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I connected a usb keyboard to my laptop and it works just fine. I took out the usb keyboard and then went to the device manager on my laptop and then to keyboard, and the status for my keyboard says "This device is working properly". But it isn't working?
 &nbsp;So then I tried uninstalling the keyboard and restarting my laptop. Once my laptop was on a pop-up says that a new device was connected to my computer(the keyboard), but the keyboard still doesn't work when I push the keyboard keys.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't know what happened? So can anyone please help me? Any help is very much appreciated!&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            Looks like you are going to have to replace it. Did your youger sister spill something on it?

            No, nothing was spilled or anything. The keyboard just suddenly stopped working. So the only thing I can do is replace it? There's nothing else that I can do? Like perhaps some keys my sister accidentally pushed that disabled the keyboard or something?

<p>If it is not showing up and it is completely non-reactive, I would recommend contacting the laptop's manufacturer.&nbsp; They may know something that we do not.</p>
