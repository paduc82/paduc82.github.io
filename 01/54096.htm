<h2>            Windows 8.1 forgets dual touchscreen setup</h2>
                    <p>I have two monitors with touch screen. when configured, this works like a charm (ok, the charms bar is a little difficult to get to but I almost never use them anyway. and I still have a mouse connected).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both monitors are responding as they should. after reboot however, or shutdown and startup, windows forgot that both are touch screens instead of just one. both monitors are still recognized, just not the touch part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before reboot:</p>
<p>monitor 1: Touchscreen (USB)</p>
<p>monitor 2: Touchscreen (USB)</p>
<p>
</p><p>after reboot</p>
<p>monitor 1: Touchscreen (USB)</p>
<p>monitor 2: Normal monitor</p>
<p>
</p><p>windows 8.1 up to date.</p>
<p>two monitors of the type: ProLite T2252MTS IIYAMA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can of course reconfigure it using the tablet settings pane, but to do that everytime...it's not fun at all.</p>

            <p>Hi Henze,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue generally occurs, if the display resolution settings&nbsp;are not supported by Windows 8 or due to display driver issue. But as you have tried updating the graphics driver for the monitor, you may try the steps provided in the following link as of now
 and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/how-connect-multiple-monitors#1TC=t1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Connect a second monitor or projector</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also check, if none of the options for dual computers work as given below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong><em>Windows key </em>+ P</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;each of these options and check: Duplicate, Extend, Second Screen only.</li></ol>
<strong>Step 2:&nbsp;</strong>I would suggest you to check for any pending Windows Update.
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow the steps to install available Windows Updates.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>C</strong>, type <strong>Windows Update</strong> in the&nbsp;Search box, then click
<strong>Windows Update</strong> in the results pane.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Check for Updates</strong>. After the scan is complete, click
<strong>Review optional updates</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click the check box next to the updates, then&nbsp;click&nbsp;<strong>Install updates</strong>.</span></li><li><span>If prompted, review the license agreement, then click <strong>I&nbsp;Accept</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Follow the onscreen instructions to download and&nbsp;install the updates. </span>
<span>If prompted, reboot your computer.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol>

            <p>I do not follow. how is this in relation with touch functionality? the usb part is not being recognised. it just sees one touch monitor and the other one as a regular, even though I have set up both monitors to be touch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>to be clear: both monitors are working after reboot, that is not the issue, resolution is not the problem either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyway, I think it's fixed. but I only rebooted once yesterday, maybe it is irregular, maybe the next time it will happen again. I will let you know if that happens.</p>

            <p>well, it is still happening. after reboot it often remembers that just ONE monitor is a touch screen, but sometimes it doesn't remember that there were touch screens at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>at every reboot or cold startup (not sure about this last one) I have to use that utility in windows again to point which screen is a touch screen. which is both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>drivers are installed correctly, but I have to teach windows which monitors I like to use for touch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it is that windows 8.1 is the only one coming close to actual touch screen experience (I mean the stupid titlebar for mouse addicts shows up, I don't use it I use the gestures you initially added to windows if I am using the mouse)</p>
<p>
</p><p>i'd like to have this fixed. and not by band aids or work arounds.</p>

            <p>Apparently there is something wrong in the recognition part of the usb devices when they are on the same pinout/internal hub.</p>
<p>
</p><p>every motherboard has one or more pin outs for connecting usb ports, these are internal hubs. &nbsp;usually one or more usb ports are connected to one of those. for example 2 ports on hub 1, and 2 ports on hub 2.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>so If you connect a device to one of those usb ports the computer see's device 1 on usb-port 1 on internal hub 1. =&gt; 1-1-1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the the device on the second usb port is recognized as device 1 on usb-port 2 on internal hub 1. so: 1-2-1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere along the line telling the computer which USB device is the touchinput for which monitor something goes wrong. I think it has something to do with having two touchinput devices on the same internal hub.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I think happening: You tell windows to have monitor A linked to the touchinput device 1 on port 1 on hub 1, and monitor B linked to touchinput device 1 on port 2 on internal hub 1. Somehow windows only remembers device 1 on internal hub 1, linking
 both touchinput devices to one monitor, monitor A. which is wrong. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>to fix it you should find a usb port that is connected to an other internal hub. so where monitor A is linked to touchinput device 1 on usb port 1 on internal hub 1, monitor B will be recognized as touchinput 1 on usb port 1 and internal hub 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if this is too technical, just try out all usb ports you have directly on your computer. try to avoid external usb-hubs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>if after the switch your inputs are linked to the wrong monitor, you can use the "Tablet-PC" tool in windows to point out which input should link which monitor.</p>

    <title>Deleted a file in program files, I now have an extra 150 gigs of HDD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleted a file in program files, I now have an extra 150 gigs of HDD space and some of my programs won&#39;t work</h2>
                    
<p>I was cleaning up some space in Program Files(x86) ready to install a new program, I accidentally extracted the files straight into Program Files(x86) and not into a sub-folder, I deleted the 5 or so stand-alone&nbsp;files that were in there. Restarted my computer
 and all of my desktop shortcut icons were gone. None of my games work, they all crash during start-up, save a few older games such as The Sims and Warcraft 3. Three other things on three other programs have gone wrong also, Google Toolbar for IE simply wouldn't
 work, my&nbsp;auto-saved login information for WLM had gone also and finally my Steam auto-login was reset too.&nbsp;Those three problems were&nbsp;resolved by simply reinstalling the toolbar and re-entering my login information for WLM and Steam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I figured I'd go into my recycle bin and restore the files, as I had obviously deleted a file I misunderstood for one of the recently extracted ones. I&nbsp;restarted my computer and the problem still&nbsp;persisted, only none of the restored files had been restored
 and weren't still in the recycle bin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now have around 150 extra gigs of free&nbsp;HDD space and my whole program files(x86) folder is only 15gigs large.</p>
<p>I did a chkdsk and chkdsk /r, both came back fine, a virus scan, a system restore and an individual folder restore on my Program Files(x86)&nbsp;and Windows folders (Of which the eldest date the individual folder restores were available for, were shortly after
 I deleted the files, but system restore was back about a day before this problem first happened). Which&nbsp;all did nil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few other things are that when I entered in safe-mode, the shortcut icons were back, and remained back even after leaving safe-mode. I made a text document after all of these issues, saved it to my desktop, and after a restart the icon for it had gone.
 But only for that one, new file.</p>
<p>I think the file may of&nbsp;had a three-letter-long file name and may of been a .cfg file, but I am not entirely sure.</p>
<p>Oh, and the file / shortcut icon that replaces them is one of those "Unknown ones" which you'd normally get packed with files your system doesn't actively recognize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: By "some of my programs won't work" I mean it's mostly games or similar programs. My anti-virus works, my internet browsers, and so on, they all work seemingly normal, it's just the more system-intensive ones that crash during start-up.</p>

<p><span>Hey Crash9000,</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the errors when program crashes.</span></p>
<p><span>Deleting a file in program files folder should not cause these many issues. Generally deleting a file from there should affect only
 the applications which are related to it but definitely not the desktop icons and many programs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to put the computer in clean boot state from safe mode and then boot to normal mode and check.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers
 and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below for more details:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows 7:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps in the above article to reset the computer to start
 as usual.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Also, run the SFC scan and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To do this, follow these steps:&nbsp; <br />
a. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password,
 or click Allow.<br />
b. Type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
sfc /scannow<br />
The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
More Information about SFC scan can be found in this document:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Also, try running</span><span>a virus scan and check what
 happens.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials</span></a><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Some malware/spyware/virus that is out on the Internet, will also change system settings, corrupt data, and log invalid registries
 that will also make annoying errors, as like the ones you are encountering.&nbsp; You can try a virus scan. Just keep in mind that if your system does contains a virus, the active virus can try to keep the system from installing/using the virus scan correctly.
 Online Virus scans (sometimes) will not have that problem.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com</span></a>&nbsp; - OneCare is Microsoft's Virus Scan.&nbsp;
 You can attempt using the OneCare <br />
Safety Scanner. That is OneCare's online Scanner. Sometimes it will not launch properly if your system is not under a specific ordinance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Use the below link to perform&nbsp;an online full service scan on the computer:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I tried all three to no avail. Step one did nothing, step two found no issues and step&nbsp;three was clean.</p>
<p>I usually get a simple, "X has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available."</p>
<p>Or for another program I'll get, "An error occurred starting X. Please try again.e_fileCorrupt".</p>
<p>It's definitely the missing files that cause the crashes. A game that was once 7gigs large is now 27mb.<br />
All of the folders within the game folders remain as far as I know, but it appears the individual files are gone.</p>

            <p>Hi Rusty,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Do you have access to a second keyboard just to make sure it is not a hardware-issue?
</p>
<p>- Have you tried the keyboard shortcuts on Notepad or other Windows related programs to see if it works fine?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found this link in the Adobe Forum Support where user has the similar issue with Photoshop and the fix that was provided was to reset the Preferences set in Photoshop.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to post this question in the Adobe Photoshop forums to find if there is a work around to get this issue fixed.</p>

            <p>Kevin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. Its all pretty strange--my 3D animation program--Hash Animation Master--is more important then Photoshop and I'd be really surprised if resetting Photoshop would fix that. I believe something is intercepting the shortcuts at least halfway--remember
 the darn mouse pointer changes like it should but tool won't work unless you switch to it using the tool icon.</p>

<p>The Preferences set for each software might be the cause behind this issue. Try to reset the Preferences in Adobe is just a work around that has worked for some of the users. Give it a try and let us know the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to contact the 3D program developer support team and let them know regarding this as they might have fix which will work for their programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue has occurred after making some changes to the computer, then we have an option to restore the computer to a date where it was working fine. You might try it.</p>

            <p>Thanks so much for following up. That's rare and greatly appreciated! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't found a way to reset Photoshop preferences to factory default and am wondering if the older version I have (CS3) just doesn't have this feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also am trying to find a way to temporarily revert to default settings in Animation Master (don't want to lose them all if I can avoid it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally I will try disabling all the Windows startup programs and see if that does anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll keep you posted.</p>

                    <p>After upgrade to Windows 10, when I finally got my primary mail account set up and synced, it only brought over the last 60-90 days of mail in my in-box.&nbsp; Can anyone help me with how to get the rest of my older In Box messages in to the Windows 10 mail account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also:&nbsp; there does not appear to be any way to manage my other folders--specifically to create new mail folders.&nbsp; And I can't open some of the mail in the other folders -- even after I manually sync each folder.&nbsp; Anybody have suggestions for management of

<p>Hi Omar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are different factors that we have to take into consideration when troubleshooting issues with downloading games from the Windows Store. Here are the usual reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're not signed in to the Windows Store app using the same Microsoft account you've used in purchasing the game.
</li><li>Corrupted app data</li><li>An outdated Windows 10 OS</li><li>The game isn't available in your country or region. </li><li>The game is not compatible with your device.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To determine if you're signed in with the account that owns the game license, kindly sign in to the
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders?ref=xboxsupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Payment &amp; billing</a> page with your Microsoft account. You'll see the transaction if you're signed in with the correct account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you encounter the same issue upon verifying your Microsoft account's purchase history, kindly perform the following troubleshooting methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Run the Windows apps troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>This troubleshooter can help resolve issues with downloading games from the Windows Store. Click this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to proceed. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Check for updates </strong></p>
<p>An outdated Windows 10 OS may cause issues with built-in Windows 10 apps. To resolve this, kindly visit this
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-windows/system-requirements/latest-driver-software-updates-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and follow the steps on how to get software and driver updates for Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Reset the Windows Store app from the Settings menu</strong></p>
<p>This process can help resolve corrupted app data. Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click<strong> Start</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>System</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Apps &amp; features</strong>.</li><li>Find the Store app, then click <strong>Advanced options</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Reset</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Reset </strong>again to confirm. </li><li>Restart your device so that the changes will take effect. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, kindly get in touch with our Xbox support team. They can help verify the account you've used in purchasing the game. You may reach them through chat support or schedule a call at your preferred date and time. Click this
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> for their contact information. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly update us with the results. We'd be glad to further assist you.</p>

<p>Thanks for keeping us in the loop, Omar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried updating your device after running the Windows Update Troubleshooter?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Another solution we suggest is to manually reset the Windows Store cache through Command Prompt. Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>+<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>R<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>keys to open the run command box.</li><li>Type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>WSReset</strong>, then try launching Store and sign in. Check if the download button shows up.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, kindly make sure that your device's&nbsp;<strong> Date &amp; time settings</strong> is appropriate. To do so, kindly perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, then <strong>Settings</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Time &amp; language</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, we also recommend making sure that you're signed in with a Microsoft account. Refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17201/windows-10-sign-in-with-a-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Objects moving to 0.0001x to the side of the axis in 3D Builder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> student678  say:</h3>
<h2>            Objects moving to 0.0001x to the side of the axis in 3D Builder</h2>
                    <p>I seem to have a problem with 3D Builder where sometimes when I try to move an object to a precise co-ordinate, the app sometimes moves it a tiny little bit to either side of the axis. For example, if I tried to move something to 817x, it would move to 817.0001x,
 and if I tried to change it back, it would just go to 816.9999x. Sometimes I have to move the object quite a distance just to get it to stop snapping to these annoying locations! Sometimes this happens when there is only one object.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My units are mm, and I've disabled snapping and collisions, even though I've had the latter enabled ONCE just to see what it would do. I really don't get why 3D Builder has to "correct" my work by adding or subtracting 0.0001 mm when beforehand it was just
 fine! Can someone please tell me what is happening and what I can do to stop it?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi David.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by the April Version 1803 Update you can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>How do I satisfy a system demand to install Sonic Focus drivers for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r parnell  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I satisfy a system demand to install Sonic Focus drivers for the Intel Audio Studio Controller &#63;</h2>
                    When I start my computer I get the message that Sonic Focus drivers must be installed for the Intel Audio Controller, however, I cannot find any such drivers and any responses I get from the Widows site relate only to a generic driver. When I want to try
 to read a memory stick the computer will not recognize it and the error message relates to an ongoing installation in progress which I feel is related to the Sonic Focus drivers issue???? So I cannot read a new memory stick with photos on it. What needs to
 be done to rectify this situation?

<h2>            Disable Temporary Profile</h2>
                    <p>I need to disable temporary profile when a user logs in. I need it to go into a black screen to prevent anyone who removed the shell from being able to see what is on the computer and explore it. I have been looking for ways to stop it, but all I have found
 so far is how to fix it when the temporary profile shows up. But I don't want it to every bring up a temporary profile.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1803
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)

<br />
<br />Switching to Windows 10 64 bit is free, you don't have to pay for it. As long as you have a qualifying Windows 7 or 8 or Windows 10 license, you are entitled to use it.
<br />Switching requires that you perform a new installation, that means files, applications and settings will be deleted.
<br />
<br />You will have to reinstall applications and native 64 bit drivers.

<p>Since firmware updates need to be run just once, it would be inappropriate to include them in the list of Default Programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not own a Nikon camera but I know that firmware updates usually go like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the update file to your PC's <em>Downloads</em> folder.</li><li>Double-click it to run it.</li><li>It will prompt you to connect your camera.</li><li>It will do the firmware update.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, it runs from your PC. It does not run from your SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is not the way it happened with your upgrade then you need to read the installation instructions. If still unsuccessful, send a note to the Nikon helpdesk.</p>

<h2>            Lingering hover box</h2>
                    So I just noticed today that when I move my mouse over the programs in my toolbar, a white box with the name of the program pops up the second the taskbar vanishes. I don't even have to hover for it to happen, just a super quick skim will activate it.
 But it doesn't pop up when my mouse moves off the program that is currently being used. Does anyone know any fixes for this?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64c6bb42-da43-4074-9a94-2347cd605027?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64c6bb42-da43-4074-9a94-2347cd605027?upload=true" /></a>

    <title>Bought Acer computer preinstalled with Win 7 Home Prem - Did not - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bought Acer computer preinstalled with Win 7 Home Prem - Did not create a recovery disk.</h2>
                    <p>I purchased an Acer computer preinstalled with Windows 7 Home Premium - I did not create a recovery disk.</p>
<p>It is locking up; not shutting down; hanging; etc etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already paid&nbsp;local Staples Tech team and they tested for 4 days&nbsp;and&nbsp;diagnosed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Staples said they found no virus no issues&nbsp;and said&nbsp;they feel its the OS.</p>
<p>Staples technicians&nbsp;felt I need to RELOAD Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; </p>
<p>My 25 digit key is on the bottom of my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;I bought it once already and did not get two years out of it...where can I download my OS without repaying again?.</p>
<p>My computer works fine ONLY&nbsp;in SAFE mode.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Is&nbsp;there a place for me&nbsp;to get&nbsp;the software&nbsp;from Microsoft that I already own? (Win 7 Home Prem)</p>
<p>Can anyone help me? I am very desperate.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp; </p>

<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>

<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>

<p>Download the corresponding edition of Windows 7 you have a license for from the following link. You can identify the edition on COA sticker attached to your machine, with at bottom or battery compartment (laptop) or top/side if its a desktop computer.</p>

            Thank you for your kind response Andre.&nbsp; I followed the directions by booting my Acer using Alt F10 and it appeared to download the new code.&nbsp; It was going to take a while so I walked away.&nbsp; I returned and it said "restart my computer".&nbsp; when I did that
 it came back with "WINDOWS COULD NOT COMPLETE THE INSTALLATION...RESTART THE INSTALLATION".&nbsp; But it wont restart the installation.&nbsp; Now I don't even have Safe Mode (which at least I had before).&nbsp; Now I am totally dead.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I need a new copy of Windows
 7 Home Premiun which I am willing to pay for - but I need the discs...because my computer is giving me no features.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I know I just purchased Windows 7 64 bit Home Premium less than 2 years ago - but I fear that is my only alternative.&nbsp; If you have any suggestions - I am open to anything.<br />
<br />
I HAVE learned never to purchase a pre-installed computer.&nbsp; Having no media is crippling.<br />
Thanks for help from anyone<br />

<h2>            how to remove ramdisk &#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    i had windows 7 but something wrong went and the C drive stopped working, so i formatted the laptop and installed the same windows 7 (ultimate 32bit)<br />
<br />
after the installation finished, it tells that it is going to restart, and you go normal, but when it did restart, it showed 2 options, windows 7 which i installed and ramdisk<br />
<br />
i don't know how it came !!!...but i would like to remove it, is there any way to do ? and if yes, will it harm the laptop or do any damage ?<br />

            <p>Hi Harris, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the frustration when things don't work as expected. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Windows 7 "System and Security" control panel category, the Action Center lets you change User Account Control (UAC) settings. In the
<strong>User Account Control Settings</strong> dialog box, you move the slide bar control for notifications, and then you click the
<strong>OK</strong> button. In this scenario, the dialog box does not close, and no change is made. When the mouse pointer is positioned on the
<strong>OK</strong> button, and you press ENTER, the dialog box still does not close, and no change is made.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You cannot change User Account Control (UAC) settings on Windows 7 </strong>
