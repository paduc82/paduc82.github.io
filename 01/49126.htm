<p>
</p><p>Good morning TarandeepKaur,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too have the Panasonic KX-FLB753 multi function machine. I followed the instructions given on the website and tried to manually install the drivers but unfortunately the driver software was not installed, as the computer could not find the compatible update!
 I am using Windows 10. Would you have any further tips or suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have occurred due to the incompatibility of the driver software with Windows 10 I suggest you to install the software in compatibility mode and see if you are able to install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the steps to install a driver in compatibility mode:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>&nbsp;<strong>Right click</strong> on the setup file of the driver and select
<strong>Properties</strong></span></li><li><span>&nbsp;Select <strong>Compatibility Tab</strong></span></li><li><span>&nbsp;Place a check mark next to Run this program in Compatibility mode and select the operating system accordingly from the drop down list</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;Let the driver to install and then check the functionality.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Hope this helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your advice. I referred to the steps and and selected the compatibility tab but unfortunately Windows 10 was not in the drop down list. Windows 8 was the latest operating system in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How should I proceed now?</p>

    <title>How do I restore default shortcut icons in Windows Vista&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> macuahuitl  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I restore default shortcut icons in Windows Vista&#63;</h2>
                    My problem started when I accidently deleted my Pictures folder. I was trying to make an archive and I had set the limit for the parts too low so it made over 50,000 little archived files. When I tried to Ctrl+A to delete them all, my computer would freeze.
 To solve that I simply took all my picture, made a new picture folder, and deleted the old picture folder. Well, the new picture folder didn't have the same folder icon. I didn't know how to resotore it. So I kind of left it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Today I went to change my desktop icons to those of some Battlestar Galactica icons that were at TheIconFactory. Realizing halfway through this wasn't working, I tried to return the icons to their default settings. Especially the shortcut icons. The shortcut
 icons being the icons you see under Favorite Links on the left hand side. My questions is, how I do I go about restoring the Picture icon as well as the default icons for the shortcuts?</div>

                </div>

            Hi Macuahuitl,<br />
Please take a look at this article it explains what a&nbsp;system restore touches and what it will and won't do.<br />
I figure I can tell you it won't mess with your files but I thought you might feel better if read the info yourself.<br />

            Try doing a System Restore to before you played around with them.<br />
<br />
Click Start &gt;Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore&gt; Next &gt; pick a prior date.<br />

If using Norton, disable it before using SR.

    <title>System Event Notification Error message on a Windows 7, Aspire 5732Z - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laurawilliams  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Event Notification Error message on a Windows 7, Aspire 5732Z laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I seem to have the same problem as many other users regarding System Event Notification, which has led to my laptop taking between 15-40minutes to start up, before seemingly to freeze - programs won't run, internet wont connect, and in the end I can't even
 shut down the laptop, and have to just keep my finger pressed down on the "on" button. I've then had to go into Safe mode, start a System Restore and then it has worked. Sadly, this only lasts for one attempt, and after shutting it down for the night and returning
 the next day, I face the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've looked online for guidance, but nothing seems to work for me: I've used Winsock Reset, looked at the Event Viewer for problems, ran a SFC / Scannow, but still have this problem. When looking at the sites, I found that different people fixed it in different
 ways (it seems that, whilst Winsock Reset works for some people, it only lasts for a few days before the problem returns), including uninstalling AVG or a wireless printer device, as well as a problem with a Windows Update. I don't have a connection to any
 printer on this laptop, so that isn't the problem, but I do have AVG&nbsp;which I also noticed recently had gone out of date. I updated this, as well as updated some new updates from Windows, and this morning managed to get online without having to go into safe
 mode, however, it still took me a long time to log in, so I fear that the problem has not disappeared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had this problem for three days now, and am really sick and tired of having to go through the whole process. Please also note that the long time to log in and the error message are connected; I don't have a slow laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help and advise would be welcome, as I am really losing my tether with this. I really don't want to have to fork out money on a new hardrive (I've read from&nbsp;other people who have this problem that factory resetting doesn't change anything whatsoever.</p>

            <p>Event Viewer Reports</p>
<p>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution. Most system related
 errors are logged and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</p>
<p>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes System is by far the most
 important.</p>
<p>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows
 Logs and System. Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to click a second time to see
 the latest Report at the top. </p>
<p>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Click on the Copy button to place a
 copy on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</p>
<p>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports that offer the best information
 but occasionally Warning Reports provide useful clues. </p>
<p>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports. Study reports since the point
 when the computer was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session. If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</p>
<p>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on the internet. The description
 is equally important and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting better results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</p>

            It was good to learn of how to see any errors... only that wasn't my problem. My problem was that I'm getting the message "
<p><span>Windows could not connect to the System Event Notification Service service. This problem prevents limited users from logging on to the system. As an administrative user, you can review the System&nbsp;<span><span>Event&nbsp;</span><span>Log</span></span>&nbsp;for
 details about why the service didn't respond."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then it freezes and I cannot use any programme like the command prompt or the internet.</span></p>
<p><span>Please advise me on how to get rid of this problem permanently, and not just for a little while through Winsock Reset or System Restore.</span></p>

<p><span>I would check the status of Services. </span></p>
<p><span>Click on the Start button and select Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Services. Locate System Event Notification service in the list. Check that it has started and that the StartUp type is Automatic. If it is not set to Automatic right click and
 select Properties, General tab. There is a box after StartUp type. The options are available on a drop down by clicking on the arrow down to the right of the box. Make the change and click on Apply and OK. Restart the computer and check whether it has started.</span></p>
<p><span>Also check that it is set to logon as a Local service?</span></p>
<p><span>Do you have Windows Defender installed?</span></p>

            <p>I have Windows Defender&nbsp;installed, but not working; I've never had it running since I got the laptop last year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for System Event Notification, I have it set as "automatic" as well as Logon on Local Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been looking around on the internet for other solutions, and have found that this error most of the time is because of a Windows Update. A person has advised me to, when I log on, press F11 at the very beginning to bring up some sort of update page,
 and change it so that the laptop goes back to a previous update before that of the time in which I recieved this error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would you advise that I try it?</p>

<p>I did a search in Google before I posted earlier. I did not get the impression that updates is the problem. What came across in Google was that no one has a clue or a solution.</p>
<p>If you are not using Windows Defender uninstall the software.</p>
<p>I think you should have another look at the System log in Event Viewer for this reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;"As an administrative user, you can review the System<span><span>Event </span>
<span>Log</span></span> for details about why the service didn't respond."!</p>

            <p>I must admit to being quite the newbie at System Event Log. Whilst I can easily find the errors, most of what it says does not make sense to me (the application names, for instance. Never seen them before/ heard of them/ used them, so do not know what they
 are).</p>
<p>I will try to uninstall Windows Defender, although must again admit to not being sure of how to do this - I've gone through Control Panel -&gt; uninstal a programme, but it is not there.</p>

<p>I was mistaken earlier. You cannot uninstall Windows Defender. Youi can only disable it.</p>

<p>I'm currently back in safe mode, but before I logged on during my first attempt to get into the normal Windows mode, I recieved a message about the laptop deleting some files - quite a lot of them and then reinstalling them.</p>
<p>Don't know if that may be helpful/tell you anything, but it's never happened before. All of my files seem to be still here, too, and appear unaffected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also noticed through "services.msc" that System Event Notification isn't currently started, although it is set to automatic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<p>Just wondering if that information has helped, as you haven't replied back to me yet. Still in Safe Mode, and I am getting really annoyed with it.</p>

<p>I have been rather busy getting ready preparing for a weeks holiday and have not had so much free tine as usual. I would have replied earlier but your method of posting error reports from Event Viewer was not as helpful as it would have been had you&nbsp;followed
 my tip.</p>
<p>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Click on the Copy button to place a copy on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message.
 Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</p>
<p><span>Select Start, Run, type cmd and press ENTER. Type "chkdsk c: /f /r" without the quotes and hit ENTER.&nbsp;Make sure you include the spaces indicated. Enter Y when asked whether you wish to run chkdsk on restarting the computer. Exit and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Marking off bad sectors on a hard drive takes time so be patient. Marking off does not repair a bad sector. It places pointers on the drive telling the system not to read or write to those sectors which have been damaged.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>If the number of bad sectors continues to increase after you have run the procedure above several times then you should replace the drive. If an important system file is written to a bad sector you can corrupt registry hives and lose
 the whole contents of the drive.</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand if having run chkdsk you see no more new bad sectors then the drive can work for you for years.</span></p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corrupted operating system may cause this message to appear. Restoring your system to an earlier point in time will help us in resolving the issue. May we know if you have created a restore point on your computer? May we also verify if the copy of your
 Windows is pre-installed or purchased separately?</p>
<p>

            <p>Since your post had nothing to do with feedback about the Microsoft Answers web site, I moved it from the Feedback forum to the Windows "Music and Sound" forum. Please return to your post, click Edit just underneath it, and change the Windows Version dropdown
 to indicate which version of Windows you have.&nbsp; You get&nbsp; the best help when you post in a forum related to your topic and include full details of the issue.</p>
<p>In what format is the file you saved to a memory stick?&nbsp; It it's an MP3 file an you have a CD burner on your PC, then you should be able to simply drag it to the CD drive and follow the prompts to burn the CD.&nbsp; The same can be said of a WIndows Media Audio
 file, although you can burn from within Windows Media Player as well.&nbsp; If it's some other format, like a&nbsp;MIDI file, you may have to convert it to an audio file and then burn it.</p>

                    After I put my surface book in sleep mode and plug in the charger it starts to get hot and the fans make a lot of noise. This does not happen if I completely turn it off and plug in the charger. I already have the latest updates so I can't figure out what's
 the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>I have also had this occur when I have the surface plugged in and am using it. It seems to be related to the settings for "plugged in performance" in power management. When plugged in your surface is likely running "faster" (allowed higher CPU use, disk
 speed, network speed etc). As the heat management of a surface is rather poor; this means that the fans have to go into overdrive to keep it cool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also find that not closing the lid when its on charge (and turned on / in standby) helps, as this increases the "surfaces surface area" (no pun intended) and aids in heat dissipation.</p>

<p>Do a legacy BIOS MBR install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Too many issues with UEFI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no advantage or features using UEFI except you can have hard drives over 2TB in size. And most people would never fill one 2TB HD. And you can connect as many drives as you want anyways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you just create (or windows usually will during install before format) a 450MB WRE partition and format the whole drive quick NTFS and install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will not regret it and will not miss all the issues with UEFI installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't waste your money on a SSD either. Get a HDD and get a Western Digital, they last forever, even when running 24/7/365. Never buy a Seagate. total Garbage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a farce that SSD is going to give you this big performance enhancement. LOL. And then SSD's cost twice as much and last 1/4 the time a HDD does.</p>

            Hi MightyOne
<br />
<br />The decision is yours . . .
<br />
<br />If you have UEFI on your PC, you can choose to install onto MBR or GPT
<br />
<br />If Secure Boot is enabled in BIOS, then your System will need your hard drive to be GPT, if Secure Boot is disables and Legacy BIOS enabled, you can install onto MBR . . .

    <title>Faint but high pitched intermittent electrical buzzing sound from xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> speedster996  say:</h3>
<h2>            Faint but high pitched intermittent electrical buzzing sound from xbox one-x</h2>
                    <p>I've started noticing this strange not very audible but somewhat high pitched/frequency like sound from my console. Happens very randomly, whether I'm in a game session, sitting idle on home dash or just surfing the internet. Sometimes it goes away completely...and
 sometimes it happens more frequently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, I thought it was coming from my PC power supply. But its actually the console. I don't recall hearing it when the console is off, even if still plugged in. Or I might have maybe on one or two occassions. My first instinct was "there's electrical
 sparking going on somewhere...maybe the wall outlet maybe the extension strip... It wasn't until I put my ear right next to the console that I confirmed it was indeed coming from the one-x.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The duration of the buzzing sound is sometimes under a second, sometimes more. I was concerned that there may be electrical sparking going on inside because its sounds like a fine, high pitched sound, you need good hearing and observation skills to detect
 it. I can never hear it with game volume up slightly or ceiling fan spinning. I could swear its almost the same sound you hear when there's electrical sparking due to a loose plug or connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Googled it and apparently it's a normal coil whine sound... Something to do with electromagnetic current being exchanged between components. Is there any other reason for this faint but high pitched buzzing sound? A bit concerned that's all. And not to
 be confused with the dull fan buzzing sound . That's a separate one and its constant.</p>

<p>I've seen a number of YT vids by now and a handful of reddit comments about the same complaints although it has no impact on performance or operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In many cases, they sent their units for repair/exhange and the second and even third, in some cases, had the same faint and intermittent buzzing/screeching sound. They all tried plugging directly into the wall but that had no effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be it's some kind of manufacturing design thingie that's causing this as many people have experienced it and it's all over YT and reddit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update: It's GONE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My One-X is silent as a ninja in the night - I removed the power cable adapter from the power strip/extension cord and plugged it directly into the wall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that annoying high pitched sound is coming form my PC, LOL! It's a bad power strip I suppose - to save my beloved console I now have it plugged in directly while everything else is on the extension strip (PC system and monitor, sound system, router and
 Sony LCD TV).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Not allowed to play Xbox Live&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been playing on XBL using my silver membership. Before you guys say, go buy gold, I leave in about 20 days for basic training, so not really a point in doing so.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am bridging connections from my PC to my Xbox360 using a high speed ethernet cord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my question is: Why is my profile not allowed to play on Xbox Live even though I was just on it?</p>

<p>Sorry. I don't know what else to tell you. The only times you can play online with a silver account is if you're using a 48 hour trial card or it's a free gold weekend. Otherwise you have to have a gold membership. I'm not sure if there was a glitch on your
 account or something that shows you as silver, but as a silver member you're not supposed to be able to play online.</p>

<p>In general, Smwutches is right, paid Gold membership is required to play online multiplayer. Exceptions include promo periods (free Xbox LIVE Gold weekends), trial cards (I've never seen any above 48 hrs), the free month trial for setting up a LIVE account
 for the first time, and perhaps this situation...</p>
<p>IF you set up a LIVE account (without paying for membership) for the first time a month ago and you weren't using a trial card , then you were probably under the free month trial of Gold membership. All profiles get this free month for setting up LIVE for
 the first time. Although, I think your status would've shown as Gold until it ended...</p>
<p>If, however, as I suspect, you've already used up that free month for setting up a LIVE account, weren't using any trial cards and thus your LIVE status is Free/Silver, then check out the following thread for others who experienced the same thing. Unfortunately
 no one seems to know why it happened. Perhaps it was a glitch or a quiet/secret promo?

<h2>            Disabling Skype Auto-Zoom...</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Is there a way to disable Skype Auto-Zoom / Pan feature?</p>
<p>In theory and practice it works great when people in the room always look at the camera but when one or two child move around the place the camera zoom in out out and pan all around the place... Not so cool.</p>
<p>I'd like to disable this feature so the entire room is displayed and my family can see my kids instead of only my ugly mug :)</p>
<p>Thx!</p>
<p>Christian</p>

<p>Yes, that's possible: During your video call use the controller to navigate the selection to your video preview in the &nbsp;bottom right. Use the green "A" button to toggle auto-zoom :) Done</p>

<p>Hi Elko,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Usually, tablets that are in recovery mode utilize the volume buttons for <em>
<em>Enter</em>. Try to press the volume button and observe if the highlighted option changes. If it does, select
<strong>See advanced repair options</strong> &gt; <strong>Troubleshoot </strong>&gt; Advanced
<strong>options </strong>&gt; <strong>System </strong><strong>Restore </strong>or <strong>
Startup </strong><strong>Repair</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to do so, please contact your device manufacturer for further assistance.</p>

                    <p>Ever since my machine was updated to Win 10 Anniversary edition the other day, the font in my command window/console became tiny and unchangeable. Whether I change the font type or size via the Default or Properties menus, nothing works. I've tried rebooting

<p>Hi OldRobbie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are you referring to the sign in&nbsp; screen?... If so, this is one of the NEW features built into Windows 10 May 1903 build. This is perfectly normal. However there are those who do not like the new look, and there&nbsp; is supposedly a "Registry Hack" you
 can do to remove the blur effect. However.. I do Not recommend any hacks to the registry.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best advice I could give is for you to post your feelings about this blurring over on the Feed Back Hub. This way if there are enough upvotes there. then MS may consider adding a switch where you can adjust this in the setting app with a possible Win
 10 Future Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Hope This Helps...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I know this must sound really stupid but there is no menu bar in internet explorer.&nbsp; In fact there are no menu bars in Widows 7 or explorer.&nbsp; That is why it is so hard to use as nothing is easy or straight forward.&nbsp; I just have a screen full of pictures
 that you can swipe along but you can't minimise anything, find favourites or anything that I used to be able to do on XP. I feel like throwing the thing out of the window as it drives me nuts! Apparently I am not alone in this thought, and have yet to find
 anyone who really likes it. All I want to do is find out how to search internet sites I have viewed recently and nothing seems to get me there!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really appreciate all of the advice but it has not helped yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please keep trying.</p>

<h2>            Problem connecting to xbox via laptop - newb question</h2>
                    
<p>Well, another newb question <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimages.bimmerforums.com%2fsmilies%2ffrown.gif" />... I've done the googleing, I've watched the Youtube How to's, gone on xbox forum search, etc...nada<br />
<br />
I have wireless internet and trying to avoid spending the $ on a wireless adapter for my xbox... So I connected via ethernet cable the laptop with wireless internet to the xbox...
<br />
<br />
The first suggestion online was to bridge the lan with the wireless, easier said than done.. At first it wouldn't connect, and give me an error message, then I made a change and it did bridge them, but when bridged I loose internet connection. In properties
 of wireless I have the following two boxes unclicked for this:<br />
<br />
<br />
When I bridge them I loose connection to the internet. I have to have both boxes UNCLICKED to do this:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection
</li><li>allow other network usrs to control or disable the shared internet connection
</li></ul>
<p><br />
Then I tried clicking both boxes in wireless connectoin:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection
</li><li>allow other network usrs to control or disable the shared internet connection
</li></ul>
<p>And it allowed me to connect .<br />
<br />
<br />
Then it didn't work, then it did. ugghhhh... Its taken me an hour each time I go connect online, there has to be an easier way or a setting's wrong or ? OR should I just spend the money on the wireless adapter ?&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would untick those settings and go back to bridging and if you loose connectivity try promiscuous mode
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/302348" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.microsoft.com/.../302348</a> most of the time that will resolve that disconnection issue</p>

    <title>windows 7 logon failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iliveinazoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7 logon failure</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I am running a windows 7 upgrade from Vista on a Dell Inspiron (my son's computer).&nbsp; Upgraded several weeks ago, and it has been running fine.<br />
<br />
Today, he was exiting out of IE, when the computer locked up.&nbsp; He hit ctrl+alt+del in an attempt to close the locked up program, however, the computer was completely frozen, so he opted for a restart.<br />
<br />
Upon restart, he made it past POST, and got to the logon screen (blue with the pretty swirls), but no log on box (where you click to logon).&nbsp; The mouse was functioning.&nbsp; After 30 minutes of waiting I asked the computer to restart.<br />
<br />
It reported that it needed to run startup repair, but this took it back to the same screen, where it stayed for another 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
I have run the diagnostics, everything passed.<br />
<br />
I cannot start in safe mode, I get the message that windows failed to start and needs to run startup repair..........which only takes me back to the swirly screen.<br />
<br />
I tapped f8 and choose "repair", which took me back to the swirly screen.<br />
<br />
Now I have put in the windows 7 DVD that came with my upgrade package.&nbsp; It loaded files quickly, then asked for language etc..........and then took 21 minutes to load the next box which gave me options.&nbsp; However I had the circle (the win7 equivalent to the
 hourglass) for another 15 minutes before it started searching for windows installations.&nbsp; It has now been search for 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
This laptop is only about 5 months old, already had to replace the hard drive once (thank goodness for warranty).&nbsp; I would like to NOT have to reinstall the OS a second time<br />
<br />
Please, would one of you brilliant folks step forward with some wonderful ideas?<br />
It would really make my night.<br />
<br />
thanks!<br />

            Yes, you were very smart to get the warranty. It sounds like you have more hardware issues, possibly the motherboard. Call Dell tech support.

<h2>            Missing Windows Media Centre in Settings after upgrade to Windows 8.1 Pro</h2>
                    &nbsp;Hi.<br />
<br />
I initially upgraded my laptop (then running win7 32-bit) some months ago to windows 8.0 Pro and I had to purchase a key and even added WMC, which I paid $9.9 for. Later, I also upgraded to Win 8.1 Pro for free and added WMC using the key I got 4 Win 8.0 Pro.<br />
<br />
Now, about a month ago, my laptop refused to boot up to the desktop and I had to do a reformat, when reset &amp; refresh didn't work. I re-installed Windows 8.0 Pro x64 from a DVD, but my initial key didn't work (I guessed it was because it was for 32-bit), so
 I had to purchase another one. But, the WMC key worked, so I added it.<br />
<br />
However, I just updated to Win 8.1 Pro x64 and have activated with the win 8.0 pro key I newly bought. But, there's no where in the System settings page for me to add WMC.<br />
<br />
So, how do I go about doing this, so my $9.9 WMC key do not become redundant?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

            <p>I have found out that some&nbsp;Windows 8.1 Editions are supposed to have this issue (not able to install Windows Media Centre).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support2.microsoft.com/kb/2793650/en-us?wa=wsignin1.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, my own does not fall into the category in that MS article. See Attached Screenshot after running this command: "slmgr.vbs /dli" in admin command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke to one MS Support Staff today and after burning my credit for over 30minutes, he asked me to refresh and when I asked him what if refresh do not work, what next, his answer was not coherent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I definitely do not think that refresh would solve this issue: I do not wish to start re-downloading all the myriads of updates I have downloaded and I do not wish to re-install my desktop apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi MDi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue. However, there are some portions&nbsp;of the text that are equivocal and need some clarifications as mentioned below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Having activated Windows 8.0 Pro, what&nbsp;does the phrase,&nbsp;"just updated to Win 8.1 Pro x64 and have activated with the win 8.0 pro key I newly bought" refer to?</li><li>What is the&nbsp;operating system&nbsp;name mentioned in the system properties?</li></ol>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you had Windows 8 pro with Media center, then you should be updated to Windows 8.1 pro with Media center. When you check for updates in Windows store, the update itself would be named as
 Windows 8.1 pro with Windows Media center.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To check this, I would suggest you to check which version of Windows you have in the System information Window. I would suggest you to try these steps:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If it is mentioned as Windows 8.1 Pro with Media center, then it is possible that Windows Media center files are corrupt and hence you are unable to access it. In this case, I would suggest
 you to turn OFF and turn ON the Windows Media Center service and check. Refer to these steps:</span></span></span></span></p>
