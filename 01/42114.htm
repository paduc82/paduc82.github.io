<h2>            Need help fixing some Issues on the new Windows 10 laptop</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Need help with Win 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi Guys,<br />
<br />
My cousin got a new Win 10 laptop yesterday. We need your help with few issues-<br />
<br />
1. We have two old pc's at home, one is running Win XP SP2 and the other one is running Win 7 Ultimate. The first one is connected to the internet via lan cable and the other one via wifi. Is it possible to connect all three computers or at least two of them
 via wi-fi(since we use the same ISP's internet at home and the ip will be the same) using networking or some software so that we can copy/transfer data among them?<br />
<br />
2. From where to download the installer file of Windows 10 Home Single Language? We have got the key using ProduKey, need the setup for the emergencies. If there's any torrent which is not modded or something, then great.<br />
<br />
3. The laptop has one drive named as recovery. How exactly does thing work? The shopkeeper told us to make recovery discs. Let's say we make those discs, then how to recover data using them?<br />
<br />
4. We cannot install Microsoft Security Essentials(MSE) in Win 10 instead it comes preinstalled with Windows Defender. Two issues with this software, first it does not autoscan any usb plugged into the laptop, be it a pen drive or an external hdd. MSE had an
 option for auto scanning USB's. Second issue is that let's say there's any file, say some .exe file when we right click on the file there's no option to scan it with Windows Defender. MSE and every anti virus has atleast this option. Is there any setting to
 enable these functions?<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. If there is a router&nbsp;then you should be able to connect to the same network via Wi-Fi if the PC's have in built Wi-Fi. Just switch the Wi-Fi button on. It would discover the network automatically. You may have to enter the credentials.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You can download&nbsp;Windows 10 Home Single Language from here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Dear Joy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all thanks for replying. Few questions-</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Like I wrote dear that one pc with Win XP SP2 connects via lan so it will not be possible to connect via wifi. Say one pc is on lan and others are on wifi using the same isp with the same ip then can't we connect them together?<br />
</strong></p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I tried this link but it seems that the laptop is auto updating something in the background, probably Windows updates and HP's bloatware so the download speed is very very less. Is there any clean torrent for the same, so that we can pause/resume
 due to slow speeds?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Follow the link below by Andre Da Costa on how to do it: </p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/windows-10-recovery-disc/32a11f4d-610b-4f1f-b1c6-ea373c434fbc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/windows-10-recovery-disc/32a11f4d-610b-4f1f-b1c6-ea373c434fbc</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Andre has given the details but a question though, let's say I create those 6-7 recovery discs, then do I need to insert these discs after following the points as mentioned by Andre-</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can do a clean install a couple ways.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Press Windows key + i</strong></p>
<p><strong>Click Update and Security</strong></p>
<p><strong>Click Recovery</strong></p>
<p><strong>Under Remove everything and reinstall Windows, click Get started</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>or</strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>At the Sign in screen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power icon on the screen</strong></p>
<span>
<p><strong>Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart</strong></p>
<span>
<p><strong>Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears</strong></p>
<span>
<p><strong>Click Troubleshoot</strong></p>
</span></span></span></span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Installing/Restoring the Windows using 6 discs seems odd.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. MSE is replaced with Windows Defender. You can still install third party antivirus compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Let's not talk about third party antivirus softwares on MS forums, JK. MSE is the bes</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>, moreover it is free. So, we are used to it. Leaving the pc with Windows XP SP2 we are using MSE everywhere. Can't we change
 the settings in WD so that it autoscans an USB inserted in the laptop and that we can scan any file by right clicking on it, just like MSE does? If these options are not available then WD is junk and MSE should be released for Windows 10.</strong></p>

            <p>1. You can easily connect the computers by creating and using a workgroup. You can find instructions for creating a workgroup here:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3. The recovery partition has nothing to do with recovering data. It was provided by the laptop's manufacturer in lieu of an installation DVD. It's there to let you reinstall Windows should that be necessary. You definitely *should* burn its contents to
 a DVD (the manufacturer should have provided instructions with the computer, but if you no longer have the instructions, call them or look on their web site), so you are not up the creek without a paddle if your hard drive dies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backing up data is another issue entirely. See my comments on it, below, after point #4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Windows Defender is the new name for what used to be called Microsoft&nbsp; Security Essentials. Do not try to go back to an older version called Microsoft&nbsp; Security Essentials.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><div>
<p><span><span>First of all, almost everyone should be backing up regularly. It is always possible that a hard drive crash, user error, nearby lightning strike, virus attack, even theft of the computer, can cause the loss of everything
 on your drive. As has often been said, it's not a matter of whether you will have such a problem, but when.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Essentially you should back up what you can't afford to lose--what you can't readily recreate. What that is depends on how you use your computer and what you use it for.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<span>It takes time and effort to backup, but it also takes time and effort to recreate lost data. If you back up daily, you should never have to recreate more than one day's worth of lost data. If weekly, there's potentially a lot more
 to recreate. You should assess how much pain and trouble you would have if you lost x days of data, and then choose a backup frequency that doesn't involve more pain and trouble than that you would have if you had to recreate what was lost.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Some things (photographs, for instance) can never be recreated, and more frequent backup may be wanted for them.</span><br />
<span>At one extreme is the professional user who would likely go out of business if his data was lost. He probably needs to back up at least daily. At the other extreme is the kid who doesn't use his computer except to play games. He
 probably needs no backup at all, since worst case he can easily reinstall his games.</span><br />
<span>Most of us fall somewhere between those extremes, but nobody can tell you where you fall; you need to determine that for yourself.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Should you back up Windows? Should you back up your applications? Most people will tell you no, since you can always reinstall these easily from the original media. But I don't think the answer is so clear-cut. Many people have
 substantial time and effort invested in customizing Windows and configuring their apps to work the way they want to. Putting all of that back the way it was can be a difficult, time-consuming effort. Whether you should backup up Windows and apps depends, once
 again, on you.</span><br />
<br />
<span>How to backup? What software to use? There are many choices, including the Windows-supplied backup program. Which choice is best for you depends at least in part on the answers to some of the questions above.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Finally what backup media should you choose, and how should it be stored? There are many choices, including CDs, tape, zip drives, and second hard drives.</span><br />
<br />
<span>I don't recommend backup to a second non-removable hard drive because it leaves you susceptible to simultaneous loss of the original and backup to many of the most common dangers: severe power glitches, nearby lightning strikes,
 virus attacks, even theft of the computer.</span><br />
<br />
<span>In my view, secure backup needs to be on removable media, and not kept in the computer. For really secure backup (needed, for example, if the life of your business depends on your data) you should have multiple generations of backup,
 and at least one of those generations should be stored off-site.</span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<div><span>My computer isn't used for business, but my personal backup scheme uses two identical removable hard drives, I alternate between the two, and make a complete copy of the primary drive.</span></div>
<div><br />
<span>I also use a pair of 16GB thumb drives for making more frequent backups of my most critical data (like financial information). For that I just drag and drop.</span></div>

</p><p>3. The recovery partition has nothing to do with recovering data. It was provided by the laptop's manufacturer in lieu of an installation DVD. It's there to let you reinstall Windows should that be necessary. You definitely *should* burn its contents to
 a DVD (the manufacturer should have provided instructions with the computer, but if you no longer have the instructions, call them or look on their web site), so you are not up the creek without a paddle if your hard drive dies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backing up data is another issue entirely. See my comments on it, below, after point #4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Windows Defender is the new name for what used to be called Microsoft&nbsp; Security Essentials. Do not try to go back to an older version called Microsoft&nbsp; Security Essentials.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><span><span>First of all, almost everyone should be backing up regularly. It is always possible that a hard drive crash, user error, nearby lightning strike, virus attack, even theft of the computer, can cause the loss of everything on your drive. As has
 often been said, it's not a matter of whether you will have such a problem, but when.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Essentially you should back up what you can't afford to lose--what you can't readily recreate. What that is depends on how you use your computer and what you use it for.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<span>It takes time and effort to backup, but it also takes time and effort to recreate lost data. If you back up daily, you should never have to recreate more than one day's worth of lost data. If weekly, there's potentially a lot more to recreate. You should
 assess how much pain and trouble you would have if you lost x days of data, and then choose a backup frequency that doesn't involve more pain and trouble than that you would have if you had to recreate what was lost.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Some things (photographs, for instance) can never be recreated, and more frequent backup may be wanted for them.</span><br />
<span>At one extreme is the professional user who would likely go out of business if his data was lost. He probably needs to back up at least daily. At the other extreme is the kid who doesn't use his computer except to play games. He probably needs no backup
 at all, since worst case he can easily reinstall his games.</span><br />
<span>Most of us fall somewhere between those extremes, but nobody can tell you where you fall; you need to determine that for yourself.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Should you back up Windows? Should you back up your applications? Most people will tell you no, since you can always reinstall these easily from the original media. But I don't think the answer is so clear-cut. Many people have substantial time and effort
 invested in customizing Windows and configuring their apps to work the way they want to. Putting all of that back the way it was can be a difficult, time-consuming effort. Whether you should backup up Windows and apps depends, once again, on you.</span><br />
<br />
<span>How to backup? What software to use? There are many choices, including the Windows-supplied backup program. Which choice is best for you depends at least in part on the answers to some of the questions above.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Finally what backup media should you choose, and how should it be stored? There are many choices, including CDs, tape, zip drives, and second hard drives.</span><br />
<br />
<span>I don't recommend backup to a second non-removable hard drive because it leaves you susceptible to simultaneous loss of the original and backup to many of the most common dangers: severe power glitches, nearby lightning strikes, virus attacks, even theft
 of the computer.</span><br />
<br />
<span>In my view, secure backup needs to be on removable media, and not kept in the computer. For really secure backup (needed, for example, if the life of your business depends on your data) you should have multiple generations of backup, and at least one
 of those generations should be stored off-site.</span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<div><span>My computer isn't used for business, but my personal backup scheme uses two identical removable hard drives, I alternate between the two, and make a complete copy of the primary drive.</span></div>
<div><br />
<span>I also use a pair of 16GB thumb drives for making more frequent backups of my most critical data (like financial information). For that I just drag and drop.</span></div>

<p>Thanks a lot for replying everything in such detail. While we have followed all your points, we are facing one last issue.&nbsp; We have connected the pc and the laptop via the lan cable, the laptop is connected via wifi and the pc with xp via lan cable to the
 modem. The drives of Xp are being shared on 10. But we are not able to connect the printer in xp. Check this error-<br />

<br />
It asks for a password when we click on connect printer in xp. We enter the username(workgroup name) and the password that we use to enter into the laptop, the MS account one, we cannot stop it from coming on the boot screen everytime though. Is that fine?<br />
<br />
Why is it asking for a password?<br />
<br />
When we connect both computers via ip, nothing works. No internet no networking in the pc with xp. 10 is connected via wifi to the internet. Our ISP uses dynamic ip. Is this an issue?<br />
<br />
10 is automatically detecting the wifi as a public group. Is that the reason why in xp it asks for a password? How to change it to private?</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro and the 4th Gen Intel Haswell Processor</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to know, even though the current surface pro is shipping with the 3rd gen Intel processor, will Microsoft change the processor in the later surface pros that it makes now that the 4th gen processor is being released? Or will i have to wait until
 they make surface pro 2? Basically, will this version of surface pro get the newer processor if i wait a few more months before buying it, or do i have to wait til the next generation of surface pros which could be next year or later? Do i wait 3-4 months
 or do I wait a year or more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance &nbsp;</p>

            Nobody knows. But if you are willing to wait for a year, next year you will be talking about the fifth generation processor... Sounds like you don't need the computer otherwise you wouldn't wait that long.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not that i don't need a computer, it's just that i don't mind waiting 3-6months to get a processor that will give the surface pro a longer life. But if it's not going to be til next year then i will get the surface pro this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just wanted to know what Microsoft's game plan so I know if i am waiting or not. So of any Microsoft insider has any info then please let me know.</p>

            They won't tell you.&nbsp; Given that the new proc doesn't come out till June I wouldn't expect a new pro until at least Xmas&nbsp;or a bit later.&nbsp; If the battery life is that important to you&nbsp;I'd wait otherwise get a pro now and enjoy it for what it is.

<div>A Surface Pro with them could occur sooner than later, if it offers &nbsp;better performance and thereby a better marketing platform too for MS., as the competitors will be on board.</div>

            I've seen only some samples nothing for sale, now or&nbsp;June the point is does anyone really expect MS to intro an upgraded pro less than 11-12 months before the first one was released...keep dreaming.

Bad for business??
<div><br />
<div>What is bad for business are the competing models having better specs &amp; performance for same price point... And thereby, reduced or nil sales.... Intel's timing for release trumps.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not big a big leap here... Haswell chips are selling for less or same $$ as the predecessors.</div>

            Is it just conceivable that the new markets release for end of May in UK and elsewhere could have Haswell? &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>This would rely on&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>the delay to new markets being based on MS waiting for Haswell, rather than supply chain problems. &nbsp;Tough one to call - but the delay has been excessive and vague until recently and I am sure I remember reading somewhere that Haswell was the intended processor
 for a surface Pro. &nbsp;So was the US release with a lesser processor forced on them because of the leaks and June announcement last year, but all the time Haswell was the goal?</li><li>Intel giving MS priority over other manufacturers. &nbsp;Entirely believable to me - they have a very long relationship ('Wintel') and I could imagine Ballmer cutting a deal. And if Haswell was the goal, they could have been talking about this to Intel for some
 time.</li><li>They would not call it Surface 2 - just a spec bump to the current model that &nbsp;would be made available worldwide.</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>This could of course just be hopeful speculation from a Brit who would like to have a Haswell Surface Pro. &nbsp;And at the back of my mind, I remember similar hopeful speculation over Windows Phone 7 capabilities and release date that proved &nbsp;to be just that
 - a stupid belief the MS would deliver something amazing and ahead of expectations. &nbsp;So history is not encouraging.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Still if they could pull it off - and deliver an Haswell Surface Pro in June it would certainly stir the market up!</div>

<h3> joe590  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touch input temporarily freezing &#40;about 5 seconds&#41;</h2>
                    <p><span>I was wondering if anyone else is having issues where the touch input stops working for a short period of time (roughly 5 seconds or so usually). It seems to occur mostly at random
 and fairly infrequently when using the machine. However, when I use Drawboard to markup PDFâ€™s it occurs very regularly (just about every time). After I write something with the pen, the touch input seems to temporarily freeze and prevent me from using my finger
 to scroll through the document (for roughly 3-5 seconds). Yes, I have the pen away from the screen. I have also had it&nbsp;occur, much less frequently, when browsing the web with Edge (without the pen).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Yes, I have all the latest updates. I have had the Surface Pro 4 since launch and have been quick to apply each subsequent update as I had many of the same issues everyone else
 was having. The updates have seemed to fix most of the problems I was having with the touch input but this one is still present.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have a love hate relationship with the Surface Pro line (I had the original and now version 4). When it works it is by far the best computer I have ever used (for my needs).
 However, many of the problems have been exceedingly frustrating. </span></p>

            <p>I have tha same issues, but when using OneNote 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me it sometimes looks like the pen is laggin when writing in OneNote. I tried Drawboard PDF one and the writing felt smooth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I will get my 3rd SP4. The first one had battery issues and this one has white bleed and it gets very warm (in the area where the TypeCover is connected) when I am working in OneNote.</p>
<p>I love the device, but those issues are marking it very frustrating sometimes. I hope the new device will be okay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If it's an Xbox Arcade game, then you won't be able to go to a store and buy it on a disk. However, you can go and buy an Xbox Point Card from any game store. The points from the card are used to buy the game instead of using money from a credit card. You
 can also buy the points from your Xbox, though this requires a credit card.</p>

    <title>Dual Monitor Does not wake up from sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dougdrew03  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual Monitor Does not wake up from sleep</h2>
                    Hey all. So my setup right now is i have my laptop connected to a second monitor and im&nbsp;loving it. The only problem is that when i put the computer to sleep, and then wake it back up, the laptop does not automatically project to the second monitor. So
 every time i use my computer i have to go to "project --&gt; extend". Is there a way to make the laptop automatically project to the second monitor when i wake the computer up? I have been looking everywhere for an answer and i cannot find one. Any help would
 be greatly appreciated.

<p>Yes, i have been experiencing this issue since i started using the second monitor. It actually happened with both monitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes it does the same thing on another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The power plan is:</p>
<p>turn off display: 5 min on battery, never plugged in</p>
<p>put computer to sleep: &nbsp;15 min on battery, never when plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and i ran the power troubleshooter and that was it so far, and everything was fine.</p>

<p>To further troubleshoot the dual monitor issue, we suggest that you try the following workaround:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Check the cable connection of your monitor. Try to test if the issue will still persist after using a different cable.</li><li>Change the <strong>Turn off</strong><strong> the display time</strong> in the
<strong>Power Options</strong>. We suggest selecting a longer timeframe from the drop-down menu and check if you will still encounter the issue.</li><li>If you are using a USB mouse and keyboard, you can also change its settings and see if it helps. To get started, open the
<strong>Device Manager </strong><strong>&gt; </strong>locate the <strong>mouse/keyboard
</strong>then click it to expand <strong>&gt; </strong>right-click <strong>mouse/keyboard
</strong>and click <strong>Properties &gt;</strong> Select<strong> Power Management </strong>
tab <strong>&gt; </strong>add a check mark on <strong>Allow this device to wake the computer</strong><strong>.</strong></li></ol>
<p>Once you have tried all of these, let us know the end result. </p>

<h2>            Download for Premier Edition of Battle Field 4 is having download problems</h2>
                    <p>I started downloading the premier edition of Battlefield 4, and it downloaded at lest 6=7 items and then failed.&nbsp; I resume the download, which stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my wireless router I see the comments:</p>
<p>
</p><pre><p><strong>[site blocked: dlassets.xboxlive.com] from source  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</strong>  ( I left my IP address blank here )</p><p>I found that this is a Microsoft account, and is being blocked by my wireless router, for trying to do something that the router does not like.  I presume that the previous premium items that did down load came through this connection also, and at some point the download tried to do something differently than it had been doing before, and the router blocked the downloads.  </p><p /><p>I see many connection attempts from some of the following:</p><p><strong>205.185.216.18</strong></p><p><strong>205.185.216.19</strong></p><p /><p>The commentary on my Xbox stated that something had gone wrong with the downloads, and that it would continue to try.  I keep getting multitudes of errors in my router log, about dlassets.xboxlive.com being blocked, and connection attempts from the above two IP addresses.</p><p /></pre>

<p>Hey Umeweall1!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the issue with the Battlefield 4 installation.</p>
<p>A suggestion to resolve this would be to try the restart console option.</p>
<p>This can be done by&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Pressing the <strong>Xbox</strong> button to open the guide. </div>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Pressing the <strong>Xbox</strong> button will open the guide from any other screen on the console.</p>
</li><li>Selecting <strong>Settings</strong>. </li><li>Selecting <strong>Restart console</strong>. </li><li>Selecting <strong>Yes</strong> to confirm.</li></ol>

            I had tried that previously, and it did no good.&nbsp; I was loading this to my back-up Xbox One.&nbsp; I had just turned the Xbox off finally, but noticed that the update was still trying to run, over time.&nbsp; I finally just unplugged the Xbox, but the download attempts
 still kept happening, and switched to the Xbox One that I normally use.&nbsp; I saw the same on it, as I had seen on the other Xbox One.&nbsp; The download showed as stopped, and when I tried to start it, it would just stop again.&nbsp; I finally just selected the option
 to kill all downloads on my primary box, and the download attempts finally stopped.&nbsp; I was happy, as those attempts kept filling up my router with the IP address of the download sever, in a continuous manner, which was very annoying.

<h2>            Windows 8 boot-up problem, due to an accidental Windows XP installation on another partition</h2>
                    <p>I had Windows 8 Pro on one partition and Windows XP SP3 on another partition for some time and I could choose which one to start. I decided to remove Win XP and format the partition Win XP was installed on. I tried to do this using Win XP CD's formatting
 option that appears before installation; however, I accidentally installed Win XP again on the same partition. The problem is that my laptop no longer recognizes Win 8 and starts on Win XP. I was wondering if by any chance I could retrieve Win 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, the partition which Win 8 is installed on, is intact and healthy with all the windows files in it. Also, I tried to refresh or reset Win 8 installation using Win 8 DVD, however, it did not work; as a message appears saying that the drive is locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your time. </p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Amir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that the boot loader is damaged. You must install the older operating system first, and then install the more recent operating system. If you don't (for example, if you install Windows XP on a computer already running Windows 8), you can render
 your system inoperable. This can happen because earlier versions of Windows don't recognize the startup files used in more recent versions of Windows and can overwrite them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you reinstalled Windows XP on a computer running Windows 8, it has destroyed the boot loader.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Follow these steps.</p>
<p>We need to rebuild the Boot Configuration Data (BCD)&nbsp;. For this we require a Windows 8 installation media. &nbsp;If you do not have a installation, you can create one.<br />
<strong><br />
Refer to this article.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Follow the above article to download Windows 8 setup program.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only</span></a><br />
<strong><br />
To create installation media, following this article.<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>Here are the steps that help fix this issue.</p>
<p><br />
a. Insert the Windows 8 installation media and boot the computer using the disc.<br />
</p>
<p>Note: You need to check the computer manual on how to set CD/DVD drive as the first boot device in the BIOS.</p>
<p>b. Once you boot using the Windows installation disc, on the Windows 8 installation window, click on Repair your computer.</p>
<p>c. Click on&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>&nbsp;and in the<strong>&nbsp;Advanced options</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
d. Select&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt</strong>. Type the following commands into the prompt and press Enter key after each command.</p>
<p><strong>bootrec /fixmbr<br />
bootrec /fixboot<br />
bootrec /scanos<br />
bootrec /rebuildbcd</strong></p>
<p><br />
Once the command completes, restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

<h2>            Night light</h2>
                    night light turns on automatically when I turn my screen on after sometime of inactivity. It has been happening since I updated windows 10 to version 1903. I can't turn it off unless I restart my computer. How can I fix this?

            Hi there,
<br />
<br />Check the settings for night light, as below
<br />
<br />Go to Start  &gt; Settings  &gt; System &gt; Display &gt; Night light setting
<br />Check Schedule, to see if toggle Schedule night light to On
<br />
<br />If it is on, simply turn it off, and that should resolve your issue.
<br />
<br />Thanks!

            Hi khuzaimranawadia
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Night light is an issue in 1903. Though Microsoft has fixed that later on but this issue is still there and not 100% fixed. Best course of action is to wait for the fix to flow in through Windows automatic update in coming weeks.
<br />
<br />However, try actions related to Display Driver as the first level of troubleshooting
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Display Adapter &gt; Right click on entry below &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Rollback the Driver 
<br />Click Properties &gt; Go to Driver tab &gt; If there is rollback option, click it
<br />
<br />B. Update driver from manufacturer's website
<br />Go to the website of the driver's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that &gt; In previous option, click Uninstall &gt; Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />You will need to restart your computer after the above steps.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi khuzaimran
<br />
<br />This is a known bug in version 1903 of Windows 10, many users have reported this to Microsoft, at the moment there is nothing you can do, there is no fix
<br />
<br />Microsoft are working on a fix and when that is ready, that will be pushed onto your PC as a patch . .

<p>Sorry, it is not alright, as you can see by yourself. When you click the mountain symbol then you get prompted for the file you wish to attach. It must be a valid .jpg&nbsp; or .png file. If you are still unable to attach the picture then you could upload it
 to some cloud storage and post the link here.</p>

<p>There is a very long and complex reply&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/backup-encountered-a-problem-while-backing-up-file/560fd627-e40e-4c85-b857-b743f8ba714e">here</a></span>
 on this subject.</p>
<p>Some general thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the backup process is configured properly then it should back up user files. The folder C:\Windows\System32\Config is not a user folder. It should not be included in the list of folders to be backed up.</li><li>Windows Backup has been deprecated and may be partly broken. Microsoft recommends to use a third-party product, e.g. the free version of Macrium Reflect.</li></ul>

    <title>Performance issues with File Explorer in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Performance issues with File Explorer in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have upgraded windows 10 from windows 8. Initially it worked pretty well. But after some updates it simply slowed down the File Explorer &amp; overall response time. For example :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1] When I launch File Explorer or click on my computer it takes more time to open the file explorer,</p>
<p>2] Once file explorer opens &amp; I select a file there to drag &amp; drop into other app the waiting sign shows up nothing happens further,</p>
<p>3] When I right click on any of the files waiting sings appears remains for almost 8 to 10 seconds,</p>
<p>4] Basically each &amp; every keystroke, mouse click pops up waiting sign on my machine,</p>
<p>Also the windows button doesn't work whenever I press windows button from keyboard nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details About my Machine :&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lenovo G50 - with AMD-A8 processor,</p>
<p>1 TB hard disk, 8GB of RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried :&nbsp;</p>
<p>1] Cleaned temp files &amp; tried running disk defragmenter,</p>
<p>2] sfc /scannow in admin command prompt</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing worked me, this is really frustrating :(</p>

            <p>Hello Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in&nbsp;Microsoft Community and we regret for the inconvenience. Let me assist you to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Boot the computer in safe mode with networking, and&nbsp;check if the issue still persist.&nbsp;This is a diagnostic step towards identifying and isolating the main cause of the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Safe Mode With Networking:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
</span><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong><span> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using. Please follow the steps outlines in the below article.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Once this is done, reboot the computer in normal mode and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue does not occur in Safe mode, try to place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if there are any third party application/software to be causing the issue.

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thanks for your detailed reply I have tried all above three suggestions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method2:</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Scan for&nbsp;malicious&nbsp;software did not detected any such software.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Method3:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Above command did not showed any health issue over the console. But still I executed the next command as follows:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>But in case of <strong>Method1</strong> <strong>clean boot</strong> somewhat improved the performance of my system on starting machine. But as I continue my regular work the system shows slowness again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I doubt there must be service which is slowing down the machine &amp; it must be associated with some installed application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any tools to detect such service ? Or any other tool which might come handy in above situation ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks In Advance</p>

    <title>No USB devices detected at all, occasionally - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> itphoenix1  say:</h3>
<h2>            No USB devices detected at all, occasionally</h2>
                    <p>On 7 x64, sometimes the system fails to detect (not "not recognized") any USB device at all, whether a fresh connect, or on a reboot when they were detected.&nbsp; There was a setting problem, but I am not sure which one, or group of settings, improved the situation,
 from almost continual lack of detection.&nbsp; Now most of the time they are detected, even on a reboot if left in a port.&nbsp; There were also random system freezes here and there&nbsp;especially with IE10--mouse and keyboard unresponsive. These are the settings that were
 changed thus far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removed all USB devices and ran with PS/2 mouse an keyboard.&nbsp; Reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalled all ghost entries in Device Manager relating to any and all USB devices, and deleted INFCACHE.1 from the Driver Store.&nbsp; Reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No change, so tried shutdown, kill power, hold power button in for 20 seconds, restore power.&nbsp; Boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repeated all of the above several times, but noticed the uninstalling of the USB controllers and hubs--alone--always&nbsp;had a positive effect&nbsp;for a short time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set the service, <span>Windows Driver Foundation,&nbsp;to Automatic Start.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Set the registry key, "</span><span>ServicesPipeTimeout" to decimal 120000.&nbsp; Reboot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then went to the BIOS and set "Legacy USB Support" to enabled. This was set to disabled, and on my machine, it is necessary if booting from a USB device is necessary.&nbsp; Then on reboot, the light on a known good flash drive lighted before the OS started,
 and stayed lighted throughout the boot process.&nbsp; Needless to say, it was available and worked perfectly after logging in.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Removing&nbsp;and reinserting the drive worked flawlessly, as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On&nbsp;one subsequent&nbsp;reboot without the drive inserted, then inserting it after logon, it failed detection.&nbsp; So instinctively I went to uninstall the USB controllers and hubs starting with "Standard Enhanced PCI to USB Controller", but I disabled it instead,
 and the stereo was connected with the volume fairly high, and the sweet sound of detection was heard. And it worked perfectly, as expected. A cloud came up announcing the device could run faster.&nbsp;
</span><span>The controller in question provides Version 2.0 of the USB standard for&nbsp;High Speed (480Mbs).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>With the controller disabled, any USB flash drive and a camera all work as they should.&nbsp; Enabled, everything is good for a few days.&nbsp; When this happens, Event Viewer reports the flash drive driver failed to load ID 219 (212).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There is also this error on a regular basis:&nbsp;&nbsp;"<span>Audit events have been dropped by the transport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;1101"&nbsp; This points to a slow processor or hard drive.&nbsp; It is not the processor, but I would believe the drive is a little slow--a 7,400 rpm IDE drive with a small cache, but it is new and SMART says perfect.&nbsp; There is 2GB RAM so there is no
 paging, and MEMTEST says perfect as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another I just noticed again but does not occur too often is, "Kernel-EventTracing&nbsp; ID 2&nbsp;Session&nbsp; (NT Kernel logger failed to start).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So the question is,&nbsp;what is the&nbsp;best way&nbsp;go about finding the cause of this, now occasional, USB failure at High Speed only?</span></p>
<p>

            <p>To be more specific, the problem was rooted in the fact that my motherboard does not support anything beyond XP, XPx64, and 2003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The technologies are there, but it&nbsp;was the W7 interrupts and the absence of a PCIe x16 slot that was causing latency problems. So the slow IDE drive was just a mismatch in this scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving to a fast SATA drive solved all issues.&nbsp; But even though W7 provided the Serverworks HT1000 chipset driver, it did not have the RAID controller driver, which is necessary to utilize the SATA interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, I found a signed driver on the HP site, which is provided for their Proliant servers.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I could not find a 32 bit SATA driver that would load, so the Recovery Disk would not show the drive, and I could not install the disk image
 I had made (to save time)&nbsp;to the new drive.&nbsp; So a clean install worked with the 64 bit driver.&nbsp; As soon as it was loaded, the drive appeared in the list of available targets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, MS has been saved from condemnation.&nbsp; If the motherboard manufacturer had decided to support the new OSs, it would have provided the drivers and technical support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this scenario, since the video is taxing the PCI bus, it&nbsp;would have been a good idea&nbsp;to obtain a video card with 512MB of memory (which is as high as they go it seems).&nbsp; I have a 256MBcard &nbsp;installed which will not withstand a WEI test without BSOD, unless
 acceleration is disabled on&nbsp;the Microsoft H264 Video Decoder MFT.&nbsp; Then I can run the test.&nbsp; The results show a very low score for Aero and graphics, as expected.&nbsp; There is very little ghosting when dragging windows across the screen, but it is obvious there
 is a shortfall of performance since I notice a slight delay when collapsing windows. And this is with all the animation and fading disabled in Visual Effects under Performance options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps things could be improved with some setting changes, but videos play perfectly from the internet and from DVD disk, so I will leave it alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just thought I would add this information for those who may be interested.&nbsp; This experience reminded me of the adage, "Hardware first, then comes the software."</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their<br />
supplied drivers. Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation and <br />
drivers, and ask in their forums. <br />

<div>I am running this web application in a Windows Server 2012 R2, 64bit operating system.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am struggling on analyzing these crash dump information. I tried searching for related posts regarding this crash issue and one suggestion I got is to set Enable32BitApplication to true for application pool which I have to try yet (Reference link -</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>https://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/3f0722ba-90a2-4167-90b4-01181aec9ee4/kernelbaseraiseexception68-when-calling-asmx-webmethod?forum=Offtopic)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can someone further explain significance of setting this Enable32BitApplication&nbsp; to true as solution to this issue?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Or any guidance in further troubleshoot this crash will&nbsp; be much appreciated.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Thank you.</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>solution is do not use "Reinstall". You must Uninstall game and Install it once again. It help me.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why a specific application is not installing properly on Windows Store. One of which is corrupted Windows store cache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to isolate the root cause of the issue, we need the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What specific messaging app are you trying to reinstall?</li><li>Is the issue happening when installing other applications?</li><li>Are you using a PC or a Windows phone?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response</p>

    <title>No internet connection on my Protab - Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No internet connection on my Protab - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have just purchased a Protab which is running Windows 10.</p>
<p>When I first started it up it picked up my wireless signal and was working fine.</p>
<p>The wireless icon was visible on the Taskbar at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>When I turned it on today (next day) the wireless icon was missing and when I clicked on the IE icon it said "you're not connected.</p>
<p>I checked my cables. I made sure I was not in Airplane Mode. I have no "wireless switch" on the Tablet. I restarted my router.</p>
<p>I went to Network Settings. Clicked on Network &amp; Internet. Only wireless device listed is Bluetooth, which is On.</p>
<p>I even reset the tablet.</p>
<p>I am at a loss to know why I can't get internet / WiFi.</p>
<p>Any help would be gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yes it is a bit technical however one step at a time and it becomes a lot easier.<br />
<br />
1st check the top part of the troubleshooter posted on Tuesday, March 30, 2010 4:17 AM.<br />
Do that check and the main User possible solutions are to update the major drivers as in<br />
the message posted on Tuesday, March 30, 2010 4:18 AM.<br />
<br />
After updating drivers if the same problem still persists then I would uninstall my antvirus<br />
just to see if it were causing the issue. Be careful while it is uninstall and better is to down-<br />
load a replacement such as Avast to use while waiting to see if the problem is still there.<br />
<br />
Any hardware related issues, if it narrows down to those, will need technical support from<br />
a real computer shop or the System maker's Support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> xman2010  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 64-bit randomly freezes.</h2>
                    
<p>I&nbsp;recently purchased two laptop computers, one is a Fujitsu with T6500 which I upgraded from Vista 64-bit to Windows 7, the other is a Toshiba with P7450 preinstalled with Windows 7. Both have&nbsp;randomly freezing problems. The&nbsp;Toshiba has far&nbsp;more freezing
 than the Fujitsu. I have changed&nbsp;both power option to High Proformance. The Toshiba&nbsp;still freezes frequently. Apprenantly it is a Windows 7 problem, not related to any specific computer or hardware. I hope Microsoft can acknowledge and address this problem
 ASAP, unlike TOYOTA with their cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            hey xman2010, I am having the same problem with random freezing as well on my desktop machine. I too have upgraded to Win7 and been having these random freeze with my machine. So far I have reseated the ram and ran a memtest86 it passed with flying colors,
 reseated the vid card, reinstalled the video drivers (both the original drivers and the newest from nvidia). Along sfc /scannow and verification comes back clear. I am at a lost on what else do to I have also come to the same conculsion that it is Windows
 7 and MS need to address this. I would like to direct you to another forum where people are having similar issues with random system freezes too. http://tinyurl.com/freezingproblem &lt;-- Strongly suggest you visit this forum. Update: OK here is the newest dump
 file and error report http://tinyurl.com/dump02062010 &lt;-- 02062010 dump file Problem signature: Problem Event Name: BlueScreen OS Version: 6.1.7600.2.0.0.768.3 Locale ID: 1033 Additional information about the problem: BCCode: 116 B

            This post-dates your problem, but for other people experiencing freezing issues with Win7 64-bit after late March, try uninstalling Microsoft Update KB980302
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That update caused the same problem for me, and others.</p>

            I was having this same issue, Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit freezing randomly whenever I let the computer go idle for a minute or longer.&nbsp; I finally had success fixing this issue when I went into the Advanced Power Settings and under "Hard disk" I changed
 the option of letting it "Turn off the hard-disk" to "Never" when I have the computer plugged in.&nbsp; Whenever my computer froze before I had to close the lid and let my laptop go to sleep and then wake it up again to resume work, but after I changed the "Turn
 off the hard-disk" setting in my Advanced Power Options I haven't had the freezing issue reoccur.&nbsp; Worth a shot maybe?
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I think with the 64-bit operating system there's a bug somewhere when it has the hard-drive set to go to sleep after a certain amount of time, because that amount of time doesn't need to pass and the computer still freezes if you let it stand idle just a minute
 or 2.
