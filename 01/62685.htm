<p>i played it for a few weeks when it went f2p on playstation a while back, it's not terrible. somewhat interesting story/world, okay combat when it doesn't lag, cutscenes...not a great game, but i guess it's fun enough to waste some time in if you enjoy mmo's
 that aren't world of warcraft.</p>

<p>You can play with up to 10,000 people in this game.</p>
<p>This game is in somewhat like destiny. some ways better, some ways not better but I cant say worse.</p>
<p>The map in this game is HUGE.</p>
<p>It is rare to find mean people in this game. they can really only be mean by challenging you and killing you.
</p>
<p>The game is very, very, VERY, LOOOOOONG. If you like long stories, TONS of game play, many upgrades, or you just don't have many games to play, even if you like FPS games but your not super into Call of Duty, killing aliens and robotic type of things, etc
 etc etc.... get this game. </p>
<p>Its free, you don't have to buy any perks, and it is a very good game.</p>

<p>I am really enjoying Defiance. I love the fact you can play this at your own pace by yourself rarely meeting up with people unless you bump into people at Arkfalls or Incursions(which the help is appreciated for those)</p>
<p>I have currently been playing this on the PS3 as the 360 FTP Defiance was still in the works but will most likely grab this for my 360 as well as it would have been my preferred choice to pick.</p>

<p>Yellowjacket, is there a way to transfer your game save from xbox 360 to the ps3? I bought the disc for like 7 bucks a while back, but then I stopped playing it because my friends didn't own it, so I felt weird playing by myself lol</p>
<p>hopefully more people will play it now that its free</p>
<p>Ill try to post more forums about it cause im sure Microsoft isn't going to advertise this for a while</p>

            On a new build is has to be a hardware issue. Remove ALL power then reseat the cards, memory, and cables (on both ends when possible) - actually remove and replace&nbsp;- do not just snug.<br />
<br />
You can also try making the system as simple as possible, including minimum memory, to see if that helps.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
You can also test the memory.<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;&nbsp; Windows Memory Diagnostics&nbsp;<br />

<br />
A home build can be particularly difficult to troubleshoot the hardware due to the lack of known good parts to swap in and out.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<p>I had the very same problem transferring from Vista to 10.&nbsp; I need to transfer all setting, even on older programmes but a&nbsp;lot of my data did not transfer across, especially an older version of Family Tree which I had a lot of stuff saved on.&nbsp;They no longer
 have that particular programme and I had to download a newer version which is no use to me whatsoever.&nbsp; I had to do the same for ITunes and Picasa but thankfully, I did not have a problem with Picasa, only with I Tunes and Family&nbsp;Tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;Updating to a new format
 was not a problem with my documents though I did have to buy the new Word programme so I could access&nbsp;all of my stuff.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a real shame that Easy Transfer does not work for Vista, only the later versions of Windows.&nbsp; Sometimes , whilst trying to "improve" services, a lot of companies throw the baby out with the bath water.&nbsp; It's much more lucrative for companies to make
 the customer "improve" too than trying to accommodate their needs.</p>

            <p>I have this problem with Works 7. Per instructions I downloaded this fix, but it checks to determine if I have the version of Works for which it is intended. Since I do not, it won't install. Any other ideas?</p>
<p>Whenever I get this "out of memory" message, Works will go ahead and print, but it won't print in landscape orientation.</p>
<p>P.S. I need to change my email address to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

<h2>            Xbox one X&#58; Screen keeps going blank every few seconds when in 4k mode</h2>
                    <p>So, I bought the Xbox one and all was great until I switched to the 4k resolution in settings. It shows up just fine but then every few seconds the signal refreshes itself, causing everything to go blank momentarily but then it's back and does it again after a few seconds. I've unplugged and rebooted everything and it still persists. Interestingly the refresh is even occuring during the Xbox boot sequence. However if I switch back to 1080p everything is fine. My TV is a Sceptre 4k, so it is a cheap one but it supports 4k at 60hrtz, HDMI 2.0 with hdcp 2.2, only thing it doesn't have is HDR. I have a&nbsp;Chromecast ultra that has no issues with 4k.</p><p>I tried another HDMI and it's the same. My best guess is it's either an Xbox one X driver/hardware issue or somehow compatibility with my off- brand 4k tv. If anyone has any insight that would be great! Thanks in advance.&nbsp;<br /></p>

            Yes, following your instruction I can display picture on Window Live Photo Gallery. But This Window Live Photo Gallery functionality was much limited. Actually it shows totally different user interface, any editing related&nbsp;functionality&nbsp;are gone. There
 is not much&nbsp;different to Window Photo Viewer.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I &nbsp;then selected all folders, there is no "add to gallery" item given on list for me to pick for the folder.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The security setting of My Picture gives me a full control over My Picture folder. Other user can only read.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you very much to take time helping me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards.</div>

            <p>Once you use the open with, wlpg&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on the top left listing, edit, organize or share this should open the real wlpg,</p>
<p>When it does open, the toolbars will change and if you left click the photo and the hit the enter key it will open in the full editing page.</p>
<p>This is just the process you have to do in windows explorer to open up wlpg.</p>
<p>It's the long way around the barn, but that's the way it was designed, when wlpg isn't the default picture handler,</p>
<p>If wlpg was the default, you could simply left click a photo and it would open to the first page, or right click and select open,&nbsp;without using open with, wlpg</p>

            Thanks to given some more instructions to try on. I love to learn some new tricks.
<div><br />
<div>Here is what I got by following them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>By left click on the lop left menu, edit, organize or share, the real wlpg opens up.&nbsp;</div>
<div>As soon as wlpg opens, the picture&nbsp;disappears.&nbsp;</div>
<div>So this two wlpgs must use different&nbsp;executable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I went back to window explore and changed my picture file to open with wlpg as a default app.</div>
<div>After that, there are no pictures shown in my folder. So I quickly changed it back with windows photo viewer as a default.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is that JPEG format that photo gallery can't view? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again and&nbsp;I am willing to try anything to make it work.</div>

<p>Also look into this solution as to why wlpg won't open,</p>
<p>(944221) Windows Live Photo Gallery stops <br />
responding or will not start<br />

(depending on version, database could also be <br />
Pictures.pd5)</p>
<p>Also click the start button, then click on default programs on the list, then click on set your default programs, if wlpg is listed click on it and then click on close,</p>
<p>Seem windows photo viewer is your default now and can be changed back if wlpg still will not open.</p>

<div>None of above works on my machine.</div>

<div>But &nbsp;the pictures under folder&nbsp;C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Stationery can be viewed on wlpg.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is no real different of those pictures,&nbsp;except that my pictures are in c:/users&nbsp;folder.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>And any pictures under C:/users can not be viewed by wlpg even if it is a public pictures came with machine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>By coping some pictures from c:/users into&nbsp;C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Stationery folder, &nbsp;those pictures became view-able by wlpg.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am not sure what makes difference but &nbsp;c:/users folder was set as&nbsp;hidden&nbsp;by default.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;It does not make any different &nbsp;if I change users folder into a&nbsp;view-able one.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;Maybe user data gets special protect by system so that &nbsp;wlpg can not search it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>But I would think user pictures should be able to be viewed and edited by wlpg instead of the other way around.</div>

            <p>Right click the my pictures listing on the left side folders tree, and select properties, on the general tab section uncheck the hidden box if it's black in the attributes, this should remove it from all the folders in this area.</p>
<p>You can also click on organize on the top left, click on folder and search options, then click on the view tab section, and check the box for show hidden folders, files and drives, then apply and okay.</p>
<p>These files came from a different computer, if yes windows will isolate them from the new system,</p>
<p>You can also test this by dragging one folder that is not being read by wlpg to your desktop, it should say move to, desktop.</p>
<p>Open wlpg and see if it finds this folder.</p>
<p>If it does not read this folder still, drag the desktop folder to the my pictures listing on the folder tree in wlpg, it should say move to, my pictures.</p>
<p>I'll add make sure your signed into wlpg, and the other user is not, just look on the top right and make sure your user profile is shown.</p>

    <title>Will This Work&#63; &#40;VGA, 3.5mm audio setup&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Will This Work&#63; &#40;VGA, 3.5mm audio setup&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I just have a quick question and am wondering if this will actually work properly. The scenario is: I want to be able to hit up some Xbox at night, and to do so without interfering with the rest of my household, I'd like to use my computer monitor in a different
 room, and headphones.</p>
<p>Now, my computer monitor is a bit older, it only has a VGA input, so I'd be connecting the Xbox up to it by purchasing the
<a href="http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=Xbox+360+VGA+cable&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;prmd=ivns&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=851&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=17919546747242084942&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ctn-TbCXG8Te0QHoipSbAw&amp;ved=0CGMQ8wIwAA#ps-sellers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox 360 VGA cable</a>. However, my monitor has no built in speakers, and therefore has no RCA jacks for the RCA cable components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where I'd like to go as direct to headphones as possible. I saw I could buy something like the TurtleBeach XLC's which include a female RCA to male RCA AND female 3.5mm. The XLCs would do game audio and voice chat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I don't really care if I get voice chat or not, and I'm debating even getting the XLCs at all, but I know I will need the RCA splitter at the very least. This is like I said, sold with the XLC headset, OR seperately from TurtleBeach.
<a href="http://STORE.TURTLEBEACH.COM/x1rcasplittercable35mmftorcam-1.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Here is the link</a></p>
<p>REGARDLESS of if I use the RCA splitter to go to the XLCs, or another pair of headphones I already own, will this setup actually work? Can I use the RCA splitter to send the audio signal to the 3.5mm and my headphones, WITHOUT connecting the male RCA side
 to something like a TV? I don't see why I couldnt bypass the RCA altogether and just go solely with the headphones for my game audio, but I wanted to be 100% sure before I made this whopping $11 investment (potentially $36 if I bother to get the XLCs)</p>
<p>Thanks so much!!<br />

            The log at the account contains paid calls only. That is why you are not able to see incoming.
<br />
<br />With new Skype, it has become complicated now to get log. But I am making it simpler for all as call database is in .db format and you need to retrieve from there.
<br />
<br />1. Download below utility from <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/skype_log_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/skype_log_view.html</a>
<br />
<br />2. Now, you need to follow following path
<br />C:\Users\ABCDEFGH\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.SkypeApp_kzf8qxf38zg5c\LocalState\live#3aIJKLMNOP
<br />Where ABCDEEFGH - Your computer's user name
<br />IJKLMNOP - Your Skype ID
<br />Here is your log file which is named main.db
<br />
<br />In case you are having problem in locating this, you can simply go to following path and search for main.db (ABCDEEFGH - Your computer's user name)
<br />C:\Users\ABCDEFGH\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.SkypeApp_kzf8qxf38zg5c\
<br />
<br />Now, you need to copy this path from File Explorer and put this in Nirsoft utility. This will give you log

<p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, you can choose the ringing device on Skype for Business. However you can only choose only one device for ringing. Hence, if the sound insulation of your headset is not obviously good, I suggest you set up the ringing notification in Mac
 to avoid Skype calls missing.</p>

<p>I appreciate the note, but the problem is that IM notifications appear to go through the Speakers vs. Ringing. &nbsp;So, my use case is not unusual...I am a professional that uses Skype for IM's throughout the day and for Conference calls. &nbsp;That is, I do not
 have my headset on during the day unless I am on a call. &nbsp; Currently, the IM notification only appears to go to the headset and since it is sitting on a charger, the sound is never heard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am interested in any type of workaround or fix similar to Windows version where IMs can notify via laptop speakers so that it isn't lost and still be able to use a headset for calling.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Skype for Business for Mac can only set up one device as your speakers, if you only use headset when in a Skype call, then you can configure&nbsp;your
<strong>Speakers&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>Ringing&nbsp;</strong>as <strong>Built-in Output</strong>. From my test, the sound of IM notifications and Skype call notification will appear in your Mac. Meanwhile, since Microphone is set as your headset, you can still use
 it to communicate in a Skype call or conference call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

<p>Unfortunately, If I am following this correctly is that the net result ends up being that my conference calls would come through laptop speakers in order to get notifications through laptop speakers.&nbsp; &nbsp;That, in an office environment, is simply not feasible.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;My challenge (I think) remains the same.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would like voice (input and output) to be through headset while notifications (rings or IM notification sounds) come through laptop speaker.&nbsp; &nbsp;Again, essentially the same experience that I currently get while working
 in Skype-for-Business on a Windows machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, when you connect your headset to your computer, there'll be a prompting window to remind you whether switch to your headset.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94d2db4a-bcaf-4ffb-9eb1-1cabc9eee19f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94d2db4a-bcaf-4ffb-9eb1-1cabc9eee19f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So the workaround is to connect your headset to your laptop after you hear the notifications of Skype call or conference call. And pull out your headset after you hang up. This is a bit troublesome but can get the same experience
 as in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Open Powershell as administrator the run following cdmlet
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work, review following link for more options:

            Hi BananaFrappe,
<br />
<br />it appears that this is quite a common issue after a bit of research online and it seems that someone has found a trick to help with this;
<br />
<br />take a look at the article below as this may help with this;
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/fix-live-tiles-not-updating-windows10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.maketecheasier.com/fix-live-tiles-n...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />However it has also been mentioed that if you right click and uninstall the app and redownload this from the store this may resolve the issue       
        </p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />See if re-pinning these tiles helps you! 
<br />
<br />Else, run Windows Store Apps troubleshooter from Settings app &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

<p>I read that article, but I'm not sure if I understood it fully. Did it say that it will only update the information on restarting my computer? ...and not periodically while it's running? Isn't it supposed to be constantly updating itself with new data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the fix addresses the latter, I will give it a shot. If it's the former, let me know, and I'll still probably give it a shot, but as I'm always nervous dealing with regedit (as I do not know what I am doing), I will look to other possible solutions first.</p>

            What that should do is each time you restart and boot up the cache is cleared for these apps,<br /><br />If clearing the cache for the apps fixes the issues, this should ensure each time you restart the cache is cleared

<h2>            WIN 7 Driver Power State Failure 9F, &#123;4, 258, 851d9a70, 8293bb24&#125;</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently performed a clean install of Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; I have started encountering the driver power state failure whenever the laptop (ThinkPad R61) is connected to the internet and I perform a shut down or restart.&nbsp; Minidumps (see below)
 point to a problem in umbus.sys.&nbsp; While I have seen other similar postings, I haven't seen a solution for exactly the same argument values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; I have checked for updated drivers under UMBus Root Bus Emulator - Result was I have the latest drivers installed.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.&nbsp;</p>

<div>No. Just my laptop speaker.</div>

<div>I dunno if this helps. I own a Toshiba and it has some kind of power plan (<b>eco</b>), I do not use it and I doubt if it is the cause.</div>

<div>In addition, I noticed that after changing the audio file for the <b>Default Beep
</b>in the sound settings seems, the repeated sound changed from from Windows Ding to the one I selected. I guess there is a setting or program using the

Removing Safari solved the issue for me.

================================<br />
Unfortunately...that is not an option in Photo Gallery.<br />
<br />
Four alternatives for manually adding text...<br />
<br />
1) You can add text to the face of a photo with <br />
Windows Paint.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 - Getting Started With Paint - Tutorial<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Getting-started-with-Paint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Getting-started-with-Paint</a><br />
(scroll down to :&nbsp; Add Text)<br />
<br />
The text will be permanent so you may want <br />
to create a copy of your photo to experiment <br />
with.<br />
<br />
2) And the freeware Picasa has several options<br />
for adding text to photos.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create<br />
a System Restore point before installing<br />
software or updates)<br />
<br />
Picasa<br />
<a href="http://picasa.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://picasa.google.com/</a><br />
(you may want to uncheck some of <br />
the options on the final install screen)<br />
<br />
After downloading and installing Picasa...<br />
open the program and double left click<br />
an image to open the editing features.<br />
<br />
To add text to the face of the photo...<br />
choose...Basic Fixes / Text Button...<br />
<br />
Picasa - 'Basic Fixes' features: Crop, Add Text, Retouch<br />
<a href="http://support.google.com/picasa/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=93403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.google.com/picasa/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=93403</a><br />
<br />
Picasa - Printing text and borders with photos<br />
<a href="http://support.google.com/picasa/answer/106191?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.google.com/picasa/answer/106191?hl=en</a><br />
<br />
3) Faststone Image Viewer is another alternative:<br />
<br />
The following instructions will prepare the photos <br />
with the EXIF Time/Date stamp then you can print <br />
them.<br />
<br />
The freeware FastStone Image Viewer can add <br />
EXIF Time/Date to the face of your photos in a batch.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
FastStone Image Viewer<br />
<a href="http://www.faststone.org/FSViewerDetail.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.faststone.org/FSViewerDetail.htm</a><br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7)<br />
<br />
I suggest that you create a new folder and add<br />
copies of your photos for experimental purposes.<br />
If you are unhappy with the result your originals<br />
will be untouched.<br />
<br />
After FastStone is downloaded and installed...<br />
open the program and go to...<br />
<br />
Tools / Open Batch Convert / Batch Convert tab...<br />
<br />
Check the box...Use advanced options...<br />
<br />
Advanced Options button / Text tab /<br />
Check the box...Add Text...<br />
<br />
(You'll have to experiment with position and font<br />
size and color to achieve the result you desire.)<br />
(text size will have to be adjusted depending on <br />
the size of the photos)<br />
<br />
Open the drop window..."Insert a Variable"<br />
choose...EXIF Date Time / Date And Time...<br />
(in the white field you should&nbsp; see&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ($H1)<br />
Left click...OK<br />
<br />
On the Batch Convert tab...in the left field...<br />
Left Click the square button "Select Source Folder"<br />
Browse to and select the photos you wish to<br />
append.<br />
<br />
Left click the Add button to move the files to <br />
the right field.<br />
<br />
Choose an Output Format...<br />
<br />
Choose an Output folder...<br />
<br />
Click the Convert button...<br />
<br />
This is much easier to do than it is to explain so <br />
give it a try before you say "Good Grief...that's too<br />
much work".<br />
<br />
4) The following online site may be worth a look.<br />

<p>I have two controllers being used, one wired one not. I am playing minecraft (2 people playing) for the first time today. I started the console and game up&nbsp;and the right stick (to turn left/right) on the wired controller&nbsp;stopped working although I can successfully
 push it in to crouch. I unplugged it, tried different ports, etc. I re-booted and fired up minecraft again&nbsp;and now the wireless right stick won't work (although I can crouch)&nbsp;though now the<em> wired controller</em> works just fine. I checked the controller
 settings in minecraft and everything is fine.&nbsp;I changed the batteries on the wireless and&nbsp;there are no routers or&nbsp;any potentially disruptive signals&nbsp;near me.&nbsp;Please help!</p>

<br />To solve this issue follow the steps below:
<br />
<br />1) Update, rollback or reinstall the Driver
<br />
<br />2) Run Windows System File Checker 
<br />Open cmd as Administratior and type 
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />
<br />3) Check for Hard Drive Corruption
<br />Open cmd as Administratior and type 
<br />chkdsk /f
<br />
<br />4) Run troubleshooter
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot. Scroll down. Click Hardware and Devices. Click Run the Troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />5) Edit registry (before do backup !) 
<br />Follow the steps from here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/314060/your-cd-or-dvd-drive-is-not-recognized-by-windows-or-other-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/314060...</a>

<p>I've done some of your recommendations:</p>
<p>
</p><p>sfc /scannow:&nbsp; Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f:&nbsp; The type of the file system is NTFS.&nbsp; Cannot lock current drive.<br />
Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another process.&nbsp; Would you like to schedule this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts?&nbsp; (Y/N)<br />
<strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; I have an F hard drive.&nbsp; I had renamed my CD/DVD drive to drive B so I did chkdsk /b and received the same message even though there is no hard drive B.<br />
<br />
Run troubleshooter &gt; Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot. Scroll down. Click Hardware and Devices.
<br />
"Your PC must be restarted.&nbsp; Restart your PC to finish installing drivers and updates."</p>
<p>

<p>Well, I tried Repairing Windows but it was a no-go.&nbsp; It was "preparing to Repair Windows" for about a 1/2 hour until I rebooted, went into BIOS, and made CD ROM drive first in boot order and told it to boot from CD.&nbsp; That got me to my desktop.&nbsp; In My Computer,
 my C drive wasn't listed.&nbsp; So I decided to do a Defender scan to see if I picked something up.&nbsp; It took a couple of hours but it found nothing but, in the meanwhile, my C drive reappeared in My Computer again.&nbsp; I don't know why it disappeared, why it reappeared
 or if it'll be there when I reboot tomorrow.&nbsp; I'm going to do another sfc /scannow as Administrator.&nbsp; When I did one a few hours ago, it said that the drive was good but when I rebooted, Windows wouldn't boot up.&nbsp; It's a 2Tb drive with only Windows, less than
 2Tb of documents, and very few programs on it.&nbsp; It has 1.67Tb free space.</p>
<p>
I haven't gotten around to see if there is a corrupt Registry entry yet.&nbsp; It's late and I'll save that for tomorrow if Windows will boot up in the morning.<br />

<p>I had gone into Device Manager and updated the drivers for the CD/DVD drive but none were available when I asked Windows to look for them.&nbsp; Since my CD/DVD drive is no longer available in Device Manager, I have no way to install drivers

            Hi Denise,
<br />
<br />Indeed, regarding new build version some issues regarding CD/DVD were reported, but usually the steps below solved all of them.
<br />
<br />Some exception is compatibility. This depends on what is your device was made for.
<br />
<br />Regarding your device model, look here <a href="https://www.pioneerelectronics.com/PUSA/Computer/Computer+Drives/DVR-216D#manuals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pioneerelectronics.com/PUSA/Compute...</a>
<br />
<br />It  "Works with Microsoft:registered: Windows:registered: operating systems including:
<br />Microsoft Windows Vista:registered: Home/Business/Ultimate, Windows 2000,
<br />Windows XP, and Windows ME"
<br />
<br />There are no any mentioning about Windows 10. Yes, sometime old devices are working with Windows 10, but technically should not.
<br />
<br />Here you should better to contact your developer and consulted is it possible to set it up on W10 (new build). In other way you should use other device, or use different OS build where this device was recognised.
<br />
<br />If you have questions let me know       
        </p>

<p>I installed Windows 10 using the CD/DVD drive that is now not recognized by Device Manager.&nbsp; The CD/DVD drive worked well with Windows 10 for over a week until I did a Repair of Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Windows Repair made the device no longer available for use, even
 though it was still listed in Device Manager.&nbsp; In this thread, I was advised to "Uninstall" it so that Windows 10 could detect it again using the Hardware Troubleshooter, but that didn't work.&nbsp; I tried to install updated firmware for it, hoping that Windows
 would again recognize it, but Windows wouldn't allow it because it said that the device is not in my computer because I followed the advice given here to Uninstall it.&nbsp; When I went into BIOS and put my CD/DVD drive first in boot order, Windows 10 booted up
 from the CD with no problems.&nbsp; The CD/DVD drive can work with Windows 10.&nbsp; It's the Windows 10 Repair that has changed settings so that my CD/DVD drive is no longer recognized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now made arrangements for a tech to come to my home at a cost to me of $95.00/hour to fix the problem.&nbsp; If worse comes to worse, I'll buy a new CD/DVD burner, a new hard drive, and install Windows 10 on it.&nbsp; Hopefully, a fresh install onto a new hard
 drive using a new CD/DVD drive will solve the problem.&nbsp; <br />

            If you are using a third party anti-virus you can get that message, too. It just means the third party&nbsp;anti-virus is the active anti-virus, not Windows defender the default protection in Win10.

<h2>            XBOX ONE freezing on startup</h2>
                    I've had my brand new Xbox one for all of 2 weeks it worked wonderfully for the first week then over the past week it has been either freezing on the green Xbox one screen and does nothing for hours even or if it does happen to load and start working it
 won't last more than an hour before it freezes up completely I've reset the console to the factory settings I've tried a cold reboot and nothing seems to work I'm wondering if I need to just send it in to be serviced or if I'm just out of luck on this one
 my family and I love Xbox and everything it has to offer and we hope we can get the help needed to continue enjoying Xbox together.

<h2>            Windows 10 for routing purposes only</h2>
                    <div>Hello team,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need to buy some commercial software that works like VPN router,&nbsp; it requires one of these systems: Windows 7 SP1 (32/64-bit), Server 2008 R2 (64-bit),Windows 8 (32/64-bit), Server 2012 (64-bit), Windows 8.1 (32/64-bit), Server 2012 R2 SP1 (64-bit).
 It also may working on the Windows 10 Professional edition. Thus, the machine will be a simple router on Windows. I guess I need to buy Windows 10 Professional box w/ article number FQC-09118. I want to install this OS to the VMware ESXi cluster which consist
 of three physical servers each of which has:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>CPU E5-2650 v3 (10 cores/2.3Ghz/25Mb/105 watt) - 2 pcs, w/ enabled Hyper-Threading, total logical processors is 40 pcs, RAM 128Gb</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In total, the cluster consists of 26 physical cores and 104 logical processors. A Windows virtual machine can only run on one of the servers at a time. In the event of server failure, the cluster loads the virtual machine on one of the remaining working
 server in the cluster. VMware is on VMware vSphere Essentials Plus license.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>With this router will work two persons remotely under Administrator account thru RDP (when one administrator is working, the second one cannot work - I understand this, it's ok for us).
<strong>What the licenses I need to buy besides the boxed version of Windows (FQC-09118)? What technical limitations can I encounter if I choose Windows 10 Professional rather Windows Server?</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For security reasons, Windows will not be in the domain, although the company has it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I will be glad to advance the answer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for the tips.</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Fanatec CSR wheel</h2>
                    
<p>I just got the Fanatec CSR racing wheel and it is AWESOME!!!!&nbsp; FAR superior to the Microsoft wheel, much more sturdy and excellent feel. Cant wait to get the clubsport pedals for it. I'm currently usin the Microsoft pedals with adapter but I think the new
 ones will be better. If you are a big racing fan and can scrape up the money (Wheel is $250, pedals $150, shifter kit $50) it is WELL worth it!!</p>

<p>A word of advice regarding the Clubsport pedals...you might want to consider buying a couple of extra replacement load cells when you place your order. &nbsp;As much as I enjoy using their products, Fanatec doesn't seem to be able to make a set of pedals where
 the brake doesn't malfunction after a few months or so of normal daily use.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I originally had a set of the standard pedals, and after a few months I started noticing that the brake was registering input even when my foot was not touching it. &nbsp;Fanatec offered me a discount of $50 off (the cost of the standard pedals) to be applied
 to an upgrade to the Clubsports.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Originally they worked fine, but sure enough just the other day (I've only had them for roughly 4 or 5 months) they started showing the exact same behavior.&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.saltywet.net/2011/02/24/fanatec-clubsport-pedal-brake-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
This link</a> explains the problem in more detail.&nbsp; It's apparently a known flaw and is fairly widespread.&nbsp; It really seems like Fanatec should offer free load cell replacements for people, instead of making the consumer purchase extra products just to keep
 their $200 set of pedals working.&nbsp; Especially when other, cheaper pedals last for far longer with no problems whatsoever (my friend had a Momo wheel/pedal set for his PS3, which was at least 3 or 4 years old, and he never had any problems with it whatsoever).</p>

<p>Its doesnt take much to downplay someones else good work. I have a Fanatec wheel too and they are great. I did have some problem with it, but no product is PERFECT. You may come across a product that doesnt live up to YOUR expectations, and you have the
 right to your opinion, but DAMN DUDE. The load cell cost $10 and dont tell me you cant afford $10 when you kicked out almost $500 for a Fanatec product.
</p>
<p>And before this wheel I went thru 3 Madcatz so whats your point. </p>

<p>What's my point? &nbsp;Did you not read my post, or were you just so incredibly offended that I said something critical of a product that you spent money on, that you couldn't comprehend what you read?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I said nothing about the wheel itself...I personally own a GT2, and it's great...no problems with it whatsoever. &nbsp;The pedals, on the other hand, are a different story, and the reason I mention it is so that if someone like the OP is reading this and they
 already own a set of G27 pedals, or even the MS ones (both of which will work with this wheel), they might want to think twice about dropping an additional $200 on a product which has known issues. &nbsp;For some people they may work fine, but there are also a
 lot of people for whom they malfunction on a regular basis.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The argument of being able to afford a $10 replacement load cell completely misses the point, which is: &nbsp;when you pay $200 for a "top of the line" product such as the Clubsport Pedals, they should just work, and not require the user to disassemble, clean,
 lubricate, and replace parts on them every few months.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Besides, I'm not entirely convinced that a faulty load cell is the root of the problem. &nbsp;I had the exact same problem with the set of standard Fanatec pedals which I originally owned before upgrading to the CSPs. &nbsp;The standard pedals are totally different
 hardware-wise, and don't use a load cell at all. &nbsp;Which leads me to believe the problem has something to do with either the electronics/wiring, or the firmware being used by the wheels, or both.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Bottom line, the CSPs are great when they work, but don't be surprised when they don't.</p>

<p>I had a problem with my csr standard wheel 888 error code, but it would appear the problem is to do with the clamp and the location of some electronics because upon taking the wheel apart and moving some stuff the wheel sprung into life. calibration is back,
 force feedback too. the thing is like brand new again after nearly a year unused.</p>

<p>Just for an FYI, not to detract from other post here, but I have had the clubsport pedals for nearly two years now and I have had no trouble whatsoever. They have gotten considerable use I might add.</p>

<h2>            New laptop came with Windows 10, want to install Windows 7 instead but freezes whilst doing so</h2>
                    <p>Just got an Acer Aspire ES 15, which came with Windows 10 already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't like Windows 10, would much rather use Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to boot from my Windows 7 CD, however once I've passed the 'loading files' bar and am on the 'starting Windows' screen, the four coloured circles that usually spin around whilst loading, just freeze and the installation goes no further?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated. I've tried booting from a USB but when I hit F12 I'm not given the option to boot from it!</p>

            <p>Thanks fella, but I think I've actually solved it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone that has similar problems, change the boot sequence in BIOS from UEF1 to Legacy. That'll get past the DVD ROM freezing. When you come to format, you'll be told that Windows can't format any of your drives because they are&nbsp; of GPT partition style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To convert from GPT to MBR, simply delete all partitions and create a new one. My Windows 7 is currently 17% into installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been a long time since I've done anything this techy on a computer, chuffed!</p>

                    <p>I have a laptop that suddenly started to say that Windows is not genuine. I have tried activating Windows, but I receive the following error message:</p>

            <p>Additional info:&nbsp;If you have not yet tried phone activation or activation failed try the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Run chkdsk as follows:</p>
<p>Open a command Prompt by right clicking and select 'Run as Administrator' <br />
and then at the command prompt type:&nbsp; chkdsk&nbsp; /f&nbsp; /r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then press the enter key.</p>
<p><br />
If prompted to schedule the volume to be checked the next time the system/PC restarts,<br />
enter: y</p>
<p>Now reboot the PC.</p>
<p><br />
Also if you know the manufacture of your hard drive you can download their diagnostic software.</p>
<p><br />
Another utility: SpeedFan has an online health analysis feature <br />
(SMART tab) for hard drives. It will show how your drives <br />
compares with other drives of the same make and model.<br />

<br />
Note: Unfortunately now includes a lot of bloat-ware, be very careful when you install to opt out of bloat-ware.</p>
<p><br />
=====================================================================</p>
<p><br />
2) Run the&nbsp; SFC&nbsp;&nbsp; /SCANNOW&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; command. This will check and repair if necessary any critical Windows system files.</p>
<p><br />
Click on Start/All programs/Accessories&nbsp; then <br />
Right click on Command Prompt option and select 'Run as administrator'.<br />
(or "Safe Mode" open a Command prompt)<br />
At the command prompt enter:&nbsp; SFC&nbsp; /SCANNOW</p>
