<h2>            Why Windows 7 shortens file name when trying to save&#63;</h2>
                    Why Windows 7 shortens file name with dots, when I download a long name file and I try to save it?<br />
<br />
Three dots replace part of the file name and I want to save it with its original name!<br />
<br />
How can I inhibit this shortening?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.<br />

            It's not being shortened, that truly is the real full name of the file. &nbsp;The person who created the file decided to put dots there. &nbsp;You'll have to ask them why.

            A file name can be up to 255 characters long. &nbsp;Note that the download dialog might show dots (Such as
<b>Saving file BigLongFileName....cated.jpg</b>), but the whole file name really is being preserved, it just doesn't fit in the status window.

<h2>            Microsoft Download Problems__</h2>
                    While I have successfully downloaded a program (Kaspersky) and had one successful download from Microsoft Update, I have had many, many failures in automatic and initiated downloads of updates from Microsoft. Is this another symptom of a problem with Windows
 Vista or my computer? Should I initiate a contact with Microsoft Support (I've tried some of their other options to correct the update problem without success)? I'd like to solve this problem without hauling my computer off to the Geek Squad. And I would like
 to install Windows 7 -- A good idea??? One problem at a time. What do you suggest. I get two error codes: Updates failed -- Code 800731 and Code 643.<br />

            Always state your full Windows version (e.g., Vista SP1; Vista 64-bit SP2) when posting in a forum or newsgroup. Please do so in your next reply.
<br />
<br />
What anti-virus application was installed <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
before</span> you installed (or attempted to install) Kaspersky (AntiVirus?) and was the subscription still current?<br />
<br />
Which updates (KB number) failed to install and threw the 800731 &amp; 643 errors?<br />
<br />
[I would not attempt an upgrade to Win7 at this point, no. Upgrading in hopes of fixing an existing problem is usually an invitation to disaster.]

    <title>So windows deleted everything. can I get any of it back&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angelinalicchelli  say:</h3>
<h2>            So windows deleted everything. can I get any of it back&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is 2 years old, it came with a free upgrade to Windows 10. Based on previous free upgrades to new Windows, I decided I'd not jump on board straight away as previous experience lead me to think there'd be a fair few bugs. Then, one night, my computer
 was on over night as it was busy building a 3d image for me... I got up in the morning, and wham, a new welcome screen telling me the computer had updated itself. So i had windows 10. I decided I wouldn't try and downgrade, just stick with it instead and for
 the most part Win 10 has been pretty good. Except it had issues. My wifi would ALWAYS cut out. No amount of driver updates ever fixed that, I ended up getting a USB wifi stick instead.<br />
<br />
My computer would glitch, and keep flashing, like it was opening hundreds of windows. Never got that fixed either.<br />
<br />
Lots of other niggles happened, and at least 3 times a week I'd get a BSOD, usually with some memory error. Oh, I also could not open 90% of my files easily, because it claimed I was the built-in Admin account, so could not access apps of any kind. So had to
 right click and choose a program EVERY SINGLE TIME<br />
<br />
But I learned to deal with these issues, they weren't huge worries. I kept a regular system restore point (backed up every 2 weeks) and by and large windows 10 was the best experience I'd had in years with an MS OS<br />
<br />
Last week though, I was using the computer and it reset itself. It booted back up, and all my folders and desktop were missing. I found them all again, and put them back. But it was a bit odd. A few days later, a windows update caused them to all vanish again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then my laptop went into this weird loop, where it would load up, with no files at all, and need to be rebooted, BSOD, reboot once more, and then my files show up. I restored to 2 weeks earlier, but it kept on, so I was advised to do a 'Reset my PC'.<br />
<br />
All files, except for system files, should have been kept. I backed up my documents folder, and my downloads folder (placed the back ups on the desktop) and did the process. It seemed ok, computer loaded, crashed, BSOD a couple of times but since then has run
 pretty much perfectly. Except for one issue. All my files are gone.<br />
<br />
My documents, downloads, music, pictures... all those files are empty. My desktop is gone, in fact everything on the C drive seems to have been formatted, at least everything I want. Programs are still installed, even Bookworm the game is still there and I
 forgot I ever installed that. But all personal files are missing.<br />
<br />
I used Recuva, to try and find them, I found 33,000 jpgs and sifted through desperately trying to find the 2 gig of photos/videos I had of my son. But no luck, I found about 20 photos, mostly corrupted. I hoped my one drive would have them, but bizarrely, despite
 One Drive always asking if I wanted to back up, and me always saying yes, all it had was 3 screenshots of websites I dont ever remember screenshotting.<br />
<br />
I went to Restore, in the hope I could restore and get my libraries back... but every single restore point had been wiped too. Everything, all gone. I'm absolutely heartbroken.<br />
<br />
IS there any way, <em>any way at all</em>, that I can recover these libraries? or is that it? have my options been exhausted. Are restore points recoverable? can I do anything now?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help that can be offered.</p>

            I can only sympathize with your situation, and I know this isn't going to comfort you but in future always,
<strong><em>always</em></strong> back up your important photos and other files regularly to an external USB drive (or two!) in addition to a cloud service if any. The less user data you store only on your system i.e. OS/Windows partition, the better.

<h2>            Desktop Right Click not working</h2>
                    So when I try to right click my desktop to make a folder the blue loading icon loads and it takes about 5 minutes to load and then nothing happens. I do it again and it does the same thing.. when it's loading I can't click anything on my desktop at all
 and when it stops loading all I can do is right click app icons and that stuff but whenever I right click on the desktop it does it again. I don't know if I explained this well enough.

            Hi.
<br />
<br />For this scenario better to check your system.
<br />
<br />Run System file checker.
<br />-	Press Windows key + X, select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />-	Type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />-	Restart the computer.
<br />If no corrupted system files were found in the previous state, then I suggest you to try the following steps: 
<br />-	Press Windows key + X, select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />-	Type the following commands and press Enter after each command:
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />       DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />-	Close the command prompt and restart the PC and check if it works.
<br />
<br />
<br />As well check for the updates.
<br />
<br />Let me know how it goes       
        </p>

            I tried both of your methods and they didn't fix it. The commands worked properly but I guess it didn't fix the issue. Is there any other simple things that could be causing this?

            Hi,
<br />
<br />The problem could be a problematic third party context menu handler.
<br />
<br />The following link has some info and a download to ShellExView which you can use to selectively disable third party context menu handlers to find out a problematic one:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/slowrightclick.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsxp.mvps.org/slowrightclick.htm</a>
<br />
<br />You could try disabling all non-Microsoft context menu handlers and then, if the problem resolves, re-enable them one at a time to see which one was the problem.

<p>I had this same issue today and spent over an hour following the support advice here and trying other things. IN the end, I was able to fix it by simply unpairing the mouse from Bluetooth and then re-pairing it back with "Add a device" in the Bluetooth settings.&nbsp;</p>

            1. &nbsp;They were changes my parents made. I have 2 accounts now so 1 account is time limited and one is not. 2. There is no error message when it's shuts down. 3. It occurs randomly. 4. I have done troubleshooting yet.&nbsp;

            If the cause isn't software, it has to be hardware. It could be that the power supply needs to be replaced. A technician can tell you in a minute.

<p><span>Hi <strong>Ethan</strong>,</span></p>

            My PC is 5 years old, but everything works fine. Also it shuts down just 1 time, then it doesn't do it again. Here's the synopsis, boot up computer, minutes later, shuts down, &nbsp;boot it up again, doesn't shut down again.&nbsp;

            Sometimes the account can be messing with your PC. I don't know why it was doing that. I'm guessing it was the account itself. The current account I'm in, doesn't shut down by itself. Problem SOLVED BOOM!&nbsp;

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay in response. Try these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Try disconnecting the cable from the Internet:</span></li></ol>
<ol>
<ul>
<li><span>If there is a Wi-Fi icon on the sign-in screen, click it and go to Airplane mode.
</span></li><li><span>If there is a wired connection, disconnect the wire. </span></li><li><span>If sign-in is successful, let us know in the comments!&nbsp; </span></li><li><span>Also, we can then change to a local account, restart, and re-connect to the MSA.
</span></li><li><span>If this works, please let us know!</span></li></ul>
</ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Try sign-in on another device (phone or PC) via the <a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.microsoft.com </a>page. </span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>If the sign-in is <strong>unsuccessful</strong>, stop and handle it like any other password issue.
</span></li><li><span>If sign-in is <strong>successful</strong> there, don‚Äôt try resetting/changing the password, continue to the next step.</span></li></ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.<span> Try using the On-Screen Keyboard to sign in on the PC. </span>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. If that fails, make sure the PC is connected to the Internet (the connection icon should be visible in the lower right).
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Multiple users each with different tasks</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up my Windows 10 Home&nbsp;computer with multiple users as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Administrator account with Microsoft account for updating non-Microsoft application and basic computer maintenance
</p>
<p>2. Administrator account with another Microsoft account for work</p>
<p>3. Local account for gaming though with another Microsoft account used solely for Windows store and,</p>
<p>4. Standard user with another Microsoft account for surfing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I log in to a user to do it's assigned task and log out and go to another user for another task.</p>
<p>I am the only one who use this computer :).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I just wasting effort and computer space in so doing? Is there an advantage this way or none at all? Is this secure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Charlie</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;Hi Stt13,</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you using a built in microphone or an external one?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Is
 the microphone plugged into the jack correctly?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Which
 version of Skype are you using?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 sound work on your computer otherwise?</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Uninstall the drivers for the sound card and reinstall them.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 start, type ‚Äúdevmgmt.msc‚Äù in the start search box and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 Device Manager, locate the microphone device driver, right click and select ‚Äúuninstall‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Make
 sure you check the box for ‚Äúdelete the driver software for this device‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 the computer to load the generic drivers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 the issue still persists, download and install the latest drivers from the manufacturer‚Äôs website.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Audio Devices and Sound Themes by clicking the &nbsp;<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking &nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking&nbsp;
<strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>, and then clicking&nbsp;<strong>Sound</strong>. <br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the&nbsp; <strong>Recording</strong> tab.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select&nbsp; <strong>microphone</strong> and click on &nbsp;<strong>set default.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If the microphones connections are not properly attached make sure the microphone wires are intact and unbroken. The connections to the computer
 might be loose, so unplug the wires and reconnect them, making sure they fit snugly.</span></p>
<p><span>If the above steps does not help setup microphone again.<br />

    <title>Surface Pro 3 unresponsive after waking up from standby&#47;sleep - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 unresponsive after waking up from standby&#47;sleep while in tablet mode</h2>
                    I have an i5, 8GB RAM Surface Pro 3 and for a long as I can remember I've had this issue where if I let the device fall asleep while using it in tablet mode (Type Cover 4 folded to the back), when I wake the device up, it wakes up fine onto the lock screen
 but the touchscreen will be completed unresponsive. This seems to be a consistent&nbsp;issue for me no matter which built of Windows 10 I am on or whether it is connected to power or on battery. The only workaround I've discovered and have been relying&nbsp;on is to
 unfold the type cover which switches Windows back into desktop mode (I have tablet&nbsp;mode switching on auto) and the touch screen will start responding again. Am I the only one with this issue? Is there a permanent&nbsp;solution or driver update to this issue?&nbsp;

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be resulting from a hardware or a firmware problem. When the issue happens, does restarting the Surface resolve it? Without switching to desktop mode, try restarting the device to see if the trouchscreen will work. If it does not work, please
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023532/surface-how-do-i-use-the-bios-uefi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
boot into the Surface UEFI</a> to further check if this is a hardware problem. If the touchscreen does not work in the UEFI, it means this is a hardware issue. It's best that you take the Surface to a Microsoft Store if that's the result of the troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the touchscreen works after restarting and if it works in the UEFI, we need to troubleshoot the software. To do that, you can
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
run the Software Diagnostic Toolkit</a>. The tool will let you know what errors may be causing the issue and it will tell you how you can resolve it.</p>

    <title>Windows 10- laptop goes to sleep after 60 seconds - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10- laptop goes to sleep after 60 seconds</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 about a month ago and have had a problem with my laptop going to sleep since. I previously had Windows 8 and had no problem. The laptop goes to sleep after 60 seconds and requires login when I move my mouse/ press a key etc. It's
 not a huge deal but it is annoying since it is avoiding my settings. I'm wondering if other people have had the same problem and if they were able to fix it?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>
<p>Shan</p>

<h2>            Please undo my suspension</h2>
                    <p>2 weeks is a long time without gaming. I pay a yearly subscribstrion. And I get banned for talking crap. That is so unnecessary, and the messed up part is, I know what bad things I said or did. But when I read the report, they over exaggerated, saying I threatend them and all the extra stuff. I said one thing, and then I blocked the person and delete their messages. Yah, I shouldn't have done it. But 2 weeks is going over bored. I cant play one game online. I'm so frustrated, you guys are really something else. Please just let me play, and block me from sending messages to anybody for a month. But don't take online away. That defeats the whole purpose of even have an Xbox one.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Here is the quickfix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set the laptop to standby instead of hibernate. Laptops can have issues with hibernate function. Here are the instructions to navigate there:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to control panel classic view. (Ctrl-Esc and then type "control" to quickly access control panel)</p>
<p>2. Double click on power options icon</p>
<p>3. Click "Change when the computer sleeps"</p>
<p>4. Click "Change advanced power settings"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the sleep menu and</p>
<p>* set "Allow hybrid sleep" to: OFF</p>
<p>* set "Hibernate after" setting to: NEVER</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: You will need to type this text in the field there is no drop down to select.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is very likely to be the issue and the resolution. However, here are some additional troubleshooting steps should you have any issues:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Troubleshooting sleep mode function:</p>

            <p>Mr. Archak,</p>
<p>It says : &nbsp;We're sorry, but your operating system is not supported by Microsoft Fix it at this time.
</p>
<p>I had upgraded to Windows 10 but had a number of problems with it, especially with Norton 360, so I went back to 8.1</p>
<p>Could that have caused additional problems or be causing the Fix It program to not read my OS correctly?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For issues with Windows Media Player corrupt. Let us try to run System File Checker (SFC Scan) as this could be an issue with corrupt system files.<br />
System File Checker is a utility in Microsoft Windows that allows users to scan for and restore corruptions in Windows system files<br />
Perform System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue.<br />
Follow the steps:<br />
‚¶Å&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Press Windows Key + X.<br />
‚¶Å&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click on Command prompt (Admin). <br />
‚¶Å&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Command prompt, type ‚Äòsfc /scannow‚Äô without quotes and hit enter.<br />
Also see: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833<br />
</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<h2>            Cleaning question</h2>
                    
<p>Since Microsoft's prohibitive cleaning measures restrict me to a microfiber cloth, I was wondering if there was a specific type anyone could recommend. The one I use seems to push dust around on the Xbox (One)&nbsp;more than attract it to its surface. Yes, I
 know there are other options than a microfiber cloth for cleaning but I'd really just like this question answered.</p>

<p>I just use some Kleenex facial tissues to wipe dust off the top of my Xbox 360 slim console, and Xbox 1 console and dust dust off the top and around my Sony KDL40EX720. It does a good job. At least I don't use cheap facial tissues. Paper towels are too big.
 A duster is not suited for electronics from how I see it. I have some good micro-fibre clothes too. As long as you don't use a vacuum toothbrush or A-jack-spray-and-wipe.... just kidding :)</p>
<p>A professional answer would be use a good micro-fibre cloth ones best suited for cleaning HDTV's your laptop screen or something.</p>

            <p>I too pull the console and vacuum the vents and disc-slot once a week or so. The brush on the vacuum hose will scratch the shiny surface, but I'm over that at this point. Don't forget the power-brick too. Those little holes really tend to attract the "bunnies." </p>

<p>I use new or a clean swiffer duster or compressed air since a cloth is just guaranteed to still push dust around instead of lifting it off. Then clean off finger prints with zeiss disposable cleaning cloths. One microfiber cloth I would recommend I use on
 everything besides my glasses are 3M textured microfiber cleaning cloth. Little dimple like texture makes huge difference compared to a smooth microfiber cloth. Texture helps pick up dust instead of pushing it around as well.</p>
<p>Really though I learned with my piano black PS3 that glossy black is going to get scratched up no matter how well you take the time to do it right.</p>

<p>You really should avoid using compressed air. </p>
<p>Ontop of obvious force damage you are just pushing the dust deeper into the console.</p>
<p>Use a vacuum. </p>

<p>White Spirit is always good for removing sticky stuff, like when a label leaves the sticky stuff on a CD case, as to whether it would deteriorate or damage the rubber i'm not sure - maybe with prolonged use.</p>
<p>What i personally would do is use White Spirit very sparingly to remove the sticky stuff and then use warm water with a tiny bit of washing up liquid to remove the White Spirit obviously being very careful doing this not letting any water get into any gap.</p>
