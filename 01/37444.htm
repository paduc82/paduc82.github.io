<h2>            DLC&#38;&#35;39&#59;s not working</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Recently I purchased Hearthfire for Skyrim, then I ran into a problem. The Hearthfire DLC would not show up in game. Looked in my HD and it is there, and is not corrupted or a partial. Xbox LIVE is showing I purchased it, as I have done the "Clear cache,
 delete the DLC, re-boot, and re-install" method numerous times now. That doesn't work. Then I took another HD and transferred the content to that HD and tried playing that. Nothing. Then tried downloading to that HD (not the original). Nothing. Then tried
 the deleting and re-installing on the second HD. Nothing. Now NONE of my DLC's are working. I had to get&nbsp;my Elder Scrolls "fix", so I tried Oblivion and to my surprise&nbsp;none of the DLC's I have for that are working now. Also, Oblivion wont save. I saved my
 game, went back later to restart, and it wasn't there, but it is showing up on my HD. So then I go to play Mass Effect, and the DLC is missing and it wont load my last saved game.... I again tried to transfer all content to the second HD. Nothing. Tried to
 delet and re-install. Nothing. I thought well maybe it's the HD, but I bought&nbsp;the Microsoft&nbsp;320gb HD, with the Legos:Star Wars download on it, not some knock-off. I purchesed the new Xbox in July I think, and it had performed fine up until December, when I
 attempted the Hearthfire Download.</p>
<p>So just as a re-cap of what I've already tried: I already tried downloading my license (which should not have been an issue anyway, as I purchased the download with this gamertag and consule), tried useing another HD, have done the "Clear cache, delete the
 DLC, re-boot, and re-install" method a dozen times on both HD's, Xbox LIVE is showing that I have purchased the DLC, I can see the DLC in my HD, the DLC is not corrupted or partial. I've shelled out some serious money for Xbox and this is getting real old,
 real fast. I'm at a loss as to what to do......</p>
<p>Please anybody, HELP!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok, throwing out a couple things...</p>
<p>DLC ties to the gamertag and console it was downloaded to, so is that the case here, or did you download on a friend's system with your drive and try to play at home?</p>
<p>Now, if at home on your own system, did you fire up the game while still connected to live? DLC doesn't fully sync up in Skyrim unless you do that, and you get the latest game update.</p>
<p>Next, when firing up the game, after selecting storage device for save location, does it show "Loading Add Ons" on the screen? It should, and sometimes it takes a moment.</p>
<p>Afterwards, it should show on the small list for add ons on the menu.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Now, after all that is said and done, in game you actually have to go out and meet the qualifications while playing to get access to the new lands to build on. It's not an automatic freebe to your character that just pops up.</p>

<p>If you recently got a new Xbox, you'll need to transfer the license, which can be done here:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/download-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../download-content</a></p>
<p>If you have not, I suggest uninstalling it and re-downloading it again. If this doesn't not work, I would suggest deleteing your Gamertag,download your Gamertag (assuming it was the one you purchased the DLC with) and try re-downloading the DLC again.</p>

<h2>            Windows Store Error 0x8000704cf</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having this problem for a quite a long time. Got Dolby Access and buy Dolby Atmos for windows 10. Unable to download as I got the Microsoft Account Sign in error on Store. The Error code is 0x800704cf. I tried all the methods right from updating network
 adapters to dnsflush and everything, but did not help that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also tried various videos to bring in solution, but unable to sign in to Store due to error code "0x800704cf". Yet, I am able to sign in to microsoft account on web browser but unable to sign in in the In-Built Windows Apps like Xbox Store or Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please bring resolution of the problem as soon as possible or is there any way to get Dolby Atmos for Windows 10 through browser ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly solve this problem urgently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Apple Thunderbolt Display with Dell XPS13 9360 with Thunderbolt 3 to 2 Adapter</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell XPS 13 9360 and am hoping there is a way to use it with an Apple Thunderbolt display. I have purchased a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter but have had no luck. When I plug in the display through the adapter I get a message saying 'Thunderbolt
 device functionality might be limited.' And then the display doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering whether perhaps there is a driver I can download, although I haven't been able to find one so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen the odd post where people seem to have managed to get this to work but haven't gone into detail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Troy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There can be a lot of causes for this issue to happen on your device. One of them is that there are too many other devices or dongles connected to your PC (or phone) that use a USB-C connection. Please try to have the device the only one connected to your
 laptop and see if the issue gets resolved. If it would still persist, you can also try these solutions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Make sure your PC (or phone), the external display, and the cable supports DisplayPort or MHL alternate modes.</li><li>Make sure the device or dongle is connected directly to your PC (or phone).</li><li>Make sure the device or dongle is connected to the USB-C port on your PC (or phone) that supports the correct Alternate Mode. For example, if you’re connecting a DisplayPort Alternate Mode adapter, make sure it’s connected to the USB-C port on your PC (or
 phone) that supports DisplayPort Alternate Mode.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Here's also an <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4012609/windows-10-fix-usb-c-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> that can help if there are other issues you're experiencing.</p>
<p>

</p><p><em><strong>Application Blocked by Deployment Rule Set</strong></em>. &nbsp;the application was blocked even though the host site of the html file at: &nbsp;https://market.fs.ml/launch is included in the Exception Site list because the application refers to resources

<p>
</p><p><span>If you are using third party security software, disable third party security software and check.</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Disable third-party Security Software. Refer to these steps</span></p>
<p><span><span>a. </span></span><span>You should see an icon for your Antivirus program in the Task-bar notification area. It is usually at the bottom right corner of your desktop.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Important Note:</strong></span><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps you. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;third party software was disabled.&nbsp;Security was "weakened" for this site as it is a trusted site.&nbsp; Java is an important advantage for users that use "heavy" java applet to "mobilize" their stock trading platform.&nbsp;Many colleagues would be utilizing the
 Surface 3 + Stock Trading platform for the mobility it provides.&nbsp; There is really no other way to take the "desktop computer"&nbsp;advantage on the road without surface 3. Surface 2 wouldn't work because of the RT version of Java.&nbsp; Other&nbsp;laptops and tablets&nbsp;run
 a watered down version of esignal charts but Surface 3 because of the addition of Windows 8.1 (not RT)&nbsp;has been able to run the full blown&nbsp;version of esignal charts.&nbsp; But lately I have been getting 2 different errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Error number one:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>"Application Blocked by Deployment Rule Set"&nbsp;</em> Java was downloaded and the specific website in question had the Java Console tweaked to a "weaker" protection to enable this website to load.</p>

 just won't load.&nbsp; This second error has to do with enabling "javascript" as opposed to Java (not the same thing) This is perplexing since it worked fine the first few days of owning the Surface 3</p>

            When you click on "This PC", if it doesn't show the A drive, you'll need to enable it in bios settings. Then, the floppy should show in "This PC", and if the little drive belt is still good, you should be able to run the floppy to copy the files onto a
 CD, flash drive or hard drive. If it works, you should do the same with all your floppies while the drive still works.

<p>&nbsp;You've posted in the Insider forum where we test pre-release versions of Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;However I'll attempt to address your note.&nbsp; I haven't seen a PC with a floppy drive in over a decade.&nbsp; Are you sure your PC&nbsp;<em>has
</em>a floppy drive?&nbsp; How old is the floppy?&nbsp; Assuming you do have a floppy drive, it could be that your floppy has become unreadable over time - they don't last forever.&nbsp; What is the exact error message you're getting?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which browser are you using to watch the video? I suggest you to go to the manufacturer website and install the latest video drivers and check. Also perform clean boot.
<span><span>Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications/drivers or startup items are causing the issue.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the article and check if it helps.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, follow the section
<strong>"How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot"</strong> in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>I'm sure you understand. I didn't watch the videi n a &nbsp;browser, I watched it on my computer. I used the default videos app first, and when that didn't work, I used media player, and that didn't work.</p>
<p>When I posted this, I immediately went and redownloaded the video, but the same thing happened.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Mapping LPT1 to a shared printer</h2>
                    
<p>Trying to map LPT1 to a shared printer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C:\Users\levander\Desktop&gt;net use lpt1 \\cracker\crackermfc490cw<br />
The password is invalid for \\cracker\crackermfc490cw.<br />
<br />
Enter the user name for 'cracker': levander<br />
Enter the password for cracker:<br />
System error 5 has occurred.<br />
<br />
Access is denied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've tried leaving that user name blank, putting Administrator in there, few other things.&nbsp; I always use the same password for everything on my home network because security doesn't matter that much.&nbsp; And, this is a machine I just installed a few days ago.&nbsp;
 I know I use the password for everything that I always use.&nbsp; I've also tried leaving it blank.&nbsp; Always get those same error messages.</p>
<p>I've read something about how all Windows above XP, a non-Administrator user can't remap a parallel port that's been assigned to a physical hardware device.&nbsp; And, you'd think that could cause the error messages I'm getting above.&nbsp; But, user 'levander' is
 an Administrator on this computer.</p>
<p>When I try to map LPT2, I get this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C:\Users\levander&gt;net use lpt2 \\cracker\crackermfc490cw<br />
The command completed successfully.</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
Then I:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C:\Users\levander\Desktop&gt;print /d:lpt2 hello.txt<br />
C:\Users\levander\Desktop\hello.txt is currently being printed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and nothing happens.&nbsp; I go check the printer and it's not printing anything.</p>
<p>Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?</p>
<p>I'm running Windows 7 64 bit Ultimate.&nbsp; I can print to the printer fine from Windows applications like Notepad, etc..</p>

<p><span>Hi Levander,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Can you verify if disabling the physical LPT1 port in device manager helps? This helps users in redirecting LPT1.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to start, type devmgmt.msc and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Expand
 Ports (COM &amp; LPT).</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 Printer Port (LPT1), then select Properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under
 "Device usage," select "Do not use this device (disable)."</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Disabling LPT1 in Device Manager makes it a logical port (such as LPT2 and LPT3) instead of a physical port.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Besides, here is a thread you may want to look into that has similar issue.</span></p>

    <title>Extreme lag&#47;slowdown in Win 8 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevincottrell_me  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extreme lag&#47;slowdown in Win 8 Pro</h2>
                    <p>I am experiencing extreme lag/slowdown on Win 8.&nbsp; Task Manager&nbsp;and Resource Monitor&nbsp;are not showing an obvious&nbsp;cause or issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other threads said to create a new user account, which I did and after a couple of days the lag issue is back. &nbsp;I&nbsp;did see another thread that suggested a pagefile type issue but never saw an answer posted, and I cannot find my pagefile to even check my stock
 settings.&nbsp; I think I used to find my pagefile through Task Manager in previous Windows but cannot anymore.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Norton Insight has repeatedly warned me about a <strong>taskhostex.exe</strong>&nbsp;Performance Alert&nbsp;and warns me after around 1,300 MB Disk Write Activity, which I believe points to a possible pagefile issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I run very few 'background' type applications and normally have around 5-6GB RAM available, 25-30% RAM used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>edit:&nbsp; I would also like to add that my slowdown issue seems random and once it happens will continue for about 30 min or so then goes away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Win&nbsp;8 Pro&nbsp;on Dell XPS: i72600, 8GB RAM, 64 GB Solid State (21 GB free), data stored on 300GB HDD (130 GB free)</p>

            <p>After extensive testing, it turns out that my 64GB SSD boot drive for some reason was not operating well under Win 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Never has issues before but the SSD was slow when used as a Win 8 C: drive.</p>

<p>I did have 20GB+ free when used as my boot drive.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check the physical connect connected to your computer?<br />
I would suggest you to follow the steps and check.</span></p>
<div>
<p>
<span>No Input Signal message.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Cause</span></p>
<p>
<span>This issue can be caused by any of the below possibilities.</span></p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Monitor not connected properly.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Bad hardware</span></li></ol>
<div>
<p>
<span>Solution</span></p>
<p>
<span>Monitor not connected properly</span></p>
<p>
<span>Verify that the monitor is properly connected in the back of the monitor as well as to the back of the computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the monitor appears to be connected properly, verify that a cable is not loose by disconnecting all cables that can be disconnected in the back of the monitor
 (generally the data cable cannot be disconnected). Next, disconnect the data cable connected to the back of the computer and then reconnect the cable. When connecting the cable in the back of the computer ensure the cable connection is tight. Most Computers
 will also have screw ends that can be screwed in to hold the connector in place.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Bad hardware</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the connections appear to be correct, unfortunately it is likely that either the monitor or the computer video card is bad. To test what component is bad either
 connect a different monitor to your computer or connect your monitor to a different computer.</span></p>

    <title>The Walking Dead - XBLA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fizzyface  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Walking Dead - XBLA</h2>
                    
<p><span>Based upon both the fantastic graphic novel and hit TV series, The Walking Dead is set to come to the Xbox Live Arcade, with an original story following a new character named Lee Everett. Zoning in on the key theme of people
 losing their humanity amid a zombie apocalypse, The Walking Dead will pick up the action with Everett as he escapes from his prison escort after it'**** by a car and rolls into a ditch. A free man, Everett finds himself trying to leave Atlanta as the zombie
 hordes bear down upon him and a little seven-year old girl named Clementine who looks to him for protection. Taking Clementine under his wing, Everett will find himself facing both the undead and unfamiliar characters, some of which will be out to double cross
 him. </span></p>

<p><span>Familiar faces like Lilly from the books will also make an appearance, as will locations like Herschel's farm, which you'll visit before Rick Grimes manages to make it there. The Walking Dead game hopes to "push the boundaries
 of what's been done by Telltale in the past", says Telltale's Kevin Boyle, and as such, the game will focus on the human aspects of the story, creating tension with the ever-looming threat of death around every turn. Although there's no screenshots or gameplay
 on offer of The Walking Dead as yet, the game will be evocative of the books' visual style, will be a 3D adventure game and will be episodic. The exact mechanics also have yet to be settled upon, but what we've learnt about the game so far is intriguing nonetheless.</span></p>
<p><span>The Walking Dead will be shuffling onto the Xbox Live Arcade in winter 2011 as an as yet unspecified number of episodes, at a price that's still being agreed upon.

<p>heard about this months ago.</p>
<p>Three possible ways the game is going to go</p>
<p>The Sims Zombies : by this I mean pretty much what it sounds like, you have to control the people like sims telling them to eat sleep and barricade places aswell as shoot zombies etc and work out their group issues to stop people storming off on their own.</p>
<p>A hidden object game: thats right searching environment after environment for items to prgoress to the next area.</p>
<p>The interactive book : done by Farenheit, Heavy rain and soon Jurrassic park on 360 you play the game with some quick time events and the game seems to seamlessly transition to gameplay from cutscenes with events that occur in the quick time events often
 branching the story off in different ways.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other shows that will kill a character at the drop of a hat, but the problem with Walking Dead is that the characters and their motivations are so poorly fleshed out. Even when they do try to establish a bit of backstory it's usually
 really cringey stuff (like the thing with that beardy man, forgot the guy's name). So you never really care when someone dies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most common defence is that it only had 6 episodes so it was barely a warm up, yet Breaking Bad's first season (another popular AMC show. They seem to be everywhere now) was 7 episodes and right from the get go you knew enough about the main character
 to understand and empathise with his plight. Something was at stake the entire season and it evolved at a really fast rate, whereas Walking Dead just shuffles onwards with really weird storylines and protracted conflicts between characters that really show
 the writing team's lack of direction. Thank god they've all been fired. Maybe the new team can salvage something out of this once promising premise. I mean, the pilot was still pretty good, all things considered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, 'T-Dawg' is without a doubt the most offensively bad name I've heard for what is supposed to be a 'ghetto' character in a series.</p>

<p>I thought the first TV season is great, and tells the story brilliantly. I have the novels but have not had the chance to read them, but i assume the game will also present the story in a very vivid way.</p>

<p>I started off quite enjoying 'The Walking Dead' but it just kinda fizzled out a bit for me towards the end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Breaking Bad' on the other hand .... awesome. It just progressively got better the further in it got and season 3 was bananas!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of whether Walking Dead will make a decent game I don't know but it'd better do something special if it wants to stand out from every other zombie game that's saturating the market at the moment</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I don't think anything beats 'Oz' for killing off its main characters as that'd get through about 4 - 5 per episode</p>

            Hi MjSam,
<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />Have you tried from the control panel?
<br />
<br />On the Windows search bar type "Control Panel" and make a left-click on it &gt; Programs &gt; Uninstall a program.
<br />
<br />Regards.

            Hi MjSam
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP application supplied by Windows 10 installation like Clock, Calculator etc
<br />Uninstall it using Windows 10 Store App Unistaller - Apps-Cleaner.zip
<br /><a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Windows-10-Store-Apps-5f60b9e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcen...</a>
<br />
<br />(This can also be uninstalled using Powershell scripts but scripts are different for different app. The utility is a good one to uninstall)
<br />
<br />B. If this is UWP application but installed by your from Microsoft Store and not supplied by Windows 10 default installation
<br />Windows key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click on the respective application &gt; Uninstall
<br />(The method of point A can be used for this also)
<br />
<br />C. If this is a third party application but not installed from Microsoft store
<br />Same as in B - Windows key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click on the respective application &gt; Uninstall
<br />
<br />D. If still the problem in previous point
<br />Use Revo Uninstaller (Free) to uninstall.
<br />Download from - <a href="https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstalle...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Yes I agree, and on this app I tried clicking on the 'Terminate' button, but nothing much reflected as 'done' and Yet the app still would linger there anyway. I wish to clear it up all from PC so noone can switch it on again.

<br />You can also try the free trial of CCleaner, it will list you all the apps installed on your computer and it has the option to uninstall them too.

    <title>Wireless adapter wont turn on automatically in Windows 7. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> motosman1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless adapter wont turn on automatically in Windows 7.</h2>
                    A few months ago, a coworker walked me through using my iPhone as a "hotspot" internet source on my laptop. We could not get it to work properly and gave up. Since then, when using my laptop after sleeping or hibernation, it may take several miutes to
 connect to my wifi network, and sometimes it will not connect until I run the network "troubleshooter". The troubleshooter says that the wireless adapter is turned off and it turns the adapter on to "apply this fix". I can go to the Network and Sharing Center
 &gt; Change Adpter Settings and right click the Wireless Connection 2 (my Atheros Wireless Network Adapter), click to enable and a window pops up showing that there are no networks available to connect to. I have to go to the Network and Sharing Center and run
 the Troubleshooter to get the adapter turned on. Sometimes it takes a second attempt. I have had this laptop for 2-1/2 years and no issues until trying to pair it to my iPhone, as a "hotspot". I did follow a tip, from this site,

<p>Hi Erika,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you on your fast reply.</p>
<p>I have tried everything from your link.</p>
<p>WLAN Report has shown all kind of errors, all defer in typ.</p>
<p>Disable and Enable of network adapter has shown it self as unhelpful.</p>
<p>Installing newest driver and managing software for Killer Network also was not helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime I have solved my problem.</p>
<p>After couple of hours I was checking Windows updates and found one that was installed on 12.7.2017 (I don´t know the code for update, so I have provided the date).</p>
<p>Update was Windows Security Update for malware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After uninstalling this security update everything was again functional. As it is wright now (with the network adapter latest driver and managing software).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I must say that uninstalled Windows Update was again automatically installed upon shutting windows down.</p>
<p>After turning Windows today back again, I have not experienced any Wireless adapter disconnecting problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooter (for networking) was not helpful at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After starting to resolving a problem, Troubleshooter has try to rollup the driver and restart network adapter. After that, it was automatically switched on to the blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this will help in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>
</span></span></span><span>When exactly do you get the error message?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Do you have any security program installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Are you able to boot to the desktop?</span></p>
<p><b><span>If you are able to boot to the desktop, I would suggest you to follow the steps and check if it helps.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to
<span>try performing <b>System File Checker</b> scan on the computer. The scan will replace any corrupt Windows files with fresh ones.</span></p>
<p><span>Check the link mentioned below for further guidance on System File Checker scan</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>Note: You may be prompted to insert the Windows 7 installation DVD if any files are found to be missing or corrupted.</p>
<p><span>If the does not get resolved then you may also try system restore to the date when the computer was working fine.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><b>System Restore
</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore</b></a></p>
<p><b>Note</b>: When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state, programs and updates you installed are removed.</p>
<p><span>System Restore affects
<span>Windows</span> system files, programs, and registry settings which were changed recently. It can also make changes to scripts, batch files, and other types of executable files on your computer. System Restore does not affect
 personal files, such as e-mail, documents, or photos, so it cannot help you restore a deleted file.
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>Hope this helps and keep us posted.</p>

<p>It started as soon as I reinstalled a clean installation of Windows 10 on a new ssd.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What are the troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>I tried looking through some of the registry files and my user file. It seemed to only affect my user because other users on the same computer were unaffected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any changes on the settings on the PC prior to this?</li></ul>
<p>Just reinstalled Windows 10 again and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would have to say, I finally had enough and just did another re-installation of Windows 10 and it fixed it, but now I am having an issue with my Microsoft account not syncing to my other pc's. I used the account tool and it cannot connect to the service
 and requests that I check my internet connection. This is obviously an error on Microsoft because I am connected to the internet. I can even see the pc I am having an issue with on my account on Microsoft's website.</p>

<p>This just started happening for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens mostly if I type before cortana pops up. Sometimes it happens even if I wait. Reboot doesn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also strange if I delete what I'm typing the popup menu disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It gets even weird. Let's say I click "Type here to search", then I click the gear settings icon. The windows settings pops up and if I start to type anything it dismisses on the second or third key press every single time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can still click through all the menus fine.</p>

<p>Hi James</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the article it shows that find and fix problems is under System and Security.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3309e7a8-f9ec-4980-a180-0ba5de87101a" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If turning that option off does not help, you should be able to use the <strong>
AutoPlay</strong> component for a removable drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Auto Play enabled each time that you connect the Memory Card you will get a PopUp where you can select
<strong>Open folder to view files</strong>&nbsp;and this will open the <strong>Memory Card</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In <strong>Control Panel</strong> (<strong>Category View</strong>) clcik <strong>
Hardware and Sound</strong>. On the next screen, place a <strong>check mark</strong> in the
<strong>Use AutoPlay for all media and Devices</strong> option at the <strong>top</strong> of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

</p><p>The icons that disappear seem to be selected at random. The last time it happened, my wife was doing e-mail (GOOGLE gmail) and forgot to sign off gmail when she was done. Several hours later, I discovered the oversight, signed her off, and re-started the
 PC. about 6 desktop icons were MIA. I was able to replace them, and when I next shut down the PC, and then re-started the next day. All was in order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my query remains; why is this happening?</p>

            <p>Hello James, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that this issue occurs on random basis. You may try to perform clean boot and see if that helps because,
<span>p</span>utting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.
<span>Refer to the link to perform clean boot.</span></p>

            <p>GOOGLE is our friend. After some searching, I located the procedure for turning System Maintenance off.</p>
<p>Using the Control Panel in icon view (either large or small icons), click on the "Troubleshooting" item. &nbsp;In the top left corner of that window, click on "change settings". One of the choices there is to turn off System Maintenance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there's a catch; the thing won't STAY off. When you re-boot. it's back on, with the notation "(recommended)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should incorporate a "HANDS OFF MY DESKTOP ICONS" feature in the control panel. I knew what I was doing when I set up these icons, and I don't appreciate Windows messing with them.</p>
