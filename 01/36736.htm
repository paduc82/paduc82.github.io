    <title>Virus &#38; threat protection - Setup OneDrive... can only choose - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ngageonline  say:</h3>
<h2>            Virus &#38; threat protection - Setup OneDrive... can only choose &#34;Work or School&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I open "Windows Defender Security Center" it shows me a warning/reminder under "Virus &amp; threat protection" to "Set up OneDrive". However, OneDrive seems to already be running and syncing. But, what's even more confusing is; When I try to run the
 setup and enter my email-address, the option for "Personal" is greyed-out. I can only choose "Work or school". Just above the buttons it says: "This email address is used for both OneDrive and OneDrive for Business. Which would you like to sign in to first?"
 This is very odd, because I don't remember ever creating any OneDrive for Business account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my assumption is: the "Personal" option is greyed-out because it's already running. My question is: How on earth did I get a OneDrive for Business account associated to my email address without ever setting it up? AND, how do I get rid of this annoying
 warning/reminder. (My OCD teaches me, I have to have all green checkboxes :D )</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS: Also, why is the OneDrive "Category" for posting Locked?!</p>

<p>With all due respect, are you Serious?&nbsp; Ignore it? Well why not just ignore all warnings that Windows Defender gives you?&nbsp; How is the common user to know which Warnings to ignore and which warnings to take action on?&nbsp; This should be fixed.&nbsp; if you can't

<p>I agree with you here. Why bother replying with a throwaway comment like this. However, I do imagine what Andre meant was just ignore it until MS fix it as the issue seems to be caused with the latest update and is likely affecting a lot of people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not want to wait I have managed to fix the issue with a bit of a workaround.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on the OneDrive icon in the System Tray.</li><li>Click on <strong>More</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Next, under the <strong>Account</strong> tab select <strong>Unlink this PC</strong>.</li><li>Again, on the prompt confirmation window select <strong>Unlink account</strong>.</li><li>You will then have the option to sign back into OneDrive. If it does not prompt you, go to
<strong>Windows Defender Security Center</strong> and under 'Virus and Threat Detection' select
<strong>Set up OneDriv</strong><strong>e</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>You should now be signed back into OneDrive and the Virus and Threat Protection warning should be gone.</p>

<h3> c-ann-ccarmen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Mail doesn&#39;t recognize my new password to log onto Hotmail on the mail client</h2>
                    <strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">What I need answers on here is that using the Windows Live Mail client, not the Microsoft email client, while it provides users to sync with their Microsoft account with Hotmail, apparently isn't recognizing the fact
 that I had changed my password with my Hotmail account recently, and I don't understand it when I did that, and Microsoft verified my changes, and on the browser website for Microsoft, I was able to log in with the new password, which was a "fix" for my Microsoft
 a month ago, which I had to wait for Microsoft to send me a "code" in order to "fix" my Microsoft account, which perturbs me to no end as to why Microsoft makes you wait ONE MONTH to get that code to "fix" your account! &nbsp;But, today was the day that Microsoft
 allowed me a code to fix my account with them, and was able to do so. &nbsp;Now while on my laptop, a Lenovo, using Windows 10, I now was able to load in my emails with my Hotmail and Gmail accounts on the Microsoft email client. &nbsp;But, while I had to wait a month
 before I was able to use that email client, I downloaded and programmed my personal email accounts that had POP accounts onto the Windows Live Mail client which was all set and working properly; except for using a provided synch'd email using Hotmail that
 Windows Live Mail has in its upper right window to get user's hotmail emails. &nbsp;Since today after I reset my password, and that Microsoft accepted the change of password and aptly provided me to use its email client using both Hotmail &amp; Gmail accounts, I thought
 I'd try that using Windows Live Mail as explained above. &nbsp;Every time I tried to log on with my new hotmail account password that was changed today and accepted by Microsoft, it kept stating that my password (and/or user name) were "incorrect" and to try another
 account or to use the "Forgot password" to get a new one. &nbsp;I DO NOT want to do that as I had already CHANGED that Hotmail password as of today, &nbsp;January 26, 2018, which was the day that Microsoft was to send me a "code" in order to fix my hotmail and gmail
 accounts. &nbsp;But the Windows Live Mail client does NOT recognize my new password for my Hotmail account and I am NOT able to log on to that account for some strange reason! &nbsp;However, I am using now the Microsoft Mail client and can get both my Hotmail and Gmail
 emails, just on a different client. &nbsp;I still use Windows Live Mail for my other POP3 email accounts. &nbsp;I just can't log on when in Windows Live Mail to the Microsoft Hotmail account. &nbsp;Do you "techies" now understand my dilemma? &nbsp;</span></strong>

<h2>            Most troubleshooted Skype for Business problematic scenarios. What to collect before addressing to support</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>This article is intended to provide a basic scoping around the three most commonly encountered problematic scenarios regarding the Skype for Business technology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here they are:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The <strong>Sign in.</strong></li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<p>
</p><li>Is there a specific error message that you encounter?
<p>
</p></li><li>Is the reported sign in failure <strong>consistently</strong> reproducible? Or is it occurring
<strong>intermittently</strong>? Or random <strong>disconnects</strong>?
<p>
</p></li><li>Behavior<strong> Start Time</strong> - any known <strong>Changes</strong> (Has this ever worked? If so, did any changes precede the functionality loss?)<strong>
<br />
</strong>e.g. Since <strong>Deployment?</strong> Since <strong>Provisioning?</strong> Since
<strong>day:time?</strong>
<p>
</p></li><li>Are you using a online, on-premises or a combined online/on-premises service?
</li></ul>
</span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span><span>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Which of the following scenarios are in use:</p>
<ul>
<p>
</p><li>O365 <strong>Managed</strong> Account (Cloud created or DirSync / AADConnect)
<p>
</p></li><li>O365 <strong>Federated</strong> Account (<strong>SSO</strong> - ADFS / 3rd party)
<p>
</p></li><li>O365 / SfB On-Premise <strong>Hybrid</strong>
<p>
</p></li><li>O365 <strong>Dedicated</strong>
<p>

<ul>
</ul>
</span>
<ul>
</ul>
</span>

<p>2. The <strong>integration </strong><strong>with Exchange scenarios</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<p><br />
</p>
</ol>
</ol>
</span>
<ol>
</ol>
</span>
<ol>
<span><span>
<span><span>
<p>Knowledge:</p>
<p>The following logic is used by SfB / Lync clients and Devices to locate Exchange Web Services within an Exchange environment from an internal or external network.
</p>
<p>SfB / Lync client will attempt to read any existing Autodiscover data with a valid TTL which may have been previously retrieved (by Outlook
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SfB / Lync client will query for the users PrimarySMTP. </p>
<p>A users PrimarySMTP is determined by querying the Active Directory Email address field which is populated by Exchange when a user is mail enabled.</p>
<p>The smtpdomain will be pulled for Exchange CAS Autodiscover lookup in the following order</p>
<p>

</p><p><span><span>* </span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>https://&lt;smtpdomain&gt;/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>* </span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>https://autodiscover.&lt;smtpdomain&gt;/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>* </span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>http://autodiscover.&lt;smtpdomain&gt;/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml</span></span></span></p>
<span><span>
<span><span>
<p>
</p><p>In the event of Autodiscover failure, retries will occur as follows: </p>
<p>* If Autodiscover fails, retry on a three minute interval over a period of two hours
</p>
<p>* If Autodiscover fails after three successive attempts, use MAPI but continue to retry
</p>
<p>* If Autodiscovery succeeds, refresh cached values on an hourly basis</p>
<p>

<span><span><span>
<span><span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:</p>
<p>Very important to detail the behavior and the environment. Both SfB / Lync can be either OnPrem, Online O365 or a hybrid setup of both. So:</p>
<p>- What is the environment, on the Exchange side?</p>
<p>- What is te environment on the Skype for Business side?</p>
<p>- Is the failure persistent or intermittent?</p>
<p>- When did the issue start and in what conditions? Any changes?</p>
<p>- Collect the <strong>Configuration Information </strong>(CTRL+Click Right on the small Skype / Lync icon near to the clock);</p>
<p>- In what network the issue reproduces?</p>
<p>- From OWA, can you connect the LWA client?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log collection action plan:</p>
<p>1.　　　 Make sure that the logging is enabled for both users:</p>
<p>In the Skype for Business client, go to "Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;General" and check the if the logging is set to "Full".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>　2.　　　 Close the Skype for Business client and clear the cache by deleting the following folders:</p>
<p>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Lync\Tracing</p>
<p>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Lync\sip_&lt;user&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>*If you have Skype for Business 2016, the folders will be:</p>
<p>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync\Tracing</p>
<p>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync\sip_&lt;user&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.　　　 Launch Command Prompt as admin and run the ipconfig /flushdns command;</p>
</span></span></span>
<p><span><span>4.　　　 Download NetMon tool and install it (link </span></span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4865" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>here</span></span></span></a><span><span><span>);</span></span></span></p>
<span><span>
<span><span>
<p>5.　　　 Launch NetMon as admin and start a network trace;</p>
<p>6.　　　 Depending on the problem, open the Skype for Business client, sign in and search a contact from the address book or open the Outlook client and try to create a Skype for Business Meeting from Calendar.</p>
<p>7.　　　 Stop the network trace from NetMon;</p>
<p>8.　　　 Archive the below folders and send them along with the Network Trace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Lync\Tracing</p>
<p>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\MSOIdentityCRL</p>
<p>
</p><p>*If you have Skype for Business 2016, the folders will be:</p>
<p>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync\Tracing</p>
<p>
</p><p>The responses for the scoping questions and all the data collected is enough for the Microsoft support engineers to figure out the issue.</p>
<p>Here is a summary again:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<p>
</p><li>Responses for the scoping questions;
<p>
</p></li><li>Print screen with the error message or the fault;

<p>3. The <strong>federation scenarios </strong>(when users from domainA can’t communicate with users from domainB):</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<p>
</p></ol>
</ol>
</span>
<ol>
</ol>
</span>
<ol>
<p><span><span>Questions:</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<span><span>
<ol>
<ol>
<p>
</p><li>What is your environment? (one of the options below)
<p>
</p></li></ol>
</ol>
<ul>
<ul>
<p>
</p><li>Online: Cloud only, Local AD, or ADFS;
<p>
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Hybrid: What is the server version?
<p>
</p><p>
</p></li><li>OnPrem: What is the server version.
<p>
</p></li></ul>
</ul>
</span></span>

<ol>
<ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<span>
<span>
<ol>
<ol>
<p>
</p></ol>
</ol>
<p>2. Is the reported presence failure a consistently reproducible problem? Or is it occurring intermittently?　</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<p>
</p></ol>
</ol>
<p>3. Behavior Start Time - any known Changes (Has this ever worked? If so, did any changes precede the functionality loss?) 　<br />
e.g. Since Deployment? Since Provisioning? Since day:time?　</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<p>
</p></ol>
</ol>
<p>If this has never worked before, go through Hybrid Config Scoping questions to confirm configuration is correct.</p>
<p>

</p><ol>
<ol>
</ol>
</ol>
</span>
<p><span><span>4. How many users out of your total user base are impacted by the issue?　 　<br />
　　　　　　　　　 e.g.: One |Some (#) | All USERS?　<br />
If one/some users, gather SIP address and User UPN.　<br />
e.g.: </span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></span></span><span><span><span>　<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<span>
<span>
<p><br />
</p>
<ol>
<ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<span>
<span>
<p>5. Between which users are there IM/Presence issues?　　 Determine where IM/P works and where it doesn't</p>

<ol>
</ol>
</ol>

<span>
<span>
<p>If the issue is only occurring between users on the same topology (on-prem or online), the issue is not related to Hybrid and should be investigated as a regular IM/P issue.</p>

                    I checked and apparently my HPWebcam driver is completely up to date, despite having updated Windows 10 recently. I can see/ hear people fine, and they can hear me but not see me.

<p><span>Hello MartaPelusi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Skype Community forum! I do understand the inconvenience you have faced.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For issues on video or webcam, please check the following:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Use the latest version of Skype.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>We’re always improving call quality, so for best performance, make sure that
<em>you and the person you’re calling</em> are using the latest version of Skype.
<a href="http://www.skype.com/go/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download the latest version</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>2. Check your connection.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the video freezes, looks block-like or has motion blur, it might be your internet connection (or your friend’s) causing the problem. If Skype detects a weak connection, it
 will reduce the quality to try and stop the call from dropping altogether. Check out our guide to
<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA12303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">solving connection issues</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>3. Check your webcam.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Make sure your camera is installed, plugged into your computer, and turned on. If you’re using an external camera and you’re having problems with video, try plugging it into
 a different USB port. If you’re using a USB hub, try plugging it directly into your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, kindly go through the steps provided under “My friends can’t see my video” in this link: Solving your video and webcam issues for Skype for Windows 10</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Should you have further queries, please do not hesitate to reply to this post.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.
</span></p>

            Please note: As I had already noted in my comments: I have verified that my built-in HPWebCam for Windows 10 has the most up-to-date drivers installed. Also, we all have the most up to date version of Skype (me and the other two people I have been Skyping
 with, who can not see me).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<div>
<div>
<p>re: "<span>Also, kindly go through the steps provided under “My friends can’t see my video” in this link: Solving your video and webcam issues for Skype for Windows 10" I have already done this.
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you, Marta Pelusi<br />

<p><span><span>Unfortunately, it is not uncommon that HP laptops are provided with a buggy Sonix webcam driver, and this may cause issues with Skype not being able to detect the webcam.</span></span></p>
<p>

</span></span><span>run the DirectX diagnostics tool.</span></span></span></strong></p>

            Thank you Ruwim.B, I will try this! I don't have time just now, and am not sure if it will resolve my issue or not; I do not need to Skype in the immediate future.&nbsp; I was having trouble with Google hangouts too where, sometimes folks could not hear me
 and I did make sure Mute was not on, etc. (And they could all hear each other). Sometimes people can see me on Google Hangouts, other times not, but the last few times no one could hear me! Lots of glitchy issues that you'd think you wouldn't have to deal
 with in our supposedly streamlined age of "distance communication."<br />

<h2>            Error pop ups after downloading and installing windows 10 .</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>There was a problem starting C\Windows\system32\NvMcTray.dll.</p>
<p>The specified module could not be found.</p>
<p>There was a problem starting C\Windows\system32\NVCpl.dll.</p>
<p>The specified module could not be found.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is the messages I get every time I start/ restart my Laptop. I was using windows 7 before I downloaded the free update for windows 10. I have followed the instruction as below by no success. I've also tried to download the related driver files from
 Nvidia but cannot install them as it says I don not have the compatable &nbsp;hardware.
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
</span></p><p>Since nvcpl.dll is file related to NVIDIA, I would suggest you to update the latest graphics card driver that is compatible with Windows 7 and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>If this does not resolve the issue then perform clean boot troubleshooting by following the below steps:
</p>
<p>Step 1: Perform a clean boot</p>
<p>1.Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.
</p>
<p>2.If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.
</p>
<p>3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box.
</p>
<p>4.On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.
</p>
<p>5.Click OK, and then click Restart. </p>
<p>If this solves the issue then some non-Microsoft applications may be causing this problem, in this case repeat the Step 1 and continue with the steps provided in the below link:
</p>
<p>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135 </p>
<p>
</p><p>After this please start the computer in normal mode by following below steps: </p>
<p>1.Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.
</p>
<p>2.If you are prompted for an administrator password type your password, or click Continue.
</p>
<p>3.On the General tab, click Normal Startup. </p>
<p>4.Click OK, and then click Restart. </p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<div>
<div>Hello ,</div>
<div>I've followed all the step-by- step instructions given below in your last mail but there is no change at all.</div>
<div>However, I contacted Nvidia through their chat portal and I've been told that my GPU Nvdia Geforce Go 7200 has drivers only up to Windows 7 OS and thus isn't compatible&nbsp; with Windows 10. This being the reason for the pop up error messages that I get. I
 have confirmed this information received by accessing the Nvdia driver installation site .</div>
<div>Kindly advise Microsoft team about this issue as I hope that in their endeavor to improve Windows 10 and make it compatible to older hardware, they could consider including a driver for Nvdia Geforce Go 7200 GPU.</div>
<div>Kindly advise if you have an alternative solution.</div>
<div>Thanks and kind regards,</div>
<div>Stephen G Dsouza.</div>

            <p>I have exactly the same issue and for the same reason. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My HP laptop&nbsp; (dv9715nr) does seem to work OK using the generic driver for the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter: driver version 10.0.10240.16384. &nbsp;Resolution is significantly reduced; especially the text is not very sharp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps there is/are Windows 10 NVIDIA driver(s) that are designed for other video processors that might work better than the generic Microsoft driver .... albeit not perfectly?&nbsp; Hope so.</p>

<h2>            Not valid Win32 application</h2>
                    When installing Skype for Windows 4.1 I receive the error message that the application is not a valid win32 application. The MS FAQ led me to reinstall the Windows Installer but uon doing that received message that this was not necessary with my current
 version of XP Hom and service pack 3.&nbsp; Any suggesions?&nbsp; Ive not encountered this problem on other computers.

            "Not valid Win32 Application" generally indicates that the file is corrupt. You may also need to do some maintenance on your computer like check disk etc. Also clear out your temporary internet files etc and redownload Skype.
<br />
<br />
Try to install after a fresh download on a freshly housecleaned/maintained computer.<br />

            I have this issue and not with Skype. With any and EVERY file I have attempted to download. Every single thing I have attempted to download comes up with this error. It downloads and then when it gets to the download box and I double click the .exe file,
 it comes up stating that it is not a valid win32 application. I have done scans, disc clean ups, rebooted, logged off and back on, defrags.... everything that I have found suggested to do in relation to this problem. I am beyond frustrated at this point. I
 belong to a game site and have paid for games that I can't play due to this issue. I have attempted to download a registry cleaner to fix this issue and can't even get that to work. Had to get a cleaner from a friend to try that solution. Nothing is working.
 Personally had it not been for me getting a new computer after they stopped putting XP on computers and forcing the consumer to use Vista, I would NOT be using Vista.

            Hm, what I found the problem to be was I downloading Skype from Google Chrome's browser as opposed to the less-secure Mozilla Firefox and lame MS Explorer. Chrome corrupted the Skype program file for some reason so I dled from another browswer and it worked
 fine. See if it works for you.

Many of these devices such as HP Stream came in a variety of colors with a full copy of Windows 8.1. Attractive qualities include an affordable price and a 11 or 13 inch display. Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations.

    <title>&#34;an error has occurred while ejecting &#39;BD-ROM Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tesfaldet  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;an error has occurred while ejecting &#39;BD-ROM Drive &#40;G&#58;&#41;&#39;&#34;</h2>
                    Recently I just got a Dell Studio XPS 1645 and when I wanted to test the slot-loading BD drive by putting a ps3 game in, the system would fail to eject it. I used a ps3 disc because it was the only BD disc I had and I know that it would allow me to look
 into the contents of the disc, just like with the ps2 and ps1. If I was able to read the contents of the disc then I know that the drive works as it's supposed to.<br />
<br />
However, the disc would get stuck inside and would not read at all. The drive would make spinning noises as if it was reading it but then it stops immediately. The only way I have figured to eject the disc was to hold on to the eject button and the touchpad
 (saw that it works on another site) while rebooting. Sometimes it would work. <br />
<br />
Also, another weird thing that I can tell why it's not my drive's fault but windows' fault is that I can put a regular CD-ROM in the drive and it would work perfectly (spinning loud, autoplay popping up, being able to eject it).<br />
<br />
The model of the slot load drive is the HLDS CA10N 4X BD reader and the driver I am using is ver. A110.

<p><span>Hi tesfaldet,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If possible, try with another Blue Ray disc. This will help in determining if the problem is solely with the concerned disc or with all blue ray
 discs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here are other things you can try.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Have a look with the inbuilt troubleshooter that’s available for Blue Ray discs. Run it and see if it manages to fix the issue.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are other firmware versions available for your drive at Dell website. Check with those versions and see if there’s any go.</span></p>

            Panzer General 2 was released in the 1990s - if it’s an older DOS program/game you can try installing a DOS emulator to run the game, it might work better.<br />

<span>This can help with some (but not all) programs/drivers:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next window click "Start the Program" to install it.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in Windows 7.

<p><strong><span>Hi ccteach,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>This issue occurs if some components cannot be copied when it gets to 12 to 13%.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to try and do the back up on a completely different drive and check if that resolves your issue.
 You can even use an external hard drive to back up the data. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Temporarily disable the anti-virus and firewall.
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Follow the below mentioned steps to disable any Anti Virus and Firewall you have on your computer
 -</span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Look on the desktop or in the notification area for an icon that represents
<span><strong>firewall</strong></span> or antivirus software. Move the pointer over each icon in the notification area to read the tool tips that describe whether an icon represents the
<span><strong>firewall</strong></span> or antivirus software. If you locate the software, go to step 2</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Look in Control Panel to determine whether firewall or antivirus software is installed on your computer.

<h2>            Xbox 360 was recognizing Hard Drive, now it isnt showing up&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I was transfering stuff to my new 120GB Xbox Hard Drive, it was working before but after transfering, it wont show up on my Xbox and when I go to plug it into my computer using a transfer cable, it shows up in 'My Computer' as an NTFS with 111GB free? How
 do I make it work with my Xbox again?</p>

<p>No I was transferring the data using a computer. The Hard Drive DOES NOT show up in the storage setting on the xbox itself (basically it isnt recognized a hard drive is plugged in) but when I plug it into the computer via the transfer cable, it shows up
 as an NTFS hard drive.</p>

<p>Doing the transfer through your PC is why it's not working sorry. You should have connected the new drive to your console and then connected the transfer cable to the drive you wanted to transfer the data from and then connected the usb end of the cable
 to your console.</p>
<p>You will never get that 120GB drive working as an Xbox hard drive again I suspect.</p>

<h2>            Device Encryption</h2>
                    <p>On one of my laptop which came pre-installed with Windows 10 Home Single Language there is an option for "Device Encryption"</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03878597-210a-47fa-9066-9256dc3bff5d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03878597-210a-47fa-9066-9256dc3bff5d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But on my other laptop which came pre-installed with Windows 10 Home there is no such option, no device encryption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has clearly specified that Bitlocker and device encryption would be available for Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise Then how is this option available on one of my Windows device and not on the other (both Home version)<br />

<p><span>Hi Pritam, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft community forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Did you recently make any changes on the computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What is the computer make and model?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Though the BitLocker encryption is not enabled or supported on Home or Home with single editions of Windows 10. I suggest you to check with the system manufacturer if they

<p>No changes. This option didn't appear all of a sudden, it existed from the day I got the laptop.</p>
<p>Version - 1607</p>
<p>It's BitLocker only. I once tried encrypting&nbsp;the device using this option and the encryption process was successful (also got that recovery key), later I decided to decrypt the drive.</p>
<p>Encryption (with this option) works perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Even the "Encrypt contents to secure data" option appears and works perfectly fine.</p>
<p>If it is a bug then even after 4 feature updates it should have been removed, </p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Whatever the case be I happy I have this option (BitLocker&nbsp;encryption) but wished if same was available on all my Windows 10 Home PCs</p>

<p>It won't work via your friends profile because any DLC license you purchase with your profile will be attached to your profile only.</p>

<p>You need to be logged into the other console you want to play on. AND you need to download the content on that console as well. I play at my brother house all the time.
</p>
<p>The only way for a different account to be played with DLC without you being logged in to the console yourself is the console that the license is associated to.

                    <p>I have a m2(boot C:), ssd(primary-new E:) and hdd(primary-old D:).&nbsp; I moved apps and programs from the hdd to the ssd, formatted the hdd and they still appear in apps and features under the D: drive. everything appears correctly in the file explorer.&nbsp; I
 believe that this is preventing me from using the hdd as a backup drive. I used Apps and Features or Steam to move everything.</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a nice list of games out there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It depends on how you move programs or apps on the computer (primary hard disk to external hard disk or vice versa). The reason why they are stayed listed on the hard disk because of the formal installation you've made in the first place. It's already in
 the <strong>Registry </strong>of the computer and will always be recognized that they are saved on the hard disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you move programs? Did you copy and paste?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>File Explorer</span></strong><span> is the main file and directory organizer of Windows. If this works in an unusual behavior, you will need to run our troubleshooter design for this. Visit this link:

<h3> akjourney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open Tray Error</h2>
                    
<p>I just want to voice my dissatisfaction concerning the all famous OTE. I am a victim. Yes, I said victim. From this point on, I am done with Microsoft products. I have cd drives on 10 year old Dell computers that still work, it amazes me. and to read all
 the crap that ms is putting dedicated loyal customers through is appalling. I believe there should be a class action suit, IMO. And then to charge your loyal customers 100 bucks and replace it with a different unit?</p>
<p>It has to be hardware, all mine stated after the updates as well. Sometimes, fires off immediately. Some days, like tonight, never will load. &nbsp;I am seriously let down by the support options. Clear the cache, disconnect HD, and if that does not work give
 Bill another bill, wait 30 days, and then get a recon?</p>
<p>Right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time to redo everything and convert to pc gaming. I will do this before I buy another piece of crap from MS.</p>
<p>I called the support # listed in other threads- propaganda as far as I am concerned. after all these options- *** it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If MS considers a loyal and dedicated is worth a phone call- then call me. If not- then cancel it all, my gold membership- everything</p>
<p>Class action...attorneys should be all over this.</p>
<p>Support- message me and I will give you my phone #. You call me.</p>
