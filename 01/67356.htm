<h2>            I cannot manually repair&#47; replace corrupted file Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I tried to copy or move file message Windows explorer stooped working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your website i was advised to check for corrupted files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have performed file check and also was able to see which file is corrupted in SFC details but I have no idea how I can replace this file with not corrupted one. The idea that I could use another computed with uncorrected file is great but I do not have
 another PC with Windows 7 so i cannot replace it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I could do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't find out how to attached my SFC file so i only attach the file that is corrupted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Eva,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information that you have provided, it does show that it can't resolve all of the corrupted system files. What I can suggest is to run
<strong>System File Checker</strong> (<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>) twice. After performing the SFC scan, run the
<strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management</strong> (<strong>DISM</strong>) to fix the system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just follow these steps on how to perform <strong>DISM</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>R</strong> key on your keyboard to access
<strong>Run</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>CMD</strong> in the <strong>Run</strong> box and hit <strong>Enter.</strong></li><li>In the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> window, paste this command: <strong>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth</strong></li><li>After running the <strong>DISM</strong>, the <strong>SFC</strong> one more time.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you are running in Windows 7 Service pack 1, it should run the command. If not, I suggest that you download the said service pack through this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the <strong>x86-based (32-bit) versions of Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 7</strong> or
<strong>the x64-based (64-bit) versions of Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 7</strong>, depending if you're using a 32 or 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a possibility that it will resolve the issue after installing the service pack since it is going to overwrite some of the system files in your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>@Jay Jap Microsoft engaged "expert":</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how it is going to go:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here we go again - a Microsoft engaged "expert" offering a command that is impossible to work in Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what you would see if you would follow your own advice on your Windows 7 system:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6fe31674-636b-4fe6-aa3f-18a33780a4f2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6fe31674-636b-4fe6-aa3f-18a33780a4f2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Why/How does this same bad advice keep appearing over and over and over again, and why doesn't somebody in the MS Answers Community do something (additional training, reassignment, termination) about it?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>...and you should be able to tell by looking at the log results that the system is already running Service Pack 1.</p>

<p>HI&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to follow your first suggestion but must agree with Jap Jap who also replied to my post that the command DISM/Online/Cleanup-Image/CheckHealth doesn't work. It gave me an error code 740. Not sure what that means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then followed you other step (even though my Windows 7 was Service pack 1 already) but again that did not solve the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is there any other suggestion? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was going to yet again restore my PC to factory settings which I had to do while ago as after I downloaded free Windows 10 (when they were offering for free) it worked perfectly fine for a while until there was an update and it crushed my PC which after
 weeks of trying to fix it led me to restore the PC to original factory settings and taking me back to Windows 7. I then managed to reinstall Windows 10 again but the same issue - my PC crashed again so back to restoring to factory settings and kept Windows
 7 since. Now I cannot transfer and/or copy files :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to blame Windows 10 download (I like Windows 10 on my laptop) but my point is that I had no problem with this PC until after the Windows 10 download months ago.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system (Windows 7) worked well until I downloaded Windows 10 (when they were offered for free), my PC crashed few months later and ended up restoring the PC to factory settings. I then downloaded Windows 10 yet again but same issue and ended up with
 having to restore the PC to factory settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't use the PC for a while after the last restore (about 6 months) so I am not sure if the issue was then (after my last recovery) but I must say that no matter how much I like windows 10 (on my laptop) I wish I never downloaded it on my desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am attaching screen print but not sure if you can read it, if not I will type it&nbsp;</p>

<p>Error 740 can mean that the command requires elevation (Command Prompt opened as Administrator) - another Microsoft engaged alleged "expert" failure to provide instructions that work but it sill will not work on Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Acer that has been restored to factory settings but you did not reply to the other questions, so with partial information and the issue of Explorer crashing let's see if this is the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you have an afflicted Explorer Shell Extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explorer Extensions make up the list/menu of things you see when you right click something. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>An afflicted Explorer Shell extension can cause Explorer to crash - especially when using copy/paste and/or drag/drop and often to/from an external USB attached drive or device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several recent incidents involving Acer and ASUS systems and MyWinLocker from EgisTec (which is already known to include some troublesome Explorer shell extensions) which may have come preinstalled on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>** Note:&nbsp; You may see this issue after the installation of Windows Update <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4038777/windows-7-update-kb4038777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB4038777</a> but the Windows update is not the problem - the update patches security holes that bring the real problem to the surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if your system is not from Acer or ASUS it may have MyWinLocker installed and since there have been many reports of it contributing to Explorer crashes it seems a good place to start looking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in your Installed Programs and find MyWinLocker or anything from EgisTec and you don't know what it is or why it is there consider just uninstalling it, rebooting and then see how things work.&nbsp; You can always reinstall it again later if needed,
 right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have determined that MyWinLocker or any other EgisTec programs are involved follow the general purpose instructions below so you will be able to see all the Explorer shell extensions and figure out which one is afflicted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using The following program suggestion if you see any extensions from EgisTec, PSD Security Software, eDataSecurity, DragDropProtect (they will be some of the pink extensions) start with those first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of those things are present, continue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving (especially when right clicking), start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.&nbsp; You may also see Data Execution Prevention (DEP) errors.&nbsp; DEP errors are reported when Windows feels
 threatened by a program and Windows will shut down the threatening program.&nbsp; Windows should never feel threatened by Windows Explorer (or Internet Explorer) unless some add-on is the cause.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added without your knowledge when you install new software.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
If you can make it happen anytime you want, make an adjustment and then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed now and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView (double click shexview.exe) and acknowledge the security warning, adjust the column widths so you can see everything clearly.&nbsp; Under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in
 light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move up or move down the Microsoft column so it is closer to the top (Move Up) so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header called Microsoft (it may be way out on the right side of the screen) to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column header) so all the non Microsoft extensions are at the top and easy to see.&nbsp; They will say "No" and be marked
 in pink since they are not Microsoft extensions, something like this: </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d24c2e4c-1ede-4fa6-b292-dc4a77378dcc" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
If you see extensions that do not have anything listed under Description, Product Name, Version, Company or have peculiar names that looks like they might be just random numbers and&nbsp; letters, you might want to look at those first.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding Explorer crashes or DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;my-suspicious-add-on&gt;&nbsp; windows explorer crashing<br />
<br />
You have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time (or perhaps in little groups of 3-5) keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your (right click) failure
 condition.&nbsp; If Explorer starts to act normally, you will know that some extension you just disabled in that group of 3-5 is the culprit so you can start to enable them one at a time until explorer fails again.</p>
<p><br />
One user reported that there was a need to restart Explorer after each adjustment so to do that press Ctrl-E from within ShellExView.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled.&nbsp; You can always enable it again later, so keep track of things by writing them down.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time or in little groups (to make things go faster) until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again to be sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot, test your failure condition and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the failure condition.<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of extensions, you could disable them is little groups, 3-5 at a time instead of 1 at a time until your system starts to behave. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it does behave, you will know that the problem is one of the extensions in that little group and you can enable those in the group one at a time until the problem comes back, then the problem will be with the last extension you enabled.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the problem and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you think you found the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be
 sure the problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />

            <p>I have a similar situation. I'm running an ASUS UX31E on Windows 8 PRO (64 bit) upgraded from Windows 8 Release Preview. If I place the laptop into sleep manually, or via closing the lid, or via the automatic settings (e.g. after 1 hour, go to sleep), upon
 resuming, I get a blue screen with a&nbsp; message stating "KERNEL DATA INPAGE ERROR". The Laptop then restarts and works semi-normally (I notice that some of the USB devices are not loaded properly, and sometimes sound card is not loaded properly).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have since changed my power settings, removing the check from the "resume fast" (or whatever it was called) from the power settings. So far so good, but have not yet fully tested.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other advice as to why this error occurs is appreciated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@Bullets for Hire - is this the same for you?</p>

            My setup is: after 4 minutes, screensaver kicks in.&nbsp; After 5 minutes, monitor turns off.&nbsp; After 10 minutes, computer goes to sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is all setup within the screensaver and change power settings menu.&nbsp; When you select change power, I select Balanced
 (recommended) and adjust the time to turn off display and put the computer to sleep.&nbsp; So after 10 minutes of inactivity, the computer should go into sleep mode.&nbsp; This has always been fine in Windows 7.&nbsp; Touch the keyboard or mouse and the machine wakes up
 instantly.&nbsp; Now, in Windows 8 Pro (64 version), SearchIndex.exe prevents the computer from going into sleep mode.&nbsp; I know it's this service because when I run powercfg /requests, it tells me that this service is preventing the computer from sleeping.&nbsp; If I
 disable this service, computer sleeps right on schedule.&nbsp; Unfortunately, you need this service to run if you're using Windows Media Center and you decide to record a program but you first need to search to see when this program airs next.&nbsp; I've searched up
 and down and don't seem to have any ideas on what the solution is.&nbsp; Any help is appreciated.<br />

            <p>I have the exact same problem with an HP TouchSmart 300.&nbsp; Media Center is the app we use most on this PC and it worked great with Win 7.&nbsp; Now when I try to put the computer to sleep it appears to behave normally - screen shuts off and power button turns
 from blue to orange - but then the computer comes right back on.&nbsp; I'm going to have to go back to Win 7 soon if I can't find a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also - to anyone from MSFT monitoring this forum - removing Media Center a a standard feature was VERY shortsighted.&nbsp;

            I can confirm now after testing for a week that un-checking the option under "Power Settings" of "turn on fast start-up" fixes my issue - the laptop now sleeps and resumes normally.

Hi Bullets for Hire,</p>
<p>I just had a similar issue myself, regarding my Windows 8 pro PC not entering "Sleep Mode" correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steps I found to work,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1: Check for updates on desktop and also on start&nbsp;screen (under settings charm), make sure to actually complete a new search. As I had the regular information being displayed informing myself that I am set to have automatic updates installed, however after
 selecting "Check for Updates" and "Check Now" options in both desktop and start screen, new updates were displayed. Then completed a "Re-Start" and checked again, (in both areas) Again had to switch from desktop and start screen as low and behold more updates
 were there. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2: Selected Action Centre, troubleshooting, "Fix&nbsp;Problems with Windows Update" (For the above reasons) Ran as Administrator, after repair had completed I had to re-enable the install optional updates feature under Windows Update Settings, and complete a
 new search to be sure all have been installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3: In Start Screen, I&nbsp;Turned off&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the "Live Tiles" by right clicking on the tile and selecting "Turn live tile off" The ones I turned off were, News, Sport, Finance, Bing and Xbox Solitaire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4: Also cleaned up history in browser and disk drive, again just to make sure nothing there was still communicating and preventing "Sleep Mode" entering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After completing the above steps my Pc now obeys the settings as set in my "Power Options" (Found in Control Panel after opening Action Centre from desktop) with the result of my Pc entering "Sleep Mode" correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

Hi Lee,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hybrid Sleep" is within the advanced settings for power settings. Mostly used by Pc user's, i.e. not Laptops/Tablets, as they have other power saving option/features.&nbsp;Hybrid, is available in Windows 7ultimate32bit, Windows 8pro64bit(with M.C.)&nbsp;versions.
 (I can not comment about other versions as these are the only versions I use.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To locate Hybrid sleep (on a Windows 8 pro64bit Pc (with M.C.) Please type, Power Options onto your start screen and on the right hand side select, Settings. The top option is listed as Power Options. Please select, a new windows will open on your desktop,
 displaying Power Options. Please, select the highlighted option labelled, Change Plan Settings, then select the next highlighted option labelled, Change Advanced Power Settings. A new windows will open. Please, scroll down the page until you locate the Sleep
 option and click on the plus sign to expand options. Hybrid is the second on the list. Once expanded you can select the On/Off option&nbsp;as you wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are other ways to open this same command/feature, seeing as you are finding it difficult to locate this feature,&nbsp;I would suggest to follow the above steps until you are more confident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Based on your post it sounds like your computer was infected when you attempted to install MSE.</p>

<p>You should not attempt to use AVG and MSE concurrently on the same computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your PC is<b>&nbsp;possibly&nbsp;</b>infected with the newest variant of Sirefef AKA Zero Access. &nbsp;One of the symptoms is that downloads are (falsely) identified as being a virus...and the malware interferes with the installation of other antimalware programs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest solution is use HitmanPro Kickstart which should remove this malware and repair the changes made to the computer by the malware:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.surfright.nl/en/kickstart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.surfright.nl/en/kickstart</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; You must
 use an uninfected computer to download it to a flash drive and then follow the specific directions on how to run the program on the infected computer. &nbsp;Hitman Pro Kickstart is available as a 30 day trial version.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you remember making any specific change in the computer prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>This could be due to various reasons and to diagnose the issue, let's try the following methods and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong><span>Start the computer in Safe Mode and check if the issue persists. If the issue does not persist in safe mode, place the computer in clean boot state and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 1:
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Start the computer in Safe Mode
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows
 are started. The words <strong>Safe Mode </strong>appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> When you hit the power button, hold down the
<strong><em>Shift</em></strong> key when clicking the <strong><em>Restart</em></strong> button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Next, hit
<strong><em>Advanced</em></strong> options followed by <strong><em>Windows</em></strong>
<strong><em>Startup</em></strong><em> <strong>Settings</strong></em> from the next screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe
 Mode as well. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 2:&nbsp;
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Perform Clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup
 is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow
 the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:
<em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Run Microsoft Safety Scanner</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It
 works with your existing antivirus software.</span></span></p>

</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware
 definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a
 potential for data loss.</span></span></p>

            Hi,<br />
1.&nbsp; Did you make any changes to the computer (hardware or software) before the issue occurred?<br />
2.&nbsp;What is the make and model of the monitor?
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1 :<br />
</strong>Try updating the graphics card driver. Refer the following link.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></div>
<div><strong><br />
Method 2 :<br />
</strong>I would suggest you to uninstall the display driver and then reinstall it and check if it helps.<br />
Steps to reinstall the graphics card.<br />
Reinstall the drivers for your Display adapter. <br />
a. Click Start. In the Start Search box type "devmgmt.msc" and press Enter.<br />
b. Expand "Display Adapters", double-click on the entry of the display adapters.<br />
c. Click the tab "Driver", click "Uninstall".<br />
d. Click Start. In the Start Search box type "appwiz.cpl" and press Enter. <br />
e. Remove the entries related to the display adapter.<br />
Then reinstall the driver with your driver CD that came with your computer. <br />
Alternatively, you can try to uninstall the driver from the Device Manager, and then go to the computer or the device Manufactures website download the latest driver</div>
<div><strong>NOTE</strong>: Don’t uninstall the drivers until you have the source to install the drivers back to your computer. Also create a system restore point before you uninstall the drivers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Follow the mentioned link for updating driver: <br />

                    I just reinstalled Windows 10 fresh. It has no applications installed yet, but I have applications that I installed previously on my other HDDs. How do I tell Windows that these apps are installed? Or how do I create a launch icon for Windows Store applications:
 particularly Forza 7 and Forza Horizon.

<p>Hi Moka.1,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need to formally reinstall Forza 7 or Forza Horizon on your computer. This program needs to be installed properly so that
<strong>Windows 10</strong> will recognize it and should be added in its <strong>
Registry</strong>. Huge game programs like this should not just copied from a hard disk to a computer.</p>
<p><span>The reason is that when an application is listed on the <strong>Registry
</strong>of your operating system, it will be handled by your computer and it will do its best to make it compatible.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>During installation, there's an option to create a desktop icon in the installer. Check this option and click
<strong>Finish</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.</span></p>

<h2>            Dell N5110 Inspiron Camera Not Working After Windows 10 Upgrade&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>Anyone help me on installing Dell Inspiron N5110 Camera driver on Windows 10? Camera is not detecting in my laptop. I was an Insider Preview Windows 10 User, while using the insider Windows 10 version, my camera was working fine. After the upgrade to Windows
 10 Pro, my camera is not detecting. Also, I am finding serious issue with the battery backup after the Windows 10 installation. Till the previous versions, before installing the graphical drivers my battery backup will be very poor, once after installing the
 drivers, battery life will be increased. But in Windows 10, after installing the drivers also, I cannot find any improvement in my battery backup. I lost battery backup immediately after installing Windows 10 Insider Preview version. Guys help me out on this!
 I hope still Microsoft is working on drivers support for Windows 10. As a Microsoft developer, I value your product and hope I will get the answer soon. Thanks a lot in advance!!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen others report this too, but I've also seen some unofficial info that the release date may have changed (For all versions, disc or digital)</p>
<p>Best option to try for now is to contact Xbox Support to see if they can double check some things to make sure it's not an issue on your end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To contact Xbox Support use the Phone or Microsoft Support Chat option at http://support.xbox.com/contact-us</p>

<h2>            How to use my XBOX live account in another windows account using Windows 8</h2>
                    
<p>Hi<br />
<br />
I have small problem I have my WINDOWS 8 account that I use on my computer. Now I want to use my XBOX LIVE in my computer, but not make another user to have Switch between profile, just to have to play in XBOX LIVE. So is it possible to SIGN IN at XBOX games
 with another account in background and second in XBOX LIVE GAMES program without singing out at my current windows profile? &nbsp;<br />
<br />
And I do not want to connect these two accounts together in one, because I want to keep these separately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I believe the way Windows 8 works what you're suggesting is not currently possible. Everything is linked with the Microsoft account, even if you wanted to link the accounts, it wouldn't be possible.</p>

<p>Reset this PC will probably have uninstalled Windows Essentials, which is why you can't find it. Resetting
<em>Removes apps and drivers you installed</em>; it's not clear (to me, at any rate) whether
<em>apps</em> includes all programs or just some of them, and in that case, which ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>K</em><em>eep all files</em> is just as ill-defined as <em>removes apps</em>. It refers to user data (e.g. documents and&nbsp;pictures in the folders called
<em>My documents</em> and <em>My pictures</em>), but it's unclear whether it covers all user data in all folders in the user profiles.
<br />
<br />
Please check whether these folders exist:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>C:\Users\</strong>{user}<strong>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>C:\Users\</strong>{user}<strong>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>where {user} is the name of&nbsp;the Windows user account concerned. Be sure to check the folders for all users if there's more than one. You'll have to have
<em>Hidden items </em>selected on the <em>View</em> tab in Explorer to be able to see the folders. If they exist, your data should be safe. If they don't, you're probably out of luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try installing <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/download-windows-essentials#wetabs=we2012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Essentials</a>; if&nbsp;the installer&nbsp;finds your data where they should be, you're good to go.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you have File history set up to back up your Windows Live Mail data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were you normally signed in in Windows Live Mail? If you were, your contacts should be safe.</p>

            <p>I just did a reset on a customer's PC for Windows 10. Despite the "assurance" that all user files would be kept, Windows Live Mail (the program) and its data were gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the list of removed apps that the reset process keeps, there is no mention of Windows Live Mail being removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out that the data can be found in:</p>
<p>c:\windows.old\users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are various folders there for the account(s) and storage folders. E-mails are stored individually as *.eml files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Supposedly Microsoft Essentials can be reinstalled. In this case, as Live Mail is no longer supported by Microsoft, I'll be changing the mail program to Thunderbird. It's much easier to backup, manage, and move from one system to another, if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very disappointed at how the "reset' process is presented (misleadingly, in my opinion) and operates.</p>

<h2>            Movie Maker&#58; Movie saved with glitches</h2>
                    <p>When I play my movie in the program, everything plays smoothly with no problems, but every time I publish, in the same few spots where it goes to a new clip, there is a skip or glitch saved in the video.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen this question a few times and I've tried some of the solutions like updating my driver and repairing Windows Essentials. My source file is an MP4, but it's my understanding that to convert the file to WMV as some posters have suggested, I'd have
 to start all over with my edits which would take ages. (I'd be happy to be wrong in this case if it will fix the problem.) The only thing I haven't tried is messing with codecs because I don't know enough about it to know where to begin. If anyone has any
 suggestions specific to my circumstances, I'd be greatly appreciative. I'm running 64-bit Windows 10. Thank you :D</p>

Thanks for the suggestion, but the clips are not overlapping. And it's usually fine when I play it in the program; it's just when I save that the glitches pop up. It happens a few times when the next clip has different audio that isn't directly from the video,
 but other times it happens with the original audio, just jumping from clip to clip. I've tried restarting and saving multiple times -- a few spots save correctly or incorrectly sometimes but one particular spot is jumpy/glitchy/skippy every time I save. Any
 other ideas?

            <p>It happens sometimes when saved project like the captions are cut off at the end of video clip. The remedy is to copy the video clip and paste to the next, also copy and paste the caption. In your case the audio is the cause why it skip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drag the video that is skipped to end of story board and - project-emphasize music, then play it it works. Do not save -only for trial and error. Check the audio for copyright.</p>

            I tried emphasizing the music but the skip/glitch is still there, only in the final saved product, not in the preview when I play it in the program. Plus selecting Emphasize Music adds a fade in to the next clip which I don't want. I'm about at my wit's
 end with this project. If anyone has any more ideas for me to try, I would be so grateful.&nbsp;

<p>If you purchase content through the in game store, it's treated slightly different, than a market place purchase as its controlled by EA. &nbsp;It works on the same principle as a season pass and why they tell you not to download the single files from the market
 place if you have bought a season pass, as you will be charged twice for it. So if you ever lose those content packs or get a new system, you will have to load the game to download them as they will be tied to your EA account as oppose to your live account.</p>

I know it's kinda troublesome but &nbsp;:I</p>

<p>I'm assuming it won't let you use the DLC with the other console because you bought it in game using Battlefield Premium. You'll have to re-download the content to the other console once the game is running on that console.</p>

    <title>Very high CPU Usage for no apparent reason - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fournodes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Very high CPU Usage for no apparent reason</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this is a problem with some graphic driver or direct X or something of that nature, but I`ve had little or no success in fixing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I`ve already tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Updating all drivers to latest version</p>
<p>2. Update windows to latest version</p>
<p>3. Uninstall ESET (antivirus)</p>
<p>4. Upgrade/downgrade graphic driver specifically</p>
<p>5. Clean Boot windows</p>
<p>6. Enable/Disable each device from device manager</p>
<p>7. Don`t even remember how many others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is not present when I load windows 10 in safe mode (with or without networking)</p>
<p>I`m sharing the following in the <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!Apue9SZMMdAzihrM6U0scIFk7_V_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
one drive shared folder</a></p>
<p>This contains the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Speccy snapshot</p>
<p>2. ETL generated using xperf (can generate a newer file if requested, with desired flags)</p>
<p>3. Task manager and resource monitor snapshot</p>
<p>4. LatencyMon snapshots</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instance in the snapshot above show CPU peek with windows explorer on the top which not necessarily always the case, this happen as soon as I try to do anything on the machine in this case opening and closing explorer to demonstrate the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More information that might be helpful: The machine use to work flawless before, The issue started with the BSOD couple of days ago with the following error code:&nbsp;IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me on this issue.</p>
<p>Looking forward for some help</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<br />
<br />Blue Screens are in general caused by a bad driver
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<p>Hi Andre,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, I will go ahead and do that but I would like to have this account fixed as I have lots of valuable programs installed under the current user.<br />
<br />
Let me give it a shot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay here are the <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!Apue9SZMMdAziiOK018RlD-dF34Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
results</a></p>
<p>I don`t see any improvements as such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to add that earlier today (after I posted the question)</p>
<p>I ran Driver Verifier Manager -&gt; Custom Settings -&gt; Force IRQL checking</p>
<p>Which has given me some improvements, now it's not peaking as high as 100% on every step (even moving mouse rapidly would make CPU go and stay up)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's staying on the 30%-60% mark when idle, but importantly even at 100% (with chrome opened in the background in this
<a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Apue9SZMMdAziieVI9Zwj-v3VcjC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
example</a>&nbsp;it is not impacting the experience that much compared to before, where I would have trouble to even navigate as the mouse would start to lag badly.</p>

<p>No worries friend. As you can see from the above responses it's a well known scam that is very ineffective and little more than just a nuisance. In no way are you at risk... well unless you actually try to get one of their "free" Xbox's. I also advise you
 to not respond to these random messages. It may open the gate for more absurd advertisement and scam messages.</p>

<h2>            TEAC CAB-200 bluetooth driver for Windows7 x64</h2>
                    <p>Hello -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have finally completed a clean upgrade to Win7 pro 64 bit and have a Dell CAB-200 19 in 1 card reader with Bluetooth (connects via USB 2.0).&nbsp; The CAB-200&nbsp;shows up as a portable device in device manager and the card reader works fine but I cannot utilize
 the Bluetooth function.&nbsp;&nbsp; A search for Bluetooth shows nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I only use Bluetooth to transfer items from android devices.&nbsp; Properties show Microsoft Driver date 6/21/2006&nbsp; version 6.1.7600.16385&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dell website only offers a driver for Vista.&nbsp; Any
 thoughts?</p>

            <p>I had a similar situation.</p>
<p>After upgrading my Dell 435MT desktop from Vista to Windows 7 (64bit), I did not have bluetooth working, despite having the bluetooth blue led showing up on my Desktop's front panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took me several months to do some research and give up a few times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally today, after spending an hour, I found out some solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Devices and Printers</p>
<p>I could see I had CAB-200 and BT Mini-Receiver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I un-installed CAB-200 and shutdown the system.</p>
<p>I pressed the button on the media card reader and kept it pressed while powering on the desktop. (I am not sure if that steps is required, but somewhere I read that it is needed to set the card reader into Bluetooth mode)</p>
<p>Then, after around 20 seconds, I removed my finger from the button. Meanwhile, Windows 7 booted up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, it started searching for the drivers and installed them.</p>
<p>I had previously downloaded and extracted&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=Y6F01</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I ran the exe in that folder with "Windows Vista SP2" compatibility and also with "Run as administrator".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I rebooted the computer again and after that the BT Mini Receiver device got installed with following modules:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Generic Bluetooth Adapter</p>
<p>2. Bluetooth Device (RFCOMM Protocol TDI)</p>
<p>3. Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator</p>
<p>4. Bluetooth Device (Personal Area Network)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now, I am able to see Bluetooth icon in my system tray and can transfer files from my Android devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish Dell had made this easier for us.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are unable to search Bluetooth functionality after upgrading from previous version of windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 Try to install driver from following methods. </p>
<p>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly </p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly#update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly#update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly=windows-7</a>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Method 2 If the above step does not resolve the issues try the following instructions.</p>
<p>Changes in an operating system usually cause pre-existing drivers to become useless because the drivers will be looking to work with parts of the operating system which no longer exist. Than we have to run the driver in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the dell website does not have the latest driver for windows 7 than we have to install vista driver in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Help with Windows 7 compatibility problems</span></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the drivers from manufacturer website.</p>
<p>Link to download the vista drivers: <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/driverdetails?driverid=R176546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/driverdetails?driverid=R176546</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Install the TEAC CAB-200 Bluetooth driver in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>1. Place the vista 64 bit driver installation file on the Desktop.</p>
<p>2. Right Click the driver installation file and select Properties/Compatibility Tab. Select the vista options in from the list in the following image.</p>
<p>3. Click Apply/OK.</p>
<p>4. Right Click the file and select the <strong>Run As Administrator</strong> option to install.</p>
<p>5. Restart the computer.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you can run BlueScreenView to see the BCCode or Stop codes - either in Windows or Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
See the BlueScreen troubleshooter above dated Monday, March 29, 2010 7:48 PM.<br />
<strong><br />
BCCode: 24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0x00000024<br />
<br />
Cause</strong></p>
<p>One possible cause of this bug check is disk corruption. Corruption in the NTFS file system or bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk can induce this error. Corrupted SCSI and IDE drivers can also adversely affect the system's ability to read and write to
 disk, thus causing the error.</p>
<p>Another possible cause is depletion of nonpaged pool memory. If the nonpaged pool memory is completely depleted, this error can stop the system. However, during the indexing process, if the amount of available nonpaged pool memory is very low, another kernel-mode
 driver requiring nonpaged pool memory can also trigger this error.</p>
Resolving the Problem
<p><em>To debug this problem:</em> Use the .cxr&nbsp;(Display Context Record) command with Parameter&nbsp;3, and then use the kb&nbsp;(Display Stack Trace) command.</p>
<p><em>To resolve a disk corruption problem:</em> Check Event Viewer for error messages from SCSI and FASTFAT (System Log) or Autochk (Application Log) that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. Try disabling any virus scanners,
 backup programs, or disk defragmenter tools that continually monitor the system. You should also run hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer. Run
<strong>Chkdsk&nbsp;/f&nbsp;/r</strong> to detect and resolve any file system structural corruption. You must restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition.</p>
<p><em>To resolve a nonpaged pool memory depletion problem:</em> Either add new physical memory to the computer (thus increasing the quantity of nonpaged pool memory available to the kernel), or reduce the number of files on the Services for Macintosh (SFM)
 volume.<br />
