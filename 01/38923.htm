<h2>            I have forgotten the password to one of my compters</h2>
                    <p>I used this computer just last week with no issue and now it is requiring me to use my Password Recovery disk which I do not recall ever making (fiction)</p>
<p>What is up and how can i use my computer without a reformatting&nbsp; since my installation disks are no longer available to me? This is some thing I do not want to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Ideas welcome.</p>

<p>You can do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the BIOS so that the machine boots off your Windows 10 Repair Flash Disk*.</li><li>Use System Restore to set Windows back to a point when you were able to log on.</li><li>Plan ahead and create, test and document a spare admin account in order to prevent similar mishaps, same as you had a spare key cut for your house/flat.</li></ol>
<p>* This command, when executed on any Windows 10 PC, will create such a disk: <em>
RecoveryDisk.exe. </em>Do NOT copy the system files.</p>

<h2>            Has your &#39;Restart Options&#47;schedule a time&#39; been blocked by a WU&#63; Or do you still have it&#63; Win10</h2>
                    <p><strong>16th March: Is your Title changed from Problems with Restart after Cumulative WU: (1) Reminder (2) Schedule a time Win10.</strong></p>
<p><strong>See post 16th March below for the reason.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sod's Law (UK technical term) has operated. Whilst in the middle of creating a reply to a User with "PC shuts down", my laptop shut down. It's done that intermittently and I've installed the AMD Adrenalin version, their answer to the well-publicised fiasco
 with AMD/Intel driver/chip fiasco. But this time it didn't restart so I had to switch off/wait five minutes/switch on and then the cause was clear - after yesterday's Cumulative WU (KB4090913) there was another one (KB4088776) causing the havoc.</p>
<p>Sorted now but two questions please:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) I'd previously turned on "Show More Notifications" i.e. remind me before restarting. This was now turned off. Can/do some WUs change settings?
</p>
<p>(2) "Schedule a time" - mine is greyed out. Why? Is it because I 'only' have Win10 Home?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Taffy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could have been caused by some updates that was installed on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the options on your PC are grayed out because of the update you just received which is the
<strong>KB4088776 OS Build 16299.309</strong>. This includes the <strong>Scheduled time</strong> option. To resolve this, you will need to do a full restart on your PC until your computer says updating. You can check our support article as well for Windows
 Updates issue: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fix Windows Updates issues</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Keep us posted should you have other concerns so we can further assist you.</p>

<p>Hello Aldwin. I probably do a full restart four or five times a day and when there's a problem, as now, I check my Settings for another update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em>Fix Windows Updates&nbsp;</em>has taken a long time and the latest notice says</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3eec4fbe-e2c5-4aa6-b48b-e364187b1e94?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3eec4fbe-e2c5-4aa6-b48b-e364187b1e94?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Continuing took me way too deep for comfort, including BITS and others including the ubiquitous SFC/ Scannow. I've always found that to be a total waste of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's NOT a problem with my laptop because I'm having exactly the same issue with my spare laptop, where the WU was installed yesterday. At the moment, it looks to me like another failed WU, and if you read the very many threads from many users with problems
 after the same WU, it has to be the programmers' fault, surely?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can't I simply uninstall and re-install </span><strong>KB4088776 OS Build 16299.309</strong><span>?

<p>We appreciate your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to uninstall the recent update on your computer, we need to do a <strong>
System Restore </strong>on your device. This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time generated before the Windows update. It won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was
 made. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Start</strong> button, type <strong>control panel</strong> and then choose it from the list of results.</li><li>Search <strong>Control Panel</strong> for Recovery.</li><li>Select <strong>Recovery</strong> &gt; <strong>Open System Restore</strong>&gt; <strong>
Next</strong></li><li>Choose the restore point related to the problematic update and then select <strong>
Next</strong> &gt; <strong>Finish</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Post back should you have other concerns so we can further assist you.</p>

<p>Hello Aldwin. I'm horrified to have just found out that my System Restore that I'd been told by one of your colleagues had been resolved (&amp; being trusting I hadn't checked) is in fact still knackerated (Yorkshire technical term). So please don't waste any
 time on the System Restore topic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you know though, there was a major thread (on that problem) created by Harold Fra on the 18th March2017 and answer-marked by Jestoni Mac the same day although there were dozens of User who complained that they still had the problem. My complaint to Mod
 Requests was over-ruled leaving me and many others that MS had a problem that they didn't want to admit. We know now why of course - System Restore won't be in the next major Version change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that we drop System Recovery altogether. I'm about to change the title because I've been tipped off elsewhere that the 'Schedule a Time' option has been deliberately blocked/greyed out by Microsoft.</p>
<p>I can understand why - distributing Cumulative WUs must be an horrendous headache for MS - but if it's true, why not just tell us, so we don't waste time like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the person who tipped me off is an Insider. He says they flagged a problem and this is how MS has dealt with it. As I said, I've issues at all with such operational changes but please just tell us. I won't waste any more of your time Aldwin. Let's see
 if the title change attracts any comments. Thanks.</p>

<h3> jfletcher220  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMC getting &#34;Volume Error&#34; message box</h2>
                    I have Win 7 32bit and use it for my home theater PC...so I use WMC.&nbsp; A couple of days ago I started gettting a message box that says "Volume Error" and something like WMC has experienced an unexpected error and either sound will not work or I will not
 be able to control the volume.<br />
<br />
I have the latest Realtek audio drivers and the volume works fine when I use Netflix.&nbsp; However, if I play a TV show the volume cannot go up or down and I have to use the TV speakers to adjust.&nbsp; Please help.

            Hi JFletcher220,<br />
<br />
a)<strong><span> </span></strong>Do you get any specific error code?<br />
<br />
b) Did you make any changes to your computer prior to the issue occurrence?<br />
<br />
In case you've upgraded to Windows 7, you may have to download the latest audio drivers for your Windows 7 by visiting the manufacturer's website. Click
<span>
<a href="http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsCheck.aspx?langid=1&amp;pfid=24&amp;level=4&amp;conn=3&amp;downtypeid=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>
</span>to visit manufacturer's website.<br />
<br />
<strong>Some devices have drivers that you need to install yourself. If you download a driver that isn't self-installing, follow these steps:</strong>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</strong>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Security, and then, under System, clicking Device Manager.&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.‌<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In the list of hardware categories, find the device that you want to update, and then double-click the device name.<br />
Click the Driver tab, click Update Driver, and then follow the instructions.&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />

            Azeez,.<br />
Thanks for the help. It does not provide a specific error, it just says volume error, and that sound may be uncontrollable or muted in Media Center.<br />
<br />
the interesting thing is the volume control works with netflix streaming and movies that are saved. &nbsp;Volume for live tv and recorded tv does not work or atleast cannot be adjusted. &nbsp;I have updated all my ATI and realtek audio drivers. &nbsp;Pleaae help.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            I have a problem that produces this error too.<br />
<br />
If I touch the audio control in WMC then the error pops up;<br />
<br />
<br />
After that I have no audio in WMC and no audio in Windows.&nbsp; A system restart is required to restore audio.<br />
<br />
I'm using Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit.&nbsp; The MB has "Realtek High Definition Audio" and video card has an "AMD High Defininition Audio Device".&nbsp; I have the AMD device selected as the primary audio output and sound works great, output via HDMI ... until I touch
 the WMD audio control.&nbsp; This is a new install.&nbsp; The problem has always existed.<br />
<br />
I have tried the drivers that came with my hardware.&nbsp; I have tried the latest released drivers.&nbsp; I have tried beta version drivers.&nbsp; I have tried drivers that others online have recommended as being reliable.&nbsp; Still, WMC locks out my audio with this error when
 I click on the little speaker icon.<br />
<br />
I can find no messages in the system logs regarding this error when it pops up.&nbsp; Why doesn't WMC log something when this happens?&nbsp; Can I make WMC log details when this occurs?&nbsp; How can I track down the cause of this problem?<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />

            This string seems to have stopped by I am having the same issue.&nbsp; I can adjust the volume in WMC but if I turn it all the way down to zero (0), I get the same error mentioned above:<br />
<br />
<br />
</span>After getting this error, I no longer can get any&nbsp; sound (even when I turn the WMC volume up above 0) and need to reboot the system to restore sound.<br />
<br />
I tried the solution mentioned but noticed that auto volume was already unchecked.&nbsp; Typically, when this error orrcurs I'm watching a DVR'd show in Recorded TV.<br />
<br />
Help......<br />

<h2>            Reset PC to Sell, Lost Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>A couple months back I received a Surface Pro 3 with Windows 8.1 Pro (I believe). I had the Microsoft logo in the taskbar to reserve my place for Windows 10, I did. I got it a couple weeks ago or so. I was running it fine. Then in the past couple days I
 factory&nbsp;reset my computer twice because I was going to sell it. The first time I was about to sell it but the sale fell short. So I set it up as my PC again. The first reset WAS on Windows 10. I then got another offer a couple days later, and I factory reset
 the computer again. However, this time the PC had the purple Windows 8 setup menu. I was worried so I set it up as a test, and low-and-behold it was on Windows 8, and it said Build 9600... I'd like to rest it one more time and have the blue Windows 10 setup
 menu and&nbsp;my LEGITAMTE copy of Windows 10 for the customer. Any way I can get Windows 10 back, or get the symbol to be in the taskbar to reserve or re-download Windows 10?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Some PCs may need up to 24 hours to download Windows 10, depending on the quality of the internet connection.

    <title>Laserjet Lpt style printer no longer working in Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikemajor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laserjet Lpt style printer no longer working in Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Good evening folks -&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Well, I managed to sort the awful corrupt file issues with Win 10 by reinstalling to a nice, new drive. This lets me use my machine.<br />
<br />
Downside, the Laser Printer no longer operates. It's an old Laserjet 6. I've done all the 'usual' including manual install etc. It requires a USB virtual port which it is set to during the install, but it still cannot print.<br />
<br />
The system shows the following:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b257a19-deaa-4ae6-8273-65bae2fc9922" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b257a19-deaa-4ae6-8273-65bae2fc9922" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>At issue is the USB Printing support and the 'No Printer Attached' entries. I've updated the drivers for each of these manually, no joy. When I unplug the printer, these two entries vanish.<br />
<br />
There is also the IEEE-1284 Controller seen here (this is the type of cable that the printer uses to plug into the machine). This also vanishes when the printer is unplugged. I've tried updating the driver manually for it as well.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/37f28d27-3248-4692-a46f-af1198b6d0e0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/37f28d27-3248-4692-a46f-af1198b6d0e0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This printer has worked with Win 10 and did before the clean re-install, but I cannot seem to get it working again now.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any advice?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>another troubleshooting step that you can take is to try booting in <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong>, then try updating the drivers
 again. This will check if an existing faulty app or program is the one causing the issue with the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how it goes.</p>

<h3> toddmoriarty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer is not recognizing my product key for Windows 10 Pro.</h2>
                    <p>I just built my first desktop computer and bought and installed Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; I entered the product key when prompted.&nbsp; It appears that it worked.&nbsp; I have access to the desktop, I have some icons saved on the desktop, I've connected to the internet, I
 have favorites saved.&nbsp; When I go to Settings&gt;System&gt;About...it says Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; So far, so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I installed a new sound card. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, today I tried to personalize my desktop with a photo and that's when it gave me a message saying my Windows is not activated?!?&nbsp; I've clicked through the messages and prompts and I see error codes.&nbsp; It's telling me to go to the Windows store to buy another
 copy of Windows, but I already bought it (on Ebay) and installed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried entering the product key again, and it's showing another product key different from the one I originally entered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's now prompting me to call to activate my product key by showing me a series of numbers that look like padlock combinations.&nbsp; And it's asking me to enter these numbers in boxes?!???&nbsp; It's also prompting me to run the Activation Troubleshooter.&nbsp; But that's
 no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's going on?&nbsp; Help!</p>

            Hi Todd.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did you buy a discount key?  There are no discounts for Windows 10 so those are almost always fraud.  You can report it to your bank as piracy and fraud.  If you paid with Paypal they may also protect you.  
<br />
<br />Always buy Windows keys from Microsoft or major retailers that back all sales.  
<br />
<br />You can contact Microsoft Customer Service to confirm the key is bad:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/405170...</a>
<br />
<br />You can report piracy and fraud to Microsoft:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/windows-updates-activation/234159-windows-genuine-activation-issue-posting-instructions.html#post1957831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/windows-updates-acti...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, Todd,
<br />did you buy a license or just a key for unreasonably low price? 
<br />Please note, Microsoft warns at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/Shop.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/Shop....</a>
<br />
<br />Beware of Product Keys Sold Separately
<br />With the exception of Product Key Cards (PKC’s) distributed with COA’s, Microsoft does not distribute products keys as standalone products. If you see a listing on an auction site, online classified ad, or other online page advertising product keys for sale, it’s a good indication that the keys are likely stolen or counterfeit. If you were to purchase and use a stolen or counterfeit product key to activate Windows installed on your PC, the key may not work for activation, may already be in use on another PC, or it might be blocked from use later by Microsoft when the key is reported stolen.

            <p>Hi John - annoying for you... If the files on the CD are copy-protected there's not much help available here. Discussing means of circumventing Copy Protection breaches the forum CoC... however I'm sure the producers of the CD will not have intended to prevent
 you from honest personal use of the material, so it may be best to have a word with them directly and see if they can supply the images in a non-protected format.
</p>
<p>Some Blu-ray players have a usb input - as you were able to copy them to the pc that might be an option that will work - unless the images are in a format that the player does not recognize of course. - Best, Ric.</p>

<h2>            Missing In Homegroup</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I've been trying to link my three computers together via a HomeGroup network. Two of the computers are connected, but the third, my main PC, is not. I have run the troubleshooter and it comes up empty-handed ("user ID problem not resolved"). And though the
 computer is joined as part of this HomeGroup, it doesn't show up in File Manager (Explorer) or on the other two computers that are part of the network. I know it was added to the HomeGroup as I went through the setup wizard successfully. Any help will be greatly
 appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Technical Details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mini computer (ThinkPad X120e) the originator of the HomeGroup. Win 7 Pro, SP1, x64 Bit; 4 GB RAM; internal and external HDDs.</li><li>Main (Desktop, Custom Build) the computer 'exiled' from the HomeGroup. Win 7 HP, SP1, x64 Bit; 12 GB RAM; 2 internal HDDs.</li><li>"Test Bed" (Dell D630 laptop) used for Beta testing and visible in the HomeGroup. Win 10, x64 Bit; 2 GB RAM; internal and external HDDs.</li><li>Network connections are solid (all 3 computers connect to the internet, do emails, etc.). Firewall connection lets traffic through (it would have prevented the Main computer from joining the network if it was a blocked connection). Networking / Internet
 connection via hard-wire Ethernet connection.</li></ul>
<p>Anything else you need to know, just ask.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            <p>Hello BearPup,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience experienced by you and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue&nbsp;might have arisen&nbsp;if you have changed the Computer name recently or if the advanced sharing settings are misconfigured. So, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to&nbsp;change to&nbsp;the following options for
<strong><em>both</em></strong> the systems on the network in the <strong>advanced sharing settings
</strong>(Open<strong> Network &amp; Sharing Center </strong>&gt; <strong>Change Advanced Sharing settings</strong>):</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">- Turn on Network Discovery</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">- Turn on file and printer sharing</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">- Turn on sharing so anyone with network access can read and write files in the public folders</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">- Turn off password protected sharing</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now, try to map the drive following these steps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Click
<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Computer</strong> and click on <strong>Map network drive</strong> from the options given under the address bar.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. In the
<strong>Drive</strong> box, click the drive letter you want to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. In the
<strong>Folder</strong> box, type <strong>\\server\<em>share</em></strong>, where you can type the IP address of the drive to be mapped. For example, if the IP address is 192.168.6.xxx, you can type
<strong>\\192.168.6.xxx. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Click
<strong>Finish</strong>.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Try to ping the IP address from the
<strong>Run</strong> command. Refer to the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Press
<strong>Start </strong>button and <strong>R</strong> key (&nbsp;+
<strong>R</strong>).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Type in the IP address of the drive to be mapped, e.g., if the IP address is 192.168.6.xxx, you can type

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Check if you are able to open the network drive.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 3:</span></strong></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For better understanding of the issue, please provide us following information:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></li><li><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior this issue?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue usually occurs if the system services are corrupt or if the drivers are either missing or outdated.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to follow the steps below and see if it works:</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Perform Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot allows the Windows operating system to launch without any additional programs or services running when you turn the computer on. This allows you to determine if computer issues are caused
 by a program or service that starts up when you boot the machine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Place the computer in clean boot and check if the issue persists. You may follow the article mentioned to perform a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Perform a Clean Boot</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After performing the troubleshooting steps for clean boot refer the section<strong><span>“how
 to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Run System File Checker</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The <strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong> command (System File Checker) scans the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect corrupted, changed/modified,
 or damaged versions with the correct versions if possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files.</span></p>

<h2>            Trying To Connect To XBOX Live While Playing Pinball FX2</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having troubles connecting to XBOX Live&nbsp;while playing Pinball FX2.&nbsp; I purchased the full version with Spider Man, Iron Man, etc.</p>
<p>My system is set to automatically log in to XBOX Live, and it does.</p>
<p>I've booted my system, verified that I am signed in, then when I start the game, it says "Can't save to Gamer Profile.&nbsp; Pinball FX2 is unable to save your settings at this time."</p>
<p>I go to the Xbox Guide and click on "Connect to Xbox Live" and it says "Your connection to Xbox Live has been lost. Please sign in again."</p>
<p>This is very frustrating, because I can exit the game and go to other games I've downloaded and play them LIVE.</p>
<p>Help!</p>

                    I was having trouble with sound intermittingly, some days it would work other days it wouldn't. Ran the troubleshooter it didn't fix anything so I ended up restarting it and the sound issue was resolved. It occurred again and I tried the same steps then
 when it restarted there was still no sound. So I followed the Microsoft techs advice tried to update the drivers, they were up to date. She suggested I uninstall and reinstall them. I did this and now it won't find them and I have nothing for a driver. I'm
 stuck any help would be great. The driver was Intel SST Audio Device (WDM) and the Realtek

 third party products.&nbsp; We&nbsp;"offer remote assistance", and the end user clicks yes once (for view only) or twice (for remote control), and we are off and running.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the computer being assisted&nbsp;is running Windows 10, then certain keys do not function.&nbsp; For example, the&nbsp;left shift key works, but the right&nbsp;one does not.&nbsp; Num lock doesn't work either.&nbsp; It is a huge pain.&nbsp; I also often see that my mouse and the remote
 mouse are misaligned fairly often, but I can deal with that.&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't seem to matter if the "expert's" computer is Windows 10 or 7 or something else.&nbsp; You'd think a Windows 10 computer assisting another Windows 10 computer would work smoothly, but it does
 not.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd *really* like to see this fixed.&nbsp; Someone please report this bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            WOT 360 error code</h2>
                    
<p>It has been over a week now that I can't not log into the game, kept getting error code E: 00L04 service unavailable. I have tried everything from clear cache to disconnect power cord and internet to hard reset, but nothing works I can't play the game and
 my premium is wasted. Is there a problem with my xbox? Any help will be appreciated &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It has World of Tanks infecting the system.</p>
<p>Your best bet is to delete the game and play something else.</p>
<p>Good luck to you!</p>

            Given the memory exception parameter I would run memtest for 6-8 passes and driver verifier.<br />
<br />
If you are overclocking anything reset to default before running these tests<br />
<br />
1-Memtest<br />
<br />
-Download a copy of Memtest86 and burn the ISO to a CD using Iso Recorder or another ISO burning program. "http://www.memtest.org/#downiso<br />
<br />
-Boot from the CD, and leave it running for at least 5 or 6 passes.<br />
<br />
-Just remember, any time Memtest reports errors, it can be either bad RAM or a bad motherboard slot.<br />
<br />
-Test the sticks individually, and if you find a good one, test it in all slots.<br />
<br />
-Any errors are indicative of a memory problem.<br />
<br />
-If a known good stick fails in a motherboard slot it is probably the slot<br />
<br />
2-Driver verifier<br />
<br />
-Using Driver Verifier is an iffy proposition. Most times it'll crash and it'll tell you what the driver is. But sometimes it'll crash and won't tell you the driver.<br />
<br />
-Other times it'll crash before you can log in to Windows.<br />
<br />
-If you can't get to Safe Mode, then you'll have to resort to offline editing of the registry to disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
-I'd suggest that you first backup your data and then make sure you've got access to another computer so you can contact us if problems arise. Then make a System Restore point (so you can restore the system using the Vista/Win7 Startup Repair feature)<br />
<br />
-In Windows 7 you can make a Startup Repair disk by going to Start....All Programs...Maintenance...Create a System Repair Disc - with Windows Vista you'll have to use your installation disk or the "Repair your computer" option at the top of the Safe Mode menu
 .<br />
<br />
-Then, here's the procedure:- Go to Start and type in "verifier" (without the quotes) and press Enter-<br />
<br />
-Select "Create custom settings (for code developers)" and click "Next"- Select "Select individual settings from a full list" and click "Next"<br />
<br />
- Select everything EXCEPT FOR "Low Resource Simulation" and click "Next"<br />
<br />
- Select "Select driver names from a list" and click "Next"Then select all drivers NOT provided by Microsoft and click "Next"<br />
<br />
- Select "Finish" on the next page.Reboot the system and wait for it to crash to the Blue Screen. Continue to use your system normally, and if you know what causes the crash, do that repeatedly.<br />
<br />
-The objective here is to get the system to crash because Driver Verifier is stressing the drivers out. If it doesn't crash for you, then let it run for at least 36 hours of continuous operation (an estimate on my part).<br />
<br />
-If you can't get into Windows because it crashes too soon, try it in Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
-If you can't get into Safe Mode, try using System Restore from your installation DVD to set the system back to the previous restore point that you created.<br />
<br />
