<h2>            Shift button keeps on beeping</h2>
                    <p>So I was playing Geometry Dash on Steam when suddenly my shift key started to beep. When I hold it for a certain time, all my other buttons don't work. And no, this is definitely NOT sticky keys or filter keys because they're turned off. Also, another reason
 why it is not sticky keys is because it's only for control. I can't find this problem anywhere on the internet. This is a problem for me in Minecraft, Terraria, and Geometry Dash. I can't sneak with my shift button so now I have to sneak with a different button
 which makes me feel unconfortable. Not really a problem for Terraria but I will need it either to equip my torch item or quick move items. This will be another problem for Geometry Dash when creating levels because I can't move objects by .1 blocks anymore
 with the SHIFT + A,S,D,W.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now this may only really effect one game, Minecraft, but it will be annoying. Very annoying. It is very annoying when typing and needing to capitalize letters.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until I get a new PC, which is probably Christmas, I can't play Minecraft without the annoying shift beeps when I'm trying to sneak while I changed it to control instead but I'm used to SHIFT. Yes, I can just get used to it. But it will take a long
 time. And it will be very annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks for reading this, so please someone answer this.</p>

                    My son's computer keeps coming up with Facebook as the most visited site, even though face book is blocked and he does not have a face book account.&nbsp; There are also some&nbsp; blocks listed for twitter.&nbsp; This has been happening for about four weeks now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The problem begins as soon as he powers up the computer.&nbsp; We watched the number of blocked visits go up as we were investigating what the issue might be. &nbsp;&nbsp; Someone else posted this same thing about face book however the answers were not helpful.&nbsp; Anyone else
 have this problem and find a reason or a solution?<br />

            <p><span>Hi TeriVentura,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Even though a certain website is blocked, it's still possible that you will see the website as visited in activity reports. Basically, it means that the child is trying to access the specific website and the number of visits determines how many times
 he/she attempts to access it. The activity reports also show if the child was able to access the website or was blocked so you don't have to worry&nbsp;as long as it shows as blocked on the report.</span></p>
<p>In the matter that the website is not Blocked, please check your Web Filtering settings again and then refresh your Family Safety client by clicking the refresh icon at the upper left corner of the client installed in your computer.</p>
<p><span>Should you need further assistance, please feel free to reply on this post.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Best regards.</span></p>

<h2>            &#34;windows 7 64 Pro &#34; &#34;check for errors on 4 TB HDD&#34; not completeing</h2>
                    Hi there.
<div>I have a 4TB HDD that I tried to delete some files from and explorer failed saying that there was an issue with the file system. (sorry I didn't write down the error code).&nbsp;</div>
<div>So I went to properties -&gt; tools &nbsp;and ran the error checking utility with only the "Automatically fix file system errors" option selected.</div>
<div>It has now been several hours and the process is not complete, The "Checking Disk &lt;Fobar&gt;" dialog seems to be frozen at "20856832 USN bytes processed" It will not respond when i click on the cancel or the X -close- buttons. I brought up the Task manager
 and all users processes don't show any obvious processes running.</div>
<div>Any suggestions? The system is responsive - should i just reboot? Or should I kill the process in task manager (in which case what is the process name?).</div>
<div>I have a backup of the data so I am not hosed but It would be nice not have to recopy 3TB of data.</div>
<div>Thanks in advance.</div>

<div>Thanks for the reply. All very useful information that hopefully will be useful to others as well.</div>
<div>The HDD was a brand new 4TB WD Caviar Black,
<div>I rebooted and and was able to delete the files that I wanted to.</div>
<div>Unfortunately the files that I wanted to retain ... showed up in the partition table but they were all empty. :( Thank goodness I have a backup. :)</div>

            You may already have Movie Maker.<br />
<br />
Try the following...<br />
<br />
Go to...Start / Run...<br />
<br />
Type or Copy/Paste&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moviemk.exe<br />
<br />
Press...Enter<br />
<br />
If Movie Maker is on your system it will launch.<br />

If that fails...the following article may be worth a look:<br />

</p><p><span><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please be informed that the feature to copy in photos app is for you to paste it in your desktop and not within the photos app. This is the reason why you do not get the paste option. As you are trying to copy the photos to a different folder,
 what you have to do is, go to file explorer (Windows key + E) and locate the folder where the photos are saved and copy the preferred pictures and paste it in an already existing folder or by creating a new folder. Whatever folder you create in the file explorer
 will automatically appear in the photos app.</span></span></p>
<p>

<h3> dholland1  say:</h3>
<h2>            The most recent update has effected the stmp connection print to scan connection failure.. all setting are correct yet nothing works any fix &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft community I trust this message gets to you well,.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a recent upgrade that Microsoft pushed through a day or 2 ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>since the upgrade my printers scan to email .. specifically the stmp setting does not communicate with the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>to be clear Everything was working tip top prior too this upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what i have done to try resolve the issue..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. hired the same IT tech who set up the printer to the computer to try solve issue. (IT tech is from a large cooperation).</p>
<p>2. I spoke with a tech for 3 hours from Lexmark today, conclusion all settings I have were correct. his resolve looks like its an ISP issue.</p>
<p>3. I spoke with my ISP for an 1.5 hours also today and all stmp and email settings I had were also correct..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>everything was working exactly as as it was supposed up until the upgrade,</p>
<p>currently the printer prints and recognizes the router and wifi but does not for some reason communicate with the stmp / email setting,&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>the error received is a lexmark connection failure -11. There are 1 of 3 possible issues all have been picked apart and worked through from both my ISP and the lexmark enterprise tech.</p>
<p>
</p><p>we have deduced that it is in fact the recent software upgrade. Because my ISP has said that I am the third caller they have personally dealt with these exact same issues.. and unfortunately all things being equal and the same (other then this upgrade)&nbsp;
 there are some wires crossed so to speak.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any insight or are aware of the issue and there is a fix coming please let me know or if possible address the issue at hand</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you ever so kindly for your time i know you are busy and I value your effort.</p>

<h2>            Samsung SH222BB is no longer recognized in device manager and so no long works</h2>
                    <p>Help needed.</p>
<p>I have just done the upgrade on my desktop PC&nbsp;to Windows 10 from Windows 7 (64 bit ) and now find that my internal Samsung SH222BB is no longer recognized in device manager and so no long works. I have had an online chat with Microsoft on this problem and
 the only advice I got was to get in touch with Samsung. I did this and Samsung said get in touch with Microsoft to get the latest driver for this unit. Since the upgrade I have done a driver update from Microsoft but this has made no difference. I even reverted
 to&nbsp; Windows 7 and the drive worked perfectly. Before re-doing the upgrade to Windows 10 I made sure that I had the latest drivers from Samsung however once Windows10 was reinstalled the same problem again. Hope someone has the answer as both Microsoft and
 Samsung are absolutely useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade also lost me my favourite version of Solitaire&nbsp; so much for the statement ' all files and folders will remain ' just an outright lie.</p>
<p>Regards Steve</p>

            <p>Hi Nachappa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply however I think the basis of my problem is that the Samsung SH222BB is not being recognized by my PC ( not listed in device manager ) since upgrading to Windows 10. It is therefore not possible to use any troubleshooter or drive
 update programs as they do not know that this drive is on my PC. In desperation I actually went back to Windows7 and the drive worked perfectly OK so this leads me to think that it is a Windows 10 and not a drive problem. I have had chats with both Microsoft
 and Samsung and was just pushed from one the other and neither seemed to be able to offer a solution so I am no further forward after several hours work trying to find the answer. I would really like to know how to get this hardware to show in device manager
 as I think once I am able to achieve this then it may be problem solved. In short&nbsp; Samsung SH222BB drive is shown on my PC in Windows 7 but not in 10 - Any ideas ?</p>
<p>

            Hi Jb,
<br />I am Dexter, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this issue. 
<br />
<br />It seems Windows does not log the transfer details, but still, I got some information from the Event Viewer may have some help for you.
<br />
<br />I've made a test to simulate transfer some files from my desktop to my phone through Bluetooth, and I got an event logged by Windows shown my phone's connected to my desktop, and with my phone's MAC address, but have no detail about the files name transferred.
<br />
<br />You can do the same with Windows Event Viewer to check out if there is any device connected to your laptop. Here are the steps:
<br />
<br />1. Open a Windows Explorer and right-click on "This PC" - "Manage"
<br />2. Select "Computer Management" - "System Tools" - "Event Viewer" - "Windows Logs" - "System" from the left tree.
<br />3. Right-click on "System" you've selected - "Filter current Log", choose the event sources to "BTHUSB", and check the Event level on "Information", then press "OK"
<br />4. From the filtered result you can check one by one to see if there is any event seems like "Adapter (xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx) paired with local adapter successful" (I'll attach the pic below)
<br />5. If you found event like that, means at least you got the chances to be stolen transferred file through Bluetooth.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps and let me know if I can help you further!<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/16e18b59-5eb0-49bc-a60b-5d2b7475d4fe?upload=true" />

            In the filter current log window, there is an option on the top which defaults set to "Any time", that means you'll see all the logs windows have stored.
<br />
<br />Please refer to the pic I attached, if you're still not allowed to click the sources dropdown, try to log on your computer as an administrator account.
<br />

<p>
</p><p>Yes it is answered, and yes it is for Windows 7, and yeah. . It should also apply for Windows 10.<br />
Temporary fix is to right click the Exe file, or the setup, then run as Admin.<br />

            <p>Since the previous steps didn't work, let's boot your PC into <strong>Safe Mode with Networking
</strong>and see if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Starting your PC in <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> can troubleshoot problems on your PC while using a limited set of files and drivers. What we will consider doing is downloading the antivirus you want to install while in Safe Mode. Here's how you
 can enable your PC in <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> +<strong> I</strong> key from the keyboard to launch
<strong>Settings</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong>, then <strong>Recovery</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click the <strong>Restart now</strong> button under <strong>Advanced startup</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> when you get into the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Advanced options</strong>, then <strong>Startup Settings</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Restart</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>5</strong> or <strong>F5</strong> after your PC restarts to start your PC now in
<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Download the antivirus you want to install.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result after downloading the antivirus in Safe Mode with Networking mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, we can try to install it again by removing your Windows Defender. Maybe there is an issue of incompatibility between Windows Defender and the anti virus that you want to install.</p>

<h2>            Laptop hard reset stuck at 32&#37;</h2>
                    I just bought my friend’s Acer Predator Helios 300 with thw latest version of Windows 10, and performed a factory reset to get his old stuff off, the reset has been going on for close to 5 hours now, and has been stuck at 32%. I am aware that this should
 take a few hours, it just hasn’t moved from 32%. All external devices are unplugged, save for the charger.

            Hello Tommy,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />As Reset is not working, you can alternatively make clean install.
<br />
<br />Please refer this step-by-step guide:

            Hi Tommy, most likely the recovery image on that laptop is corrupt, your best option is to clean install Windows 10 wipe the previous owners data from that system, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h2>            There isn&#39;t a turn time limit in multiplayer online&#63; Really&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>It's an unfortunate truth that online people act in ways that they wouldn't in real life. &nbsp;If you pay attention to any game that you play competitively online you will notice that steps have been taken in order to prevent
 unscrupulous people from "griefing" those that just want to play as intended. &nbsp;It appears that something slipped through QA on Magic 2012. &nbsp;As I write this post I'm in the middle of a duel online. &nbsp;It's my opponent's main phase, he's at 6 life with 1 land
 and no other permanents in play. &nbsp;I'm at 10 life with Ulamog a ton of land and another creature in play. &nbsp;Seems pretty certain that I'll win, right? Well I guess my opponent though so because he refuses to move past his main phase. &nbsp;It's been at least 15 minutes
 now and here we sit without the game having moved a bit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I can verify that nothing is frozen, I can still select cards and zoom in on them, pull up menus, even hit the guide button and use the functions there. &nbsp;Right above the grey bar with the current phase in it there is
 a white bar that slowly depleted, which I assumed was a turn timer. &nbsp;Once it depleted though it refilled and nothing has happened.</p>
<p>Will this issue be addressed soon? It's rather unfortunate that poor sportsmanship is causing a need for the game to be "corrected", but alas you can't control other people.</p>

<p>yea i am having that happen right now and im not even on a ranked match. i have 27 health and 5 creatures on the table. he has 1 health with 1 creature 8 unused land and 3 cards in hand. i can move around the table looking at my cards as well and so i know
 the game didnt freeze and its been about 10-15 mins. its not ranked so i guess that i can leave and take the loss but it still annoys me greatly</p>

<p>Fortunately this occurance hasn't reached epidemic status. &nbsp;Just leave bad feedback and hope you don't meet the player again in the future. &nbsp;I have had good luck missing these types of players, I hope it continues. &nbsp; I don't know why, but losing at this
 game is a tremendous let-down. &nbsp;Even when I lose, sending the player a "gg" message or something brief to congradulate them is always well received and usually makes losing easier to bear. &nbsp;Hope those grudge players ruining the experience read this and take
 the advice. &nbsp; game on.</p>

<h2>            State of Decay 2 installation Problem</h2>
                    <p>Since the update (from windows) i made yesterday, when i got in game there were missing textures. I thought i should reboot the game and when i went to Microsoft Store, it said the game had a problem and needed repair. So I clicked the option proposed and
 it reloaded the full game over a few hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Towards the end of the downloading, it said installing, and then I had an alert stating</p>

</p><p>Stated of Decay 2</p>
<p>Couldn't install. We'll try again later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the store only shows the game, with the button update, as if there was a pending update. When I press it, it just displays the same alert and fails to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried every step proposed <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_store/state-of-decay-2-couldnt-install-well-retry/9b1a92fd-d936-4c6a-a1e3-f9214bd91cb6?rtAction=1528480109285">
here</a>, except the ones using the App &amp; Features window from the settings, as I can't do anything there since the game is not actually "installed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I also tried the option someone mentioned using this&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-winapps/reset-clear-store-cache/0fe64e03-8e82-4e73-bff7-68e99a7b748f">link</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The option of the trouble shooter only states cache and licenses might be corrupt, to which it proposes to reset Microsoft store. And when I start it again it just states the same thing.</p>

<p>Hi JustinLe Page<br />
</p>
<p>A corrupted file on your computer could be the reason why you can't install the game. Let's try to isolate this issue so that we could find a way for you to install State of Decay 2 on your computer. First, I recommend that you download and run the Windows
 Update troubleshooter to scan and repair any Windows file that got corrupted. You may refer to this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em>to download the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, let's try to reset the Windows Store cache on your computer by performing the following steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the Cortana search box, enter "<strong>cmd</strong>".</li><li>Right-click on Command Prompt, then select<strong> Advanced options</strong>.</li><li>On the CMD window, enter <em><strong>wsreset.exe</strong></em> and press Enter key.</li><li>Launch the Store app and try to install the game.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Do get back to us with the results. We'd be more than willing to provide you additional help.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Very slow printing from Windows Vista.</h2>
                    My printer is an Epson workforce and the connection is wireless.&nbsp; i don't think it's a printer issue.&nbsp; First the print dialogue box takes a long time to appear -&nbsp;a couple of minutes perhaps -&nbsp;then once it does and I click print, it takes a long time -
 several minutes -&nbsp;for printing to begin.&nbsp; This problem has only recently appeared and does not occur with my other computer, which has a wired connection to the same printer.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
- Have you made any changes to your computer because of which the issue started?<br />
<br />
I'd recommend you to restart the print spooler service and check if the issue persists,<br />

            <p>Thanks for the effort to&nbsp;help</p>
<p>1. We've made no changes other than the updates sent by microsoft&nbsp; The issue began a couple of weeks ago after a couple years of using the same printer, computer and wireless router without issues.&nbsp; This part is not perfectly clear, but it may have happened
 soon after a set of microsoft updates were installed</p>
<p>2. For us ordinary folks who use a computer like an appliance, suggestions like "restart the print spooler service" might as well be in a foreign language - can you give me more details on what that might mean?</p>
<p>3. Ran the "fix-it" application I found at the link, but it said it detected no problems - it seems more designed for an absolute failure to print than what we have, which is just amazingly slow printing.&nbsp; In looking at some of the other questions I see,
 I probably ought to clarify that: the printer runs normally once it starts - it's the process of getting it to start that takes several minutes - first a long wait for the print dialogue box to come up, then an even longer wait for printing to start once we
 click the print button in the dialogue box.</p>

<h2>            Kworld Capture Card doesn&#39;t work on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Windows 7 to 10 and now when I go into Power Director 8 it can't find my Kworld Capture card even though it's on the list of hardware plugged in.
</p>
<p>Is there a way to solve this? I did download Power Director 11 but that didn't help.</p>
<p>If there's no way to do this how do you revert back to Windows 7.</p>
<p>

Surface 3 gives Brown smudge-like edges along the outer side of the display.<br />

It has a lot of way from a burned display. Could this be a manufacturing fault or is this software repairable?<br />

<p>Hello Ruz San,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your quick reply.<br />
</p>
<p>The problem is that I live in Belgium and by your fellow of the Belgian/Dutch forum I am referred to this English language forum. The Surface is out of warranty. In Belgium there is the company B2X responsible for Microsoft service. However, there is not
 one speaks our language. I would like to ask a question then comes the announcement that 9.99 Euro must be paid first. So I have here so not pay attention.&nbsp;<br />
Contact Microsoft Support. This stops after inspiration of the problem and one refers to the guarantee check and the Surface 3 is out of warranty. Then searched for a Microsoft store but that exist in Belgium apparently only online so all in all it is difficult
 to get in touch with someone from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
What to do, the rates of repair at B2X are very high and the Surface 3 is already fully outside the cost of contents.<br />
Hopefully you can give me advice or to cumbersome if the screen look do I have than the Surface 3 to throw away?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much so far,</p>
<p>
