<h2>            Video chats on skype</h2>
                    A friend and i are having trouble with the sounds on skype when we are listening to music.&nbsp; we have for years been able to have him play his music from his computer and i can hear him and the music.&nbsp; now when he plays it i cant hear him or the music.&nbsp;
 both of us have a line at the bottoms saying are speakers are muted.&nbsp; they are not.&nbsp; when we go onto facebook we can hear things just fine and when he is not playing the music i can hear him fine.&nbsp; all of this started just after the last update a few months
 back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi CindyWicks 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />In Video call, he will have to share screen. When he shares screen, he gets the option of turning on computer sound. When this is toggled, then audio can be listened to.

            <p>Thanks for the quick response. I attempted to follow the steps and when I shut down the laptop and restarted it, f9 didn't allow me access to Windows recovery menu, but rather went back to aptio setup utility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My boot option (I only have one) is "windows boot manager (po: Toshiba mq01abd100)".</p>
<p>

            <p>UEFI is the modern replacement for BIOS.&nbsp; Did you install Windows yourself or did it come preinstalled from factory?&nbsp; If so it should have a UEFI install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fix in the link presumes it instead has a Legacy BIOS install and not UEFI, but that this has been changed by the forcing of a MSAHCI driver from Windows Update.&nbsp; It says&nbsp; to change the CSM setting to enabled, and disable Secure Boot which you said is
 already disabled.&nbsp; Also set the hard drive to boot first and not WIndows Boot Manager which is only for UEFI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may need to search every tab in Setup to locate CSM.&nbsp; Once enabled Save settings and Exit.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

<h2>            Where does Skype blur video backgrounds&#63; Sending Client&#63; Cloud in the middle&#63; Receiving Client&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, Skype. Saw this: <a href="https://blogs.skype.com/news/2019/02/06/introducing-background-blur-in-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Skype's announcement">
https://blogs.skype.com/news/2019/02/06/introducing-background-blur-in-skype/</a>. It says certain clients have the button to turn background blurring on or off. But it doesn't say whether:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>the sending Skype clients are finding and blurring backgrounds, </li><li>or Skype's servers are blurring when the video is re-transmitted to the recipients,
</li><li>or whether the receiving Skype clients are doing the blurring. </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where does the blurring take place? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer touches on some performance, privacy, and third-party developer concerns.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

                    <p class="contentStandard">Hello,</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">so recently I've started experiencing many crashes while gaming on windows 10.</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">So far it only happens when I play but I am afraid it might expand. What happens is that in headphones I hear the usual cracking sound when something bad happens&nbsp;(like a driver crash or BSOD) and then the screen turns usually black,
 sometimes dark ish green, white or even pink. Sometimes the event viewer doesn't even show any error prior to the hard reset I have to do - hard reset is the only way out, Shift+Ctrl+Win+B to reset display drivers does not work at all and sometimes provides
 me with "nvlddmkm&nbsp;failed to load" error.</p>

            Hi Jan, I am Rob, an independent and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as independents we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. If you will work with me I will be here to help until the issue is resolved.
<br /> 
<br />ID 41 issues can be some of the very hardest to troubleshoot and often are hardware caused.
<br />
<br />Could be your computer just does not have the complete specs to run those games. Best to check with the game makers' support and forums.
<br />
<br />Please read this link even though your event does produce a BugCheck.
<br />ID41 with no Bug_Check - The main cause of this issue as you have described is hardware related :                 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2028504/windows-kernel-event-id-41-error-the-system-has-rebooted-without-clean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/202850...</a>  
<br />
<br />1. Over-Clocking -&gt; best to reset ALL to the defaults especially while troubleshooting
<br />
<br />2. Memory (check thoroughly as indicated below).
<br />
<br />3. Power Supply (see below to ensure you have enough power).
<br />
<br />4. Over-heating - even if the overall temps are with-in specs a single component can be too sensitive to even the normal levels of heat and fault at a lower temp. Try adding a fan blowing into the case to reduce the effects of heat even more than the cooler usually does. Of course ensure all built-in fans are running.
<br />
<br /> ====================================================
<br />
<br />After checking determining the wattage of the power supply you will then need to check the requirements of the motherboard and devices. Usually, the video card is one of the major power users.
<br />
<br />How do I determine how big my power supply is?

<br />
<br />=====
<br />
<br />Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
<br />
<br />To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.  &lt;-- best method

<p>Hello Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>after reading the ID41 with not Bug_Check articles, I am assuming it's the "Scenario 2" case, as after the computer freezes I use the restart button on my computer which, I believe, then generates the ID41 Kernel-Power event. I might have worded my&nbsp;issue
 poorly, it's not really a crash, but rather a black (or sometimes different colour) screen freeze which I can only escape from by pressing either the restart button on my PC case or by holding the power button to turn off the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Literally, the only thing that might cause those freezes are is dwm.exe and dwmcore.dll error.</p>

            Hi Jan.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You said it worked for awhile after a Clean Install until Windows Updates, correct?
<br />
<br />Do you have a System Restore point going back to before those updates (they should set one)?  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If so I'd restore to before then, see how it performs.  
<br />
<br />Monitor Updates to see what installs, assure plenty of Restore points, then if it fails again uninstall those Updates and hide them using Hide Updates tool here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />You might also be able to spot the Update now in Installed Update History at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History by it's date or if it's a driver.  So you could uninstall it now and see if the behavior stops.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If you need to reinstall again follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Then closely monitor performance after each group of Updates, each program, each setting to isolate the cause.   It's likely to be found since you had it running OK once after the Clean install.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            In C:\Windows it would be a memory.dmp file if there. 
<br />
<br />If there is no C:\Windows\minidump folder then it is probably not setup or there has never actually been a minidump created (sometimes the nature of a crash does prevent that from happening)..
<br />
<br />Please double check your settings here :
<br />
<br />Start - Settings - Type in search box --&gt;  Advanced System Settings 
<br />
<br />Click that and then click in Startup and Recovery - Settings - System Failure - check the box to Write an Event to System Log
<br />
<br />uncheck Auto Restart 
<br />
<br />make sure the Write Debugging is set to small minidump 
<br />
<br />and the default folder should look like %SystemRoot%\Minidump.

<br />
<br />Be sure your SSD has the latest firmware direct from its maker's site - this is very important.
<br />
<br />Ensure that the ASRock BIOS, chipset drivers, and all major device drivers are fully up to date (check their makers' sites manually).

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>a little update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run an IntelBurnerTest stress test, 10 passes, standard settings - everything went ok (except quite high CPU temperatures, I'll get a better cooling system), so I assume the crashes are not caused by heavy load and high temperature on the CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I ran a few GPU benchmarks and again, stable performance on 70-76°C, no crashes or freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Memtest86 ran for 9 and a half hours straight, almost 7 passes, no error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could those be a hint that the problem is in fact either in my Windows or some other piece of software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll re-roll back now on to 1511 version of Windows, where the games were most stable so far and keep you updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Rob</p>
<p>
</p><p>Done. Also, I don't use an SSD.<br />

<p><em>"except quite high CPU temperatures... so I assume the crashes are not caused by heavy load and high temperature on the CPU."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is - <em>not </em>- a typo ? What are the cpu temps ?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"...or some other piece of software?"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Could be a gremlin software conflict. Do you use any system 'optimising' software, Skype or similar programs ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"the screen turns usually black, sometimes dark ish green, white or even pink. "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Do you have access to another gpu to verify if it's your 970 causing the crashing ? Or maybe a friends machine to test your 970 in ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I had a similar problem when using a GTX770. Except in my case I had these various coloured screen lockups when
<em>not</em> gaming.</p>
<p>Games were fine, but while doing something simple such as these forums, and sometimes with weeks in between, but occasionally</p>
<p>more than one a day... Blank screen lock-up of different colours.</p>
<p>I also did the full drill, and every time I did a test or&nbsp; tried a new 'fix' the card was agreeable for a while... False hope.</p>
<p>Tried it in the wife's machine and got the same random issue. Used her AMD card in my machine, and had no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already RMA'd my first 770 as the first one had a massive heart attack in the first six months and I think EVGA sent me
</p>
<p>someone else's problem as they probably didn't get this issues while testing due to it's random nature.</p>
<p>I didn't bother sending the RMA card back because it cost me $45- AUD to post, and it worked flawlessly with&nbsp; games
</p>
<p>(for about two more years. Then one day... It didn't. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Long story short. I reckon the problem in my case was the power supply controller on the card was causing the card to crash</p>
<p>at idle (dropping the power too low). It's possible yours could be doing the opposite, and not supplying adequate power while gaming ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or... <em>"550W PSU, sufficient." </em>Theoretically sufficient, but maybe not providing steady power under load.</p>
<p>Even if it's a good quality psu (40+ Amps on the +12V rails being one indication of quality 550W) there is a possibility it is faulting,</p>
<p>but if it's a cheap psu and has&nbsp; had a lot of work it's even more of a contender as a source of your woes.</p>

    <title>CHKDSK &#47;f &#47;r &#47;x when to use each or all three in a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> questions_  say:</h3>
<h2>            CHKDSK &#47;f &#47;r &#47;x  when to use each or all three in a command, please explain what is happening with two computers with identical hardware and similar files</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Often I run CHKDSK /F /R on two laptop computers that are the same model.&nbsp; They have very similar files and software.&nbsp; The sizes of the hard drives and files are nearly the same.<br />
<br />
On one computer it always takes 3 to 4 hours to run CHKDSK /F /R after a restart.<br />
<br />
On the other computer it is instantaneous after a restart.&nbsp; There is a very brief pop up to view to press a key and it boots to the logon desktop or logon screen.&nbsp; This is reproducible using the charm menu with power options and with administrative command
 prompt using the command shutdown -r<br />
<br />
How come the computer has nearly instantaneous run of chkdsk /F /R?<br />
<br />
Is it redundant to use this command?&nbsp; Should just chkdsk /R or Chkdsk /F be used?&nbsp; When is it necessary to use the x command?<br />
<br />
Should I search for CBS files?&nbsp; If so how do I search for them and what do you look for in the files to see if a repair was done or not done?<br />
<br />
If a chkdsk /f /r repair is done and then immediately afterwards it is repeated should it be instantaneous, should it take the same amount of time, or what percentage reduction in time should be accomplished by immediately repeating the search and repair?<br />
<br />
In the event viewer how do i search for what was found and what was repaired?<br />

            These computers have hybrid hard drives which includes 32 GB flash cache.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The command that I entered into administrative command prompt was chkdsk /f /r.<br />
<br />
It did not have a designated drive and allowed each computer to run the command with the default drive for this command.<br />
<br />
Today I ran chkdsk C: on each computer.<br />
<br />
The computer that had spent 3 to 4 hours scanning and repairing the hard drive had no errors.<br />
<br />
The computer that had performed the reboot chkdsk /f /r immediately had errors:<br />
<br />
0 bad file records processed<br />
<br />
In the verifying indexes (stage 2 or 3) it found some problems:<br />
minor file name errors:&nbsp; 191977, 191978, 191979,191980,191981,191982,191983<br />
index entry {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }~1.CAT in index $130 of file 178661 is incorrect.....there were 7 of these......there were no brackes on the command prompt and i used them in this chat to indicate that it had multiple entries.....the first was PA25EE~1.CAT,, the second
 PA2804~1.CAT etc<br />
<br />
<br />
CHKDSK cannot continue in read-only mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
On one of the computers the windows 8.0 operating was reinstalled numerous times and the last time was with external recovery disks.&nbsp; This was the computer that took 3 - 4 hours to perform chkdsk /f /r after reboot.&nbsp; No designated drive was entered into the
 command prompt command and it scanned and repaired the drive on the reboot<br />
<br />
On the computer that performed chkdsk /f /r immediately after reboot it did not have a windows 8.0 re-installation.&nbsp; I am guessing that the chkdsk /f /r is scanning the 32 gb flash drive by default and this may explain why it completes the task so quickly.
<br />
<br />
1.How come it is using the flash drive or the D drive when the drive is not designated?&nbsp;
<br />
2.How come it does not use the main drive, drive C when no drive is designated? <br />
3.How do you verify which drive chkdsk commands have scanned?&nbsp; <br />
4.Would i need to search for the cbs files and then see if it has drive d or c?&nbsp; <br />
5.Does re-installation of the windows 8.0 operating system change the default drive from d to c?<br />
<br />
This weekend I will plan to run chkdsk C; /f /r on the computer as it is unknown how long it may take to complete.<br />

            <p>When I run administrative command prompt on this computer and enter chkdsk c: it indicates that in stage 1 that there are problems:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>attribute list entry with type code 48 in fale 68046 is corrupt</p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>361984 file records processed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3065 large files processed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>errors found</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>chkdsk cannot continue in read only mode</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then entered chkdsk c: /f /r</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a prompt where I entered y so that it would repair on the reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon the reboot it displayed:&nbsp; to skip ...press any key......and it went immediately to the windows screen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It did not have any time to scan or repair the c drive unless it did it instantaneously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I used the charm menu and entered computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were two drives:&nbsp; The OS (c:)&nbsp; 606 GB free of 669 GB and recovery (d:) 3.25 GB free of 28.0 GB</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then right clicked on the c drive and then clicked on properties then on the tools tab then clicked on check for error checking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I clicked on scan and repair drive then restart and repair now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon restart it again present ....press any key in a flash and went immediately to the windows screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there are errors found by running chkdsk and chkdsk /f /r does not scan or repair the drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pressing the escape key upon boot then running diagnostics does not find any problem now.&nbsp; In the past there was a short dst failure.&nbsp; Upon rerunning the hard drive tests both short and long test and loop test no recurrent failures were found.&nbsp; All subsequent
 tests indicated pass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is happening that chkdsk finds errors and chkdsk /f /r does not appear to work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is happening where it posts your drive was successfully repaired?&nbsp; And it was not repaired?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>hi, I opened this strand and wonder if you can help me.&nbsp; my daughter has a laptop touchscreen hp/ altec lansing with windows 8 and i'm not sure if she upgraded to 8.1 but here's the problem.&nbsp; she claims she installed applie iTunes shut down her computer
 properly afterwards and when it started up it would be nearly frozen (running extremely slow) until login screen, once we enter her password (which takes a few minutes to display the password we type) will be stuck in loading for hours and then display a partial
 bar at the bottom with only the windows logo in the left and these are grayscale.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to hit f11 when starting up and tried these many steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do a recovery and got an error message that said the drive that windows is installed on is locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i&nbsp;ran chkdsk, chckdsk /f C: and honestly don't recall the outcome</p>
<p>
</p><p>tried to do system restore to earlier points, I got some message about not being able to complete system restore , wouldn't go beyond a certain file and it suggested running chkdsk /r C:.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do a backup from advanced options after hitting f11 on reboot again and got message saying chckdsk /r C: and now it has an eta of 608:44:28 stuck in stage 2 it seems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kept thinking if I could restore to an earlier point I could resolve the issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>any suggestions?</p>

    <title>How can the Scan app use my scanner - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smallmountain_new  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can the Scan app use my scanner</h2>
                    <p>When I launch the new Scan app, it says "To get started, connect a scanner".&nbsp; But I have a scanner connected to this desktop computer - it is part of my all-in-one printer.&nbsp; Is this a driver problem?&nbsp; My all-in-one is Canon MP620, which I don't think has
 Windows 8 drivers, maybe that's it?&nbsp; Do you have a list of current all-in-one printers that will support the Scan app?</p>

            Hi Eric,<br />
<br />
Are you trying to connect Windows RT to scanner?<br />
<br />
<span><span>Windows&nbsp;RT&nbsp;8.1</span></span> is only compatible with printers that are designed to work with
<span><span>Windows&nbsp;RT&nbsp;8.1</span></span>. These printers display a Designed for <span>
<span>Windows&nbsp;RT&nbsp;8.1</span></span> logo. Make sure that scanner is compatible to use with Windows RT.<br />
<br />
Go through the following information and make sure that the app works fine.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 doesn&#39;t remember the &#34;Extend these displays&#34; setting after sleep</h2>
                    <p>Having a hard time coping with windows handling multiple monitors on multiple graphic chips after wakeup from sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 monitors - one connected to my main ASUS Strix (nVidia) 980, and the other to on-chip Intel I7 HD Graphics 4600.</p>
<p>Ever since I had windows 10 installed -&nbsp;it doesn't remember the "Extend these displays"&nbsp;when waking up from sleep.</p>
<p>Always&nbsp;wakes up with "Show only on display 1" (the 980)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I WILL not even try to connect both the monitors to the nVidia card,</p>
<p>&nbsp;- &nbsp;kind of negates the benefit of having a 2D screen just for social/manual reading when gaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(latest drivers&nbsp;of everything (nVidia gfx driver -&nbsp;not ASUS) and Win10 Pro up to date)</p>
<p>How hard can it be to save the setting (or even redetect the monitors/gfx chips)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions anyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seen some people ask similar questions - but they had a laptop lid they closed... and my monitors are stationary always connected.</p>
<p>And I really wonder what the education level of the MS people answering here is. I as a northern European seem to understand the questions better than the MS folks - at least it seems so when reading their (somewhat irrelevant)&nbsp;return questions?</p>
<p>Not to mention the totally irrelevant links they present from time to time. Kind of sad...&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Unable to install printer driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tamasfrecska  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to install printer driver</h2>
                    Trying to install a new Brother MFC-j470DW printer on an HP computer with Vista 64-bit OS. During the configuration phase of the installation I get the following message: "You do not have permission to modify the settings for this printer..." Nonetheless,&nbsp;
 after the installation the scanner of the printer is functioning but the printer itself sends a message that the printer-driver is missing. I do have full admin rights and permissions and I had both HP and Epson printers installed previously on this computer.
 Brother's online-help was of no use and they claim this to be a Windows problem not a printer problem. I searched the internet for answers but found no applicable solutions. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the printer software several times with no results.
 By the way, the printer installed just fine on my Win 7 computer. I'd like to know if anyone experienced similar problems with the "you do not have permission..." message while installing a device and if they found a solution.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you right click on the Printer Driver/software &gt; then select Run as Administrator when installing it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And did you select the correct Vista 64bit Printer Driver to install:</p>

            Thanks for the suggestion.&nbsp; I have already been to the site you recommended and downloaded the correct Vista-64-bit driver file. Mind you, I used the CD disk that came with the printer to install it on my wife's Win-7 computer without any problems. The
 CD did not work on my Vista and that's why I downloaded the driver from Brother. Unfortunately, that did not work either even though I followed every recommended step from uninstalling previous driver to turning off all my security software (Firewall, antivirus,
 etc.). I noticed on Brother's site that there is a firmware update available from C to D (my current firmware is C). Personally I don't think that that's the problem, but do you think I should update the firmware anyway, even though the printer works just
 fine on Windows 7? This kind of problem has never happened to me in 25 years so I don't know where to look for the source of the problem. For example, where in the registry could I find the offending permission setting? Why is the scanner driver allowed to
 be installed but not the printer driver?<br />

            Hey Dave M Candy,
<div>Thanks for all the suggestions. I wish I could report that all my problems are solved. They are not. I have tried all your suggestions and got no results worth mentioning: The Process Monitor form Sysinternals did not work (or I simply did not know how
 to use it because with the filters I got nothing). The Microsoft FixIt programs were worthless, all they did was direct me to the Internet in search of answers. Reloading and re-registering the the installation program (MSI) had no effect. And finally, I could
 not create a log of the installation process because, I suspect, the installation kept aborting. Anyway, as of right now I cannot even install a simple PDF writer, or any of the previously installed printer drivers without getting the "access denied" error
 as soon as the installation gets to the registration phase. The only thing I can do, and let me know if you disagree, is back up my computer and re-install the OS and hope that this will solve the problem. Thanks to all who tried to help and as far as I'm
 concerned the "you have no permission to change the settings..." message is still a mystery.</div>

            I was having the same problem with my printer. I accidentally uninstalled it from programs.&nbsp; I don't know if this has already been tried but I was told to go to the site of the name of my printer. I had all the issues you had. I typed in www.lexmark.com
 and there was a tool to download. Before I did that I could not find a driver that was compatible. Anyway, it solved my problem and my printer is up and working. I can't believe what I had tried and didn't even think about that. just try going to www.BrotherMFC.com
 or however you have to type it in and it will ask you all the questions about your printer and install.&nbsp; Good luck. I hope this helps. Plz respond

            Thanks for the suggestion. Brother's Help center was unable to help me and they blamed the operating system which, as it turns out, may have been the problem. Anyway, I re-installed the Vista OS and I was able to install the printer drivers (with some
 minor hickups during installation). It's a solution that I would recommend only as a last resort, since re-installing the OS, all the MS Updates and all the applications is a couple day's job.

<p>Hi Celt13,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for directing your question to the answers.microsoft.com forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The KB958644 refers to Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 based systems.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If the system you are utilizing is one of those Operating Systems yes it needs installed, if not it isn't applicable to the Operating System you are using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What OS are you using, I would believe Vista, but, at times it is best to check;<span>&nbsp;
</span>also, did Windows Updates suggest this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not running Win2000, WinXP, or WinServer2003, then trying to run that update on your system is working as designed, if you are running one of those applications, then we should assist you
 in troubleshooting the download error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if this information is helpful or if further assistance is needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

 bin). If you’ve just done delete and file is in recycle bin, then you can restore it by pressing CTRL + Z or from the recycle bin itself.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>

            I was tying on a book I'm doing on Word, nearly 200 pages finished, when the whole thing simply disappeared. I assumed I'd hit ctrl z but even if I did it seems it would only have deleted the part that wasn't saved yet. I've been trying very hard to get
 this fixed and with no luck yet. I guess I'm going to have to take it to the Geek Squad. If you have any other suggestions let me know.

            I was editing a movie and attempted the control+Z function to undo the last move I made in the editing software.&nbsp; I did not realize my last click was in the folder in which I kept the subfolder with all of the videos.&nbsp; When I hit Control + Z it "Undid"
 my last move in that folder, which was the creation of the subfolder.&nbsp; The sub-folder with all of the videos disappeared from existence without even an "Are you sure you?"&nbsp; I cannot figure out a way to recover the files, and now the video (which was a masterpiece)

            <p>I'm so sorry that happened. I took my computer to the Geek Squad at Best Buy. They were able to recover a portion of my work.&nbsp;It still took me about a month to redo what was lost. I think computers should ask, "Are you sure you want to delete this?" It's
 heartbreaking when all your hard work is just gone. I wish you luck.</p>

    <title>Camera App does not save image with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j. b.m  say:</h3>
<h2>            Camera App does not save image with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When taking photos with the Camera app the image fails to be saved after the first shot, which is saved, and then just the message "Something Went Wrong" with error 0xA00F424F &nbsp;( 0x80004001 ) quoted. &nbsp;This is different to the other 2 similar threads, &nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-camera/camera-app-crashing-on-hp-laptop-after-update-to/89c6ce22-da98-4731-8bfa-8e3def947f64<br />
and &nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-camera/windows-10-camera-app-keeps-crashing/51e75376-04b6-4f44-bf5e-adf8c3af3e97 &nbsp; &nbsp;and their solutions do not work on my Windows 10 Pro laptop.</p>
<p>Using the Troubleshooter for hardware I get the message that I need to restart to finish Updates but they are all installed and up to date and restarting does not change anything.</p>
<p><strong>Camera App only works for one picture and then requires restarting to take another, one photo only per restart.</strong> All user permissions are granted to Camera Roll which is located on a separate Partition, all first shots appear there and nothing
 after that.</p>

            <p>Hello CT,</p>
<p>The problem started probably on 17th November '16.<br />
<em>Updates</em> were last loaded 11th Nov<br />
<em>Windows App Troubleshooter</em> cannot find anything wrong<br />
I have no other camera to attach at the moment and nothing else that uses the camera for photos as far as I am aware. &nbsp;Skype uses the same device for video and functions OK<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There appears to be no way to uninstall this APP. &nbsp;I have tried updating the driver, I have deleted the Camera and then restarted before they reinstall automatically AND NO CURE!<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is a fix given online for a similar problem which relates to access permissions, this does not work for me as all permissions are granted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have move the location of the Camera Roll Folder to a different drive to no avail.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I run a multi boot system with Win 8.1 And Win 10 so I keep all personal files on a separate partition.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I could not take any photos then it may be understandable but for ONE and then nothing is ridiculous.</p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a few&nbsp;things I'd try, after each one, try to use the windows camera app again and see if the issue is resolved:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you've done most of this, but&nbsp;follow this troubleshooting article for camera roll, try a new location, maybe on a different drive or SD card than you where using previously:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-missing-camera-roll" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-missing-camera-roll</span></a></p>
<p>Next reset the camera app:</p>
<p>1. Open Settings</p>
<p>2. System</p>
<p>3. Apps &amp; Features</p>
<p>4. Locate Camera in the list, click on it, and then click Advanced options</p>
<p>5. Click reset</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, make sure you are updated to the latest version of the Camera app. To do this:</p>
<p>1. Launch Store</p>
<p>2. Click on your user icon upper right</p>
<p>3. Select Downloads and updates</p>
<p>4. Check for updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I noticed you are an Insider, are you on an Insider build? If so what build? If none of this works, can you tell me the version of the Windows Camera app (launch app,&nbsp;click settings, scroll to bottom&nbsp;"About this app")&nbsp;you are using and your make and
 model of PC and camera. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

            <p>Hello Tom,</p>
<p>Thanks for the contribution.</p>
<p><span><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Setting/Apps and Features/ Camera</em>, single click to show 2 choices greyed out, Move and Uninstall.&nbsp; Left or right click, single or double click and Enter all do nothing.&nbsp; Odd thing is that the
 install date is 10/11/2016 but was originally installed 30/10/2015.</span></p>
<p><span><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Store/ Check for Updates,</em> it gives none!&nbsp; I have updates set to automatic for Store APPs anyway.</span></p>
<p><span><em>Version of CAMERA APP</em> is 2016.1028.10.0</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have just installed DELL Webcam Central (an awfulthing) which will take a series of photo but it saves them to my Documents without alternative but at least the B thing works! &nbsp;Even after this item
 was installed the APP still will only take ONE photo.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have run a search on C:\\Windows and the WinSxS Folder contains CameraSettingsUIHost.exe and WebcamUi.dll with both modified 14.11.16 in 2 locations.&nbsp; I have only one remaining piece of Software on that date which I have now uninstalled, I was, and
 still am, testing a number of different Backup Software and I had already deleted most of them. It would appear that one of this lot may have been the problem as there is no other software alteration about that date.&nbsp;
<em>There is a problem with many Microsoft implementations NO UNINSTALL.&nbsp; I have 2 occasions with Windows Defender failing with no solution from Ms themselves and no way to unlock it from the OS to be able to use another AV.&nbsp; The result being a total reinstall
 and with the amount of Software I use that is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
very</span> time consuming.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I now find I have no RESTORE Point before this problem because they were all delete by Updates to the OS on the 10<sup>th
</sup>of November and I now only have those for several days after the problem occurred, another cause of my anger regarding Ms carelessness in the way they now issue updates even though I am protected to a degree by running the Pro version and have altered
 the background downloading to “on permission”.&nbsp; I did that because Ms Updates crashed a brand new Win 10 installation by overloading my RAM to the point to total unrecoverable collapse of the OS, nothing else was running.&nbsp; I think they constantly forget that
 there are those of us who use Win 10 for more than browsing and the odd APP.&nbsp; I had fewer problems with Win XP in 10 years that I have had with every year of the latest versions (I tried and scrapped the crap Vista and skipped Win7).&nbsp; YES, I know there are
 good point to Win 10 which are really worthwhile, if not I would not have been an Insider for Win 8 &amp; Win 10 Preview etc.&nbsp; I can no longer spare the time and effort to continue that with the early releases of Win 10 versions because of the problem I constantly
 encounter from something that should work faultlessly, will not continue with the litany of faults.&nbsp; If I was younger and knew I had to put this much effort into Windows then I would have put the effort into a GNU OS but I am too much of an old fart to be
 able to do that now.</p>

            <p>Hi CT,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no previous driver to roll back to. &nbsp;Driver I have is 10.0.10586.0 dated 21/06/2006 which is very old but when I try to update it, which I have tried a variety of time in the past, I get the old standard "Windows has determined------- best driver".
 &nbsp;I have previously checked out Dell for drivers for my laptop and found none different. &nbsp; Other online sources provide the same driver or Windows will not install it.</p>

            <p>Since the driver that you have is the one that comes up with the computer, we suggest that you contact the manufacturer of the device and ask them when will they have the new driver for your computer. Rolling back the driver is one of the isolation process
 to identify if the new or recently driver is the one that causing the issue. To learn more about Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM), check this

                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Where I live the Short date format is dd/mm/yyyy. My language and Short date format are set correctly in Control Panel -&gt; Regions (Windows 8.1). Other applications use these settings. However, I just sent a fax and I noticed that the "Date &amp; Time" field&nbsp;on
 the cover page&nbsp;was in mm/dd/yyyy format, although the date and time printed at the top of each page was in the correct dd/mm/yyyy format.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I opened the cover page (generic.cov), but I did not see a way to format the field. Did I miss something or is this a bug?</p>

            Hello Praseetha,
<div><br />
<div>1) On January 11, 2014, I sent a fax from my computer for the first time since I upgraded to Windows 8.1. I have sent only one other fax from this computer in my life, but that was maybe two or more years ago. It was running Windows Vista SP2. I did not
 notice at that time whether the date format was correct or not.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2) I am constantly changing installing, removing and upgrading software on my computer. There have been no hardware changes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>With respect to regional settings: I mentioned in my original post that my regional settings are correct and other applications display the date in the correct format for my region.</div>

                    <p>My laptop shutdown while running every software which require the graphics card (mostly games and films).</p>
<p>This started a month ago with a single game while i could run all the other games.</p>
<p>To solve the problem i tried to unistall and reinstall the driver of the graphic card, but the situation worsened until the actual condition.</p>
<p>Also i can not even run the windows experience index test (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-is-windows-experience-index#What-is-windows-experience-index=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-is-windows-experience-index#What-is-windows-experience-index=windows-7</a>)
 because teh pc shutdown while doing it.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Some other info:</p>
<p>-I had to replace my screen due to backlight problem with a compatible one (not original)</p>
<p>-For weeks ago i lost the original power supply and i used a non original one with the same specification, until i found the original one.</p>

            <p>Overheating is a definite possibility.&nbsp; Does the fan seem to be working?&nbsp; Are the vents clear of dust?</p>
<p>&nbsp; Speedfan might help you get a read on system temperatures and fans (sometimes).&nbsp;&nbsp; I would particularly watch it while running demanding video activity and see if temperatures seem to be spiking.</p>

            <p>Could be a fan problem, im not completely sure that it works correctly.</p>
<p>I already removed teh dust from the fan.</p>
<p>I tried also to monitor the temperature while running these software but it does not seem particulary high (than before, in general is around 80/85°C), but i don't know the safe range of temperature.</p>
<p>Also the fan is not detected by your software (or similar one) so i can not see if there is any problem.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the steps and check.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to try to boot the computer in safe mode and check, Please refer to the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily
 lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is
 connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.

<h2>            The request could not be performed because of an I&#47;O device error</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a problem. After a power blackout when computer was "sleeping" I can't access an internal HDD. When I start a computer management I get the following text (See the picture below:<br />
<br />
You must initialize a disk before Logical Disk Manager can access it... blah-blah :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When I click OK I'm getting the next message after a while: "The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error"<br />
<br />
Anybody knows how I can solve it, please?<br />
<br />
Thanks in forward<br />
<br />

Hello and thank you for answering.<br />
<br />
My answers to yor 3 questions are as follow:<br />
<br />
1. Yes. I'm able to boot to the computer.<br />
2. It's a desktop.<br />
3. It's 5 (five) HDDs that are connected to the PC. One of them isn't answering.<br />
<br />
I'm using a Win &amp; Ultimate if it could help you to help me.<br />
<br />
Thank you again and waiting for further orders :)<br />

            For the HD that is not visible use that makers free disk checking utility, as on the face of it, it would appear that drive has failed.
