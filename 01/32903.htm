    <title>disable hold right click function on tablet pen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danlane  say:</h3>
<h2>            disable hold right click function on tablet pen</h2>
                    Hi I have a wacom tablet and pen installed on my windows 8 machine. If i press my wacom pen down and hold it in one spot windows will try and do a right click, I really need to disable this feature. I'm not sure why somebody would want that as it makes
 the pen useless with pretty much all software I use. From what I can tell this is a windows issue rather than a wacom issue.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can someone tell me how to turn it off in windows 8?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks</div>

            Thanks for that, those steps you provided worked for me. Though I had a further problem which was the pen and touch options were hidden from me ! I solved that by installing the latest wacom driver, which seemed to unlock those options.

            No, but it can be used to restore the system to the state it was in when the image was created once you get the replacement.

<h2>            Surface Pro rebooting on its own</h2>
                    I bought a Surface Pro couple of days back. While using the device got switched off due to a low battery. I tried charging the device but I was not able to switch it ON(Charging LED was not glowing even though the charger was connected properly). After
 an hour or so, the device got switched ON but if i try to use (just press the windows button) the display goes blank and the device is off and it comes up on its own after some 10 minutes. This cycle is being repeated. Can some one please help me out to solve
 this problem? Is there a problem with the battery?

            Hi Linda-Lee, 
<br />
<br />This may be a tough one, but I'd like to try to help. Is Velocity a custom PC? It may be tough to get new drivers for it, which may be needed for Windows 10 and your multicard reader. 
<br />
<br />So first off, have you tried to use a different port? One in the back maybe? I know it sounds crazy but it may help. See what happens. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, I want you to plug the device in, then open control panel (click on start, type "control panel" and open it)
<br />
<br />Look for device manager. At the very top of device manager, right click and scan for new hardware. It may find the driver needed for the cardreader. 
<br />
<br />3rdly, does the cardreader have a name/model on it? I can try to find the driver from them if so :) 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

            <p><strong>Is Windows 10 really free and do I have to pay for it after the first year has passed?</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users. This means, as long you upgrade within the first 12 months (July 29th 2015 to July 29th 2016), you will not have to pay for Windows 10 at all.
</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10.
<strong>Once you upgrade within the first year for free, its yours forever at no additional cost.</strong>&nbsp;As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>

</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">I heard Microsoft representatives mention they are moving to a servicing model for Windows 10, does that mean Windows 10 is going to require a subscription?</span></strong></p>
<p>No, Windows 10 remains a perpetual license, which means, you can upgrade to Windows 10 and use it forever without it expiring or going into any reduced functional mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Are you saying there will be no more versions of Windows after Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft is moving Windows to a servicing model with Windows 10. The days of major revisions or what are called big bang releases are no more. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">

</span><span>‚Äì</span><span> in fact, one could reasonably think of Windows in the next couple of years as one of the largest Internet services on the planet.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>And just like any Internet service, the idea of asking "What version are you on?" will cease to make sense
</span><span>‚Äì</span><span> which is great news for our Windows developers. </span>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Why is Windows 10 free, is there some catch?</strong></p>
<p>No, its not a catch. We are computing in different times. Windows 10 is free so app developers can standardize on one platform and reduce the fragmented market of different versions and editions of Windows that have been an issue in the past. When everybody
 is on the same platform, it means better quality apps, a healthier ecosystem and more advances in hardware and software innovation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will I have to pay for updates and fixes for Windows 10?</strong><br />
No, updates, fixes, security updates, features all remain free. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What does lifetime of the device mean?</span></strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;logical conclusion is as long as the machine is operable, Microsoft will continue to support it with updates. So, if the machine still works 5 or 10 years from now, revisions and updates to Windows 10 will be made available to it. Please note that Windows
 10 uses the same life cycle policy of 5 years mainstream support and&nbsp;5 years extended support.</p>

            <p>Thanks Mohammad.&nbsp; This will work if Edge is not open, so when Edge is opened multiple Home pages appear, one for each Tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am also looking for the ability to re-open the home pages once Edge is already open.&nbsp; This functionality existed with Internet Explorer - it is no longer available with Edge.</p>

            This worked for me. When I restarted Edge, both tabs started up. I used the second tab for WhatsApp on the web (enter web.whatsapp.com into the browser and scan the barcode into the phone app (select WhatsApp on the web from the app menu). Of course, this
 assumes that you are already a WhatsApp user.

            <p>This does not set multiple HOME pages, it sets multiple START pages that open on startup.&nbsp; Multiple HOME pages should open more than one page when the home icon (if you've made it visible) is clicked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In IE you could enter multiple pages on one line and they'd all open when you clicked the home icon, as well as when you started the browser.&nbsp; In Firefox you separate the pages with a semicolon and it operates like IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chrome (and apparently Edge) only allow one home page.</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Run the SFC command when troubleshooting a buggy Windows system. SFC works by scanning for and replacing system files that are corrupt, missing, or changed. Even if the SFC command doesn‚Äôt repair any files, running it will at least confirm that no system files are corrupted and then you can continue to troubleshoot your system with other methods. You can use the SFC command as long as the computer itself will start. If Windows will start normally, you can run it from an administrative command prompt. If Windows won‚Äôt start normally, you can try starting it in Safe Mode or in the recovery environment by booting from your installation media or recovery disc.

                    I have had to remove the battery system driver every day for the past week...and restoring my laptop to a date in March in order to charge my battery...how can I stop this ridiculous update from installing again!!! Please fix it on your end...I've seen
 so many posts about it, and they all say to do the same thing...quit the bandaid approach and get a REAL SOLUTION!!!!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/348bca6c-be5a-47d2-b2af-6e524c042467?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/348bca6c-be5a-47d2-b2af-6e524c042467?upload=true" /></a>

            Hi  accsmoo
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Can you try upgrading to the newer Windows 10 1809 or 1903 release to see if it resolves the issue?
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-10-creators-update/617a37da-8fc0-4f33-a3eb-59fe9082f925">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />Check if its working...
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isn't fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. It's possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you don‚Äôt have any. If you don't have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=outlet+tester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=s...</a>). Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system won‚Äôt be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. Slack's Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.
<br />
<br />10. Replace Charger or Battery Module
<br />
<br />Ultimately, if you don't see any improvements after trying all the above, then it‚Äôs maybe best that you replace either the charger or battery itself. This will require contacting your laptop manufacturer and placing an order. Batteries and the chargers are not necessarily cheap, especially if its an older system. But, if you have no choice, its something you will just have to do to get your system back in working order.

<p>Thank you again for your feedback and quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can add then this small list.</p>
<p>
The new interface lost a number of functionalities:<br />
The text is small I can't make it bigger.<br />
The quality of the response seems to be sluggish.<br />
I can't configure anymore the sounds, as I would like to have the old one I can't put it back.<br />
There is no possibility of really pinning the chats... because the sorting is based on other sorting and not on pinning...<br />
The new configuration commands violate all the standards of apple applications, creating clutter and spreading controls allover the place (cmd+, open only a small subsection of the commands and they are not really connected to the rest).<br />
The design is made for a phone so the userexperience on the desktop is... dubious to say the best.<br />

            It is almost unbelievable that this was set by design. Skype was a great app a few years ago, and now for many updates in a row, it has simply gotten worse each time. The point of having favourites was to be able to see them right away. If I have to click
 and scroll to see them, then I can simply search for the person directly. This and other features (e.g., the connection with Skype phones, which has also been discontinued without a clear reason) were what made me want to use Skype, which I will now abandon
 as quickly as I can.

<p>Totally agree, I'll try to drop it asap.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I could not find a suitable alternative yet. If you have Ideas, let me know. You could be more helpful then political answers ready for a campaign instead of a half designed product. I still have 5 euro inside skype...</p>
<p>For the moment I let the update done on my "work" computer and blocked any other update on "my personal one" instead. Which solved the problem of using skype. At work I do not. In my free time I do (older interface).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is amazing that no one realised how bad and corrupting is the idea of a centralised skype. And another web based app is not going to improve the world, nor bring more customers or make your user base happier. The design of skype had a meaning before.
 After microsoft took over it started the end for the apple platform.</p>

            I had the same problem. I went to gmail.com and logged into my gmail account the old way, all my stuff was still there it just doesn't seem to be on the email app on Win10. I have noticed that once I send an email the address is added automatically and
 I have noticed that a few of my contacts show up when I start to send an email I wonder if those are people who also upgraded.

            I'm in the same boat as Christopher. I upgraded to W10 on your invitation and now appear to have no contacts. Where are they and why wasn't this very obvious flaw foreseen by Microsoft? Do we have yet another upgrade ****=up or is there a simple, and easy
 to apply solution?&nbsp;

            I went to All Apps (bottom Left) then to Microsoft Windows live Mail, and they were all there.&nbsp; Now when I want to send an email I go to that site.&nbsp; Not the best way to do things but it works.

<h2>            Apps not loading - white screen</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Windows 8 through download. To begin with for the first day or so all apps worked and then just stopped. I've tried all the suggestions on all the other threads and no change. Once I click on an app such as mail or messenger it loads
 a white screen and nothing else. I can't even open the store uninstall and re-install. The only option I haven't tried is the refresh option but if I really don't want to loose all my programs that I have already installed if it may not even fix it. Please
 if anyone knows any other way could they please help me as I'm fit to throw my laptop out the window over this.&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting this in Microsoft Community.<span>&nbsp; </span>I am sorry to hear that, you have an issue with apps performance.<b>
</b></span><span>I apologize for inconvenience; I would request you to send us more information as listed below to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you face any issue with other apps?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try these methods and check the issue status.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to download and run the app troubleshooter in the link.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p>Place the computer in ‚ÄúClean boot‚Äù and then check how it works.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to place the computer in clean boot state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Press the ‚ÄòWindows + R‚Äô key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span> </span></span></span><span>In the ‚ÄòRun‚Äô windows type ‚ÄôMSCONFIG‚Äô and click ‚ÄòOk‚Äô.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click the ‚ÄòBoot‚Äô tab and uncheck ‚ÄòSafe Boot‚Äô option.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On the ‚ÄòGeneral‚Äô tab, click to select the option ‚ÄòSelective startup‚Äô, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On the ‚ÄòServices‚Äô tab, click to select the ‚ÄòHide all Microsoft services‚Äô check box, and then click ‚ÄòDisable all‚Äô.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On the ‚ÄòStartup‚Äô tab, click ‚ÄòOpen Task Manager‚Äô. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‚ÄòDisable‚Äô.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click ‚ÄòOK‚Äô, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>If it works in clean boot state, then follow rest of the steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2: </strong>Enable half of the services</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 3:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check
 boxes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span> </span></span></span><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 4:</strong> Enable half of the Startup items</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 5:</strong> Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the
 check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide
 all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 6:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the
 problem item.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 7:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Press the ‚ÄòWindows + R‚Äô key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the ‚ÄòRun‚Äô windows type ‚ÄôMSCONFIG‚Äô and click ‚ÄòOk‚Äô.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On the ‚ÄòGeneral‚Äô tab, click the ‚ÄòNormal Startup‚Äô option, and then click ‚ÄòOK‚Äô.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‚ÄòRestart‚Äô.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>What to do if you have problems with an app. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 4:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Perform System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press ‚ÄúWindows Key + Q‚Äù to open Charms Bar.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type ‚Äúcmd‚Äù without quotes in the search box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. On the left pane, right click on the ‚Äúcmd‚Äù option and select ‚ÄúRun as Administrator‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Type ‚Äòsfc /scannow‚Äô without quotes and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, are you unable to receive any notifications using the new Skype? Have you also enabled the notification from the Skype app itself? Also, what particular notification is not working, is it the call or the message notification?</p>

            I have latest IOS and the latest version of Skype on my desktop. I have set all available notifications to "ON". Still, no pop-up appears for incoming calls, and as the accept-call icon is located on the pop-up, I am unable to answer any calls. I have
 to set Skype to call-forwarding and take those calls on my cell phone. Have you any solution to this?

                    <div>I have a major problem and I'm hoping one of you can help me.</div>
<div>My PC is trying to update EVERY TIME I switch on. &nbsp;It's been happening for a couple of days now.</div>
<div><br />
It prepares to configure.- gets to 15% and tells me configuration failed and it's reverting changes.</div>
<div>Then it shuts itself down and on opening, it prepares to configure again. &nbsp;Then it boots to desktop.</div>

<div>When I shut down, it tells me it's installing updates 1 - 9.</div>

<div>When I switch on again, the whole rigmarole starts again. &nbsp;It's constant.</div>

<div>I have tried recovery, where it found and fixed 2 update problems, but obviously not this one.</div>

<div>I tried a system restore and got this:</div>

<div>[img]http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b201/Tosca_/Miscellaneous%20Stuff/restore.jpg[/img]</div>

<div>I have never known a system restore not to work. &nbsp;:(&nbsp;</div>

<div>I've tried everything I can think of, even deleting a couple of updates. &nbsp;Is it safe if I delete all updates for the last 3 days 'cause I don't know what else to try.</div>

<div>As an aside, and what I now think might be the problem..my 5 year old granddaughter switched the PC on the other day to play a game without my knowledge and she's just now told me that as it didn't work, she switched it off again. &nbsp;When I showed her the
 problem I was having, she said yes, it looked like that. &nbsp;So, I reckon that Mia switched if off (using the on off button that I'd told her NEVER to use to switch off) while it was updating and it's that that's knackered it.</div>

<div>Anyway, any ideas guys? &nbsp;I'm at my wits end and it's taking about 20 mins to get to where I can actually use the computer each time.</div>

<p>Glad you got it sorted.</p>
<p>Norton... *sigh*</p>
<p>My suggestion:<br />
Get rid of Norton. Anything and everything made by Norton.</p>
<p>As far as AntiVirus - the free ones are fine: <a href="http://www.avira.com/en/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Avira</a>, <a href="http://free.avg.com/us-en/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
AVG</a>, <a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Avast</a></p>
<p>You could spend ~60USD for two years of <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/home/products/antivirus-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
eSET NOD32 AntiVirus</a> (not the suite - just the AntiVirus product) and that would be more than worth it.</p>
<p>Pick a product other than Norton and/or McAfee. Get it.</p>
<p>Uninstall the Norton stuff (use their 
removal tool from here.)</p>
<p>After a reboot - install your new product and update it after the install.</p>
<p>Perform a full scan with it.</p>

            <p>Hi Llew,</p>
<p>first things first...turn off automatic updates. That should stop the annoying cycle.</p>
<p>Next thing is exactly which updates are showing they need to be updated?</p>
<p>Are you getting any error message?</p>

<div>I'm afraid I'm not very up on this update business. &nbsp;Nothing worked so in the end I went in and hid them, which stopped them. &nbsp;I'm not sure if that was a sensible thing to do or not but there were 9 showing and 9 in my loop so I assumed they were the same.</div>

            After a period of 180 days, credits expire and you will need to reactivate. If you login to your account @ <a href="https://secure.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/</a> , Reactivate Credit should appear next to your profile pic.

            That game was a little gem indeed.<br />
I got to know about it back in the day because I love Chopin music and went to a charity concert by Stanislav Bunin playing some of his famous pieces. It was a great night so I decided to get more info also about Bunin and discovered that he was actually involved
 in the making of a jrpg called Eternal Sonata which had Chopin as the main character...got the game the day after.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this suggestion. I understand there's a game you'd like to be put on the backwards compatibility list. I would recommend contacting the developers of the game and see if your suggestion can help them
 contact Xbox about making their game backwards compatible. Many games are added to the

    <title>Surface Book 2 Blue Screen Crash With Error on ov7251.sys - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Book 2 Blue Screen Crash With Error on ov7251.sys</h2>
                    My surface book 2 is only a few months old but it is now getting a blue screen error every time I open it (whether from standby mode or from being turned off) and restarting. The computer says the error is with ov7251.sys on the blue screen. How do I fix
 this?

            Hi azUser_844
<br />
<br />Yes, the mini-dump file indicates it is your webcam device driver . . .
<br />
<br />Please try this, disable the front camera and restart your Surface, see if the blue screens have stopped . . .
