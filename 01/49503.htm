<h2>            How to reinstall my original windows XP on my Sony Viao computer.</h2>
                    I have a Sony Viao desktop computer.&nbsp; It crashed a couple of years ago, so I had a friend rebuild it.&nbsp; It runs Windows XP.&nbsp; However, ever since he rebuilt it or whatever they call it, I get the message warning that I have an invalid window license.&nbsp; So
 I haven't been able to have any Windows Updates installed on my computer now for at least 2 years. &nbsp;I do have the original Hologram Certificate of Authenticy from Sony, but it says: Microsfot Works 7.0, Microsoft Money 2004, Agie of Empires 2.0, and Microsoft
 Encarta Online.&nbsp; Is this my Proper Windows certificat though?&nbsp; I can't get any of the windows updates. I'm at a loss as to what to do.&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp; If I'm missing any information that would help you to help me, please let me know.&nbsp; How do I put back on my
 Original Windows XP?&nbsp;&nbsp; Also my Recovery thing is gone.&nbsp;Thank you so much.&nbsp; Penny.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what edition of Windows XP do you have? you should be able to see it in the Certificate of Authenticity on your computer tower not on somewhere else.</p>
<p>what do you mean by invalid windows license? are you receiving a prompt that your product key is invalid? or are you receiving a message that your copy of windows is not genuine?</p>

            Try tapping F8 just as the Sony logo is leaving and before Windows starts to load and look and see if you see any kind of System Recovery options. Most OEM PC's (Dell,HP,IBM,Sony,etc) come with a hidden recovery partition. If you can find it look for an
 option to set the computer back to factory default specifications. Good luck!!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
All of the attached DMP files are of the <b>KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR (7a)</b> bugcheck.<br />
<br />
<i>This bug check indicates that the requested page of kernel data from the paging file could not be read into memory.
</i><br />
<br />
The 2nd parameter of the bugcheck is 0 which equals - ERROR_CODE: (NTSTATUS) 0 - STATUS_WAIT_0. Hard disk failure is NOT likely, although it's still possible.<br />
<br />
Let's first enable Driver Verifier to see if we're dealing with any possible driver conflicts or corruption:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
8. Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />
Any other questions can most likely be answered by this article:<br />

<p>It also occurs to me that u may have accidently turned on the magnifier by pressing the Windows key and the Plus key. &nbsp;If so you can reduce the screen to normal by pressing and holding the Windows key and tapping the -minus key.</p>
<p>You may have to do this more then once to get the screen back to normal. &nbsp;Then close the Magnifier task which you will see in the task bar.</p>

<h2>            Fable I and II disconnects from remote controller after hitting enemy &#47; being hit.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read online that all Fable games have multiple bugs, and it appears to be true. Fable I (played on the 360) disconnected the remote controller every time I punched an NPC in the beginning of the game (in the village).&nbsp;As in hit the attack button, and then
 "Please reconnect the controller" error message on the screen, every time. Very annoying, so I gave up on Fable I. Now I'm on Fable II, and it's almost the same thing. This time I can attack, but if I'm hit by something, it does the disconnection. Not as bad
 as Fable I, but still a real 'disconnect' from the continuity of the game. I've heard Lionhead has a patch download but I can't find it online, and nothing is updating on XBox Live. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Turn the rumble off in your controller.</p>
<p>It's likely your controller isn't in top shape, and the places that hold the battery in are loose, so the rumble shakes the connection free.</p>
<p>I have a controller like this myself, so I have to be gentle with it.</p>

    <title>this copy of windows is not genuine&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sean_in_cali  say:</h3>
<h2>            this copy of windows is not genuine&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This morning I found this message waiting for me on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7&nbsp;</p>
<p>Build 7601</p>
<p>This copy of windows is not genuine</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the bottom right hand corner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I had initially downloaded an iso using the microsoft website and then purchased a key fromm ebay vendor called cheapcodes. That was back in march. And just this morning, it stopped working ? The latest update was fro this morning, not sure it has anythign
 to do with that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried reentering the product key and it says it's been blocked from use by microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>if I click on the buy new product key online, it takes me to window 10 website. I have winbdows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/433df74f-ff39-4626-915c-12166390c89a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/433df74f-ff39-4626-915c-12166390c89a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And validating on the phone &nbsp;says the same thing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And it all ends up not being valid. And when I click on the validate link to go to the microsoft website, it throws errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I contacted the chat and the remote assistance was done. The tech tried a few different things. And then he tried the phone activation and the product id he used was not my product id mine started with 021, and his tried it with a few different product
 id.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the tech restarted the computer and the problems persisted. So he then says I need to do a clean install of the windows 7. And the gave me this download link which is not from microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://f03xmg.bn1301.livefilestore.com/y4mt4KSaNTclr6grXzicL5v88N3nVLzDQXAe7h6u-vWpaLenfcML2xyaC1LTn_qA1-ArYR9wdUGL-2XNGJbvCuPPeOlfSwp_vKp3Tzrk3DHpqYRcYUjxvhu2e4ZfcCTi90wVwFt4eGR36tHAv-A9zA-e1kgHkD80nEYi-rvcrT15rjRq-h9PVoVOuR5C4taUPURJ6cygeYZdVlAxzBnY9IyXA/en_windows_7_home_premium_x64_dvd.iso?download&amp;psid=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or am I wrong in thinking that's not microsoft? I copied the chat so I can provide it if need be. That really seem fishy to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I need to resolve this issue without having to do a clean install, because last time I upgraded I had loops of BSOD, like 20, 30 in a row whiel trying to boot up. Which was due to the hardware drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i need some help here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. is there anyway to reregister this windows with Microsoft?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Does that windows ISO seem safe even though it's not from microsoft?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What's the best way to backup my entire hard drive like taking a mirror image of it so i can have my applications and data back if and once I do a clean install?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. if I don't do anything what is the worst that can happen here? That message about windows not being genuine is annoying, but, if that's all the problem it poses, I can live with it until Iget a new computer. But if I can't get any updates toprotect my
 computer from viruses, that will cause a lot of problems for me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any insights and thought,s</p>

<p>Well, we can safely conclude, you don't have a genuine Windows 7 license installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because Microsoft no longer license Windows 7, you will need to purchase a license for Windows 7 somewhere else or consider purchasing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you prefer Window 7 - purchasing an OEM System Builder license that matches the edition you have is your only option.</p>
<p>

<span><span>You can find OEM System Builder software from dozens of online merchants. The current price for OEM Windows 7 Professional at

<p>
<span><span>There are no technical limitations to prevent you from using OEM software on your own PC, although this software will work only for a clean installation and not for an upgrade. In the past, Microsoft has been remarkably inconsistent
 in its advice to customers about whether this practice is allowed.

<h2>            2017-12 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems &#40;KB4053579&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Ok, Windows 10 version 1607, with all updates installed except KB4053579!&nbsp; My system is downloading and installing this update since 12/13/2017.&nbsp; During the restart process the system hangs at 80% trying to finalize the installation process for a very loooonnnggg
 time (30+ hrs).&nbsp; At this stage I am forced to use the power off button to restart my PC, thus crashing the hard drive everytime!&nbsp; The system reboots and tells me that "...I'll be going back to my previous windows version or something like that" and after undoing
 what ever it had done it allows me to go back to my version 1607, only to start the process all over again!&nbsp; Has anybody seen the movie "Groundhog day"?&nbsp; I'm living it every day with no way to stop Windows 10 from continually attempting this update, thereby
 crashing my hard drive every time!&nbsp; Are they liable when I have to buy a brand new system (not windows based) because I can not even restore (to this hard drive or another) because Windows will continue to try this update (KB4053579).&nbsp; I have looked everywhere
 and at every option to stop this non-sense from happening!&nbsp; If you know of ANY way to hide or stop this particular update, help will be much appreciated.&nbsp; (And on a lighter note, can someone tell me what are they smoking at MS?)</p>

            <p>Hi Vardhaman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your speedy&nbsp;reply and advice. &nbsp;That's unfortunate. I found 8.1 far superior to windows 7. I accept that windows 10 is meant to be the best of both worlds with some great improvements and tweeks, but these changes become inadequacies when they
 don't give you choice. One step forward, half a step back.... I liked the bright different coloured tiles on 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having all the tiles be the same colour blue (other than a few Bing or Xbox related ones) is pretty boring.
</p>
<p>Now even all the apps in Microsoft office are the same colour blue as well. </p>
<p>It would be much more fun being able to&nbsp;colour co-ordinate your favourites! or different groups of tiles windows apps one colour, nero another colour, Office another colour etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone comes up with a solution to allow tile colour to be determined by the users please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pete&nbsp;</p>

            <p>oops above posted on wrong string!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd have to say again... at least with 8.1 you had a choice and it was great to sign in and go straight to the start screen. extra clicks and less ways to get to the same area</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows.... 1 step forward. 1/2 a step back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully the windows team will come up with a few tweaks that give users more choice in how and what their screens display when and where.</p>

Of course the answer is not helpful.&nbsp; I like the tiles screen.&nbsp; If windows 10 is so great why can't you choose to use the tiles as the default instead of having the screen go back to the boring, ugly desktop every time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that if I arrange the tiles
 the way I want them the arrangement is saved each time,&nbsp; It shouldn't take much to fix&nbsp;this stupidity.

</p><p>Hi everyone. Windows Update (WU) on my PC is not running probably. When I search for new update, It appears error code 8042A000. I've tried to repair it several times but it still doesn't work. The result of diagnostics says that all problems are fixed but
 "Problems installing update programs...(?)" Can you help me to fix the error? Thank you.

<h2>            Microsoft Play Anywhere games failing to install to any drive but the OS drive</h2>
                    <p>This error/ issue &nbsp;specifically effects play anywhere titles, other win store apps\titles are able to install to non OS drives even now. Only the newer play anywhere titles are having this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When attempting to download a recent title such as Halo 5 Forge, if I attempt to put it to my D drive, the download starts then errors out after only a few megabytes downloaded. If I then switch it to download and install to my OS &nbsp;(C:) drive &nbsp;it will download
 successfully.</p>
<p>Going back and attempting the same thing with a non play anywhere App (ed Gears of War 1 UE) &nbsp;it will install to my D drive no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note this issue also extends to moving programs &nbsp;in windows, native winstore apps that are pre play anywhere will move no problem, while a play anywhere app when attempting to move gets errored out. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clear some initial questions, I have plenty of space on my D: drive 350GB's. &nbsp;If it is a security issue it has to do with how the Play Anywhere titles are being packaged as older Win store apps exhibit none of the problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I’m honestly in shock after being suspened for two weeks this morning. I wen’t onto the Xbox Enforcment website to look at the offending content and it said this is what I said, “i got your gamer picture removed
<strong>[Mod Removed- Inappropriate]</strong>.” The context behind that message is that my friend had a very graphic picture a butt pooping and I reported it to be taken down, and wanted to tell him that it did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is that a 2 week suspension. Who was I harrasing or sending inapropiate messages to? Someone at Xbox PET just not having a good day and decided to come along and wrongly suspend me? Just unreal. I appealed for review but that won’t do anything. Xbox
 Live is a like a child’s playground now-a-days. Smh...</p>

<p>
</p><p>It may help your knowledge going forward to brush up on a bit of legal terms reading..note though that not everything that can lead to an enforcement action against your account is in written into the conduct policy.. you can have taken against you for things
 that arent listed at this link also, at XBLPets discretion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its a wise idea for you not to swear or indicate curses in anyway (abbreviations etc), dont message to gloat after reporting that particular someone and make sure your reports are genuine and you shouldnt have any more issues.
</p>
<p>I myself after reporting a player usually block and mute that player. Maybe in future if its a friend of yours, try to educate the friend on any content they may have on thier profile which could lead to enforcement action against them rather than report
 them straight away and advise them to remove or change the content?? Then if the content remains, yes place a report, but maybe without a follow up PM to the person you just reported. Leave it to the team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah 2 weeks suspension does say to us you may have had enforcements actions before and I see you know the procedure to appeal against the decision...via the enforcement page you screenshot up there. If its your first suspension or enforcement action on
 this account then there will be a reason for the extended length am sure and they will tell you that reason when they reply. There are various suspension lengths and types starting at 24 hours up to a lifetime account and console ban.. you can be blocked simply
 from messaging, or party chats etc.. or indeed be banned from the whole service for the length of your suspension dependant on what it is for. If its not your first suspension or Enforcement Action on your account, then the previous infractions may be considered
 also.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>For others reading this.. if you have been suspended or want to find out more on the Xbox Enforcement team...follow the link and click on 'How Do I?' on the home page for full instructions on what you can do here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck with your appeal Skurphy.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>By default this should be enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Right click</strong>&nbsp; a zipped file and select the &nbsp;<strong>Extract All</strong>&nbsp; option from the menu. A new folder will be created and opened&nbsp;containing the extracted files.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Can I use a 12months Xbox live subscription code while midway though a Gold subscription&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi could anyone tell me if I use a Xbox live gold code while I am part way through a current subscription will it just be added on or would it be a waste? the reason I ask is someone brought me a 12 month subscription as a present but they only wrote the
 code so would like to check it works but don't want to waste it<br />
<br />
Many thanks for any help</p>

<p>There's no built-in option to find duplicates, but there's lots of ways to do it.&nbsp; I actually use a program called DoubleKiller to find any duplicates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for putting all the pictures into one folder, you can do that by just drag-and-dropping them into the place you want them to be.<br />

<p>I am sorry to be so long responding to your message, but I am having some serious medical problems that include a total loss of hearing that has recently happened. I followed your instructions.</p>

<p>After completing, notification that appeared in the little Solve PC Issues shortcut on the taskbar that backups from previous installed operation system needed to be deleted. After deleting, there was a notification that all files had not been deleted..
 Back to the Solve PC Issues shortcut,&nbsp;there was notification that the last backup did not complete successfully coupled with multiple solutions including Try Running Back up Again. I followed those instructions several times with the same result. Also there
 would be a Red Cross appearing in the Solve Issues icon. On the last try, the Red Cross has disappeared, but placing cursor on the Solve PC icon, there is one message. Opening Action Center, under Maintenance in Backup Your Files, the message is.
<b>Your last backup did not complete successfully. Your files have not been backed up</b>.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I have not found the solution. I did have a big crash sometime later. I thought I had everything backed up on third-party app in ISO files, but there was the biggest screw up between startup disk and other storage disk. The whole thing fail
 miserably. All my data is stored on a different partition. Fortunate I had a Windows 8 installation disk. After disk boot up, I selected repair and what I got was a clean install and a list of all apps that were not reinstalled. Some of my data from the other
 partition was removed. Things like GIFs animation.</p>
<p>I now have everything backed up with Acronis True Image. Word of caution: if using that application, create the boot media and work from it instead of the application.</p>

            Is this just for personal or you want to create a corporate image to image multiple workstations?<br />Personal you can go to control panel - system and security- backup and restore. <br />Option to create system image there. <br />For corporate it’s more detailed so let me know if you need that as well.

            Built-in File History, Windows Backup and Image Backup are having a lot of problems.  I'd use a better, more flexible app like free Macrium which just works.  <br />File backup:  <a href="http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Backing+up+files+and+folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/B...</a><br />Image backup:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a> <br /><br />In addition I'd have a secondary cloud backup that keeps your files safest from fire and theft:<br /><br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  <br /><br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  <br /><br />Or you can also drag or c

            Hi, Sarah. Thank you for your response but I think it doesn't work. I checked many Dell publications but they don't have decision. When&nbsp; you have new computer and Windows 10 they don't have decision. Microsoft recommended follows to&nbsp; Windows 7. Many others
 recommendations is not serious or works with old computers and old software.&nbsp; Thanks, Leonid

    <title>Windows 10 refresh problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> graham58  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 refresh problems</h2>
                    I took over my sons Lenovo flex 2 14 laptop which was running windows 8.1. I successfully upgraded to windows 10 and it was all working fine. I decided to refresh the computer to remove everything so I could personalise it myself but it stuck at 66%. I
 had a screen come up that said it could not refresh and gave me the option to return to windows 10 which I selected. Since then the computer will not boot up or load windows. None of the F keys are working and all I get is the Lenovo logo coming on the screen
 for about 15 secs then it shuts down and the same thing happens again. I have created a windows 10 media usb stick but it won't boot from that. &nbsp;I have no dvd drive in this machine so I can't even think about buying a new copy of windows to install.&nbsp;Please
 help!!

            Hi Abdul thank you for replying to my problem. I have created a USB installation tool but the computer will not boot from it. When I turn it on it just flashes up the Lenovo logo for a few seconds, switches off and does the same thing over again. I don't
 have a DVD drive on this computer either so I can't install windows from a disc.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to boot from the USB then I would suggest you to change the boot order from BIOS to USB. So, that in boot priority USB is at the top and as soon as computer boots it starts with the help of USB. If you don't want how to change the boot
 order then I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer of your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><span><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee
 that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information provided is helpful. Do keep us updated about the status of your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Thank you for the replies to my question. However, I cannot get across the fact that my computer will not function at all other than the Lenovo logo. The F keys do not function at all so I cannot change the boot order or anything else. I have contacted Lenovo
 who said it is a hardware issue and I need to send it to them for assessment (not under guarantee)</p>
<p>I don't know if it is the machine or windows that has caused the problem - probably a combination of both but I guess nobody will take responsibility for it.</p>

            <p>This computer is now dead. It will cost me lots of money to get it fixed and to do that I need to send it to Germany. The problem was caused in the first place by my upgrading to windows 10. I will not make that mistake again and I am advising everyone I
 know not to upgrade too. Microsoft should get things right before they start wrecking peoples machines.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The time and date are correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Trouble shooting app said the temporary internet files folder had changed and changed it back.</p>
<p>This did not fix the problem. And when I tried the other options, they can only be accessed through Edge which will not load completely (pops up, but goes away before completely loading).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I ran Method 2 I got a message:</p>
<p>ms-windows-store:PurgeCaches The app did not start.</p>
<p>I had found this method in another string and had already tried it. The first time I did it it came back with a different message in the command prompt saying it did not have permission, alas the snipping tool does not work now so I cannot open the screen
 capture I took to be able to give you the exact info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also ran Windows defender, ESET, Microsofts Msert and Malwarebytes.</p>
<p>Nothing unusual found by any of them.</p>
<p>This started 3/9/2016 after an update (not sure if it had anything to do with it or not).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your assistance.</p>

<p>I do not know why, but my option at restart to open and run in safe mode is gone. F8 does nothing now. Is this an update from Windows 10 or another problem?</p>
<p>I keep finding more and more apps (some I didn't realize were apps) that do not work. Does anyone know of anything I can do short of factory restore?</p>

<p>
</p><p>But before <strong>Get-AppxPackage .....</strong>, do a<strong> Get-AppxLog </strong>
to see the latest log on what happened last that PowerShell was used, EG by&nbsp;the Store itself, installing App updates. Maybe there is a clue there. You can copy paste the output from the top left PowerShell menu,&nbsp;Edit menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to safe mode, try msconfig.exe to configure your next boot-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to that suspicious update, try to uninstall it which should have the same effect as a restore point.</p>

<p>Should I use command prompt (admin) or regular?</p>

<p>Is the "Get-AppxLog" supposed to be input to the search box next to the start button (if so it doesn't pull anything up).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry for my ineptitude, I just can't afford to mess this up.</p>
<p>I will wait for your response before I do mess something up.</p>
<p>Thank you again for all of your help!</p>

            <p>I updated my post to use PowerShell (Admin). Your other concerns do not apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PowerShell (Admin) or standard PowerShell depends on the ability to see the Apps in this folder and subfolders:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If denied the Admin version is needed to overcome folder security, else the standard version will do.</p>

</p><p>The AppxLog is a false alarm that happens with not installed packages more often so that leaves us to the reregister error result.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can make a comment on is that if something pops up at the command prompt that is part of the previous command it usually means that there was a hidden line break in that command when it was copy/pasted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hidden line breaks do not show (hence hidden) but are interpreted as 'Enter' by the command line interpreter and the rest is then entered at the new prompt.</p>

                    I'm trying to play the original Thief, but it keeps crashing claiming that DirectX 11 can't support it. I have already done the compatibility settings, and it starts up perfectly, but crashes during the tutorial, is there a way to repair DirectX in way?

            I don't have Thief ('98 release date) , but have Thief 2 (2000). <br />
You did well getting the game as far as the tutorial. T2 crashed when launching before<br />
I searched for a fix.<br />
- The game may run more stable if you use only one core of your cpu <br />
( open <i>Task manager</i> &gt; <i>Processes</i>.&nbsp; R/click on <i>Thief.exe</i> and then click on
<i>Affinity </i>and clear the<br />
tick box next to all but one core).<br />
<br />
- I believe you will need the <i>DDFix</i> for the 'Dark Engine', which the Thief game uses, though.
<br />
I used this with Thief 2-<br />
<a href="http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=121449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DDFix and Enhanced Resolution Patch (including widescreen support)</a>
<br />
<br />
I also use the <i>T2Tools</i> which helps make the game run properly on my Win7 64bit machine.<br />
This is for Thief 2 but there may be a similar fix for Thief as well.<br />
<br />
- You can also get an updated version with the Gold expansion, and an&nbsp; .exe that selects one core
<br />
of your cpu,&nbsp; from&nbsp; <i>Good Old Games</i> . <br />

<h3> iamakwik12  say:</h3>
<h2>            New PC - Added RAM - PFN_LIST_CORRUPT error</h2>
                    I bought a laptop literally one week ago, with windows 8.&nbsp; It came with one 4 gb stick of RAM preinstalled, and I added a 4GB stick I purchased as well.<br />
<br />
Installed basic antivirus, office, mozilla, and Classic Shell.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I am getting a BSOD and pfn_list_corrupt error every few days. Any idea on where to start?&nbsp; Should I just take the laptop back to the store?<br />
<br />
Any help is most appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

                    <p>Hi! </p>
<p>Whenever I try to login to Windows 7 (64 bit) it got&nbsp;this blue screen error. It happens when, at "msconfig" i clicked "diagnostic startup". I did this because all the time my PC was too slow, the CPU usage was always at 100%, even if I just have Word open
 and no Internet connection. So this is too wired for me. but, when I started my PC, CPU usage is 30%, (while loading all drivers). Then after 2 minutes, CPU usage increase till 100%! Even if I just wait!&nbsp; =(</p>
<p>After running GData antivirus, it says that there was no virus at all. I perform an defrag disk, same thing. So I thought it could be an issue with some rootkits/spyware.</p>
<p>That's why I was trying to reboot with diagnostic startup. But it never login to windows again.
<br />
</p>
<p>Please! any comment will be very helpful!</p>
