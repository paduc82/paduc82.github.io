<h2>            Can&#39;t boot Windows, or boot Windows Repair from SSD or USB</h2>
                    <p>My computer isn't able to boot, but more worryingly, I also can't seem to get the Windows Automatic Repair to work. I also am not able to get Windows Repair from USB to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try any of these options, I initially get a black screen with a cyan-ish Windows logo. After a moment, I get the loading circle thing, and then I get a blank screen. Sometimes this screen is black, but most of the the time it's the 'accent color'
 from the personalization settings screen. Sometimes I get a flash of what looks like a window, but it only lasts for a fraction of the setting. I can move the cursor around, but there's nothing to interact with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get this same result whether I select any of the following boot options:</p>
<p>The SSD with Windows 10 x64 Pro installed</p>
<p>Windows Boot Manager</p>
<p>SanDisk (both the UEFI and non UEFI versions yield the same result)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reset my bios by popping the CMOS battery for a few minutes, and this hasn't affected the results.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The precursor symptom was explorer.exe locking up. I left the room briefly, and when I returned my computer was in its current state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I try at this point? How likely is this to be a hardware issue?</p>
<p>

            Hi  Turnip, if you are getting the loading dots, you should be able to get into the WinRE . . .
<br />
<br />Unplug your PC and if it is a laptop, remove the battery 
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Power button for 30 seconds 
<br />
<br />Plug your PC back in and if it is a laptop, replace the Battery 
<br />
<br />Start your PC and see if it boots into Windows 
<br />
<br />If not, let's see if we can get into the Windows Recovery Environment: 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

<p>The problem that I have is that I can't get into the Recovery Environment to do any of those things. I've tried loading it from the SSD and from a USB stick, but I just get a blank screen as described.<br />
</p>
<p>UPDATE: After about three hours of waiting on this blank screen, I finally got a window where I could select between installing windows and hitting REpair. I clicked repair and this Window went away. It's been another three hours and nothing has happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I hit escape I get an prompt that says "To install Windows you must run Windows Installation. If you cancel Windows Installation your computer might restart. Do you want to cancel Windows Installation?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hit no obviously, but I'm still stuck on a blank screen with nothing to interact with.</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 Slim - HDMI Setup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lewstar mk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Slim - HDMI Setup</h2>
                    
<p><span>First of all, I'd like to say apologies if this thread/post has been made elsewhere. After a year and a half of PlayStation 3, I decided to switch consoles, and am glad I did. Thus im quite new to the XBOX Forums, and have had trouble finding my way
 around.</span></p>
<p><span>So I bought an XBOX 360 Slim a couple weeks back, looking forward to playing in HDMI as my PlayStation didn‚Äôt support it for some reason, and I noticed straight away that the AV/Scart/Component cable (whatever you personally call them) had a small
 piece of plastic blocking the HDMI port. Unlike most people, I don't know what I do next.</span></p>
<p><span>Can I setup the XBOX to just use the HDMI cable, by simply switching cables halfway through the process? If so, how?</span></p>
<p><span>Do I have to buy a new cable that allows me to plug both in at the same time? (Also, do you NEED to plug both in at the same time, to achieve HDMI quality?)</span></p>
<p><span>Is it possible to sand or cut the plastic on the cable, without risking serious permanent damage to the cable or XBOX? And would tinkering with the cable affect the 1 year warranty, if so I won‚Äôt think twice about it.</span></p>
<p><span>That's about it really, if anybody could provide some clear, helpful advice on any or all of these questions, it would be highly appreciated!</span></p>
<p><span>Lewstar MK. :)</span></p>

<p>Do you have a HDMI cable?</p>
<p>If so, remove the AV Component cable from the Xbox 360 &amp; insert the HDMI cable into the Xbox 360 &amp; TV and power the console on, you can change settings in the Dashboard &gt; System Settings &gt; Console Settings &gt; Display to whatever your current TV supports e.g.
 720p, 1080i or 1080p.</p>

<p>and if i go to settings to change to hd, it says "connect an xbox 360 hd av cable to configure hd display modes" i connect hdmi cable, once again, no signal</p>

<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>Let me see if I can help you fix this, as I would love for you to get playing on your Xbox! First, I would like to clarify a couple of things so I can understand fully where we are having problems.</p>
<p>On the back of your Xbox there are two video outputs, one for HDMI and one for the Component/AV cable. You referred to a piece of plastic covering parts of that. Could you elaborate into more detail what you are referring to or provide a picture so I can
 clearly get an idea of what you mean? </p>
<p>Then, I know it may sound trivial but I want to make sure you have selected the correct HDMI input on your TV before you turn on the Xbox 360 with the HDMI cable connected. You should only have to have one cable (the HDMI cable) to run audio and sound in
 full HD; you won't need the Component/AV cable at all.</p>
<p>So, like I said, let's start with some clarification and I will do my best to help you out! We'll get you squared away by the end of tonight to crank up some Battlefield 3 in pure HD amazingness! :)</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
All of the attached DMP files are of the <u><b>UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP (7f)</b></u> bug check.<br />
<br />
<i>This bug check indicates that the Intel CPU generated a trap and the kernel failed to catch this trap.<br />
<br />
BugCheck 7F, {<u><b>8</b></u>, ffffd000201d6130, ffffd00026a9dff0, ffffe00003694dfe}<br />
<br />
</i>The 1st parameter of the bug check is 0x00000008, or Double Fault, indicates that an exception occurs during a call to the handler for a prior exception. Typically, the two exceptions are handled serially. However, there are several exceptions that cannot
 be handled serially, and in this situation the processor signals a double fault. There are two common causes of a double fault:

<li>A kernel stack overflow. This overflow occurs when a guard page is hit, and the kernel tries to push a trap frame. Because there is no stack left, a stack overflow results, causing the double fault.
<br />
</li><li>A hardware problem.</li></ul>

    <title>Nero Showtime &#34;Cannot Build Graph&#34; Error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nero Showtime &#34;Cannot Build Graph&#34; Error</h2>
                    
<p>In general, Windows 7 RC is functioning smoothly on my Toshiba Satellite laptop. However, it returns a "Cannot Build Graph" error when I try to run Nero Showtime 7. Another blog suggested that a user uninstall, restart computer, and install Nero 7 with Administrator
 Privileges. But this did not solve the problem. I have encountered problems with Nero in the past (with XP Pro and Vista Business), which are usually resolved a few months following release. It might be nice to solve this one before the release.</p>

<p><span>Hi DoctorJoe,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
Can you post the exact error message in this forum?<br />
<br />
You might try reinstalling Nero with your anti-virus, firewall, and malware software temporarily turned off.<br />
I see that there might be a&nbsp;Nero Cleanup tool that you could try from Nero.<br />
<br />
Please let us know how this works out.</span></p>

    <title>Taskbar refreshes everytime I open the File Explorer within an - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikeyvah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar refreshes everytime I open the File Explorer within an application&#47;browser.</h2>
                    <p>So, first off, this supposed glitch is present since the days of Windows 7, so it's not only me or my computer. In fact, this occured on every Windows PC I have used or seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Say, I want to save or insert a file from/into a browser or Discord/Skype, or open an image in Photoshop. The computer hangs for about 3-4 seconds and when it finally opens, it still lags behind a few seconds and all my taskbar icons disappear. At this point,
 the PC noticeably slows down until the icons have fully reloaded.</p>
<p>I do have to note that the taskbar only refreshes when inserting or opening a file from within an application and NOT when I open the File Explorer as it is (for example from the taskbar shortcut).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I confess it indeed is my PC slowing down there, but what I don't understand is why does the taskbar refresh? I've seen it refresh even on gaming PCs. This still occurs even on the latest Windows 10 versions, no matter the edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else experiencing this?</p>

<p>Hi Mikey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The operating system might have been corrupted is the taskbar refreshes by itself and you're experiencing a slow computer. To isolate your concern, kindly answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What's the make and model of your computer?</li><li>What's the current build of your operating system? Press Windows key + R and then type winver.</li><li>Have you made any recent hardware or software changes prior to this issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:&nbsp;<span>Perform a clean boot.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;It helps eliminate software conflicts. You may refer to this&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 2: Perform a full scan using your antivirus.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 3:&nbsp;</span><span>Delete unnecessary files and perform a Disk cleanup.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To delete temporary files:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search for&nbsp;<span>Disk cleanup</span>&nbsp;from the taskbar and select it from the list of results.</li><li>Under&nbsp;<span>Files to delete</span>, select the file types to get rid of. To get a description of the file type, select it.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<span>OK</span>.</li></ol>
<p>If you need to free up more space, you can also delete system files:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In Disk cleanup, select&nbsp;<span>Clean up system files</span>.</li><li>Select the file types to get rid of. To get a description of the file type, select it.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<span>OK</span>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Method 4:&nbsp;Check for corrupted Windows system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Deployment Image Service and Management Tool (DISM) is a utility&nbsp; that scans for corrupted Windows system files. If it finds a problem, it will try to replace the problematic system files from a cached version that‚Äôs on your PC. If DISM can‚Äôt
 replace the files, the System File Checker (SFC) can check the corrupted files then download and replace the files through Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To use the Deployment Image Service and Management Tool (DISM).</span></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;In the search box on the taskbar, type&nbsp;<span>powershell</span>, press and hold (or right-click)&nbsp;<span>Windows PowerShell</span>, and then select&nbsp;<span>Run as administrator</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Yes</span>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;At the prompt, type&nbsp;<span>dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span>&nbsp;(note the space between "dism.exe" and "/" and each switch (/)).</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;If DISM finds corrupted files and replaces them, restart your PC and see that improves performance.</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp;You must&nbsp;be connected to the Internet to use DISM, and it might take several minutes to finish.</p>
<p>For more info about DISM, see&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Fix Windows Update errors by using the DISM or System Update Readiness tool</span></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To run System File Checker (SFC).</span></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;In the search box on the taskbar, type&nbsp;<span>powershell</span>, press and hold (or right-click)&nbsp;<span>Windows PowerShell</span>, then select&nbsp;<span>Run as administrator</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Yes</span>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;At the prompt, type&nbsp;<span>sfc /scannow</span>&nbsp;(note the space between "sfc" and the "/").<br />
Scanning will take a few minutes.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Do one of the following, depending on the results of the scan:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If SFC finds corrupted files and replaces them, restart your PC and see if that improves your PC‚Äôs performance.</li><li>If SFC doesn‚Äôt find corrupted files or finds corrupted files but can‚Äôt replace them, try using the Deployment Image Service and Management Tool (DISM).</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For more info about System File Checker, see&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</span></a>.</p>

            Hello,
<br />This often is due to corrupt/incompatible drivers.
<br />Completely remove the WiFi driver and install the newest copy of it available from the manufacturer:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-hardware/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1?tm=1436753520149">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />As you said it is an insider build, chances that this might be a bug with OS itself. Please file Feedback. I would say another reason for not using Insider build on your primary computer.

            You might be seeing a bug as a result of the Insider Preview. I implore you to send in a bug report to make the Windows Engineers be aware of the problem.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + F to open the Feedback hub then send it in a report.
<br />
<br />Troubleshooting steps you can try:
<br />
<br />    Open Mobile hotspot settings (Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Mobile hotspot)
<br />    Turn on mobile hotspot
<br />    Under "Related Settings", click Change adapter options
<br />    Take note of which adapter is connected to the internet and which adapter is your mobile hotspot (typically named "Local Area Connection* [#]")
<br />    Right click the adapter that is connected to the internet and click Properties
<br />    Go to the Sharing tab
<br />    Uncheck "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection". If it is already unchecked, skip this step.
<br />    Click OK
<br />    Again, open Properties &gt; Sharing for the same adapter.
<br />    Check "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection"
<br />    (If you get a popup that says "Internet Connection Sharing is currently enabled...", click OK.)
<br />    Under "Home networking connection:", select the mobile hotspot adapter
<br />    Click OK
<br />
<br />Open Start then type: regedit
<br />Right click Regedit then click Run as administrator
<br />Navigate to the following registry key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WlanSvc\Parameters\HostedNetworkSettings\
<br />
<br />Delete the following key: 
<br />HostedNetworkSettings
<br />
<br />Restart then try again.
<br />
<br />Run the Network adapter troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Network adapters
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if it works.
<br />
<br />If not, you can try updating both your Network adapter drivers or uninstall them.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand network adapters
<br />Right click your adapter, click uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager then restart
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will re-detect them and reinstall them.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I see that you are facing issues with Free Agent GoFlex. It is not working on your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do not worry! I am here to help.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Quick questions:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Did you check update history to see which updates was failed? Do you know the description of the update which has failed to install?</span>
</li><li><span>When you say "My portable Drive was not working" what exactly happens when the issue occurs?</span>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try the following methods and check for the result.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>As the drive behaves same in other computer as well, most probably there is a problem with the external drive.</span></p>
<p><span>Check with GoFlex Desk to see if there is any firmware update and software update for the hard drive. You may also refer the troubleshooting tab for reference from the below link.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.seagate.com/support/external-hard-drives/desktop-hard-drives/goflex-desk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.seagate.com/support/external-hard-drives/desktop-hard-drives/goflex-desk/</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Additionally you may try the following:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</span></b><span> to check if that detects anything:</span></p>
<p><span>If your computer is having problems with a recently installed device or other hardware, try using the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common issues and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your
 computer was installed correctly. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest running a full scan on the external hard-drive with your anti-virus/anti-malware software and see if you find anything. If needed you can also use the Microsoft Safety Scanner:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope it helps!</span></p>
<p><span>If you need further assistance on this issue or any Windows issue in future let us know.</span></p>

            Hi Armand, my name is Max and I'm an independent advisor.
<br />
<br />I think that the plug and play device driver hasn‚Äôt been automatically installed. I suggest you try to run Windows USB Troubleshooter
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17614/automatically-diagnose-and-fix-windows-usb-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17614/...</a>
<br />
<br />Next option is to try to update USB Controller driver
<br />1. Open the Device Manager
<br />2. Find and click on Universal Serial Bus Controller
<br />3. Right-click on USB Mass Storage Device drivers and choose Uninstall
<br />4. Restart your PC
<br />
<br />Next option is to try to update Windows

    <title>Updates broke my Xbox 360&#33;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> farrider36  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updates broke my Xbox 360&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I own an Xbox One and since you are of course not able to play 360 games on there (wich was just to hard for the engineers to figure out how to to make that happen) I recently started my Xbox 360 to play some GTA5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After my Xbox restarted 9 times and asked for an Update each time finaly GTA 5 started. After the Gta 5 Update i was finaly able to play. (offline!) Yesterday the Xbox hung up every 10 Minutes so i had to shut it off and restart it manually. Today I thought
 I could try it again. Now it restarts automatically every 5 minutes while playing the game. Which makes it impossible to play</p>
<p>Before the Update i could play Gta 5 just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has somebody a solution for this? It would be much apreciated :P&nbsp;</p>

<p>ps.: now i think about it i may have to apologize to the engineers this post may offends :D because i of course know that the responsibilty for that lies clearly within the marketing department ;D money is a big issue in the video game industry :P</p>

<p>Hey there Farrider!</p>
<p>If you still experiencing this issue, are you trying to play off a physical disc version or a digital downloaded version? I would suggest trying out these troubleshooting steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>If you installed GTAV to your Xbox 360 console, uninstall the game. </span>
</li><li><span><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/system/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear your cache</a></span><span>&nbsp;three times.</span>
</li><li><span>Restart your Xbox 360 console.</span> </li><li><span>Download/install GTAV to your console.</span> </li><li><span>Try playing it again.</span> </li></ul>
<p>If those steps don't seem to do the trick, let us know!</p>

                    After the last update I noticed my CPU is always running at 90%. The cause is the process "service host local service (no network) -&gt; window firewall". If I kill or restart it the cpu usage goes back to normal. What can I do? This is very annoying. Thanks.

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>you were right: cause was a driver update on my ATI Radeon HD 4500 automatically done 5 days ago.</p>
<p>I uninstalled it and now everything is back to normal.</p>
<p>I postponed all the updates for one month, hoping they will fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Since my display is fine as it is, may I set "never update this driver"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Claudio:)</p>

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>unfortunately the issue is back.</p>
<p>I'm not so sure if it was really related to the driver update (that is still uninstalled).</p>
<p>I noticed issue appears after a RESTART. If pc is boot from off condition everything works fine. But if i execute a restart, then this is what I see:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/879fc6ad-67ad-46c5-a2e8-4feabf8490de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/879fc6ad-67ad-46c5-a2e8-4feabf8490de" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I restart windows firewall and magically CPU goes back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe2096b6-0cdd-492d-9fc4-067ff4802cdd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe2096b6-0cdd-492d-9fc4-067ff4802cdd" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can clearly understand something is wrong after restart since fan starts to work at high speed even before the login (I have to insert a passwd) and boot after login becomes slow.</p>
<p>What can be the cause? What can i do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Claudio:)</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Claudio</strong>, </p>
<p><br />
This issue may have occurred due to some broken or corrupted system file components. To further assist you with your concern, we recommend that you perform an in-place upgrade using an ISO file to repair any broken system files while keeping your personal files,
 settings, and installed applications. To do this, kindly follow the steps provided by
<strong>PaulSey</strong> in this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-an-in-place-upgrade-with-windows-10/7f0b236e-3c6c-4913-9691-c4baa2a6190a">
<strong>article</strong></a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let us know if the solution above works. <br />

<p>This issue just keeps going on.&nbsp; I had a solution. I would just stop the firewall process, it would restart automatically but not be taking all my CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have just had a forced Windows Update 18 Dec 17. My fix no longer works. Of course I can now rotate 3D models in Powerpoint except I probably will get poor response as I have no CPU use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Diagnosing why this happens the job of an experienced MS System Engineer. It is a tough job and needs someone who can really understand the firewall process and create a proper test environment. That may mean getting a friendly user with the problem run
 some diagnostics and install some changes to isolate the problem.</p>
<p>MS seem too busy fixing other problems!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a related link:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I will boot up my Linux box and stay sane for a while. It may not have the same apps available but at least the people maintaining it are interested in fixing bugs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to remind everyone an undiagnosed bug, that is being worked around, can be having all kinds of other effects and is possibly a security risk. Development processes that do not take bugs and warnings seriously should never be let near confidential or
 critical applications.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Local Disk Drive going missing when returning from Sleep</h2>
                    <p>I have recently moved from a Macbook to a Windows 10 workstation, most things have been splendid, but one issue continues to plague me. &nbsp; The system is built on an Asus ROG Maximux IX Code motherboard and I am using the built-in Intel Raid SATA for photo
 storage on a RAID 1 Mirror Volume. &nbsp;The issue I have is that when the system returns from Sleep my I: drive will be missing from Windows 10. &nbsp;This is the Drive name I have assigned for the RAID1 volume. &nbsp;The Intel Raid Software program continues to show this
 Volume with no issues, it simply disappears as an available drive for Windows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device Manager continues to show the Intel Chipset SATA RAID Controller under the Storage Controller section, but the drive itself under Disk Drives goes away. &nbsp;The only two hints I find in Events Viewer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An error was detected on device \Device\Harddisk1\DR1 during a paging operation.</li><li>Disk 1 has been surprise removed.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to identify the issue, or gather more information that the somewhat generic Events?</p>

Compatibility mode, I guess I could use that on applications I have installed on my PC already, but also I tried to change compatibility of the installation file, the effect was as same as before, installation didn't pass.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>This did not fix the issue. &nbsp;First, I only had one language installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the Language Options settings, it seems to default to the top keyboard layout in the list once unlocked. &nbsp;So if I removed QWERTY and added it so it came after DVORAK, then it was DVORAK upon logging in (even if it was QWERTY when it was locked). &nbsp;If
 QWERTY is first in the list, it is QWERTY upon unlocking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a step back from previous versions of windows and not a good solution for me. &nbsp;I need it to stay what keyboard it was in when locked. &nbsp;It is very un-user friendly to switch based off the order they appear in the language options settings.</p>

<p>If you have a thumb drive with 8 GBs of available space, you can use that to create a bootable copy. Thumb drives are very cheap these days, so pick up a couple and create one as your first backup option. This is especially recommended for persons using
 Ultrabooks, which do not include optical drives (DVD) or Netbooks. There are some desktop systems that do not include one.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Downloading the ISO file</strong></p>
<p>An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank&nbsp;<strong>Dual Layer DVD</strong>&nbsp;or an empty&nbsp;<strong>USB thumb drive</strong>. If you are using Windows
 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Creating a .ISO file</strong></p>

<h2>            Update issues - Windows 10 &#40;NOT UPGRADE ISSUES&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Running Dell XPS 15 64 bit upgrade from Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the issue. About five days ago I went to settings to check for updates. I always manually check in spite of what I see when I click on updates. It went to check and checked for more than an hour. No response. I closed update and continued to work.
 Then checked for updates every day after. If I let it run it takes about two hours to give me an error. Something happened. Please try again. And trying again gives me the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found and ran the Windows Update fixer. It found one issue the first time I ran it. I recognize that tool is for Windows 8.1. Can't find one for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still not updating. Not even Defender updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>RJ</p>

<p>Buenos d√≠as, disculpen tengo una enorme duda con respecto a los dlc de skyrim&nbsp;</p>
<p>si digamos tengo el skyrim en espa√±ol e instalo los dlc desde la edici√≥n legendaria ( s√≥lo los dlc ya que el juego lo tengo en digital y espa√±ol )&nbsp;</p>
<p>los dlc se pueden subtitular en espa√±ol al menos? O vienen completamente en ingl√©s a√∫n teniendo el juego en espa√±ol?</p>

<p>Saludos y gracias&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi kushalpankhania,<br />
<br />
<span>AVI is included in the supported video files of Windows Live Movie Maker, please check the supported file types in this
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/movie-maker-file-types-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. What we can do is to ensure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio files</span><span>
 - Audio and <span>Video</span> require codecs to play the file and it‚Äôs important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
‚Ä¢ Try running the Microsoft <span>FixIt</span> tool for codecs:
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/</span></a></span><span><br />
<br />
‚Ä¢ <strong><span>Media info</span></strong> will be able to identify any issues with missing or faulty codecs and whether it‚Äôs already installed in your computer or not. You can get it at&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en</span></a></span><span>
<br />
<br />
<b>Note</b>: If you can't find the codec you need, you may convert the video to a supported format (<span>eg</span>.
<span>wmv</span>) and then add it to your Windows Live Movie Maker project. You can follow the suggestiong of Volunteer J.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Gerard G.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I just bought an Asus Zenbook Pro UX501VW-DS71T, and I'm trying to set up an ad-hoc wifi network for Windows 10.&nbsp; I have read that I need to install the MS Virtual Wifi Miniport Adapter.&nbsp; When I tried doing it, it gave a warning...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing the device driver is not recommended because Windows cannot verify that it is compatible with your hardware...etc.</p>
<p>
