            I believe that your region and store need to be set to the same region (although I may be wrong), to be honest MS Billing Support will be able to best assist on this issue 😀

<div>
<div>I am going to say everything I did and I ordered it, I will not know it in the VPN and I will make it clear because I used it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>the first thing was to buy the argentine currency that my uncle in Argentina bought for me and I would enter the money in euros to him.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>the second was to exchange it in the xbox to put everything in Argentina thing that if I leave, and then look for the games in question and automatically did not let me, why let me exchange money and not games? I have no idea.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>the third thing was to call the support yesterday for the first time, he told me to change everything to Argentina including my live xbox account I passed the link and I did it,</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>the fourth I realized that everything I did was worth nothing and call back support, this man told me that I had to go to Argentina or if I knew someone or family that did me the favor, I said that if I had to a family member, I told him that if I could
 use a VPN system so as not to disturb my uncle who does not understand much of this, he told me that if he wanted me to do it (that is why I use a VPN service, I have recorded them by luck. I do it in case strange things happen)</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>the fifth to use VPN and see that it was worth nothing as if it was not using it or is that the VPN service is very bad and not worth anything that is more likely, it was free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the sixth and last I gave up sleeping and this morning I called the support telling him all this including the VPN and tell me that I should not fail to use my uncle my account in Argentina and that I waited 24 hours for my location to change what could
 take, that will erase all that outside of Europe as a credit card and all those things that I already had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>post data in no time I changed my information where I live, I only made the change that the support told me to do, mainly because it only says that I live in Spain and now Argentina is the only change made and one of the support told me what if you should
 know all the policies and what should be done and not</p>

<p>Well as the others mentioned</p>
<p>Buying things out of region doesnt work as curremcy is region LOCKED and can cause issues like the ones you stated</p>
<p>Thats WHY its never recommendex</p>
<p>You. Can change the location in your console with a valid billing info</p>
<p>however this doesnt work for xbox 360 games as it is region locked and vpns arent allowed period</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since they do cause issues</p>
<p>Like incomplete downloads&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your best bet is to have your uncle use a etailer from your own region&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is not correct. Xbox One is NOT region locked and since my country Romania doesn't have Xbox Live officially, we are forced to have an account on whatever country we want. And this is official.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, i had a US account, but they locked down US for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Then, i migrated to UK, but unfortunately the prices are higher than any other region so i migrated to the Argentina store.</p>
<p>From there, i was able to buy with my Romanian card, without a VPN for a couple of months until a few days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I talked to somebody from xbox support and they told me to change my region back to UK and this is not correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i don't have an official store in my country, you can't just push me around however you like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not stealing anything. Are my money not good enough?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You want me to buy from my own country, this means to sell my Xbox and only use the PS4, as there is local Playstation Store in Romania.</p>

            There should be one region selected at a time, you can also switch Country Regions once a year. That would be possible if you'd go to your Xbox settings or website.

                    <p>Hallo zusammen, </p>
<p>seit gestern zeigt mein PC ständig diese Meldung an, ich habe jetzt ungefähr 100 andere Foren und/oder Beiträge gelesen, aber aufgrund mangelnder Kentnisse verstehe ich die Hälfte nicht, oder das Problem war schnell anders als meins. Also bitte: Hilfe!</p>
<p>Das hier ist schonmal ein screenshot der Einstellungen &gt; Aktivierung:</p>

<p>Einen Product Key habe ich nirgends und Windows 10 Pro war bereits bei Kauf des PCs installiert, es handelt sich also nicht um die Version, die man als Update von Win 8 o.ä. selbst herunterladen konnte...</p>

            Hallo NineM,
<br />vielen Dank für deine Anfrage. Ich bin Marcel und Unabhängiger Berater der Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />Sieht so aus als hättest du ne Firmenlizenz die abgelaufen ist oder ne Studentenversion die abgelaufen ist.
<br />
<br />Hast du den PC komplett so mit Windows drauf neu gekauft / war es vorinstalliert ?
<br />Wenn ja dann direkt an der Hersteller wenden damit er dir nen passenden Schlüssel schickt. An sonsten bleibt nur neuen Key Kaufen im Windows Store.
<br />
<br />Meistens passiert sowas wenn der Installationskey auf meheren Geräten verwendet wird.
<br />
<br />schau mal hier:<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/help/12440/windows-10-activation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/help/12440/...</a>

<br />Ich hoffe ich konnte dir ein bissel helfen

<br />Dein Windows wurde mit einer Volumenlizenz aktiviert, die eigentlich nur für Firmenkunden gedacht ist, 
<br />Weißt du vielleicht noch bei wem du den Laptop gekauft hast und kannst dich an das Geschäft wenden? Die müssten da mehr wissen.

<h2>            CPU usage time running fast</h2>
                    <p>i have been searching all over on the fourms hoping i find an answer and also so i dont double post a question someone already asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i turned on my PC at 8:30 when i got home from work and i looked and its 12:30 now. only 4 hours apart. i noticed my cpu usage time for my "system idle process"&nbsp;show&nbsp;its been running for 30hours. 7.5 times faster.&nbsp;i was wondering why might that be calculating
 and reporting&nbsp;processes running&nbsp;longer than they have been. my normal clock works fine its just in the task manager cpu usage time. any ideas?</p>
<p>im running windows 7 64bit. all windows&nbsp;updates installed. if needed i can give out more info about hardware.</p>

    <title>windows 8 suddenly wants permission to delete files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevef48&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 8 suddenly wants permission to delete files</h2>
                    Yesterday Adobe Lightroom displayed a message stating that there was a problem with its catalog. The solution, given on the Adobe Forums, is to run it as administrator. I tried it, it's pain in the neck, but it cured my problem. I now have to remember
 to run the program as administrator EVERY time.<br />
Today Windows 8 asked for permission to delete some files. Just ordinary image files in My Pictures.<br />
Why has this happened? I assume that Microsoft have quietly updated something without my knowledge (Windows Update doesn't appear when I run a search) and have broken Windows (Again!).<br />
I have to say that I am not impressed with Windows 8, for the following reasons:<br />
A) It was advertised as being the fastest Windows to start up. It isn't! The desktop rapidly appears, but then Windows inspects its navel for several minutes before it will let me do anything.<br />
B) Wireless networking has reverted to the same mess as existed in Vista. My new Windows 8 laptop frequently informs me that I can't access the internet. It has a strong wireless signal, but Windows refuses to connect to my network. The trouble-shooter even
 states that my hardware in incompatible with this network, if I bother to run it. Usually I can persuade it to see the error of its ways by disconnecting/reconnecting until it works.<br />
None of the above are show stoppers, but they all mean extra stress and reduced productivity, and shouldn't occur in a 21`st century OS.<br />
How do I stop Windows 8 asking for permission everytime I want to run a program, or delete a file?<br />

            Hello SteveF48(2),
<div><br />
<div>It is normal for Windows to ask if you are sure you want to delete the program. This is so you do not accidentally delete a file you want or need. It is also normal for Windows to ask for permission if you want to run a program. You can stop this by unchecking
 the box that says,"Always ask before opening this file." Some programs do not have this option so Windows has to always ask for permission before opening that specific program.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sincerely,</div>
<div>Bryan</div>

            I've been using Windows since 1988, believe me there is nothing 'normal' about Windows 8's behaviour.<br />
It isn't asking whether I am sure that I want to delete the files, it's demanding permission. This is new and bizarre, no other version has done this and Windows 8 didn't until Friday.<br />
The same with software, programs that have been running perfectly for the last couple of months, since I bought the laptop, now don't run unless I grant permission.<br />

<p><strong>&nbsp;The error:</strong></p>

<p>This device cannot start. (Code 10)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click 'Check for solutions' to send data about this device to Microsoft and to see if there is a solution available. (when I do this the error is that the driver can not be loaded)</p>

We can't help with undeleting unless you explain how and where this deletion took place. How did you go about 'deleting' your account, and where from?

<li>You can <em>close</em> an @live.com.au account by&nbsp;following the instructions on this page:

    <title>Uneven deadzones on my Xbox one controller&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pickymetal6  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uneven deadzones on my Xbox one controller&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, it seems my Xbox one controller's left thumbstick has uneven deadzones. Basically, I have to push the left thumbstick in the left direction a bit more (but not too much) in order to make the console register the input. This doesn't happen when I push
 the left thumbstick in the right direction (that seems to be normal). It's a brand new controller. Is this normal?</p>

<p>If it's new and not working right then take it back to the place that sold it and have it replaced.</p>
<p>You could try updating the controller first, but if it still doesn't work, take it back quickly to have it replaced.</p>

<p>Well, the controller is from Halo 5 Limited edition xbox one console bundle. That bundle was the very last they had in stock, and the retailer doesn't sell Halo 5 xbox one wireless separately. Guess I'm ***, but thanks anyway.</p>

<p>Dear Rose,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply but this doesn't work. Still the same error immediately after the reboot required by the&nbsp;KB4032188 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened six times.&nbsp;Surely, it must happen to everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a virtual machine, I have also tried Manual, Automatic and Disabled. Same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Same here on 3 machines, it happens after installation of KB 4032188.</p>
<p>A heap corruption occurs, Exception Code:<span> </span>c0000374, nothing you can do unless Microsoft provide a fix in a future update.</p>
<p>It happens only once, subsequent reboots no longer produce this critical event.</p>
<p>Dism Online &amp; sfc scan both&nbsp;come back clean.</p>
<p>I've already made a post here too:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/windows-updates-activation/90516-kb-4032188-issue.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>This issue can be fixed temporarily by pressing Alt + Ctrl + Del going to task manager and restarting explorer.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that allows login but it only occurs after larger updates. MS should patch.</p>

<h3> greg keeler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installshield error 5006 &#58;0x8007b7</h2>
                    I have encountered this error while trying to install the same software on two different computers, both running Windows 7 64-bit.&nbsp; I had previously installed this software on other computers, both Windows XP and Windows 7, and did not have a problem.&nbsp;
 I contacted the vendor and was advised they really didn't have an answer.&nbsp; After doing some digging, several sources advised to delete all files in the Temp folder, delete the Installshield and Installshield Information folders, and disable startup items.&nbsp;
 I did all of those things to no avail.&nbsp; I was finally able to successfully install the software on my desktop, but I'm not sure why it worked.&nbsp; Just prior to the successful installation my automatic updates installed an update - not sure if that was the solution.&nbsp;
 I still cannot get the software to load on my notebook computer (Win 7 64).&nbsp; HELP!!

</p><p>Be aware, however, that System Restore is intended to restore the "system" and not your personal files and data (although there may well be earlier versions of your files available by using the "Previous Versions" feature:
<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/56891/use-windows-7s-previous-versions-to-go-back-in-time-and-save-your-files/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.howtogeek.com/56891/use-windows-7s-previous-versions-to-go-back-in-time-and-save-your-files/</a>).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can only "go back" to System Restore Points that had been previously created.&nbsp; That is, you can't go back to any arbitrary time.&nbsp; If there's no System Restore point for some particular time, you can't now create one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, it's not a good idea to use System Restore to go back more than about a week or so, depending on what's been happening to your system during the interval.&nbsp; System Restore in Windows 7 is better than it used to be about warning you what may happen
 to installed programs if you go back in time using System Restore.</p>

            <p>Hello Abel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your issue on Microsoft Community Forum. I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you logged in as an <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-do-I-log-on-as-an-administrator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>Teredo is a tunneling protocol designed to grant IPv6 connectivity to nodes that are located behind IPv6-unaware NAT (Network address translation) devices. It</span><span>&nbsp;is installed by default and enabled so that it remains in a standby mode and
 comes into action only when required. This is typically when you install an application that needs Teredo to function properly. The main problem with Teredo is that it involves a bit of heavy-duty work, and if it is switched on unnecessarily, it might slow
 down your network connection.</span> So, I would suggest you to try the following steps and check&nbsp;if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong><strong><span><span>Update the driver for Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adaptor:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Open Device Manager by clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button, clicking
<strong>Control</strong> <strong>Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>System and Maintenance</strong>, and then clicking
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.‌<br />
b.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
</span><span>c. Look for "Teredo Tunneling Pseudo-Interface" (under <strong>Network Adapters</strong>), right click on it and select
<strong>Update Driver Software...</strong><br />
</span><span>d. Reboot the computer and check for the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue exists, try the next method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2: </strong></span>Let’s disable and re-enable IPv6, that should make a difference as it has helped many users facing this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disable IPv6:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try uninstalling IPv6 on all interfaces. To remove IPv6, </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click on <strong>Start</strong> and type in <strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Local Area Network.</strong></span></li><li><span>Go into the properties for <em>each </em>network adapter.</span></li><li><span>Either uncheck the box next to the protocol "Internet Protocol version 6(TCP/IPv6), that will disable it, or select it and click uninstall, which will remove it off the computer.</span></li><li><span>Restart the computer.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><strong>NOTE: </strong>You should do this for each network connection.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Re-enable the IPV6: </span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Follow steps 1-3 given above and then follow the given below steps.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Place a Check mark or select Install and install the IPV6.</span></li><li><span>Restart the computer.</span></li></ul>
<p><span><strong>Additional Information:</strong></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>The issue related to Bluetooth Peripheral Device with exclamation mark, I would suggest&nbsp;you to follow the steps below and check.</p>
<p>
</p><div>1. Go to <strong>Start</strong> menu type <strong>device manager</strong> and open it.</div>
<div>2.&nbsp;You can see Bluetooth peripheral device driver, right click on it and select update driver.</div>
<div>3. Select the option "<strong>Browse my computer for driver software</strong>".</div>
<div>4. Then click on "<strong>Let me pick from a list of device drivers for my computer</strong>".</div>
<div>5. Then select "<strong>Bluetooth Radios</strong>" from the list.</div>
<div>6. Now you will get list of manufacturers and corresponding model, select "<strong>Microsoft</strong>" from manufacturer.</div>
<div>
<p>7. Click "<strong>Next</strong>". If any warning message appears click "<strong>Y</strong><strong>es</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart the computer and check.</p>

    <title>Ban Hammer Rant. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ban Hammer Rant.</h2>
                    
<p>Am I the only one that hates how the banning system&nbsp;operates in Halo:reach? I get temporarily banned for leaving a few games here and there because of trolls. But some 13 year old **** can drive me off a cliff 50+ times in rocket race and get away with
 it? It seems people are just putting down&nbsp;the controller when they're in a game they don't wanna play. I'd rather be down 1 or 2 people that quit then just have a random lone spartan standing out in the open waiting to be shot.<br />
<br />
This is my opinion,&nbsp;don't whinge about it.<br />

I also noticed that before my reputation took a massive hit in one month, players are reporting me for literally no reason other than to keep me reputation status in the negative (I get like 3 reports a month now for random things as opposed to going a year without a single report).

    <title>Add to list of words to handwriting dictionary&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ari d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add to list of words to handwriting dictionary&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Is it possible to add a list of words to the tablet input panel (TIP) handwriting recognition dictionary?</p>
<p>For example, is there a way to put the words from the dictionary that MS office uses (custom.dic) into the TIP dictionary?<br />
I ask because I'm a student and the TIP doesn't recognize a lot of the specialized terms I use and I don't want to have to add them manually one at a time. I believe that the recognition is attempting to "recognize" words that it finds in its dictionary.<br />
I know that I can add one word at a time by writing the word, tapping above it, and choosing "Add [the word] to the handwriting dictionary" from the dropdown menu.<br />
Does anyone know where this dictionary is located? How can I add a list of words to that dictionary?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Ari</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You might need to download and install the Dictionary tool from the link given below and check if that helps you accomplish what
 you want.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You might need to install the software in compatibility mode as that tool is meant for Windows XP.</span></span></span></p>

    <title>Windows 7 driver for scanjet 3300C - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> welchs101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 driver for scanjet 3300C</h2>
                    
<p>I ran the windows 7 compatability checker provided by microsoft on my dads computer.&nbsp; For the 3300C scanner&nbsp; the compatability checker said the following:</p>
<p>****************************************************</p>
<div>
<p>The manufacturer provides software to use this device on Windows 7.</p>
<p><a href="http://ftp.hp.com/pub/scanners/software/sj650en.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Get the software for free from the manufacturer's website</span></a></p>
<p>****************************************************</p>
<p>The problem is when i go to the HP website there is no listing for windows 7 for this scanjet 3300C.&nbsp;&nbsp; The compatability checker says there is....and even provides a file but HP says there is not.&nbsp; Obviously i will try the file provided by the compatability
 checker once i go to my dads and give him the computer but right now i cant since i am in NC and he is in FL.</p>
<p>Why would the compatability checker say one thing and microsoft say something else.....especially that there is a driver when it sounds like there is not.</p>

<p>Because Compatibility checker is not infalable, the only real way to check wether hw is supported under win7 is to visit the hw makers site, and as you know HP doesnt produce a win7 driver, therefore your scanner is not going to work.</p>
<p>Sometimes hw makers produce a Vista driver and generally if they do the vista driver may work, but in your case the latest driver supplied was for winXp.</p>
<p>In some cases win7 has built in drivers which provide some functionality, but for your model scanner there are none</p>
<p>You will have to buy a new scanner, or all in one device</p>
<p>PS If you have a big brand PC, you have checked their site to see whether win7 drivers are available for your model?</p>
