            <p>Hi Gina,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community and we are happy to help you.</p>
<p><br />
As per the query description, it seems like the game stops while playing games such as Mahjong Titans and the mouse freezes while playing solitaire on the computer. There are also pop-ups showing up while playing solitaire game.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to gather few information on this issue to help you better:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) How are you trying to play the game ‚ÄòMahjong Titans‚Äô on the computer? Is it online?<br />
2) Did you download both the games from the Windows 8 app store? <br />
3) Are you having issues while playing any other games on the computer?</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>It could be an issue with the games that you have downloaded from the app store.
</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have downloaded both the games from app store, I would suggest you to uninstall and then, reinstall the game on the computer.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can refer to the link to uninstall the game and then reinstall:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúWhat to do if you have problems with an app:‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the section <strong>‚ÄúReinstall the app‚Äù<br />
</strong><br />

</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also like to inform you that the pop-ups that you get while playing solitaire are designed to easily access options and to experience different features such as Review, upgrade, rules etc on the game.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are playing the game online on Internet Explorer, then, it could be an issue with the ActiveX Filtering or Tracking Protection settings on Internet Explorer.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using ActiveX Filtering or Tracking Protection, some content like games or videos might be disabled.<br />
</p>
<p>I would suggest you to turn off ActiveX Filtering for the website and then try to play the game.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs how to turn off ActiveX Filtering for a certain website:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>‚Äú<strong>Use ActiveX controls</strong>‚Äù</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the section ‚Äú<strong>Turn off ActiveX Filtering for individual sites‚Äù</strong></p>
<strong>

<p>I don't understand what your post has to do with your subject line. The CiceroUIWindframe error has nothing to do with hardware.
<span>This error is caused by the "Speech and Handwriting Recognition" feature of MS Office. You can turn this feature off by going to the Add/Remove Programs applet in Control Panel. Click on the entry for MS Office and then on "Change".
 Browse to "Office Shared Features," "Alternative User Input," and make Speech and Handwriting Recognition (both) "Not available" from the drop-down box.</span></p>
<p><span>Please clarify your issue.<br />

            Hi Cymbal.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would manually upgrade to the latest version 1903 by opening the Media Creation Tool from this link:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>, choose Download Tool Now, then open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now.   This saves your files, apps and most settings in place, is the most stable method to change versions, brings your Updates current, resolves most problems.
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the Version has problems I will work with you to try to resolve them. If the problems are intractable, you have ten days to roll it back in Recovery settings.  
<br />
<br />Most problems are resolved by doing this gold standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> . So read it over and see if its something you want to learn to do. 
<br />  
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Updating to the latest feature update 1903, should resolve this.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

<h2>            External Hard Drive problem Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>I am getting a serious problem with my Xbox One S since the latest insiders update. As soon as i connect my external Hard Drive&nbsp;(Western Digital&nbsp;MyBook 3TB)&nbsp;which has always worked, and i am sure is working now too, the Xbox instantly shuts down. I have tried everything that goes from a factory reset to playing with the power cord. I&nbsp;also have tried many solutions since i have already contacted Xbox Support on Twitter, since now i only received useless solution. Don't tell me the Hard Drive is not working since it is, it powers on correctly and i am sure there's data on it, also, it can't broke without a reason from one day to another. So i am here waiting for a response, thank you.</p>

<h2>            can&#39;t change windows default apps after last update in windows 10</h2>
                    After your last update or upgrade in Windows 10, all my setting has changed and I can't change window applications. For example, there is nothing for doc document. I can't assign Word 2016 for doc type documents. Also Word 2016 and excel 2016 don't appear
 in my default programs. I can't&nbsp; set them as defaults. Also after installations, all my files have gone! I found last upgrade quite unsuccessful.&nbsp;

            That's my point! I made no changes whatsover. After the update and subsequent restart. I received 21 messages stating "An app default was reset". It appears the update made changes that I didn't want, need, request or allow.<br />

    <title>ReadyBoost on a 8GB RAM laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pavel sovi‰çka  say:</h3>
<h2>            ReadyBoost on a 8GB RAM laptop</h2>
                    <p>Greetings</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop with a 5 400rpm HDD and 8 GB of RAM. During my work, the "All CPU meter" app often shows as much as 2 GB on the pagefile while the RAM stays above 6 GB, sometimes gtting up to 7.5 GB. Unfortunetally buying an SSD or upgrading RAM is not a
 possibility. I have started thinking about using ReadyBoost with an SDHC card, as I dont use SD slot and it could stay connected all the time. I have tried to do some research on the internet and found many saying that ReadyBoost is useless for system above
 4 GB of RAM, while other say that ReadyBoost is useful when the system is starved of RAM and has a slow HDD, which is my case. Unfortunetally I dont have a SD card and none of my USB drives passed the ReadyBoost tests so I could not verify if it helps. Before
 I buy some SDHC card supporting ReadyBoost, I wanted to ask for your experience with this function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any advice</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Thx for your reply. Unfortunetally I have the machine assigned to me as is without the option of doing any modifications. The ReadyBoost feature seems like a cheap workaround that can help a bit, through Im not expecting 16GB/SSD level of performance of
 course. Too bad you replied soo late, I would have been more confident when shopping, still the info you provided is a confirmation it could work that I concluded after many hours of reading online articles.<br />
So I decided to use my spare 6 year old laptop (which is even worse sporting 4GB of RAM only and a slower HDD) and bought a cheap Sandisk SDHC UHC-1 16GB for 10 euros. If ReadyBoost could work on a machine with larger than 2 GB RAM it was with this machine
 and 10 euros isnt that much to sacrifise if it backfires. I would like to share my findings in case someone comes to the same question. The machine has a fairly fresh install of W7 with all update.<br />
<br />
My testing methodology went as this: I have measured the time to start Windows with few checkpoints and after the disk began idling, I opened chrome and measured that. I repeated this several times and in the middle i have thrown Word 2016 and CodeWarrior 11.0
 (as the only over 1 GB application in that machine right now). Of course closign and opening the application while it was in RAM was stellar, so each time I have turned off the laptop. After 4 ReadyBoost measurements I have taken out the card and did one start
 without it and than insterted it again to pickup where I have ended. This was to verify that the time differences were actually ReadyBoost related. The results with ReadyBoost are marked "(R)" and all results are in seconds (or minutes:seconds) format and
 for the specific measurement are ordered chronologicaly. So without further texting:<br />
<br />
From button push to login screen:<br />
45,2/(R)45,3/(R)38,8/(R)38,1/(R)38,1/37,7/(R)37,5/(R)35,7<br />
The second test without RapidBoost was similar to the ReadyBoosts so I would say no improvement.<br />
<br />
From button push to icons displayed on screen:<br />
1:59,6/(R)1:51,2/(R)2:36,8/(R)1:43,8/(R)1:31,6/2:27,8/(R)2:25,9/(R)2:29,7<br />
A similar story here, arguably sometimes it helps but cannot be relied on.<br />
<br />
From button push to HDD LED going off:<br />
7:41,7/(R)over 15min/((R)over 15min/(R)14:55,7/(R)6:48,9/8:10,9/(R)over 15min/(R)over 15min<br />
Didnt expect this, but on first look massive slowdown with ReadyBoost. But when inspecting this I found the laptop to be responsive without any issues. Possibly the SuperFetch was doing some ReadyBoost related caching?<br />
<br />
Chrome from icon doubleclick to taskbar idling:<br />
20/(R)5,8/(R)4,6/(R)3,7/(R)3,8/21,6/(R)3,9/(R)3,5<br />
First application tested and WOW this was unexpected. From 20seconds to under 4s improvement! First good message. And the values were achieved repeatedly, suggesting this wasnt a fluke.<br />
<br />
Word 2016 from icon doubleclick to "select document" page (or what is the name):<br />
(R)17,6/(R)15,4/18,8/(R)16,4/(R)15,5<br />
As I said, added midtest. Not much to look at, statistically it did started faster but nothing noticable.<br />
<br />
CodeWarrior 11.0:<br />
(R)47,7/(R)36,5/1:02,1/(R)24,6/(R)19,0<br />
Another big improvement, arguably less then half load times.<br />
<br />
Starting Windows few times and than 3 applications on one machine is hardly a significant study, but from the results I can conclude, that ReadyBoost can help even on a 4 GB RAM machine, although it depends on specific use case. Also performance during startup
 is inconsistent at best and could actually increase booting time. Than again, how often do you boot and how often you open applications? For 10 Euros I think its worth it. I would not go into a faster more expensive card and certainly not into a bigger card
 given that Performance Manager shows the drive being used for roughly 1.2 GB so far. A more expensive SD card would be pushing into low-end SSD territory. Last note: I did all tests with disconnected internet to prevent random updates.<br />
<br />
In the end, I had to create my own answer, but at least it was somewhat fun and I hope it helps someone in the future.</p>

<h2>            Network discovery will not turn on in Vista. When I try to reset it, it will only accept custom option</h2>
                    I am trying to get Network discovery to be on the&nbsp;<strong>on</strong> option, as I think this is preventing discovery of bluetooth devices.&nbsp;There&nbsp;is no devices listed&nbsp;when I check bluetooth&nbsp;devices in Control Panel.&nbsp;When I open the options, click on the&nbsp;<strong>on</strong>
 option, then close the options box, it defaults to the&nbsp;<strong>custom</strong> option. I have checked the appropriate Services suggested such as SSDP, UPnP, Bluetooth services and Bluetooth support. They are all started.

<p>Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Did you make any changes prior to the issue?<br />
2. What network location type have to chosen? Is it Home, Work or Public?</p>
<p>Based on the network location you choose, Windows assigns a network discovery state to the network and opens the appropriate Windows Firewall ports for that state.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> We recommend you to check if the network discovery items are enabled in Windows Firewall. To do this, try these steps.<br />
1. Click Start, type firewall and click on Windows Firewall with advanced security.<br />
2. Click inbound rules in the left pane and enable Network Discovery (SSDP-In) and Network Discovery (UPnP-In) from the list.<br />
3. Click Outbound rules in the left pane and enable Network Discovery (SSDP-Out) and Network Discovery (UPnP-Out) from the list.<br />
4. Apply the changes and check the result.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For more information on network discovery, check this link: <br />

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Check for the status of the following services: Computer Browser, TCP/IP NetBios Helper.<br />
1. Click Start, type services.msc and hit enter.<br />
2. From the list of services, double click on Computer Browser and TCP/IP NetBios Helper service.<br />
3. Change the startup type to automatic and start the services.<br />
4. Apply the changes.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Try the steps and post back the results, so that we can assist you further.<br />

<p>The network location is Private. The only other option is Public.</p>
<p>I have checked all of these areas and they are all set to enable or automatic start. I still can't set network discovery to on. It defaults to Custom option. The reason I am trying to change this network discovery option is that I am unable to get my laptop
 to recognize bluetooth devices, in particular my mobile phone. The phone can see the computer, but the computer can't see any devices. There are no options to add any devices, so I am guessing that the computer has a setting that is not allowing it to see
 any devices.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try to turn on network discovery by disabling all the non Microsoft services and see if it works. To do this, follow these steps.<br />
Visit the following article and follow the given steps: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</a><br />
1. Follow "Step 1: Perform a clean boot" to disable all the non Microsoft services, restart the computer and check if the issue still persists.<br />
2. If the issue does not persist in clean boot, try "Step 2: Enable half of the services" to "Step 6: Resolve the problem" to find what's causing the issue. Once you find the culprit, uninstall it.<br />
3. Follow "Step 7: Reset the computer to start as usual"</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To troubleshoot problems with Bluetooth enabled devices, there are several things to try:<br />
1. Remove and then reinstall the device.<br />
2. Make sure the device is turned on and that the batteries don't need to be replaced.<br />
3. Make sure the Bluetooth adapter for your computer is attached and turned on, and that the device is turned on and discoverable. If you're not sure how to turn on discoverability, read the instructions that came with the device or check the manufacturer's
 website.<br />
4. Make sure that you installed the device using the correct program. If not, reinstall the device.<br />
5. Make sure Windows is configured to accept incoming Bluetooth connections.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Check this link for more information: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-problems-with-Bluetooth-enabled-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Syed, I have done a clean boot, tried troubleshooting in safe mode, and all other suggestions that you listed in your last reply. I still have no recognition that any bluetooth devices are trying to pair with this computer. I have 3 other computers on my
 network. 2 with Win XP and 1 with Win 7. The bluetooth adapter works fine with all of them. Other than a possible complete re-install, do you have any other suggestions? The network discovery&nbsp;was just one area of troubleshooting that I was trying to solve
 to get the bluetooth device to be recognized.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi all with this problem.&nbsp; I have spent the last 3 days Googling this myself as my PC was not sharing with my Xbox, mobile phone, Kodak photo frame etc and&nbsp;have followed all the given&nbsp;instructions&nbsp;but could still not get network discovery to turn on.&nbsp; I
 then found a free program called PC Fixer, downloaded it, ran it and, hey presto, my network discovery is perfectly ok now and sharing with everything again.&nbsp; You can download it from this link<a href="http://www.digitalsupporttech.com/en-us/download.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.digitalsupporttech.com/en-us/download.htm</a>.&nbsp;
 I don't know what it did but it worked!&nbsp; Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having the same problem since I removed McAfee IS trial version.I am unable turn on my firewall at all. I am waiting for a response to that issue also as I do not have the Windows firewall option in my services menu in order to restart. As it stands
 it would appear that I have no firewall in place but network discovery stills reverts back to off when I save changes. Any ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I have this same problem. Here a couple more details on what happens and what I can do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to log in normally. Those screens display fine, but I get the blank screen with mouse after login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I hit ctrl+alt+delete the usual options show up, and I can sign out or lock but if I click task manager it thinks for a second and resumes the black screen with mouse. After hitting ctrl+alt+delete I can use the icons in the lower right (Connect to
 Internet, Ease of Access, Shut Down) without trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No other keyboard shortcuts seems to work (windows+x, windows+r, function F9, etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to force a safe mode start by turning off during start up three times, which just gave me the black screen straight away instead of bringing me to the log-in page.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue, but I fixed it by doing these steps: (My English is very bad, sorry about that)</p>
<p>1. Turn on your computer, open&nbsp;Control Panel (or press&nbsp;Windows + X) &gt; Power Options &gt; Choose what the power button does &gt; Change settings that are currently unavailable. If asked, provide administrator permission or password.&nbsp;<span>Uncheck&nbsp;Turn on fast startup
 (recommended), and then shut down your PC.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Do the same as above, but this time check Turn on fast startup (recommended),
</span>and then shut down your PC.</p>
<p><span>3. Boot it again to see result.</span></p>

            <p>I do not know tooo much about computer operating problems, just enough to be dangerous.&nbsp; I have been having the freezing problem randomly and I would say mostly on shut down and the only way to get a shut down was to pull the power plug for about 15 0r 20
 seconds and then restart, then everything clears up for awhile then we start the game over.&nbsp; I have tried all the fixes that I could find and nothing really worked.&nbsp; My comp. is a HP all in one touch screen ASUS 1900 dual band router&nbsp; and a surfboard modem
 3doc and Epson printer and they are all Ethernet wired to the router on the 5 gh band and the rest of my equipment is on the 2.4&nbsp; except the smart TV in the &nbsp;other side of the house and that is on the 5 gh band wirelessly.&nbsp; To shorten up the story, and just
 on a whim I changed all the Ethernet cables to cat 7 and to my surprise I have had no freezing or slow response since the and the data and print response has significantly I'm[proved.&nbsp; I don't know if this is coincidence or what but everything is working much
 better with no random freezing in the last few weeks where before it was 2 or 3 times week.&nbsp; Just for info as I said I am no genius with programs.</p>

                    091113-39218-01.dmp sysdata.xml WERInternalMetadata.xml I had a blue screen (these files are "files that help describe the problem" in the action center's Problem Detalis) while browsing the internet - I had a large amount of windows and processes running,
 which could have caused the blue screen. I'm unsure. I saw someone who had a similar problem and then gave his minidump files. I'm not sure what do to make sure it doesn't happen again. I also have updates to Windows that I will do promptly.

If I do, that will give me two .dmp files - correct?<br />

If that happens, I will zip them up and use skydrive.

            Hello, I have this same problem on my windows 7 build 7601 laptop. I do not use SkyDrive, but I have a link to Google Drive that leads to a compressed copy of the file that you can examine.
<div><br />
<div>Here is the link:</div>
<div><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1E1YoFr3EN_d2NHQ3Q4Sm5PNTA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1E1YoFr3EN_d2NHQ3Q4Sm5PNTA/edit?usp=sharing</a><br />
<div><br />
<div>This link should lead directly to Minidump.zip file, and I'd like to see what you can make of this because this file:</div>
<div>sysdata.xml (no link)</div>
<div>is constantly showing up as a reason for the shutdown. Does <b>1033 </b>for a locale make sense to you?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please get back to me ASAP, because this just happened yesterday.</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#8217;t boot</h2>
                    <p>It seems like windows 10 is in a boot loop where when i turn it on it will freeze. Then manually restart and it will freeze and guve me a stopcode and automatically restart. After that it will try to repair itself and freeze(sometimes giving me a stopcode,
 but not all the time). This just keeps going in a cycle, would really appricate the help.</p>

<p>Hi Tanner,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to properly isolate the looping issue with your Windows 10, we would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Were there any changes made on your computer prior to the issue (e.g., updates, software installation)?</span></span></li><li>To make sure that we have not missed on anything, what troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><br />
For possible resolution, we suggest that you follow the Startup Repair steps below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp;Turn off your computer.</li><li>&nbsp;Turn on your computer. As soon as you see the <strong>Windows logo with the spinning dots</strong>, press and hold down the power button until your computer turns off. Do this process
<strong>twice</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Turn on your computer for the third time, and let it load.</li><li>&nbsp;It should give you the message: <strong>Preparing Automatic Repair</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;On the next screen that would appear, click on <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Go to <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Click on <strong>Startup Repair</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Wait for the repair to finish.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>This is obviously not a problem with Skype for Windows, or the operating system. I just found out about this 'feature' when Skyping with my daughter, who uses Skype for Mac. My one-year-old grandson taught us that hitting the spacebar would hang up our conversation.&nbsp;
 I think this is a 'feature' of Skype, not something that can be corrected by reinstalling. There needs to be a way to disable this!</p>

            <p>BTW<br />
</p>
<p>Since I can't install software, I can't solve the error 1603, but i believe that if we'll solve the admin issue, them it will solve the error 1603 issue.<br />

</p><p>It would be better for us to know what is your issue logging in as administrator.<br />
</p>
<p>Surely, Windows give you a message why you can't log in. What is the error message?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Unfortunately, there is no way to use the camera on your phone and have it display on your computer screen as this will not be recognized by Skype.

<h2>            SYSTEM PTE MISUSE</h2>
                    <p>I recently tried to update my AMD drivers on my laptop. During the installation of the software that checks for outdated drivers I got the black screen. Upon resetting, my computer never got past the windows logo. I tried a previous restore point which gave
 an error. It wont start in safe mode. It wont start from windows 10 on a usb. It recently started just giving the error SYSTEM PTE MISUSE<br />
Im on an HP Pavilion Notebook<br />
