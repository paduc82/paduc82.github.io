</p><p>Dear All,<br />
</p>
Recently, I wanna change some outdated gears from the old pc, and reassemble them into a new one, including motherboard, CPU, GPU and SSD.<br />
So, I'm pretty worried that the reactivation would be required if I &nbsp;boost my old pc. &nbsp;Is it really necessary to backup the key before a clean installation of the 1511 version on the new one? And how to backup and reactive it effectively?&nbsp;<br />
PS: My Win10 pro was updated from the win7 pro. And I just made a bootable USB key with a new CN_Multiple_Editions_1511 updated iso file (Date: Feb. 2016).

            <p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

<h2>            Skype online on Android&#47;SKype WIDGET</h2>
                    I installed Skype on my SONY XA1 Ultra. But the programm is only active, when I open it. and I want to be online 24 hrs, without thinking about switching on. I was seeking for some SKYPE widget for Android.

</p><p>Thank you for the information. However, what you're looking for is currently not available. What I can suggest is to keep Skype running in the background if you wish for it to run all the time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We highly encourage for you to leave a feedback/suggestion for Skype's system and features improvement. You can drop your feedback here:

            I haven't actually upgraded yet I was wondering if upgrading will fix it and if the upgrade disk will recognise it. I can't use the win7 checker because it won't load the blue login screen

<div>
<div>upgrading can overwrite infected system files.&nbsp; but corrupted system files is only one factor.&nbsp; ideally, you would want to format the disk to wipe away all the old data before installing the new o.s.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>but the above is an over simplified answer to your question.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>the problem with trying to do the above, is that your computer may simply â€œnotâ€ be compatible with win7.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>in other words, you could go buy win7 and proceed to install it on your xp machine.&nbsp; but if the computer hardware is only xp ready, then win7 would absolutely not install on the computer.&nbsp; thus this method would invalidate your idea presented in the original
 question.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>perhaps, you should consider alternate solutions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>instead of experimenting with win7 and believing that installing it would resolve the issue, you could also resolve the issue applying the idea with xp since you know your computer is xp ready.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>one method could be to execute a repair install to replace corrupted system files with genuine ones or another could be do a clean install of xp and re-format the disk.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>however, if you donâ€™t have any xp disks or your computer is not win7 compatible, then you are not out of options â€“ just have to decide whether to buy xp or closeting the computer.</div>

<p>2.6 ghz</p>
<p>1gb ram 4gb max</p>
<p>200gb hard drive&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<div>
<div>in regards to ram, you can start out with 1 gig, but I have seen win7 function at the 1.5 gigs margin.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I canâ€™t tell you about the graphics card.&nbsp; you need to check its home site and see if it is win7 compatible or it they have drivers for it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>also, I canâ€™t tell you about programs installed in xp that you hope to migrate over to win7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>all of the above and more can best be answered by the upgrade tool/utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>incidentally, that sp2 cd you found, does it have a hologram on it?&nbsp; could it be the installation cd for xp sp2?&nbsp; if so, then use it to wipe the hd and reinstall a fresh o.s.</div>

<p>about the cd it is a blue disk called "microsoft windows xp service pack 2 with advanced security technologies" and that it contains free updates for win xp. i put it into my laptop to the result of major spinning and after going into it, it has 4 folders

<div>
<div>
<div>ok.&nbsp; I thought that the cd would be a good start for you to at least do some repair work on the system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>you see at this time you have reason to believe that a virus has corrupted the system.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>but what if the problem is with the hardware and not software?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>for example, what if the graphics card is faulty or has the wrong driver?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>not knowing if you have compatible hardware and or faulty hardware, makes it difficult to determine if getting win7 will be the ticket towards a functional computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>both affects above will affect the win7 installation and could turn out a costly mistake if you buy win7 and you canâ€™t use it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>itâ€™s a hard decision for you to make.&nbsp; but if it were me, I would rather buy xp because I know that the computer is fully compatible with xp.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>then think about upgrading later, maybe if and when win8 comes out.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>so what exactly are you experiencing with the faulty computer?&nbsp; does it boot at all?&nbsp; is it possible for you to borrow a winxp cd?<br />

<p>ok&nbsp;basically&nbsp;a few months ago i ran a virus check and it found 560 so I took it off of the network and ran a second check which found another 200 having&nbsp;apparently&nbsp;removing the previous lot, ran another check and found more again. I turned off the machine
 hoping it would stop them spreading however the following morning I turned it back on and it didn't load the blue login screen that appears directly after the black windows logo screen I went through all of the various ways of starting I.e. recovery console,

<div>the link you provided is based in the u.k..&nbsp; are you in the u.k. or Europe? if so, then I think deleting the partition and then reformatting is a good idea as well.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>unfortunately, even if you were able to remove the infections, the system files would have surely been corrupted and it would surely require a genuine xp cd to replace them with genuine system files again.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>also, if Iâ€™m not mistaken, there is no true upgrade from xp to win7.&nbsp;&nbsp; in other words, win7 checks to see if the pc has a xp license, then it will wipe away everything and do a clean install of win7.&nbsp; but do a little bit more checking around for this particular
 issue so that you are not surprised. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>also, keep in mind that win7 is simply an operating system and would be no better than xp with defending itself from virusâ€™s.&nbsp;&nbsp; so the first thing I would install in win7 is microsoft security essentials directly from the microsoft website.&nbsp; donâ€™t browse
 â€œanyâ€ websites anywhere on the net.&nbsp; just go directly to microsoft and install mse as the first thing to do after installing win7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I hope you succeed with the endeavor.&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>

<p>ok basically a few months ago i ran a virus check and it found 560 so I took it off of the network and ran a second check which found another 200 having apparently removing the previous lot, ran another check and found more again. I turned off the machine
 hoping it would stop them spreading however the following morning I turned it back on and it didn't load the blue login screen that appears directly after the black windows logo screen I went through all of the various ways of starting I.e. recovery console,

<br />This does seem to be a known issue, over on their forum, please see this article on the Fresco Logic forum and if that does not resolve this, you can download their driver and see if that gets that device working for you . . .

<p>Hi Rene,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the driver from the cards installation disc (if the card is/was an add-on) or if the driver from the Fresco site was downloaded and installed, completely uninstall all of those (these drivers are basically for Win 7/Vista/XP support) then restart the
 PC and let Windows update install the driver(s) that it likes.</p>
<p>The add-on cards (in my case an Inatech&nbsp;7 Ports PCI-E to USB 3.0 Expansion Card installed in Feb. 2016) that use the Fresco Logic (<span>FL1100)</span> chipset were always plug-n-play with Windows 10 with the best results. (Those that mistakenly installed
 the old drivers had problems).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, if you are referring to (using) the FL2000&nbsp;USB 3.0 Display device controller then also refer to the links below:</p>

    <title>Live Mail Message store recovery. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hywel harris  say:</h3>
<h2>            Live Mail Message store recovery.</h2>
                    I use a message store on&nbsp; my data drive so that everything gets backed up automatically. I recently had a problem with this drive failing, bad sectors etc, and during this failure Live Mail could not open the store and proceeded to create a new store in
 the default /User/ location. <br />
<br />
Of course after replacing the drive and restoring all my data Live Mail made very heavy work of reconnecting to this store. I ended up having to import all emails and move them to my chosen store folders etc.<br />
<br />
Now, in order to protect myself from this unnecessary work should a drive fail in the future I have installed a Synology NAS with two 2TB drives set as RAID1. Great, if one fails the other seamlessly takes over.
<br />
<br />
My concern is that if the NAS goes offline for whatever reason and Live Mail can't see the msg store, it will create a new one in /Users/ again. How do I stop this happening? and if it does happen how do I revert to the correct message store without having
 to import everything manually?<br />
<br />
As an aside, I was considering upgrading to Outlook, but it seems there is no easy way to back up profiles to cover the above eventuality, and you can't move profiles out of the reg, so a loss of my OS drive will create a similar but different problem. Other
 options have similar downsides ie Thunderbird etc.<br />

<div><br />
<div>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Please be reminded that, by design, Windows Live Mail will create a new storage folder so that it will not replace the default folder to avoid the deletion of emails or for them to be corrupted.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, in Windows Live Mail, you can change the default storage location by doing the steps below:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li><span>Sign in to WLM.</span></li><li><span>Press ALT + F, then </span><b>Options, </b><span>then </span><b>Mail,</b></li><li><span>Select Advance tab.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Select </span><b>Maintenance </b><span>tab.</span></li><li><span>Select </span><b>Store Folder...</b></li></ol>
<div>Additionally, you can also post this query over to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows">
Windows support</a> since this is also regarding RAID feature of a hard disk,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Should you have other questions regarding to the web based Hotmail/Outlook.com, don't hesitate to post it here in Microsoft Community or you may try to search for an answer via the search function.</div>

            Thank you Francis_S, however you didn't need to tell me how to move the default message store as I have already indicated I have done that, to move it to my data drive.<br />
<br />
The question I don't have an answer to is how to <i><b>reconnect </b></i>LM to my pre-existing data store rather than just sitting there dumbly pretending not to know anything. This question is not RAID dependant, in fact it has little to do with the RAID aspects
 of my storage, the problem came up because of a failing hardrive. <br />
<br />
I need LM to understand that I have moved the default message store and I want LM to reconnect to this. Is there a registry key I can change to point it to the correct message store? Can I export the current reg keys so that I can get back to normal easily
 following this event?<br />
<br />
Why can't LM just ask the question before before dumping my old message store and settings?, something like<br />
<br />
<i>WIndows Live Mail cannot connect to your message store, click OK to continue to create a new message store or cancel to exit from Live Mail. Your previous message store was at %path%, contact your administrator to resolve the problem.</i><br />
<br />
That would do it wouldn't it? It would for me, I would just Cancel, make sure my data drive and message store was online (and in my previous failed HDD case, replace the drive and restore data) and then restart LM.<br />

<div>Thank you for giving us more inputs in regard to this matter. However, what you are asking is more of a programming setup (registry keys) in which you'd like to command Windows Live Mail to automatically search or assign it to your desired folder, only
 if Windows Live Mail have created a new storage folder.&nbsp;</div>

            So to be clear then, you are saying there is no way to prevent Live Mail creating a new store when it cannot find the store it used previously?<br />
<br />
And in addition, to be clear, there is no way to have Live Mail reconnect to the previous store after having created the new empty store? And it doesn't have to be automatic as you suggest, manually redirecting to the previous store would work for me.<br />

            The location of the store folder is stored in the registry. When the program starts, it looks at that key to find the calendar and message databases to load. If the location is unavailable, it has to create a new, empty store folder with new databases
 to be able to function. <br />
<br />
The prevent this from happening if the store folder is unavailable, you could use a little batch file to launch the program. Have the batch file check for availability of the store folder; if it's available, go ahead and launch WLMail, but if it's not, display
 a prompt to connect to the drive where the store folder is located before proceeding.

            Thanks, thats helpful. <br />
<br />
So by the same token I could manually edit the registry to change the key value to point back to the proper store when it comes back on line?<br />
<br />
Indeed, a simple export of the reg key when working normally would do it wouldn't it?&nbsp; Is it a single key or are there more than one that I need to export?.
<br />

            I suppose that might work, but I'm not going to test it for you! The key value is<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Store Root<br />
with&nbsp;value data the full path to the store folder.

            Thanks, I don't want to test it either!. I have exported that key for emergency use, but I'm not confident that thats all I need. There are likely to be other keys that get reset when LM created a blank store and I need someone with in depth knowledge
 , probably at Microsoft, to tell me what. <br />
<br />
I am coming to the conclusion that Microsoft are too embarrased to address this problem at this time, embarrased because its such a huge omission from the application. That lack of an ability to truly back up all your settings in case of a catastrophic failure
 is something MS don't really want to be made public.&nbsp; I guess a few people encountering what I encountered, they can deal with, witness the scripted answers above, but what it really needs is a proper working solution that Joe Public can handle.

No other that I know of. You'll wait a long time for an authoritative answer to that.<br />

<br />
<br />
What is the 'huge omission'? We have been talking about relocating the store folder, not about backing up settings. Settings are almost all stored in the registry; a notable exception to this is account settings, which are stored in the store folder. There
 is a specific backup procedure for these.<br />
<br />
This program was primarily designed as a client to handle Hotmail accounts. Using DeltaSync, there is no need (for the ordinary user) for backup, because all user data in the client were&nbsp;replicated on the Hotmail servers. However, mechanisms are included for
 backing up messages, accounts and contacts. The advanced user - who makes extensive use for example of non-Hotmail accounts, message rules and so on - would be well advised also to maintain an up-to-date copy of the program registry key. Apart from this, it's
 worth pointing out that the program is obsolescent. Development stopped in 2010.<br />
<br />
Can you explain how to back up all my settings for, say, Word 2013 in case of catastrophic failure?

                    <p>Hi all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a hard time connecting my Beatbox portable to my windows 7 64-bit. When I pair it, windows recognizes it as a bluetooth headset and tells me it needs troubleshooting. When I do it, it says "Bluetooth Peripheral Device doesn't have a driver". Any
 ideas?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are trying to reset the PC to factory settings (without the CD)&nbsp;and you are receiving these errors. I will be happy to answer your query. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the PC?</li><li>Are you facing any issues with PC that you are trying to reset to factory settings?</li><li>Which operating system was installed when you bought the PC?</li></ul>
<p>The error that you are receiving could be due to a corrupt disk sector or your recovery partition is corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your computer has been supplied with a recovery partition in place of disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. </p>
<p>For Fujitsu,<span><span>&nbsp; </span>p<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ress the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</span></span></p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to try more than once to get any of the above to work. If after repeated attempts, you have no luck or the machine reports that there is no recovery partition, your only option is to contact the computer manufacturer and ask for recovery disks
 for the model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the reset, you should get<span style="font-weight: bold"><span>all</span></span> updates from Windows Update EXCEPT for hardware devices. Next, you should install a good anti-virus solution. ONLY AFTER you have done this should you replace stuff from
 backups or install anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Backup your data before factory reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            Hi <strong>Adrian</strong>,<br />
<br />
Based on the information that you've provided, the issue with the Handwriting Input Panel occurred after the Creators Update. Can you tell us if you're pertaining to the
<strong>Windows 10 Creators Update</strong> or the <strong>Windows Fall Creators Update</strong>? To find out which version of Windows your PC is running, press
<strong>Windows logo key+ R</strong>, type <strong>winver</strong>, then select <strong>
OK</strong>. Also, we'd like to know if you have tried any troubleshooting steps related to this issue.<br />
<br />
We'll be looking forward to your response.

<p>I followed Your description but it did NOT change the bug with the size of the Text Input Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact it seems to be a problem with the SCALING of the Text Input Panel and the Online Keyboard
<span>due to the screen resolution on a device that goes wrong</span>, because on other devices the Text Input Panel and the Keyboard are too small (Lenovo Yoga Book). And I had a communication in a German forum of MS community with another user that
 has the same problems I have, but again on another tablet device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this problem once on my Lenovo Yoga Book last year and I was told to alter settings in the registry on my Yoga Book. That did work back then. Now it dosn't work anymore. And I cannot remember the settings that have to be altered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did NOT alter any settings on my Surface Pro 4 in the registry until now.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            BILLING ISSUE&#38;gt&#59; DOUBLE BILLED ___AND CANNOT FIND A PHONE NUMBER TO SPEAK TO AN AGENT</h2>
                    
<p>This is absolutely ridiculous that there isn't a *** contact number to call and speak to anyone about a *** billing issue. I was double billed for an xbox pack that my son bought. There isn't a phone number or even a *** chat or email option where I can
 speak to someone. Apparently there is someone doing the billing somewhere out there, however there is apparently no way to speak to anyone about this. I have never in my life seen something so absolutely ridiculous. I have since taken all of my credit cards
 off of the account and canceled my xbox live membership. And WILL NOT continue service if this is the type of customer service that XBOX/MICROSOFT provides.</p>

<p>I AM EXTREMELY *** OFF, AS I HAVE SEARCHED UP AND DOWN ON MY ACCOUNT AND THE WEBSITE TO FIND A CONTACT NUMBER TO SPEAK TO A CUSTOMER SERVICE REP ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AND I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT IF SOMEONE WOULD GET BACK TO ME REGARDING MY QUESTION/CONCERN.</p>

<p>PHONE:<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>
<p>EMAIL: <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>
<p>EMAIL ASSOCIATED WITH XBOX ACCOUNT: <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>


<p>AGAIN THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But how can read - this "Storage System" has only the "<strong>LAN connetion</strong>" to connect with computer(s) for store the data. And if you connect&nbsp; this "<strong>Storage System</strong>" throught "<strong>LAN connection"</strong> that impossible to
 do the <strong>defragmetation by tools of the operating system.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your wrote about the USB connector - this <strong>USB connector </strong>is type

                    <p>I have created restore points when my computer is working great, but they are always gone when I try to restore my system. I changed setting to allow max drive space, but doesnt work. I have done searches for the name of a restore point I just created but
 nothing is found. Is it possable to save it to disk or drive then restore off of that. Thank you</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>You cannot save the system restore points on a disk or an external hard drive.</span></p>
<p><span>To store restore points, you need at least 300 megabytes (MB) of free space on each disk that is 500 MB or larger.</span></p>
<p><span>System Restore might use between three and five percent of the space on each disk. As the amount of space fills up with restore
 points, System Restore deletes older restore points to make room for new ones.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>You can always change the size of the space reserved for system restore on the drives. To do this, try these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Start, right click Computer and click Properties.</span></p>
<p><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click System Protection.</span></p>
<p><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select the drive that you want to change the system restores reserved space and
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>click on â€œConfigureâ€. </span></p>
<p><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Move the slider to increase the space.</span></p>
<p><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Apply the settings.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following link for more information.</span></p>

Meu irmÃ£o mais velho acabou de comprar o X1, e pretendemos compartilhar o FIFA 16, porÃ©m no console lÃ¡ de casa tem o meu perfil e o do meu outro irmÃ£o, e irÃ­amos dividir entre nÃ³s trÃªs o preÃ§o.<br />
<br />
EntÃ£o queria saber se o compartilhamento sÃ³ Ã© possÃ­vel entre no mÃ¡ximo dois perfis, jÃ¡ que tem que colocar um perfil como principal em um e outro no outro console.<br />
<br />
Teria como nÃ³s 3 possuirmos o jogo? Claro, podendo jogar ao mesmo tempo nos dois video games de preferÃªncia.<br />
<br />
Se alguÃ©m puder ajudar...<br />
<br />
Muito obrigado.</p>

<p>O jogo comprado fica disponÃ­vel para todas as contas. O problema Ã© que o Xbox one nÃ£o permite o mesmo perfil logado em dois consoles ao mesmo tempo. Quando logar em um console o outro irÃ¡ deslogar. NÃ£o poderÃ£o jogar ao mesmo tempo.</p>

<h2>            Default fonts on certain websites appear squished across all browsers after windows update</h2>
                    After an update (i think the fall creators update for Windows 10) certain fonts on most websites appear squished, especially if it's a smaller font size.&nbsp; I've been researching for days and have tried many options including rolling back as many updates as I
 could and nothing works.&nbsp; Please see screen shot:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ccc577e-56db-4a46-8e0f-2927c8b214d0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ccc577e-56db-4a46-8e0f-2927c8b214d0?upload=true" /></a>

            The image is from Chrome but like i said in my post the problem exists in any browser:&nbsp; Edge, IE, Firefox, Chrome - all at the latest version;&nbsp; Zoom set at 100%.&nbsp; And it's not just the one website.&nbsp; It seems that windows is replacing the default body font
 of certain websites.&nbsp; So, for example, if the website's default font is Arial Windows replaces it with whatever the heck that squished illegible font is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Is your resolution set to the recommended?
<br />There is an option in Display settings for "Scale and layout" do you have it set to 100%?

            Resolution is set at recommended setting.&nbsp; The issue is corrupt font issues after windows update.&nbsp; Just wondering if anyone has found a fix.&nbsp; I have already confirmed it is not a windows, program or hardware setting or driver issue.&nbsp; Thanks!

<h2>            Microsoft Visual C&#43;&#43; 2015 Redistributable &#40;x64&#41; - 14.0.24215 Installation</h2>
                    <p>My PC has been crying at me for some time now, and I'm getting tired about it, concerning the missing installation of "vc_runtimeMinimum_x64.msi". I've tried just about everything I can think of, including trying to install previous versions of the runtime,
 with no luck. Finally, I got a message saying "Error 1714.The older version of Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 x64 Minimum Runtime - 14.0.24215 cannot be removed. Contact your technical support group." So that's what I'm trying to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When does it ask for the correct path?<br />
- When I start the game SQUAD in Steam</p>
<p>- When I try to update Teamspeak 3</p>
<p><br />
I downloaded the latest (I think) redist, which happens to be version 14.0.24215 (which is what my PC keeps asking for and not being able to locate) from
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a>.<br />
<br />
Also, I created this path manually, and it still doesn't recognize the file (which I stole from a different redist path, because I have no idea what the "right" file is. :&nbsp;C:\ProgramData\Package Cache\{C0B2C673-ECAA-372D-94E5-E89440D087AD}v14.0.24210\packages\vcRuntimeMinimum_amd64\</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error that you are getting can be caused due to the Runtime Components of Visual C++ libraries that are missing or getting conflicted, possibly due to a third party software or misconfigured registry settings. Let's troubleshoot the issue by performing
 the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features, uninstall all the Visual C++ 2015 Redistribute items.<br />
2. Run the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix it tool</a></strong> to fix problems that block programs from being installed or removed.<br />
3. Re-run the <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Visual Studio 2015 C++</a></strong> installer as administrator, then click the icon besides 'Launch' and choose 'Repair' to perform
 a repair and continue the setup process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>

    <title>Microsoft Dynamics GP 2010 Lookup Window - Choosing &#34;Set as - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thornbrain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Dynamics GP 2010 Lookup Window  - Choosing &#34;Set as Default View&#34; breaks the actual Default View</h2>
                    In Great Plains 2010 you will find an Item Maintenance Window (for instance).<br />
Within this window there is a Lookup button (magnifying glass) that opens the Items list.<br />
This list always highlights the item number of the current displayed item in the calling window (i.e. Item Maintenance).<br />
<br />
Now there is a setting in the "Items" Window next to the heading "View: All Item Numbers; by Item Number" accessible by a white down-arrow.<br />
<br />
If you mess with this setting AT ALL (please don't) and then choose "Set as Default View" you will NEVER...NOT EVER...be able to get the lookup window to default to the current selected item ever again. It just defaults to the top of the list.<br />
<br />
This only applies to the current user in the current company. If the user logs into a different company, the lookup window behaves normally. ADDITIONALLY, if the user logs into that company from ANY computer, that setting follows the user account in that company.
 The setting is not stored locally on the user's GP install.<br />
<br />
<b>How do we reset the GP server/table or whatever to have Lookup Window default to the item that was listed in the calling window??</b> This bug follows all lookup windows that open the Items window (e.g. Item Maintenance, Kit Maintenance, Sales Transaction
 Entry, Bill of Materials View, etc.).<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>You didn't specify exactly what your DX issue is, or what 'it' is. Knowing what brand and model graphics</p>
<p>processor your machine uses would also be usefull.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 7 has three major versions of DirectX - 9, 10 &amp; 11.</p>
<p>You do not determine which version or sub-version of DX gets used. The software will
</p>
<p>select the DX files it requires.</p>
<p>Exception being when a game has options for DX9 or DX10/11 in it's graphics settings.</p>
<p>In this instance the user can decide if they want to use DX10/11 level effects or just run the game with</p>
<p>DX9 effects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- There are numerous DirectX files.&nbsp; DX9 has the most. The files are found in System32, and sysWOW64</p>
<p>The graphics DX files have numbers such as d3dx9_34.dll . </p>
<p>There are other DX files for audio, and game controllers (Dinput and Xinput ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>DX10/11 effects only offer a relatively small visual enhancement vs the extra processing power required</p>
<p>by these effects, so you need to have a graphics processor that can handle the extra load.</p>
<p>- What is different between DX versions is mainly how the game renders particle effects (smoke, fog, etc),</p>
<p>light and shadow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Which versions of DX can be used is also dependent on the graphics processor.</p>
<p>Old graphics processors&nbsp; will be limited to DX9. These are followed by graphics processors that are limited</p>
<p>to DX9 and 10, and so on with DX11 .</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Direct X can be updated on machines with a 'clean' install of Win7 by using the
<em>DirectX Web Installer -</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>There is no specific&nbsp; DX 10.1 installer. The files that use the tweaks that led to this designation are still labeled DX10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Which is why I gave you links to the two official MS download pages for DirectrX update or reinstall.</p>
<p>The DirectX Redist (June 2010) is the offline installer.</p>
<p>- There is no newer DX installer. The only new DX files since this date are a couple of DX12 files
</p>
<p>that come with Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I don't know why dxdiag is reporting only DX9. Have you looked in System 32 to verify there are no DX 10 files ?
</p>
<p>There should be a d3dx10.dll and&nbsp; d3dx10_33.dll&nbsp; though to&nbsp; d3dx10_43.dll (The last three came out after</p>
<p>the release of Win7, which is why the Web Installer is used for updating a clean Win7 install ).</p>
<p>There are other files, but having all of these would indicate that DirectX 10/10.1<em> is</em> installed on your machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Are you using Intel graphics driver downloaded from Lenovo ? Even if they don't have a recent driver
</p>
<p>you may still do better using whatever driver they have available for your machine than to use</p>
<p>one from Intel. </p>
<p>Laptops commonly require drivers from the mfg of the machine vs mfg of the component</p>
<p>for the best performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw - A lot of people still cling to Direct X 9.0c as the solution to DX 9 issues.
</p>
<p>This may explain why a search tends to lead people to the DX 9.0c installer download.</p>
<p>This is incorrect. There is no special magic in DX 9.0c . The June 2010&nbsp; installer has all the exact&nbsp; same
</p>
<p>files as DX9.0C, and more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Sometimes a when a game cannot launch because of inadequate processing power</p>
<p>Windows will toss out a DX error . While your Intel HD Graphics processor may be compatible with DX10</p>
<p>it would not be able to use DX10 effects in a game anyway. DX10/11 are very system intensive effects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have been trying to find why you get DX error messages&nbsp; it may be due to the Intel HD graphics
</p>
<p>version on your model cpu.&nbsp; The integrated graphics on your cpu&nbsp; is based on Intel HD 2000 graphics.</p>
<p>HD2000 is a low end graphics processor, and the version your cpu uses is a bit slower.</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen &#40;BAD SYSTEM CONFIG INFO&#41; then &#39;Preparing Automatic Repair&#39; loop</h2>
                    My fairly new Lenovo laptop running Windows 10 froze all of a sudden. After leaving it for 24 hours with no sign of fixing itself I force restarted it by holding the power button. Since then I haven't been able to use it as it first goes to a BSOD saying
 'BAD SYSTEM CONFIG INFO' then restarts and boots saying 'Preparing Automatic Repair'. The automatic repair doesn't fix anything and gives me the option to either restart or go to Advanced options. Restarting goes back to the blue screen and the loop continues.
 Going into troubleshooting, I've tried' System Restore', 'Startup Repair' &nbsp;and 'Reset this PC' and keeping my files, none of which have worked or fixed the problem. Any help would be much appreciated.&nbsp;

    <title>Retrieve deleted skype history - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Retrieve deleted skype history</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I was clearing data on my phone to add storage and by mistake i entered the skype app and cleared all the data. I realised what i have done right after and logged in hoping that my messages and contacts would still be there. Unfortunately almost all
 messages had been deleted. Is it any way to recover them? I had logged in from my sister;s phone and they were still there, but when i logged few days later from my computer they were also gone.</p>
<p>please, there is any way to recover them? They were really important.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/29e6bf88-99fc-43e8-9f97-53a6d905ee5e" title="AmeliaPilliams">
<p>
</p><p>When you delete the data stored on your computer, there's no more option to recover those deleted data. If you weren't able to
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA392/how-do-i-manage-my-conversation-history-in-skype-for-windows-desktop?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
back up your history</a>, I'm afraid it's no longer possible to recover these deleted conversations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have further questions.</p>
