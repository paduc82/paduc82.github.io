<h2>            Xbox One Discs Sometimes Won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t Read - Repeatable scenario&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all!</p>
<p>I am having an issue that I have been able to repeat on several occasions. If I have a DVD or BluRay in my drive on boot up of my console, then I want to play a game. I take the DVD/Blu Ray out of the system. Then I put in my game disc. The disc drive does
 not spin up but makes a quiet click twice. I then remove my game disc and put it back in and it reads and plays perfectly. It is worth noting if I do not have ANY disc in my system the disc is read perfectly on the first try.</p>
<p>The issue only seems to occur when switching from DVDs to Game Discs NOT Game Discs to DVDs. I can switch game discs in and out without issue but once I play a DVD I have to take the game disc out again and try once more for it to read.</p>
<p>My question is are there two different lenses inside of the disc drive? Maybe this is a software issue? I do not have a load clicking or buzzing sound that I have read from people who's systems will not read discs at all, so this is not the same problem
 they are having. So should I be concerned?</p>
<p>Thanks for any input!</p>

<p>I am having the exact same issue. Would love a response. For me though, this didn't start happening until the latest system update. I don't know if there is a relation or if my xbox is starting to break down. Do I need to send it in? Or will this issue be
 fixed in the summer system update?</p>

<p>Hey guys, try this: </p>
<p>Uninstall Blue-Ray App. </p>
<p>Go to Settings&gt;Disc and Blu-ray Settings </p>
<p>Make sure there is a check at 24 hz. </p>
<p>Scroll down to persistent storage, clear it. </p>
<p>Go back to the home screen. </p>
<p>Make sure no disc is in disc drive </p>
<p>Power cycle console for 10 seconds </p>
<p>Power drain, and unplug everything </p>
<p>Wait for the light on PSU to disappear </p>
<p>Reconnect cables in this order: HDMI (both, if necessary), Kinect, Ethernet (if necessary), &nbsp;Power cord to console and directly to wall, (if possible.)
</p>
<p>Restart console </p>
<p>Download Blu-Ray player app </p>
<p>Go to home screen, and test: &nbsp; </p>

<p>Either drives are failing or unconfirmed firmware break. The best I get now is the pop-up error. Advance exchange program under warranty guys, that seems to be the route right now.</p>
<p>For reference mine started after 1405 beta preview started to rollout but it's hard to say if it's firmware or just fluke timing.</p>

<p>Just to pile on, I too am having drive issues. &nbsp;Sometimes the game/dvd/blu-ray disk fires right up. &nbsp;Sometimes I have to eject it and re-insert it several times to get it to recognize. &nbsp;Gotta say this is pretty annoying for a new game system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I may try the whole uninstalling the app and power cycle everything but it strikes me as odd to have to go through all of that to do a basic and simple function that has worked for multiple generations of game systems at this point.</p>

<p>So I tried something the Chat help offered and it worked for a bit. &nbsp;Go into Settings, Disk and Blur Ray drive, Persistent Storage. &nbsp; Clear the &nbsp;Persistent Storage storage 3 times and do a Hard reset. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said that fixed it for a bit but now I am having the issue again. &nbsp;I am guessing I have to do it again. &nbsp;Wish they would fix it but perhaps I should see about getting it replaced.</p>

<p>I'm having this problem too, but only with Xbox 360 discs, Xbox One discs are read instantly, but I have to keep ejecting the 360 discs and reinserting them about 20 times before they read, it's getting very annoying now</p>

            After clearing persistent storage three times in the Blu-ray menu I used clear alternative Mac address in the Network's menu. It prompted me to restart the restart took longer than normal to shut down then my movie played just fine on the second try. Was
 locking up on the blue screen with the load bar beforehand

<h3> mxrauf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to wifi &#47;&#47; WLAN AutoConfig won&#39;t start&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello! My problem is my windows 10 pc won't look for and connect to wifi connections. Don't jump to conclusions! Just read through and see if you can help :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what happened was I had an issue (doesn't matter now, it's fixed) so I went to restart my laptop. It was hanging at an odd gray blank screen, so I decided to manually power down by holding the power button down. I believe this is what caused the issue.
 Later when it reboots, I find my wifi isn't working. I click it and it says no connections can be found. I somehow, after hours of searching, think I isolated my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, my WLAN AutoConfig won't run. It's set to automatic, but it is not running, and when I try to start it up, it gives me an error: 1474. Ooh aah. I searched it up online and all the fixed I found for it were useless. I hope someone can give me one
 that works. My operating system is Windows 10 (I'm not one of those people whose internet stoppers working entirely after upgrading). Also forgot to mention , but when I forced shut down I believe it was during &nbsp;an update process because when it rebooted,
 it said updates failed updating blah blah blah. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry that this isn't well written but i did in a whim on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading, and hopefully someone can help me out :)</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>It sounds like you have a hardware issue which is properly handled by the Dell.com site. Once there, click on Tech Support and have your Service Tag number available (its on a sticker on your laptop's bottom panel).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They also have a Forum that is very helpful - like this one&nbsp;(I've posted there before). Here we deal only with software issues related to Windows, and your issue is clearly a hardware issue. Sorry I can't be of more help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

                    <p>Was für eine scheiß Seite. Seit vorgestern versuche ich vergeblich den Support von Microsoft zur xbox one zu kontaktieren. Habe mehrmals versucht einen Kontakt herzustellen und es hat nichts geklappt, bis ich dann eine E-Mail Adresse gefunden habe, im Bereich für den Xbox one Support. Heute bekomme ich eine Mail und mir wurde gesagt (<strong>Wir beschäftigen uns vor allem mit der Installation und Aktivierung von Office und Windows.</strong>&nbsp;), also man kann mir nicht zur meiner Frage weiterhelfen. Kotz 🤢</p><p>Ach und dann wurde mir noch gesagt ich sollte doch bitte den Xbox Support kontaktieren. Hallo, ich habe zur xbox one eine Mail Adresse bekommen, die nicht stimmt, sondern nur PC Bereich zuständig ist? Hat jemand einen Tipp für mich, wie ich den XBOX SUPPORT UND NICHT MICROSOFT KONTAKTIEREN kann ohne einen Vollidioten zu Kontaktieren der mir so einen Scheiß erzählt.

<h2>            File sharing over a home network</h2>
                    Hello,&nbsp; By following instructions from this site for sharing files on my home network, which has two computers on it, I have been able to share files from one computer, a laptop connected to the network, with a desktop computer on the same network.&nbsp; I
 have not been able to share any of the files from the desktop computer with the laptop.&nbsp; Both computers are running Windows 10. &nbsp; Can anybody provide any advice as to how to resolve this issue?&nbsp; Thanks.

            I've also lost my simple HomeGroup, but still see my 2 laptops and 1 Desktop as being in my Network. Can't connect or delete them and attempting to file share (again) hasn't helped me either. I will not resort to OneDrive to resolve what should have not

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got recently a problem with OneDrive on my main PC. Whenever I want to change the status (online or offline)&nbsp;of a file or folder, I got an error saying (sorry, translated from french, so not the exact message) "This action cannot be executed right now
 because this folder is being moved. Try again later."</p>

<br />
============================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong></p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<h2>            Issue with Monoprice pen.</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center">you see, I'm a digital artist</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e2fc143-9496-4fdd-bff8-e219a591087e" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center">See? Art.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center">Now, most digital artists use graphics tablets, If you don't know what one is you just go and leave, you're no help here.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center">As the people who <strong>should</strong> still be here would know, If I have any hopes of making serious digital art, i'm going to need a tablet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">So, of course, I got one as a gift for Christmas. And It worked fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">But eventually( 4 months, to be exact ) for some reason, My computer got down and broke. It showed a blue screen of death, restarted itself, then looped. Turns out the computer was just too weak and couldn't hold up to the
<em>mere 12 hour a day</em> schedule I had for it and the harddrive broke. So, of course, I sent it back. They decided there was no way to fix it, so I presume they got out the ol' sledgehammer and gave me a replacement. It was german and we had to tinker around
 with it, but eventually it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1" style="text-align: center"><strong>BUT</strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">My tablet never&nbsp;<em>worked
</em>since, let me explain how.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">Whenever I try to draw a line, there's this little ripple.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">and this ripple shows the radius in which I CAN'T DRAW. let me explain how some more</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">okay, for you to understand, open paint.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">Now, using the circle tool, make a decently small circle in gray</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">starting from the centre of the circle, try to draw a curvy line</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">It should look like this</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd64af6e-5bdd-4341-915e-cb7698293477" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">Now, put a red dot in the centre of the circle, then use the line tool to connect the dot to the edge of the circle, like so.</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cddb55b7-6d03-432a-ad6b-9e456ffb3c8c" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">now, this part's a little tricky, make sure the section of the black line inside and outide of the circle are&nbsp;<strong>NOT
</strong>connected</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1735b46-ffe0-4d81-89fd-5fd687be2335" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">After that, use the paint bucket to fill the circle in with black, then use it again inside the circle to turn all the black white, this will get rid of all black inside the circle. while you're doing that,
 go ahead and use the same technique to get rid of the gray circle. then go over the red with black and..</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/99880356-6347-4ae8-a277-78afc6c09f0d" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center"><strong>Presto! </strong>That's what it's like when I draw with my tablet. So yeah, the line jumps to wherever I exit the radius.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">Now, this may not seem like much, but this is art we're talking about, I need to be incredibly precise, and with this I can't do that nor use the technique of sketching.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">And for whatever reason, there was no problem for some programs like paint.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">But I can't exactly put an MS paint drawing on my resume when applying to be an illustrator, can I?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">Now, there's been this problem before, and it's apparently been fixed,</p>
<p class="contentHeader1" style="text-align: center"><strong>HOWEVER</strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">All those people have been using a Wacom Bamboo tablet, I use a monoprice.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">The solutions I've found involve going into the settings and putting pen dynamics off</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">Monoprice has no pen dynamics setting.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">I tried giving it to my dad so he could fix it.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">But whatever he did just made it worse, as now&nbsp;<strong>all
</strong>art programs don't work</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">I think It has something to do with the touch screen aspect of windows 8 (which mine can't even do) from what i've researched</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">And the only way that might work for me is using "gpedit.msc" and using a command to turn pen dynamics off,</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">But the only way to get&nbsp;gpedit.msc is to have windows 8 pro</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">which is about 100£</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">The tablet was a gift, and costed about 50£</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">So my parrents, who're strapped for money at the moment, would need to spend twice as much as the original gift, just to fix it</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">Or I would have to save up for it myself, so if I were to calculate how long it'd take for me to save up using only my weekly allowance and the money I get from chores,</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">It would take ERROR days.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">because ERROR is happens when you Divide by zero.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">So if anyone could please give me an answer, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center">and if anyone who's trying to get me to sucker out 100£, I would like you to know that i've sent my flying monkeys after you</p>

<h3> jcrow0216  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 will not recognize my sign in password.</h2>
                    I upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 10 on my 6 month old laptop. &nbsp;It worked fine the first day, it restarted itself overnight for updates and will now not let me sign into the computer. &nbsp;It says that it does not recognize the password or it is incorrect
 and to change it. I used my desktop to go into my outlook account and change the password using the link provided. &nbsp;It still will not let me sign in and has rendered the laptop useless. &nbsp;How can I fix this problem, I spoke with outlook and they say it is a
 Windows 10 issue and they could not help me. &nbsp;Please advise, thank you!

            The same thing happened to me after using a restore point. I cannot log in to my computer, because the login won't accept my password (invalid password). so I can do nothing with that computer since being unable to log in. Surely there is a solution to
 this, what is it?

                    When I try to edit my birthday Calendar or Australian Holiday Calendar from within Windows Live Mail, they are shown as Read Only. Only my own calendar can be edited. I can edit the Birthday and Holiday Calendars if I go to calendar.live.com but not in
 Windows Live Mail. I'm using Windows Live Mail 2011 Build 15.4.3555.0308. In Live Mail, if I hover the mouse over the Birthday Calendar on the left hand side, a small one line window appears saying "Edit Birthday Calendar (Read Only)", and of course the same
 for the Holiday Calendar - "Edit Australian Holiday Calendar (Read Only)"
<div>I've seen others ask this question but the only response I can find from MS is what version of Live Mail are you using, when did it happen, was there an error message, etc etc, no actual solutions, so, I've provided my version details, it happens when
 I try to edit, and there is no real error message, just the little information message saying its read only. Please help.</div>

<p><span>3. Remove the birthday by clicking “Delete” at the top of the page.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click “Delete” again in the dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, we'd like you to answer the following question below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Does the issue happen when using other&nbsp;Hotmail/Outlook calendar?</span></li><li><span>Does the issue happen when using other&nbsp;computer?</span></li></ul>

            I Googled around for your error and I found this one post that might help. It's for the AIO 962 but should also be good for your AIO 960. I've copied the fix that worked for one of the posters from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://en.community.dell.com/forums/p/19046379/19579027.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.community.dell.com/forums/p/19046379/19579027.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<div>
<p>1. Uninstall the Dell AIO 962 Printer/Imaging Software using Dells Drivers and Utilities DISC 1. DO NOT use the add/remove program feature in the control panel.</p>
<p>2. Insert the disc into a drive. click START, click MY COMPUTER,&nbsp;open the drive showing DELL 962.</p>
<p>3. click&nbsp;SETUP.EXE, the installation window should pop up. click UNINSTALL.</p>
<p>4. follow the prompts, unplug the USB cord and remove the install DISC before RESTARTING your computer.</p>
<p>5. check to see if software is gone, click START, click CONTROL PANEL, click ADD OR REMOVE PROGRAMS. Remove if necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Verify the AIO printer is removed by checking the DEVICE MANAGER under IMAGING DEVICES. Delete If
<span><span>necessary.</span>
</span></p>
<p>(For more information, click on <strong>Start, </strong>&nbsp;Help and Support, in the search box type in Device Manager)</p>
<p>7. RESTART your computer if you had to remove or delete anything in steps 5 or 6.</p>
<p>8. Plug the USB cord back in and follow the Found New Hardware promps.</p>
*****<br />
<br />
You can also Google around like I did, using "dlboxaiox.exe" as your search term. Be careful, though - some of the posters suggest using a registry cleaner (which didn't work for him anyway) and that is Right Out. Registry cleaners will really hose your system
 even worse than it is now.<br />

<h2>            Issues connecting my 360 to a monitor via VGA cable with the new dashboard update</h2>
                    
<pre>Hi everyone:<br /><br />I have an older XBox 360, bought in around 2007, that I've been always playing with my friend via system link connected to my computer's monitor via a VGA cable. Like this one:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-VGA-HD-AV-Cable/dp/B000B6MLTG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-VGA-HD-AV-Cable/dp/B000B6MLTG</a><br /><br />So fast forward to now -- I haven't played it for over a year -- but now my buddy was in town, we got the Saints Row 3 game and decided to play again. Right before playing the console said that I needed an update. So we went through a rigmarole of connecting it via ethernet cable, then downloaded and installed something after which the dashboard looked totally new -- like those Windows 8 computers now. I should say that due to the layout of my apartment, I had to connect this Xbox to my TV fist via RCA cable to download and install the dashboard update.<br /><br />OK. So, now when I try to connect this 360 to my moni

<p>ive had some trouble with the vga lead before, certain monitors dont seem to work very at all on the xbox, have you looked in the display settings and tried to adjust the different resolutions ? - also and with the power off, unplug the vga lead (both ends)
 and make sure none of the pins are bent, if they are, this is the problem.</p>

<p>The resolution you or your friend last had it set at could possibly be a factor as the xbox will use the last known setting with VGA as it doesn't have auto detect like HDMI. If the monitor you're using now doesn't support the previous resolution you used
 then it will not display or say "out of range".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It happened to me once and I had to run through the settings blind using my pad, try memorising the button presses to adjust your display settings using another connection. Then run through them blind with the VGA connected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not an ideal solution for sure, and it may not apply to you here,&nbsp;but as I said it happened to me before and I got it working.</p>

<p>Actually you could try turning your Xbox on via the guide button (large center button) then hold down the Right Trigger and the Y button whilst it boots up. If this deosn't work try the Right Trigger and the X button at the same time.</p>

<p>No, it's the right-trigger and Y, but you have to turn it on with the big X on the controller. What is really stupid is that it is pretty easy to mess up your console by accidentally accepting a screen resolution that your screen doesn't support, or do it
 automatically by plugging it into another TV. It wasn't like that in a previous dashboard.</p>
<p>I'm curious, if "Geniuses" at Microsoft ever played with such a possibility?</p>

<p>Eu recomendo que você tente formatar ele pelo prórpio PC e depois ligar no Xbox 360 e fazer todo o processo de configuração do dispositivo novamente porque pelo o que parece o Xbox não está conseguindo "Ler" o conteúdo do pen drive que deve ter corrompido
 por alguma razão. Isso já aconteceu comigo mas no caso foi com o HD: eu tinha que esperar uns 5 minutos para que o meu console saisse daquela tela inicial e depois que ele ligava eu ia em opções e depois em memória e lá mostrava meu HD como um "dispositivo
 não formatado". Espero ter ajudado um pouco.</p>

<p>na hora de escolher o pendrive sugiro o sandisk, pois o pendrive oficial do xbox (ja formatado) e dessa marca, e tambem recomendo comprar um cruzerblade, q e o meu, ou menor, pois ficara bem discreto na parte de tras do console. tenho um game full salvo
 nele, e um demo, esta ok</p>

<h2>            Windows start menu&#47;button and Wifi menu NOT WORKING</h2>
                    <div>Since 2 days I have problems with my Laptop, This consists of not being able to use the '' windows start menu '' and the Wifi menu (being able to select networks / SSID ''.) The Windows start button on the keyboard works with combinations as Start + L
 for lock and Win + E for explorer as an example, furthermore my device is physically in good condition it has not fallen or damage with the keyboard itself The Wifi menu Bottom right with the wifi icon is not working when I hover over it says wifi networks
 available, but if I click on it and want to select nothing happens, nor I can not select a wifi network via network center.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have looked at many forums and websites and also on youtube for help.</div>
<div>Have already tried the following.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Opening task manager and then restarting the explorer: Fail</div>

<p>Turning off Display driver and reboot into windows: Fail</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: Also in the update history it does not shows any failed updates or things which went wrong.</p>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am beginning to lose hope and can not understand why Microsoft does not just solve this problem properly and forever.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Worst case is a clean install of my windows 10, but I do not want to do this yet to see if this problem can be solved differently instead of clean install.</div>
<div>This only costs more time and also has to reinstall everything and configure user account. THIS SHOULD NOT BE THE NORMAL SOLUTION I HOPE.</div>

            Hi.

<br />Try going back to a previous Windows point to repair.
<br />Follow the steps below to restore your computer to a previous date using a restore point:
<br />
<br />1- Type recovery in the search box of the taskbar and choose Recovery (Control Panel).
<br />2.- Click on Open System Restore.
<br />3.- Click on Next.
<br />4.- Select your restore point, and click Next.
<br />5.- Click on Finish.
<br />
<br />The computer will reboot and present a message on the desktop confirming that the restoration was successful.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

            Hi Anuran, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect form the Internet, and temporarily turn off any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            Does this method lets me keep my files in C drive? I've never tried upgrading this way, I've only used it for clean installations.

            Hi Arunan
<br />
<br />If you use this method it is just an upgrade, not a clean install and all your files and applications will remain untouched, just remember to upgrade, not install . ..

            Hi,
<br />If that fails.
<br />
<br />Would like to look at Rollback logs.
<br />
<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />
<br />and 
<br />
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing the path in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.
<br />
<br />Use Onedrive/Google Drive/Mediafire to share the files and drop the links in the next reply.       
        </p>
