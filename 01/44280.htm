<h2>            SKPE and Blue Raspberry Microphone</h2>
                    <p>I have Chinese student living with me and uses Skype to communicate with his guitar teacher back home in China.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We bought a Blue Raspberry external microphone to usb connect to his MAC laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The microphone works fine in transmitting the sound of the guitar playing back to his teacher in China.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that the audio from his teach can not be heard when the microphone is plugged into the computer. &nbsp;If you disconnect the microphone the audio works both ways. &nbsp;When connected the audio from China to the laptop with the microphone plugged into
 it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Hello John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question. At this time the Oculus rift is
<strong>not</strong> available for Xbox. They are for windows PC. As to when Xbox will have something similar it hard to say there has been nothing released. Personal opinion though, I would imagine soon as virtual reality is becoming very popular.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely help you in fixing the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
To help you suggest more steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you made any hardware or software recent changes to your computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. Are you able to print with the new printer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to perform a Clean Boot to prevent any conflicting third party applications from interfering with your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To place the computer in a Clean Boot state, you need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below and check with the issue.<br />
How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: You need to follow Step 3 from the article mentioned above to get the computer back to Normal Startup after performing all the steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above information helps you.<br />

<p>Hopefully if one uses the Programs and Features to uninstall a program the process would remove these startup items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes folks uninstall things some other (usually wrong) way and that can leave behind startup items that go nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And where is this "HP completely remove utility"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would someone suggest a utility and not provide a link to it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you want instructions that might work on some systems some of the time or do you want instructions that will work on all systems all of the time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some instructions that should do the job:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It might be easy to get rid of the error message by doing something like disabling the startup item in msconfig (if you can even find it), but I suggest you fix the problem and not just fix the symptom of the problem by just eliminating the startup message.<br />
<br />
I would also not recommend that you start poking around in the registry unless you have a backup since there is no
<br />
"undo" or "quit without saving" option in regedit.&nbsp; If you make a mistake, that's it.<br />
<br />
Those ideas offer "quick" and sometimes risky relief of the symptom, but may not actually fix the problem.&nbsp; I would<br />
also be wary of ideas that begin with the words "try".&nbsp; You do not need to try things, you need to do things.<br />
<br />
Here are comprehensive instructions that will keep you safe and resolve your issue the "right" way.<br />
<br />
A "Cannot find...", "Cannot start..., "Cannot load...". "Could not run..." Cannot run" "Error loading..." or
<br />
"specific module could not be found" message at startup could be related to some program that has been uninstalled and did not do a good job of cleaning up after itself leaving behind leftover startup entries in your configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possibility is malware that was set to run at startup but the referenced file(s) has been deleted after a malware scan leaving behind a registry entry or startup item pointing to a file that does not exist. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
It could be from a malicious software removal or an uninstalled application.&nbsp; The entry may have a curious looking name since it was probably generated at random when the malware was installed. If you search your system for the referenced file, you may not
 even find it.<br />
<br />
Windows is trying to load this file but cannot locate it since the file was mostly likely removed during a scan for malicious software.&nbsp; However, an associated orphaned startup parameter or registry entry remains and is telling Windows to load the file when
 you boot up or login.<br />
<br />
You need to remove the referenced entry so Windows stops trying to load or run the file. It may or may not be in the registry but you can find it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Autoruns (see below) will find the item no matter where it is. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you just locate and uncheck the item in msconfig, that disables the item but does not remove the reference to the bogus startup item from your computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The msconfig program is not a startup manager, it is a troubleshooting tool.&nbsp; Disabling things in msconfig
 to put a stop to the messages and thinking your problem is resolved is short sighted and leaves behind a sloppy Windows configuration.&nbsp; Merely disabling the display of a startup error message should not count as a "solution" to the problem.<br />
<br />
If you are comfortable editing the registry you can search for and remove the reference directly from there or remove it using a popular third party tool called Autoruns.&nbsp; The problem may not always be found in the registry though.<br />
<br />
Before making any changes to your registry by hand or with third party tools, be sure to make a manual System Restore point just in case. There is no undo or quit without saving option in regedit.<br />
<br />
You can use Autoruns to find the leftover startup item no matter where it is hiding.&nbsp; Autoruns does not install anything on your computer.&nbsp; It will display all of the startup locations where the reference might be so you can disable it or delete it completely.&nbsp;
 Here is the download link for Autoruns:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Launch Autoruns.exe (or Autoruns64.exe for 64-bit systems), maximize the window so you can see everything and wait for it to finish populating the list of entries.<br />
<br />
When Autoruns is finished scanning your system, it will say "Ready" at the bottom left corner.&nbsp; Autoruns can be a little intimidating at first if you have never see it before since it displays a lot of information.&nbsp; You are really only interested in a couple
 sections.<br />
<br />
Items that show up in a shrimpy color are "unsigned" entries which are usually not a problem.&nbsp; The manufacturer just did not bother to digitally "sign" their files appropriately.<br />
<br />
Items that show up in a yellow color are entries that point to a file, path, location that does not exist so they are suspicious since they probably don't make sense any more. You can choose to delete the yellow ones but sometimes they come back.&nbsp; They probably
 have nothing to do with your issues since they don't "do" anything.<br />
<br />
The problem item is usually in the system startup or user startup entries so click the Logon tab and see if the startup item is there.<br />
<br />
Scroll through the list and look for a startup entry related to the file(s) in the error message.<br />
<br />
If you don't find it in the Logon tab, look for it in the Everything tab.<br />
<br />
You can also click File, Find to search the Logon or Everything tab for all or part of the name of the item.<br />
<br />
Right-click on the offending entry and choose to delete it.&nbsp; If you are not sure what it is, you can just disable it, reboot and if the issue is resolved, then delete the offending entry. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you don't see it in Autoruns you may have to edit the registry and remove the item from the Startup folder there. &nbsp;<br />
Autoruns should display the same information though.</p>

</p><p>Another possibility is malware that was set to run at startup but the referenced file(s) has been deleted after a malware scan leaving behind a registry entry or startup item pointing to a file that does not exist. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
It could be from a malicious software removal or an uninstalled application.&nbsp; The entry may have a curious looking name since it was probably generated at random when the malware was installed. If you search your system for the referenced file, you may not
 even find it.<br />
<br />
Windows is trying to load this file but cannot locate it since the file was mostly likely removed during a scan for malicious software.&nbsp; However, an associated orphaned startup parameter or registry entry remains and is telling Windows to load the file when
 you boot up or login.<br />
<br />
You need to remove the referenced entry so Windows stops trying to load or run the file. It may or may not be in the registry but you can find it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Autoruns (see below) will find the item no matter where it is. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you just locate and uncheck the item in msconfig, that disables the item but does not remove the reference to the bogus startup item from your computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The msconfig program is not a startup manager, it is a troubleshooting tool.&nbsp; Disabling things in msconfig
 to put a stop to the messages and thinking your problem is resolved is short sighted and leaves behind a sloppy Windows configuration.&nbsp; Merely disabling the display of a startup error message should not count as a "solution" to the problem.<br />
<br />
If you are comfortable editing the registry you can search for and remove the reference directly from there or remove it using a popular third party tool called Autoruns.&nbsp; The problem may not always be found in the registry though.<br />
<br />
Before making any changes to your registry by hand or with third party tools, be sure to make a manual System Restore point just in case. There is no undo or quit without saving option in regedit.<br />
<br />
You can use Autoruns to find the leftover startup item no matter where it is hiding.&nbsp; Autoruns does not install anything on your computer.&nbsp; It will display all of the startup locations where the reference might be so you can disable it or delete it completely.&nbsp;
 Here is the download link for Autoruns:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Launch Autoruns.exe (or Autoruns64.exe for 64-bit systems), maximize the window so you can see everything and wait for it to finish populating the list of entries.<br />
<br />
When Autoruns is finished scanning your system, it will say "Ready" at the bottom left corner.&nbsp; Autoruns can be a little intimidating at first if you have never see it before since it displays a lot of information.&nbsp; You are really only interested in a couple
 sections.<br />
<br />
Items that show up in a shrimpy color are "unsigned" entries which are usually not a problem.&nbsp; The manufacturer just did not bother to digitally "sign" their files appropriately.<br />
<br />
Items that show up in a yellow color are entries that point to a file, path, location that does not exist so they are suspicious since they probably don't make sense any more. You can choose to delete the yellow ones but sometimes they come back.&nbsp; They probably
 have nothing to do with your issues since they don't "do" anything.<br />
<br />
The problem item is usually in the system startup or user startup entries so click the Logon tab and see if the startup item is there.<br />
<br />
Scroll through the list and look for a startup entry related to the file(s) in the error message.<br />
<br />
If you don't find it in the Logon tab, look for it in the Everything tab.<br />
<br />
You can also click File, Find to search the Logon or Everything tab for all or part of the name of the item.<br />
<br />
Right-click on the offending entry and choose to delete it.&nbsp; If you are not sure what it is, you can just disable it, reboot and if the issue is resolved, then delete the offending entry. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you don't see it in Autoruns you may have to edit the registry and remove the item from the Startup folder there. &nbsp;<br />
Autoruns should display the same information though.</p>

<p>I did not remove this program.... Windows 10 update did! Now I ask You Microsoft to fix this issue. I have a copy Windows 10 made of the files and software it removed when installing update. I also have a copy (Screen shot) of error message. But how to post
 here....</p>

<h2>            Skype account cross connection</h2>
                    My friend signed up for Skype using my email address (Hotmail), since he didn't have one at the time, before Microsoft bought Skype OR Hotmail. Now his Skype is attached to my Microsoft account, and my Skype is floating unconnected to anything. Can I switch
 the accounts or at least change the Skype name (his account) attached to my Microsoft account (Hotmail)? I have seen that "it is impossible" in other help files and ask threads, but there MUST be a way to get an exception through, especially when this is neither
 of our faults that you bought both companies and attached our accounts without permission.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There used to be an option to unlink Skype accounts from Microsoft accounts but that was removed since Skype's full migration to Microsoft. Now, you can no longer unbind Skype from a Microsoft account if they were previously linked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are thinking of changing the Skype Name attached to your Microsoft account, it is also not possible I'm afraid. Also, removing your friend's Skype Name as an
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12407/microsoft-account-how-to-manage-aliases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
alias of your Microsoft account</a>will make it unusable for your friend for signing in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, what you're trying to do is no longer possible.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Administrator</h2>
                    I just got an HP desktop computer yesterday. I was setting up accounts and I set all of them to local users, including mine. So I think that I don't have an administrator account anymore and when I try to do something in the settings it says that I need
 to enter an admin user account name and password. I can't figure out how to change my account back to the admin account. I googled it and tried to do things like going to the control panel and going to users and managing my account but it won't let me unless
 I am an admin. I really need help! Thank you!

            Hello Hannah,
<br />
<br />You mix 2 notions :
<br />Local account/Microsoft account
<br />Admin account/user account
<br />Combinations are possible, a local account can be admin of course
<br />
<br />
<br />The easiest way to solve it is to reset the password on login screen. 
<br />
<br /> You can get to reset by restarting your PC from the sign-in screen. Press the Windows logo key  +L to get to the sign-in screen, and then hold the Shift key while you select Power  &gt; Restart in the lower-right corner of the screen. After your PC restarts, select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC.
<br />Then choose the option Remove everything.

<br />
<br />Let me know if it helps.

<h2>            Random Drive showing up, almost full, nothing inside</h2>
                    <p>I just recently updated my windows 10 pc, and when I went into file explorer I was greeted with what seems to be a new drive (E:) However, I only have 2 hard drives in my pc (SSD, HDD). When inspecting this drive it seems there is nothing inside of it, despite
 being almost full. This is the annoying thing, windows is constantly (every 5 mins) asking me to empty the drive because its almost full and when I click the prompt it says nothing is inside of it. One other thing, when i scan with malware bytes it says it
 scanned 8 items, even though nothing is inside. I am the administrator of this pc and Im getting really confused as to why this random drive has popped up and why windows is constantly asking me to clean the drive even though nothing is inside. Screenshots
 attached.</p>

            This is one of the known issues with the update as Recovery partition should be hidden and is accidentally assigned a drive letter. <br />Right-click Start&gt;Command Prompt(admin) <br />Type in the following: <br />diskpart <br />list volume <br />select volume 3 <br />Replace 3 with the number of the volume which is assigned a drive letter. (In hundreds of MBs) <br />remove letter="G" <br />Replace G with the Recovery drive letter. <br /><br />Don't worry, removing a drive letter would not cause any harm to your device.

            It has been happening with new update that new drive is getting uncovered. You can do following to hide it and there will no harm anywhere.
<br />
<br />Type diskpart in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) &gt; Right click on Diskpart and run as Administrator
<br />Give following command and Enter: 
<br />select volume e
<br />Give following command and Enter: 
<br />remove letter=e

            Hi MercXD, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />list volume
<br />
<br />Note down the letter associated with that new drive
<br />
<br />Run these commands one at a time and hit Enter (replace X with the correct drive letter)
<br />
<br />select volume X
<br />
<br />remove letter=X
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and restart your PC       
        </p>

<h2>            Windows 7 fails to install Nvidia latest driver</h2>
                    I have tried to install the latest Nvidia drivers for my GF295 card. It goes through the usual routine until the end when it says completed but also says "No update to your machine was made try again later" How can I get round this error. I have never
 known so many bluse screens since 7 mainly AP_index type. Even MS's own software Fligt Sim 9 crashes with what may appear Dispaly driver errors. Can anyone help please?<br />

<p><span><span>Hi Stuart 74,</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Try booting the computer in clean boot and then install the driver. To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal
 set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Steps to
<strong>perform clean boot</strong> and check if you have the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

                    <p>I used a suspect Wi-Fi this morning, and EMET 4.1 has stopped me from using my default browser, which is Chrome. My IE 11 is fully capable, but I keep it as a backup. Every time I attempt to use Chrome, EMET notifies me that it has detected caller mitigation,

            <p>Thank you so much. I am afraid it was an attack. I had stupidly hooked up to an unsecured WIFI, and as soon as I opened Chrome, EMET notified me, and shut down Chrome. I am utilizing EMET 4.1 in its most active role, to shut down apps when notified of exploit.
 I had to use IE, which I keep silent for just that purpose, to get on the forums last night. I have since run Malwarebytes in a full scan, and nothing came up. I am on Chrome now, having disabled the caller mitigation in EMET 4.1, and it is working properly.
 I utilize the TCPIPUTILS app to explore my browser online. I did a port scan, and found no open ports. I utilize the Avast Internet Security Secure Line function, with Avast's headquarters in Prague now being my 'location' on their VPN. I am masked, and have
 noticed no further untoward behavior in Chrome. I will run Defender, and run both a boot scan and full system scan in Avast later. My question is this: Did Microsoft receive any of the forwarded notifications that EMET requested be sent. This is important.
 They would have been from Genda-PC. All other mitigations remain active in EMET, and after its good performance yesterday, I am loathe to disable any other functionality. It works better than anything except Avast, and honestly, I do not think Avast would
 have been able to stop the exploit before it was too late. I reiterate, this was an exploit. EMET 4.1 merely functions as an early warning system. Configured and deployed to its optimal functionality, which for me means full application protection of as many
 executable applications as possible, has afforded me protection with which I am extremely pleased.</p>

            <p>Hello Baran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you using EMET to protect any of your software?</li><li>Is your system connected to a <strong><em>domain network</em></strong>?</li></ol>
<p>Basically, the security mitigation technologies that EMET uses have an application-compatibility risk. Some applications rely on exactly the behavior that the mitigations block. Therefore, you may refer to the EMET user's guide to individually enable and
 disable that specific mitigation related to Google Chrome.</p>
<p>You may also try uninstalling and reinstalling the Google chrome application and check if the issue persists.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In addition to that, you may also post your question onto the support forum for Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET).</p>

<h3> pat785  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Uninstall&#34; option missing in the Start Menu of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have got multiple programs that I do not want on my computer. Such programs include Edge, Groove Music, Film &amp; TV, Weather, OneNote, Maps, Messaging, and many more. Unfortunately the "uninstall" option is missing; neither is it possible to remove these
 programs from the "Programs and Features" option. How can I get this junk of my PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, according to EU law; you have the right to remove any and all programs that aren't needed for the Operating System to run. I don't have the article stating this; but Microsoft went to court and lost when they integrated Internet Explorer
 in the normal Windows Explorer on WinXP. Of course, Microsoft wouldn't do such a mistake again, wouldn't they?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, I also have to say that I am very upset that I have to *manually* remove such junk, instead of choosing what programs I want to have with my OS.</p>

<h2>            Adding an external touchscreen Monitor to a laptop</h2>
                    
<p>I have added an external touchscreen monitor to my laptop, which is ok if I want to have the computer display on one monitor only. However if I select 'duplicate these displays' in 'Multiple Displays"&nbsp; in Screen Resolution it will identify both screens,
 but the display will not show on the external touchscreen.&nbsp; If I select "extend these displays' I can choose which screen to use, but I want the display on both screens.&nbsp; Can anyone tell methis is possible. I have Windows Vista on another laptop and I have
 no problem.&nbsp;</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
This issue may occur if laptop graphic adapters only support one display at one time. You may also check the graphics crad utility software if there is an option to change the settings to duplicate the monitor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have found some articles which might help you in setting up the duplicate monitors.</div>

            <p>Hi Don,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p><br />
I would like to know, did you install the printer driver for Windows 8 after you upgraded to Windows 8?</p>
<p><br />
Follow the troubleshooting methods given here. </p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 1: Run the Printer Troubleshooter. </strong></p>
<p><br />
If your computer is having problems printing, try using the Printer troubleshooter to fix the problem. It makes sure that a printer is connected to your computer, and it checks for common issues such as whether the printer has enough paper and toner to complete
 printing your document<br />
<br />
Follow the steps given below to run this troubleshooter: </p>
<p><br />
a) Press <strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>W </strong>together.<br />
b) Write <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>in the search box right up corner and hit enter.<br />
c) Click on <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>tab. <br />
d) Click on <strong>view all </strong>option on the upper left corner. <br />
e) Select the <strong>Printer </strong>options from the list. <br />
f) Click on <strong>Next </strong>and follow the steps to perform this troubleshooter.
</p>
<p><br />

    <title>BC games don&#39;t auto connect to LIVE on Original XB1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stabacadaver  say:</h3>
<h2>            BC games don&#39;t auto connect to LIVE on Original XB1</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I boot a BC game it automatically signs into my profile/gamertag, but it does not connect to LIVE. &nbsp;I have to push menu and view and select connect to LIVE in order for it to connect. &nbsp;I've confirmed with others that they don't have to do this and
 that it auto signs into LIVE on their BC games. &nbsp;Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried clearing local xbox 360 storage on the XB1 (which makes me download my 360 profile again) and that didn't help. &nbsp;Thank you!</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply! &nbsp;I just tried disconnecting power and that didn't work. &nbsp;I explained in my original question that I already deleted the 360 profile and downloaded it again. &nbsp;When you say "remove your account" are you talking about something else?</p>

<p><strong>I have limited restore dates and have done that--no change.&nbsp; </strong>

<p><strong>Please let me know directions to restore/correct this error!&nbsp; I saw other comments, but no one has easy directions of fix.&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp;</strong></p>

                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 7 from Windows 10 I managed to re-create my childrens accounts (with some difficulty), however now they find thay their internet access is awful.</p>
<p>Generally we use Firefox now for exampe they cannot access Google the error message is "The page you are trying to view cannot be shown becuase the authenticity of the received data could not be verified".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similar problems occur with Opera and Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Kaspersky 2015 Total Protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have turned off all internet blocking on Kaspersky and in Microsoft Family accounts</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can this be resolved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the administrator I have none of these problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched Google and Microsoft but none seem to provide an answer.</p>

            <p>I wish support staff would read the question and then answer it not copy and paste the standard "Family safety setting" answers book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated above I have turned off all of the internet blocking of both Microsoft Family Settings and my internet security software, Kaspersky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue only occurs for family members and not guest users so I expect it is related to Microsofts Family Safety software also note there are known issues with Microsoft when setting up family members i.e. you can't always do this

            <p>upgraded to 10 recently and am just now starting to add my children and am finding the same issues. Have read instructions and done everything as instructed but still receive " you must be online the first time to complete your account setup" when trying
 to logon to tablet with child acct. Tried deleting and re-adding, even tried giving admin rights to child user but still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any updates to this? I think macbk pro's are in our future. never thought I'd be an apple user but now with kids research seems to show they are much better designed for families.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 and Email Calendar invite attachments</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Recently updated to Windows 10 and love the email and calendar features.&nbsp; However I just realized attachments are not coming through to my calendar or email via the new applications in Windows 10.&nbsp; They appear fine in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how I see the attachments and access them?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is a legitimate defect / limitation in the product, not a matter of troubleshooting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a sender adds attachment to outlook invitation, it's only visible in the inbox, but once I accept the invitation, the attachment can be no longer accessed via calendar.</p>
