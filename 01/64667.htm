<p>Desktop running Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 3 (I'm told it's 32 bit: System Type says X86-based PC) with USB direct connect to LaserJet.&nbsp; After years of no problems and even using the Scanner utility within the last week, yesterday I could
 not access the Scanner utility through either the HP Director or the LaserJet itself.&nbsp; I contacted HP Support.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;tech&nbsp;had me download what he said was the full program for the LaserJet from this site:&nbsp;<span><span>

 (the program downloaded hp_CLJ_2820-2840_Full_Solution_AMWE.exe); do a complete uninstall of the HP software; and install the downloaded program.&nbsp; Now my computer cannot even find the HP Director, and the Toolbox utility that manages settings doesn't even
 show a Scanner tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had another chat with an HP tech this morning.&nbsp; She stated: "The computer has service pack 3 installed which is causing this issue.&nbsp; Please note that service pack 3 comes with high security filies which mot of the times doesn't allow the complete printer
 software to install properly.&nbsp; Please get service pack 2 install on the computer to avoid such issues in near future."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, please, what do I do now -- and how do I do it?&nbsp; I'm not computer literate.&nbsp; I'm not even sure I'm posting to the right forum.&nbsp; But I am very good at following step-by-step instructions if they are clear.&nbsp; I see that Microsoft will be discontinuing
 support on Service Pack 2 in July.&nbsp; Most importantly, I need the full use of all of the utilities in my LaserJet 2840.&nbsp; Is there a way to keep Service Pack 3 and still be able to use all of its utilities?</p>
<p>In addition, I am now unable to connect to the printer through my wireless network.</p>

<p>Hello Ronnie,</p>
<p>Did you uninstall this HP software completely?</p>
<p>Be sure that everything was uninstalled from the Add or remove programs feature of your Windows XP (you can access directly going to Start menu | Run | appwiz.cpl)</p>
<p>Please do again an uninstall of all the printer software related and then perform a new clean installation. It may be needed to reboot the computer so the memory and services are cleaned up.</p>

<p>Hi, Dantecit0, and first, let me thank you for getting back to me.&nbsp; Being computer-illiterate is both frightening and frustrating when facing these problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As recommended by the HP Tech yesterday, I uninstalled the HP software by using the HP uninstall utility, then went through my Programs folder in an explore window,&nbsp;and very carefully deleted everything in the folders that had HP and Hewlett-Packard on them,
 then deleted those folders as well.&nbsp; He suggested I do the uninstall that way, because the HP Uninstall is supposed to do a "clean" uninstall.&nbsp; After the uninstall, I did a restart.&nbsp; Then I ran the .exe program they gave me.&nbsp; When that was done, I did another
 restart, which landed me where my forum post said.&nbsp; I did notice, however, that after the uninstall, deletions and the reboot, the shortcuts to the utilities (Fax, Toolbox, and Director still were on the monitor desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if that information helps or makes any difference, but thought I should share it with you.&nbsp; To your knowledge, is there a Service Pack 3 conflict with this program?</p>

<p>Hi Ronnie,</p>
<p>It does help, I have a clear vision on what your problem here is.</p>
<p>As I understood, after you used the HP uninstall utility it kept the icons in your desktop, and this does not seem to be a "clean" uninstall.</p>
<p>I would suggest, if you had installed the software again, to remove everything HP printer related software from the Add or remove programs feature to ensure that Windows deletes all the necessary registry keys, drivers and so on.</p>
<p>This proprietary tool seems to do not work properly, so I would not recommend to use it. After you uninstall everything from Add or Remove programs, please reboot your machine and then after that try to install everything again. If you downloaded the latest
 drivers, then try to install with that, if you do not have the latest drivers, try downloading them from the Official HP page here:</p>
<p>http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareIndex.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;prodNameId=445197&amp;prodTypeId=18972&amp;prodSeriesId=445194&amp;swLang=8&amp;taskId=135&amp;swEnvOID=228#1130</p>
<p>I think that this SP3 only adds security patches and hotfixes, but it does not modify any compatibility from the SP2.</p>
<p>Please keep me posted about any news, so we can keep troubleshooting this problem.</p>

<p>Hi, Dantecit0.&nbsp; I'm sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you.&nbsp; Many non-computer things have kept me running (job deadlines, private life problems, etc.&nbsp; Life is trying to be a little overwhelming just now)!&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you recommended, I uninstalled the HP program, this time through the Windows Uninstall utility; restarted;&nbsp;reinstalled it from the link HP gave me noted above; and restarted again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This uninstall also did not remove the desktop shortcuts (HP Director, Hp Laser Jet Toolbox, and HP Laser Jet Send Fax).&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reinstallation and restarting, the HP Director utility shortcut now opens the&nbsp;Director selection&nbsp;window, and also there now is a "Scan to ..." tab in the Toolbox utility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when I click on "Scan Document" in the Director, I get an error message, "An error occurred communicating with the scanning device.&nbsp; Please ensure that the scanning device is connected properly and try again."&nbsp; When I click on the "Send Fax" shortcut,
 or the "Send Fax" choice in the Director window, I get "Unable to Send Fax: The device is disconnected or powered off."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked the connection: it is connected.&nbsp; I can print from the desktop that is direct connected to the HP 2840 AOI (but now I can't print through my wireless home network).&nbsp; I can fax directly from the HP 2840 AOI.&nbsp; The HP 2840 AOI sees the file I
 entered in the Toolbox to hold completed scans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, on trying to scan to that file from the 2840 AOI, the Toolbox says, under "Device Status", "An unknown error occurred.&nbsp; Make certain that the device's power cord is plugged in, the power is turned on, and that all the cables are properly connected.&nbsp;
 Check the Troubleshooting tab or product documentation for more information."</p>
<p>I checked the Troubleshooting tab, and followed its instructions.&nbsp; No changes.</p>
<p>I did go to the Official HP page you listed (copied and pasted to browser so it was accurate).&nbsp; There are several choices there.&nbsp; I'm sorry for my ignorance, but don't know which of those drivers should I download -- or all of them?&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in installing
 them, do they "take out the old and replace with the new", do they do something separate, or is there something I need to uninstall so they can work right?</p>
<p>Thank you, Dantecit0.&nbsp; I hope I'm not being too much of a problem!</p>

<p>Hi Ronnie, Thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>I have a couple of questions about the way you connect to this printer.</p>
<p>As this is a LaserJet AIO Workstation, probably it is connected to the Network to provide service to more persons.</p>
<p>We will need to verify that the driver is configured properly to the IP address of this printer, as it need to be pointed to this.</p>
<p>If you don't know how to verify this please let me know.</p>

<p>Hi, Dantecit0.</p>
<p>True, the HP Color Laser Jet 2840 is an AIO (printer, copier, scanner and fax; it also has a couple of little card-readers).&nbsp; I don't know about it being a "workstation", I only can describe it to you.&nbsp; It is directly-connected by USB to the desktop.&nbsp; Until
 these problems, I also could access it from my laptop by the wireless router that also is directly connected to the desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but I don't know how to determine or verify if the driver is configured properly.&nbsp; Are you able to help me with that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, as I mentioned above, you showed me a link to the Official HP site and suggested I download drivers from there.&nbsp; I don't know which to download.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you, Dantecit0.&nbsp; I appreciate your patience with my lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>Hi Ronnie,</p>
<p>The link you pasted in the first post is the right package to download.</p>
<p>I think that you will need to modify your connectivity configuration to get this working properly...</p>
<p>As you may know, this printer is capable to be connected through USB and Ethernet, if you use the printer connected with the USB cable, you may not have the whole functionality for other computers.</p>
<p>The best way to get this working (With SP1, SP2, SP3 or even UNIX / Linux) is using it connected through Ethernet (The network cable) to the router, and, in that way, install the software in each machine you need (Desktop, Laptop, Server, etc). This Software
 package allows you to install this printer from the network, and with this installation, you'll ensure that all the computers have connectivity to this printer while connected (through cable or wifi) to the network.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you need assistance to configure this.</p>

<p>Hi, Dantecit0.</p>
<p>O, dear, now I'm badly confused.&nbsp; Of the problems I've mentioned, the one that I need solved first is getting the scan and fax communications to work between the printer and the desktop.</p>
<p>Until this problem surfaced, both of those were fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I reinstalled the program as you suggested, I carefully followed the installation instructions for connecting it.&nbsp; Those instructions don't say anything about an Ethernet cable.&nbsp; When I try to scan or fax between the printer and the computer - and it's
 the same USB direct-connect to the desktop that it's always had - it gives me the above-mentioned error message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe, rather than trying to figure out all these problems at once, we should focus on the communication problem for the scan and fax utilities, through the direct connection to the desktop?&nbsp; Can we look at the problem of printing through the wireless from
 the laptop after we solve the scan/fax communication problem?</p>
<p>I'm just thinking, here: you're smarter about this stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I need to find out how to get this cable you mention?&nbsp; It has always used the one that's on it, which is also the only one that came with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm curious.&nbsp; Why can the desktop communicate with the printer to print from the desktop, and the printer can recognize the desktop setting up the file to scan to, but they don't "talk" to each other to achieve fax/scan?&nbsp; It's all the same connection, isn't
 it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, Dantecit0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had no response to my last reply to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consequently, I again uninstalled and reinstalled the program another 3 times.&nbsp; Each time, I carefully followed the video with its prompts supplied with the installation disk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the last re-install, I have no idea why, but everything - scanner, printing, faxing and copying (both to and from the AIO), are now working as they had, via direct-connect to the desktop, in the past.</p>
<p>Where it was giving communication errors, it now gives none.</p>
<p>Completely perplexed, I am nonetheless grateful for the time and thought you gave to this problem.&nbsp; Now, onward, to trying to print through the wireless network from my laptop!</p>
<p>Ronnie.</p>

<p>Hi Ronnie,</p>
<p>I'm sorry to not answer to you before, I was investigating about this issue you had.</p>
<p>About the Network Cable configuration, it is the Best Practice to get every printer service available in all the computers, not only on the Desktop (I mean scanner, fax, and printer from each computer).</p>
<p>I'm glad to hear that you could get this working, sometimes in Windows, some installations leaves some registry entries after the uninstall, and this could cause this kind of problems. Probably, this was resolved with the last uninstallation you made, it
 probably removed every registry entry and it allowed you to install properly the software after that.</p>
<p>I hope you could use your printer properly in the future!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>In Windows Explorer there are duplicate listings of the file names. One under my User Name and the other under Libraries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use the listing under my User Name then there is no problem with setting the Folder options. Under the Libraries listing the&nbsp; Options -&gt; Change folder and search options -&gt;&nbsp;View tab, the Apply button is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My question now is why do we have the duplicate listings?</strong> Makes no sense to me and I can't find any plausible explanation for it.</p>

            This has caused me much confusion also. If I'm not careful when i am trying to clean up my folders and move some files, if I move them to the library instead of the user, it creates copies and then I have THREE copies, then try to fix that, which is real
 fun when, out of the blue, explorer decides to JUMP TO THE TOP of the list just as I release my files where I want them. NOW I have to track THEM down because it doesn't tell you, "Files moved to _____", so you have no idea where they went. Fun.

            <p>You only have one copy of the file, but it is listed in two places. The "real" location is under your user name. Libraries show the contents of a whole group of folders in one place. If you find it confusing, just don't use Libraries at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main thing to remember is if you delete a file in one of the locations, it no longer appears in the other(s) so you can't use them as a backup or safety net.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of people don't like Libraries and find them confusing. I like them, particularly the Pictures one. I have all my photos organised in folders but if I want to find an image and aren't sure where it is I can look in the Pictures Library and see them
 all in one list. Same for Music.</p>

            I get the idea, at least, from your explanation. I pretty much keep my photos in a separate file-video also-so libraries is pretty much just duplicating that folder. Now that you explain it, I can just hide it (hope you can do that). I think I developed
 my aversion to it because Explorer keeps jumping up to the top of whatever list I am on at crazy times and I wind up dropping all kinds of files in all kinds of places. Thanks for the explanation. So now I can start a new thread about why Explorer does that...

    <title>Surface Camera Windows Hello SDK - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Camera Windows Hello SDK</h2>
                    I was wondering if there's a way to programmatically access the depth camera on my Surface Pro 4?<br />
I stumbled across a couple of same questions, which suggest that the installed camera is not RealSense Intel camera and hence its SDK cannot be used. But is there really no way to get the depth images and/or 3D scan using the built-in camera?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.

    <title>Internal Speakers not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kendragonzalez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internal Speakers not working</h2>
                    <p>For awhile now whenever I'd join a discord, the group voice chat application, my audio wouldn't pick up until I messed with the settings a thousand times. To try to solve this, I plugged in a headset. For some reason that seemed to wipe out my internal speakers
 all together. I can no longer hear audio unless my Bluetooth headset is connected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the bottom right of the task bar, the speaker has a red X over it and if I try to select an output only the Bluetooth headphones pop up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to access the Control Panel and then the sound option, no other sound outputs appear but the Bluetooth headphones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what I did but windows refuses to pick the sound back up. I also have no idea if I can reinstall a speaker system from the Windows company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please suggest to me ways to fix this problem whenever you get a chance. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Kendra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you inform me on what headset you use when your audio device can't pick up when you're in a Discord call? With the information on your post, it seems that the Bluetooth headset you're using is being set as the default output/input whenever it's connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I'd like for you to try these Troubleshooting options in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> on your keyboard, type <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> and click the search result.</li><li>On the list, choose <strong>Playing audio</strong> and then click <strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</li><li>After troubleshooting is done, on the same list, click <strong>Recording Audio</strong> and click
<strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.<br />
<br />
Note: The troubleshooters would show up messages of what it was able to find and repair. Also, it would show up issues it was unable to repair and I request that you provide these so that I can have an idea on what's the probable cause of your issue.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll be waiting for your reply.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to download Fortnite because I'm having problems with it and I noticed that my connection is really slow, so I opened task manager and found that my entire PC is using ~8% of my network(8-12 megabits per second) which I find strange when downloading
 a large game it should be at 60-75% which is what it used to be when downloading things(I remember a while ago when downloading something from Steam it was at ~6.5MBps(~50Mbps). I did an Ookla speed test on my&nbsp;PC and it was just scraping 3Mbps, I then did
 it on my phone, 65Mbps (even though the max speed is supposed to be 52Mbps)and they're both connected to the same network and the PC and phone are within a metre of each other. I've tried restarting my computer, turning it off at the plug then waiting then
 starting it up again, I've forgotten the network from the network panel and reconnected and restarting the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extra information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- OS: Windows 10</p>
<p>- Ethernet can't happen for reasons, if that's a solution that you would offer me, then no can't do it.</p>
<p>- PC specs: Don't really feel like they matter but it's almost 2 years old and has above average specs. If it helps with a solution then ask and I'll post them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be much appreciated.</p>

            First you should run Internet Connections / Hardware &amp; devices Troubleshooter and then execute Microsoft recommended troubleshooting steps. Update me once done.
<br />
<br />A. Run Internet Connections Troubleshooter / Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Click Internet Connections &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />B. Head to following Microsoft Help Link and execute the steps there
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br />Following is the content of the Help which you should try
<br />
<br />Things to try first
<br />Run the Network troubleshooter followed by networking commands
<br />Update the network adapter driver
<br />Roll back the network adapter driver
<br />Temporarily turn off firewalls
<br />Temporarily turn off any antivirus or malware-prevention software
<br />Uninstall the network adapter driver and restart
<br />Use network reset to reinstall network devices

<p>I just tried it all but nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A: Internet connections didn't come up with anything, hardware and devices did and it said it made some changes to my system and told me to restart my PC which I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B: I tried everything except turning off firewalls because I don't have any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply anyway.</p>

<br />
<br />C. Did this problem start after any Windows update (To check Windows updates, Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; View Installed update history)

    <title>Touch keyboard keyclick sound can no longer be disabled with RT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikejptc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touch keyboard keyclick sound can no longer be disabled with RT 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I updated my Surface RT to 8.1 last week.&nbsp; Overall, a good improvement.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One problem though... they keyclick sounds from the keyboard are ignoring the toggle in PC settings.&nbsp; I have it off, but is continues to 'pop pop pop' away while I am typing.&nbsp; Did not have the same problem with RT8.0, or the preview version of RT8.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyone else having the same issue?&nbsp; I can mute all of the sound still, but the keyclick toggle should work.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<h2>            Typing in Foreign Languages and Foreign Scripts&#58; accents, umlaut, Japanese, Chinese, diacritics, International Phonetic Alphabet characters, etc.</h2>
                    <p>I love studying foreign languages, foreign cultures, and also English dialects, and I really need to know how to be able to enter text in another language, script, or unusual characters directly as I am typing. As it is right now, I have to obtain the words
 with their unusual character/scripts indirectly by looking them up the internet and then pasting them in. This is very cumbersome, time-consuming, and not always possible. Is there some way to enter unusual characters or diacritics as one types? I used to
 be able to enter Japanese easily on my Mac.</p>

<h2>            xxx is not recognized as an internal or external command</h2>
                    <p>Hello, complete non-expert here. Apologies if this is obvious/in the wrong place etc. etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting up my computer this morning (Windows 7), after selecting my user and entering the password, the Windows desktop did not appear.</p>
<p>The only thing on screen was a cmd type window on a black screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this window it said: "C:\Users\user\Document\2ddd5055.exe" is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</p>
<p>I could access task manager using ctrl alt delete, but couldn't see/access anything else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to do startup repair, but it mentioned unplugging any music devices etc. I didn't have any devices plugged in at this point.</p>
<p>I also tried restoring to an earlier date. This completed but appeared to have no effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

            It appears to be an infection. Scan with a trusted antivirus software or use Malwarebytes.
<div><br />
<div>To solve the message issue, follow the steps (Note: This will solve the message appearing each time you log on to the PC only and will not remove the infection):</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 1:</div>
<div>Go to start-&gt;browse to a folder named Startup-&gt;right click on it-&gt;click Explore and then Explore all users (two different windows will open). Make sure you can see hidden and system files. Look for any suspicious entry, like any shortcuts referring to
 the file "C:\Users\user\Document\2ddd5055.exe". Delete it. Note that Explore and Explore all users are not same.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 2:</div>
<div>Go to start-&gt;type regedit.exe-&gt;press enter. If UAC prompts, click Yes. From the left pane, browse to the following keys (looks like folders):</div>
<div><br />
<div>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</div>
<div>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once a key is selected, on the middle pane, you can see a list of string under data column. Look for the entry C:\Users\user\Document\2ddd5055.exe under Data column. Delete the respective values.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Note: While working with registry editor, do not create/delete/change any unknown values/keys. It may cause stability issues.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now, Close the registry editor, restart the PC and check.</div>

            Hi again -
<br />
<br />1) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />2) Update your drivers from motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><span>Hi Ape.Parky,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the purpose you use the dongle for? Do you use it to connect to Internet?</span></p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Is
 it connected through USB port?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try the steps below and check if it helps you fix the internet connectivity issue on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes there may be some traces of registry left on the computer after removing the programs and features.</span></p>
<p><span>To remove Bearshare completely from your computer, Backup your registry and system, and set a restore point in case of a
 mistake.<br />
<br />
Delete any Registry entries added by Bearshare.&nbsp;To do so, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the start search box type ‘Regedit’ (without quotes) and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the registry editor, click on Edit and click on Find.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the box type Bearshare and search for the registry entries and remove all the entries for Bearshare.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> This section, method,
 or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you
 modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft
 Knowledge Base: </span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;

<p><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Check
 for the folder Bearshare.</span></p>
<p><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>If
 you find the folder delete it from the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also put the computer in a clean boot state and check if any third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below and follow the steps to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the above
 KB article to narrow down the exact source. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I woke up this morning to find my Windows 7 PC in some wierd state.&nbsp; The desktop is completely black, though the curso still moves.&nbsp; I tried ctrl-alt-del to get to the task manager, but the system does not respond to the command.&nbsp; Is there a way in which
 I can get back to the "last known good configuration" and try and boot into that?&nbsp; When I boot the system and hit F12, I do see the HD and everything looks fine.&nbsp; The system does a dskchk and everything is clean there.&nbsp; Any thoughts?</p>

</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 over the weekend and my external hard drives no longer work. Can you help?<br />
<br />
My laptop recognises the drives when I plug them in but I get an error message "Initial Job Pending" on each drive in the Seagate Dashboard and my backup log has been wiped clean.<br />
<br />
I only got my drives working on Saturday after a week and a half back and forward with Seagate, so its incredibly frustrating to find myself back to square one when I upgraded. I'm in constant contact with Seagate but their email support is pretty poor with
 long emails with "solutions" but no explanation really about how to implement those solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Seagate's last email one of their solutions was this "<span>Take a registry settings backup and delete the Seagate folder in registry editor. Then restart the PC.&nbsp; Note: A small mistake in handling registry files may lead to system
 crash (so better opt for Microsoft Support on handling registry files). So we request you be cautious and please make a note on what you are deleting in registry folder."<br />
<br />
Putting aside that I've no idea of how to take a registry settings back up, I did get nervous when they said this could lead to a systems crash.<br />
<br />
Do you have a simple solution to get my drives working? I figure I can't be the only one who is having this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks</span></p>
<p><span>Andrea</span></p>

            <p>Did you installed any software for your Seagate Hard Disk?</p>
<p>If yes, unplug your Drive try uninstall it and restart your PC and then insert your Seagate Hard Disk and see whether Windows is able to recognize it.</p>
<p>If you want to delete registry key, then you must backup your registry, steps to perform backup are posted here:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/322756</a>
</p>
<p>After you did this, then you may delete registry.</p>
<p>It is always good idea to create Restore Point before delete Registry too.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I did install software to go with my Seagate Hard Drive. <br />
<br />
Do you mean plug my drives in (to see if windows will recognise them) BEFORE I reinstall the Seagate software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Kalpana<br />
<br />
I've checked for Windows Updates and my laptop is all up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to that link I can't do the hardware trouble shooter as that tool isn't supported by Windows 10 (!) so I can't run it. The other link for fixing USB problems worked fine - I ran it and it came up with the message that it wasn't fixed as the USB
 drive couldn't be ejected. Is that an issue or is that normal for external hard drives?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll now go and try <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5963c3d7-8f1e-4d44-b98c-8d32e5db5760" title="Cyber_Defend_Team">

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now tried your suggestion (unplug Drive,&nbsp;uninstall Drive software and restart your PC). Windows recognise both drives without the Seagate software installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I haven't deleted the&nbsp;registry key at this stage as I'd like to see what else you suggest first.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you haven't tried, you might go into the Device Manager and if the drive shows up, right click and check the properties for any settings you might need to change.</p>

            <p>I don't really run backups but connect the drive when I want to create a System Image or for any other storage I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume you are running a Win 10 approved version of the software?&nbsp; If the drive had been configured with an earlier version there may be some conflict with that configuration.&nbsp; If you can't get it to work the way you want you might be able to clean the
 drive and start testing with just a newly formatted drive and no extra software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know for sure the Seagate software is involved but Seagate should know by now, although some of the Windows Updates may change your system and cause problems.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try&nbsp;the drives on a different device and check if it works.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Back up&#59; 2155348249 and 0x81000019</h2>
                    
<p>New to windows 7 and wanted to back up<br />
bought a western Ditigial Passport 1tb drive My C: drive is 465.66gb and my system reserved is 100mb<br />
back up which im only using 30mb of&nbsp;. Volume Shadow copy is Running.</p>
<p>see back starts up, gets to 7% then crashes to those two error messages</p>
<p>If I dont back up system image I still get the same message. the drive works fine I just finished copying 75gb to it so its not the drive. it was slow but what USB drive isnt.</p>
<p>I have read all discussion regarding this problem and it appears no one has solutions some say it the hidden partition I dont know but any help would be helpful</p>

<p>its actually really sad that windows cant back up their own data</p>
