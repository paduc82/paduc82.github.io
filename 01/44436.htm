                    <p>I cannot upgrade to the latest version of Windows 10 on my Asus E200H.I have removed as much data as I can without removing operating system files but am informed that I still require 8gb of space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the advice from this site I also tried using the media tool but again with the same results? that 8gb space is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Placing 128gb Memory stick in the USB port does not help as no option is not&nbsp; given to use the Memory stick as a back media for the upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would buying a&nbsp; new version of windows 10 help and doing a fresh install ?</p>

            Hi Andrew.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You would never need to buy a new copy of WIndows 10 as the license you have on that PC is good for it's life and can be reinstalled any way and time you want and it will reactivate.  You'd just be wasting your money on a PC that already has Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  
<br />
<br />First here are tips here for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version 1803 since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the  Upgrade Assistant  has already been installed by WIndows Update then I'd remove it and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

            Hi Andrew, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage ask the exact same question here every day . . . 
<br />
<br />If you are, honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you more storage - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />

<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

    <title>Speakers not working properly. How do I fix them. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Speakers not working properly. How do I fix them.</h2>
                    I have a HP with a windows 7 professional operating system that was sent to me by my school. The internal speakers had worked properly until I was in a hurry to attend a class, and I pluged in the microphone that I had never used before because I had always
 used a USB headset which would not have worked in the situation I was in (Multiple people in the same room needed to use the microphone), noticed that the audio was not playing due to the audio port being used (by the microphone), and unplugged them fast.
 During and after the class, if I turned the sound up about past 60% the speakers would make a horrible sounding noise as if all the crickets in the world had begun buzzing in a single room, and the whole time, no matter the volume, the speakers would echo
 every sound they emitted. I plugged in an external speaker and the audio had the same effect. Please help me fix this problem. Thanks in advance.

<h2>            Windows will not reinstall on Acer aspire E1</h2>
                    so I previously posted about getting an update with Windows 10 from Microsoft that rendered my laptop useless. It seems that I cannot roll back anything there is no system restore points and when created I get message that system restore encountered an
 error the error code is not posted it takes for ever to get my antivirus to open all programs are slow at opening some take more than an hour some just won't open. It will not allow me to reinstall Windows 10 from jump drive etc. When I tried to reinstall
 Windows 10 it won't let me. My previous version of Windows 8.1 never had any of these issues. I haven't been able to work nor do my online course as this has caused serious issues. Help please, online exams coming. Event viewer log says update failures, the
 bios settings are correct, most applications are not running properly I can access the Internet, Sfc / scannow runs partially then stops , disk management states my partitions and drives are healthy. This is obviously not the case. Th

<p>Hello Sandi, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for bringing this up. We understand where you're coming from and your frustrations are noted.
<br />
<br />
Here is the complete and updated check list of compatible machines for Windows 10 versions:
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/check-this-list-to-determine-if-your-computer-is/5152bb37-f95d-48a6-b7b2-ad0d5c738923">
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Check this List to Determine if Your Computer is Compatible with the Windows 10</span></em>.
</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We've also reviewed the checklist, and on our understanding, it shows that the Acer Aspire E1 is not compatible with any Windows 10 version.<br />
<br />
If you would manage to do it successfully, please let us know what you've done. <br />
<br />
In case that all failed on Windows 10 for your Aspire E1 Machine, here is where you can download Other versions of Older Windows OS:

<p><strong>my laptop worked fine till i recieved the fall creators update after that it went down hill. Anyone that runs that update is surely going to have problems. As of this morning i no longer have a laptop that is usable &nbsp;anymore. anyone that intends
 to try to reinstall is asking for issues i now am going to be out several hundred dollars for an OS and a hard drive as the hard drive is frozen from trying to reinstall windows 10 with a jump drive. If anyone has a fix to unlock the drive id gladly give it
 a try. As an IT student they certainly dont prepare you for this issue Should it arise when you first start learning how to repair computers My suggestion is for anyone with this issue to take it to a licensed repair person.I can certainly say that when I
 do replace my hard drive and OS I will be reverting back to 8.1 I will definitely never look to another Windows operating system the same again and as soon as my pocketbook will afford I will no longer be with Windows operating systems It will be a Mac</strong></p>

            I also wanted to add that windows 10 works well till you accept the fall creators and the aniversary update. Maybe microsoft developers should focus on that and roll out something that will work for those of us that have this type of issue so it can be
 fixed. What i intended to do was go back to 8.1 then reinstall 10 and hide these specific updates however trying to go back to 8.1 even with a download has infact locked the HDD and now needs to be replaced along with a OS as initally the OS was a preinstall
 of 8.1. Expensive lesson to learn for anyone. Heed my advice people are becoming very dis-satisfied with microsoft and issues like this. It could be bad for the bottom line.

            <p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>One specific example at my agency would be having outlook on one v.desktop and an agency specific application on another (both are easiest when full screen). We regularly need to drag an email from outlook to attach it into our agencies software. This is
 easy at work with a multi monitor setup. On a laptop it entails both outlook and our agency app on one desktop and trying to juggle them around the screen so an outlook email can be dragged onto it to attach the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be wonderful if I could drag an email out of Outlook on one v.desktop and onto our agencies software running on another v.desktop.</p>

    <title>Windows Vista goes to sleep unexpectedly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> merk_man  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Vista goes to sleep unexpectedly</h2>
                    I have a system with a fresh install of Windows Vista Ultimate (32bit) that puts itself to sleep suddenly and unexpextedly 2 to 5 times per day. The power saving settings are set to never sleep or hibernate and the system is set to never turn off the hard
 disk. The system will be up and running (idle) and when we sit down and go to do something like windows
<span>
<span>
mail</span> or CCC Pathways (an automotive estimating program we use) it will suddenly appear to shutdown (no video and power LED flashing). We initially thought this was hardware related but there is an event in the event log (Kernal-Power - The system is
 entering sleep) so we rulled that out. In addition, the motherboard, video,&nbsp;Ram and power supply&nbsp;in this system are brand new (previous video card failed, so we took the oportunity to upgrade). We do not have a sleep button on the keyboard so it is not "accidentally"
 being pressed. Any help with this problem would be greatly appreciated as it is a pain to have to log back in thoughout the day and we plan on using RDP to work from home on a daily basis soon.
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

            hello !<br />
<br />
Thank you for using microsoft answers forum !!<br />
<br />
the problem looks related to power supply.. but you say its brand new.. the thing is that you should get it checked.. as when your system stays idle, it conserves power, and when you wake it ( not from sleep ) it takes power from the SMPS, so you smps might
 not be taking some load..<br />
<br />
now the second thing can be a memory issue.. a referenced memory location might be faulty and as soon as it is used .. it gives the same problem.. now try reinstalling the RAM Chips, else press f8 at system startup and run memory test..<br />

One thing to check is the BIOS on your computer to make sure power saving is turned off in BIOS.&nbsp; Is your computer a laptop or desktop?&nbsp; What is the brand and model?<br />
<br />
There are also different places in Vista where the power settings are controlled.&nbsp; Please refer to this article for much more detail about how to control the power management abilities of Vista:<br />
<br />
When you configure power options for the active power plan in Windows Vista, the changes are not reflected in the Power Options item in Control Panel</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935799" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935799</a><br />
<br />
This behavior occurs because the settings that appear on the System Settings page are derived from the registry settings for the preferred power plan.</p>
<p>Changes that you make to the active power plan do not affect the global settings on the System Settings page, unless you are currently using the preferred power plan. Changes that you make on the System Settings page apply to all power plans. These power
 plans include the active plan and any custom plans that you have created.</p>
<p>Note: By default, the preferred power plan is the Balanced plan in Windows Vista.
<br />
<br />
This article gives you step by step instructions on how to:<br />
How to create a power plan<br />

<h2>            startupscan.dll is not a valid Win32 application error message</h2>
                    Hi Guys,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We're running Windows 8 on a HP 2311gt machine and occassionally we keep getting this pop up of 'Scartupscan.dll is not a valid Win32 application.&nbsp;</div>
<div>As far as we know its not affecting anything, but we can't be sure, it disappears as soon as we move the mouse....its really just an annoyance.&nbsp;</div>
<div>We also have issues with windows defender, it won't open due to error x800b0100....i undertsand it isnt supposed to run when you have antivirus software installed (we have temporary Norton 360 for 30 days) but it would be nice to have it back rather than
 carry on getting the error messages.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried troubleshooting through the system, and although it was reported as fixed, it isnt, tried the DISM.exe cleanup-image check and restore which hasnt helped, and have also tried resetting the PC without affecting our files...which hasnt helped....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone help??</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks :)</div>
                </div>

            <p>You may have malware, startupscan.dll is suspicious from some sites if seen. Download and run
<strong>Malwarebytes</strong> and see if anything quarantined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cannot run 2 anti virus programs at the same time.&nbsp; If you are using Norton, Windows Defender is automatically turned off and only becomes active if the 3 party AV is uninstalled.&nbsp; Should you wish to uninstall Norton, which is a resource hog, use the
 software removal tool from Norton.&nbsp; I would remove Norton to see if the problem still occurs.</p>

<h2>            Turtle Beach 500x - no chat following update</h2>
                    

<p>Following the update to NXOE and the later controller update chat stopped working with my TB500x. &nbsp;I can talk and be heard in party chat however I can't hear anyone. &nbsp;The issue appears similar to others posted except that most report their mic doesn't work.
 &nbsp;In my case the mic works, I can be heard but I can't hear anyone. &nbsp;I have tried reset of both console and headset without resolution.</p>
<p>i appreciate any help! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Connect them to the controller with the MS adapter and a 2.5mm-3.5mm cable. As soon as you connect them you can remove the cable and it works. Looks like the headset isn't picking up all wireless signals anymore.</p>

<p>My buddy has the Turtle Beach Stealth 500X, new Xbox One Dashboad.</p>
<p>About two days ago, game sound is fine, but in party chat we can't hear anyone else, as where everyone else can hear us fine and each other(they don't have Turtle beach headsets)</p>
<p>Starting to think it's an issue with only TBs.</p>

<p>Thanks for the replies! &nbsp;Hopefully Microsoft/Turtle Beach will fix this quickly. &nbsp;I will post the issue on TB's site as well to ensure it is seen by both MS &amp; TB. &nbsp;Although, I have to assume it's an MS problem given the timing/update.</p>

<p>It still doesn't want to run. When I started it it said "it started and then stopped".

 files by using the correct versions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>b. Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.</span></p>

<h2>            Keep disconnecting on halo 4 and games like borderlands 2 </h2>
                    
<p>Hey fellow xbox users,</p>
<p>I have a problem that i keep disconnecting from xbox live in halo 4 matchmaking and spartan ops.&nbsp;<br />
It could take 1 minute to 60 minutes before it disconnects from live. I have a open nat type.<br />
My internet is very fast! And i never have problems with xbox live only when i play halo 4.<br />
Halo 4 is my favorite fps game but now i can't play it anymore because of this problem.<br />
My router is a experia box V8<br />
If anyone reads this please reply!<br />
Also when i try to reconnect after i got disconnected it won't work. I have to wait about 10-20 minutes to reconnect again.<br />
I also tried out everything with the router. I turned it off and wait 30 seconds. Then i could play halo 4 for about 40 mins and it disconnects me again.&nbsp;<br />
I've tried to clear my xbox cache which didn't work at all. Redownloaded my xbox live profile. But this also didn't work&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really really can't wait to play halo 4 normally again</p>

<p>Gorlyjordan&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Games that were removed from the XBOX Store, can I play previous games by playing the physical version&#63;</h2>
                    <p>If I buy a game that has been removed from the XBOX Store from a long time ago but I didn't buy it which I should have, not saying that I'm out of luck, but is there a chance I can play the physical version of the delisted game that I can buy off a local
 store on the XBOX Console and will it save my data too? A friend of mine said to me when I purchase physical disc games, if I was to install them offline, it goes way faster.</p>

            No problem. The only issue you may have is if there is additional DLC. If that was delisted as well there would be no way to get that, but the main game should play just fine.

<p><span>Hi LewBarb,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
You should probably contact Turtle Beach to see if they have a driver for Windows 7.<br />
If not, you might be able to use the Vista driver, but I suggest downloading them from the Turtle Beach website.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if this helps.</span></p>

 was to do a&nbsp; "Password Reset" "Search" with "Settings" highlighted;&nbsp; hence, a new page was produced and in the middle column of the this page is an icon with "Create a password reset disk" is displayed ( as well as many other options).&nbsp; I then attach my USB,
 research the page with the icon with"Create a password reset disk" and then left click this option, this page disappears, I get my desktop, and nothing has been added to my USB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does my Windows 8 have this program installed?&nbsp; If not how do I access it? Lyric989<br />

<h2>            Windows Modules Installer Worker windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could only find troubeshooting for Windows 8 on here, so trying my luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My barely 1 year old HP Envy x360 is constantly using 100% CPU, largely due to WIndows Modules Installer Worker using upwards of 60-80%, even if there are no programs running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After just rebooting the system and deleting any foreign installments the problem is still occurring.</p>
<p>Recently had it checked and serviced at the store I bought it from - they found no faulty, other than Google Chrome could be a potential problem&nbsp;of my CPU usage.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read something about making system updates manual, but that option doesn't seem to exist - or it's hard to find.
<br />
That might solve my problem, if I could work out how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find any solution to this; nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Anna</p>

                    <p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I bought this laptop about a year ago and it is installed as Windows 8.1. I don't know if it was my fault because I keep closing the lid to sleep mode without actually turning my laptop off for some time. About a few days ago, when I decided to turn
 my laptop on again from sleep mode, it got really laggy and not responding so I tried hard reboot and it still does the same thing. I've tried reboot and run virus scan and nothing seem to help?! I checked my hard drive too... PLEASE HELP. I would much appreciate
 it. Ty.</p>

<h2>            Tried to Join a Meeting . . . Can&#39;t.</h2>
                    <p>I am using Google chrome browser 67+. I got an email to join a meeting. &nbsp;I clicked on the join the meeting button. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Skype: "All set! Your meeting is opening in a new window."</p>
<p>I waited for 5 minutes. &nbsp;No window and no signs that it was even trying to open a window. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two Questions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Why did it not open?</p>
<p>2. Are there any "practice meetings" that I could try to to join to make sure my browser is capable of opening a meeting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi WillianÔºå</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, if you have installed Skype for Business (formerly Microsoft Office Communicator), you will use the app to join meeting by default. You can uninstall it and follow the link I provided again. Check if it helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>Sorting Desktop Icons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wayne la borde  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sorting Desktop Icons</h2>
                    I like to organize my desk top icons by groups and have been doing so for years. Now, after a reboot, all the icons are sorted by name and not by the groups I put them in. I'm defining a group as location on the desktop. I've read through similar questions
 and the consensus is to uncheck the auto arrange option on the view. I've done this several times but each reboot&nbsp; sorts by name again. What must I do to cancel the sort order after a re-boot.&nbsp; Thanks.

<p>Hi Wayne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that you're unable to sort desktop icons due to incorrect settings. To better isolate your concern, we'd like to gather more information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes before this issue occur?</li><li>Have you tried booting up your computer in Safe Mode and check if the issue still persist?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

    <title>XP SP3 only boots in Safe&#47;VGA Mode. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> awe al  say:</h3>
<h2>            XP SP3 only boots in Safe&#47;VGA Mode.</h2>
                    
<p>Once I've booted in VGA mode, Windows operates flawlessly and I can change screen resolutions, uninstall video driver, re-install video driver. Everything seems fine until I reboot. Then I'm forced to use VGA mode again.</p>
<p>I tried changing mother board and display card. I tried a repair install.</p>
<p>Seems like the boot process is using the wrong video driver. I get BSOD 0x7E error code if I disable auto reboot on&nbsp;error.</p>
<p>Ideas?</p>

<p>1. First of all uninstall video driver from Safe mode then restart the machine without having any Graphics driver.</p>
<p>2. Now Look if&nbsp; you can boot normally; in this situation windows default display diver will take place in action.</p>
<p>3. Then try to install the latest driver. Do not install the driver which have you already installed. Your graphics driver set up needs to be changed. If you can't decide give us the Display device name.</p>
<p>[Manufacturing company. Model number]</p>
<p>You can also provide the chipset &amp; motherboard details which might be helpful of graphics is onboard. We will find out the relevant information from your reply. Try to reply in details as far as you know about your graphics &amp; system.</p>

<p><strong>But when you wish to use Graphics card don't forget to select it as Primary Graphics adapter or disable OnBoard Graphics from BIOS. If you do not alter your BIOS you will get unexpected Errors.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Never install both Drivers simultaneously as it may cause problem.</strong></p>
<p><strong>First of all decide which graphics/Hardware you want to use. Then inserting/Enabling that hardware make the XP installation. After installation complete immediately install the Chipset &amp; Graphics Drivers.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not try to change the graphics adapter/Hardware after XP installation. Stick with only One graphics for the whole XP lifespan. If you wish to change Graphics make a fresh Format of XP with new graphics hardware installed. Older boards do not supports
 random graphics changes. As in your case graphics changes drastically from Intel to nVidia, which almost impossible for XP to bear such changes. But XP may bear upgrading of Nvidia 7 series GPU to Nvidia 8 series GPU as both of their driver shares some file
 similarities which is already installed on the system partition. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Controlling multiple graphics at a time will only give you errors &amp; BSOD.<br />

<p>Hey Palcouk,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Please re-read. I did a clean install with SP2 then loaded SP3 and it worked. I "repair installed" with SP2 and have the issue.</p>
<p>I "repair installed" my system with SP1 it worked, thought I was fixed, but when I loaded SP3, the issue came back.</p>
<p>This means I have something in my XP installation that can be repaired with SP1 but causes SP2/3 to crash.</p>
<p>Still looking for help.....</p>
<p>Just tried a new test, I repair installed XP SP1. Then loaded new video driver. Everything worked great. I could re-boot and had no issues. Then I loaded SP3, and the issue returned...... AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRGGGHHH!</p>
<p>Still looking for help.......</p>

<p>To be honest it sounds like a bad driver, that does not work with SP3. Everything points to issues with SP3 and the video driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried the most recent video drivers with SP3?</p>
