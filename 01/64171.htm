<h2>            Lenovo Power Manager does not work with Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 on my Windows 7 machine.&nbsp; Lenovo Power Manager ceased to work.&nbsp; I uninstalled the program, then downloaded it again.&nbsp; It did not install and does not appear in my apps list.&nbsp; I got a window at the end of the installation which said
 it was not compatible with my system.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Have I lost the ability to get this program?&nbsp; It is much more versatile than the Windows 10 power controls.</p>

            <p>here is a weird thing I hope it can be explained, I originally had dual boot (win7 and 8.1). I updated both to win 10:</p>
<p>1. win7, like yours, LPM ceased to work, crashed all the time, and I uninstalled then tried reinstalling and had the same error(not compatible)</p>
<p>2. win8.1, there wasn't an old version previously, and I installed the same version (latest from Lenovo), which claimed to support 7/vista only, and it seems to work fine on win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>update ...</p>
<p>use win7 compatible mode to install, and it now works.</p>
<p />

            <p>I gave up on Windows 10.&nbsp; Although much better for non-touchscreen laptops, it still seems designed to be viewed on a tablet as text and graphics are very large with much less text on the screen at any one time.&nbsp; It does seem to work with few glitches though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 also has fewer ways to personalize.&nbsp; As you say, the power controls are much less customizable than Lenovo's Power Manager, but that is a Lenovo program.&nbsp; However, even some Windows personalization is abbreviated in its ability to customize.</p>

            <p>I went to C:\Program Files (x86)\ThinkPad\Utilities and found the file PWMUI.exe, changed the compatibility mode to Windows 7 and it now works.

            <p>Yes it does work that way in windows 10, it's even work for fresh and clean installation of windows 10 actually, but it needs Net 3.5 (2.0 &amp; 3.0 included) for windows 10 installed, otherwise it may not work for windows 10 fresh and clean installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But here's a new problem I'm having right now, it won't work at all with November update which is Windows 10 1511 Build 10.10586, the newer version of windows 10 removed PWM from my system after I upgraded to Windows 10 Build 10586. I've tried with clean
 installation, it said the PWM program is not compatible with windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently thinking of dropping win 10 altogether after November's update if there's no solution to this, I need PWM for my Lenovo E330, it could stay off power cord about 9-10 hours standby, 7-8 hours light-medium daily activity, and about 2-3 hours
 for gaming (depends on games power consumption), without PWM Lenovo battery uses advantage will be useless.</p>

            When I open the program and go to the battery tab, there is no information available. Do I have to install something for my battery? I have a Lenovo B560 that I upgraded to Windows 10.

            had the same problem after upgrading to build 10586, but there are always smart people out there. (credit goes to KeyboardOverMouse's post on https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/39anbv/windows_10_deciding_what_i_can_and_cannot_run/), basically
 you need to do the following:<br />
1. get the latest power manager from Lenovo website<br />
2. run the downloaded file, it will fail saying " ... doesn't work on this version of Windows ..." or similar<br />
3. go to C:\DRIVERS\VISTA\PWRMGRV and change setup.exe compatibility mode to windows 7<br />
4. go to https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/hardware/dn913721.aspx#adkwin10 and download "Windows ADK for Windows 10, Version 1511"<br />
5. run it and you only need to install "compatibility administrator"<br />
6. run "compatibility administrator", on the left, under System Database-&gt;Applications, click "Lenovo Power Manager"
<br />
7. on the right, right mouse click setup.exe and select "disable entry"<br />
8. now you are on the way installing and using power manager<br />
good luck!<br />

            <p>Hi Johnny,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the delayed response. You mention that there are no apps when you click on the Notification option under Change PC Settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this completely blank or is the list available but greyed out?</li><li>Were you able to make changes here earlier?</li><li>Was there any change made after which the issue started to occur?</li></ul>
<p>Lets check if a system file scan can help us get rid of the issue. To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Win+X</strong> on the keyboard.</li><li>From the power menu that appears on the bottom left of the screen, select <strong>
Command Prompt (Admin).</strong></li><li>At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter: <br />
<span><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></li><li>The <b>sfc /scannow</b> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.
</li></ol>
<p>If this does not help and if the issue started to occur recently, perform a System Restore to restore the computer to the time when it was working fine.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article </a>and see the section which says <strong>To restore your PC using System Restore,
</strong>to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do reply if with the status or if you have more related questions. We would be glad to help you. Thank You.</p>

    <title>User accounts list not showing on startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bruinfanjb  say:</h3>
<h2>            User accounts list not showing on startup</h2>
                    <p>I understand that when you boot the computer to the Start screen, on the left corner of the screen there should be the list of user accounts. What I am finding is that when I start the computer, it automatically logs in to the account for the last user that
 was on. For example, if I am using the computer and then shut it down then on the next startup it goes straight to my account without being able to select any other account.&nbsp; I have tried running netplwiz and unchecking then rechecking the box for users to
 enter a username and password but that doesn't make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming there is some glitch somewhere. Can anyone help fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            At least 1 of the users needs to have a password set up for a user list to be visible. I only have 2 users and if the user without the password is the last one on before shut down, then it goes right into that user automatically on startup but if the user
 with the password is the last one on then the list does show up.

            You might have something that is requesting a file on phantom E. Check your Startup tab in Task Manager. Disable anything that is no longer being used. While there disable anything you don't need to Start at every boot. You can always enable it if it is
 needed. That speeds up the boot process.&nbsp;

 What are my best options? Do I purchase a new computer with more RAM? How much RAM should I purchase?

            <p>Your best option is to take your computer to a reputable computer repair/PC services company. Let them examine it for you then make the appropriate recommendations.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also run the following tool to check out what of type of RAM your computer supports and how much can be installed. You can use this information to make the appropriate purchase decision.

<p>I'm sure everyone has a game they really like but its one that&nbsp;gets you frustrated playing the same level over and over.For me its gotta be Risk:Factions.I cant seem to beat mission 4.The first time I played it I was dominating and was getting 24 troops
 per round but then it said "Game Over" without giving anyone the win.Now the dice rolls are lopsided in favor of the AI.Fifteen against five takes all my troops to conquer.I played this mission 10 more times and cant seem to reproduce the awesomeness of that
 first match.I'm so ticked off.Which games do you feel are the most aggravating?</p>

<p>Sometimes "frustrating" is really satisfying (for me, anyways), like Dark Souls, which irritated me at times but felt extra rewarding once I beat it because of that. &nbsp;I like a good challenge if the challenge seems fair.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>It's when I'm wrestling with horrible controls where I get cranky. &nbsp;A good example of a game I had to give up on was Golden Axe Beast Rider, where the controls were so frustratingly sluggish I just couldn't deal with the idea of replaying areas when I died
 and had to give up before I put a hole through the TV.</p>

<p>[/quote] I doubt you would like the other games, but Homecoming gets special honors for just being a bad game overall. Did you stop at the Police Station? I find that is the boiling point for frustration(although the game is super-easy to me even on Hard.
 But a lot of it would be oblivious to first-time players.)</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth not available</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo Ideapad 305 running Windows 10. Because of some issues of slow performance I went to Recovery on the Start button and pressed Reset the PC. I now have no way of turning on or off Bluetooth. In the New Notifications box there is no Bluetooth
 box. Previously, before the reset, Bluetooth worked very well. When I tried the trouble shooter it said I didn't have Bluetooth on my Laptop. What happened and what can I do?</p>

<p>Hi, I did what you advised and it's now showing that I can turn bluetooth off and on. Thanks very much for the link. Unfortunately it won't pair with any of the devices it paired to previously. It doesn't say it can't pair bit the waiting circle just goes
 round. Any further advice.</p>

            The only relevant option is that the lid and power button both put the computer to sleep. Curiously, closing the lid and putting the computer to sleep doesn't stop the RDP connection, but stops mouse input.

<h3> alan win10  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Image too large &#47; high disk utilization</h2>
                    Running W10 on an i7 Alienware.&nbsp; System image taking up taking up 525+Gb which after actual&nbsp;working files leaves only about 45Gb free on drive.&nbsp; Change System Image Settings button is greyed out even though I'm logged on as administrator.&nbsp; Disk cleanup
 says it could recover another 10Gb but just hangs.&nbsp; Task Manager performance almost always shows disk being used 96-100% of the time.&nbsp; Neither full McAfee or any of the freebie malware I tried finds any virus.&nbsp; Any solution to this high disk utilization and
 System image taking up around 70% of the hard disc?

            Thanks Colin.&nbsp; Guess I didn't provide enough detail.&nbsp; System image wasn't showing up in backup/recovery and view system images button greyed out otherwise I'd check those settings.&nbsp; Took a gamble since Windows reported as file too large for recycle bin
 to handle and just manually deleted the folder/file.&nbsp; Space was recovered.&nbsp; Still can't get to the settings you suggest as the setting button is still greyed out despite my being administrator.&nbsp; Windows 7 backup&nbsp;shows only 68Gb free space left despite the
 image being deleted&nbsp;&nbsp;but File Explorer and every other place shows 600+ Gb free.&nbsp; Wondering if the next backup scheduled for tomorrow will work and REALLY wish I knew what it's backing up (again can't get into settings despite being administrator).

            <p>Check the sizes of two folders by right clicking on the icons and choosing Properties. &nbsp;I have circled my equivalents in the snip below. &nbsp;The top circled item will be named differently but will have the same icon. &nbsp;If you have multiple drives they may not
 be on the system drive and therefore may not matter. &nbsp;Empty the trash anyway.</p>

what software did you use to open your email?<br />
<br />
internet browsers may be opened in "incognito mode" or "private mode" or "private tab" where you cannot store, change, or delete passwords.<br />
<br />
if you are in this mode, open a browser normally, then click settings, find/delete your stored user/password, then surf normally to your website and when prompted, you can now store your username/password.<br />

<p><br />
yup, the question is now crystal clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>from windows live email client:</p>
<p>right click your account name and click properties.</p>
<p>click "server" tab and type in your new password.</p>
<p>check remember password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>remember that all microsoft email services (hotmail, live.com, outlook.com) are now bound by the use of 16 characters or less for password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you had already backed up your emails/email folders, try to delete your account from windows live email client.</p>
<p>then create a new account using your previous email account.</p>
<p>allow windows live email to download all your emails from server.</p>

    <title>Skype Meetings Web App Issue - Black Screen when presenters change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donking67  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Meetings Web App Issue - Black Screen when presenters change Shared Screen</h2>
                    <p>It has been around 4+ months now that the issue I will describe below has been happening.<br />
<br />
While using the Skype Meetings Web App to participate in on-line meetings the screen does not update when the presented/shared screen is changed.&nbsp; The screen goes "black" and shows a text message like "windows minimized".
<br />
<br />
I have to close the Skype Meetings Web App (SMWA) and log back into the meeting which restarts the SMWA in order to get the screen being shared to update and be viewable on my computer.<br />
</p>
<p>Does someone from Microsoft know when this particular problem can/will be fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else experiencing this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;DonKing67,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posts your query here. About the issue that the&nbsp;<span>screen goes "black" during desktop sharing in Skype Meeting Web App, below are two scenarios:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. T</span>he meeting is hosted in Skype for Business Server 2015 or Lync Server 2013 and you are encountering this issue&nbsp;on macOS High Sierra.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, it is a known issue and please try the workaround provided in this article:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4045585/black-screen-during-desktop-sharing-in-skype-for-business-or-lync-web" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Black screen during desktop sharing in Skype for Business or Lync Web App on macOS High Sierra</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. If issue happens in your PC, then please try following steps to check this issue:</p>
<p>(1) For some features of Skype for Business work well, please check if you have enabled below settings in your PC:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/allow-cookies-for-skype-meetings-app-skype-for-business-web-app-2108276b-b5c3-484b-bf2b-dac6eeba4c93" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Allow the broswer to save cookies on your conputer</a>.</li><li><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-off-activex-filtering-for-skype-for-business-web-app-b6de8ff6-ac7e-4e2f-b18c-2f13db643c41" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Turn off ActiveX filtering for Skype for Business Web App</a>.</li><li><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-on-javascript-for-skype-meetings-app-skype-for-business-web-app-3d997bf9-637c-4fe6-8ee3-9e62bfda52cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Turn on JavaScript for Skype Meetings App</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>(2) If the issue persists after you check above settings, then please try to reinstall the app via below method:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/690e11c0-e03a-4fe2-b996-06aa939c8c3d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/690e11c0-e03a-4fe2-b996-06aa939c8c3d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope above methods helps. Please feel free to let me know if you need further assistance. And to narrow down this issue, we need to confirm following questions:</p>
<p>1. If you join in the meeting in a different broswer, is there any differece?</p>
<p>2. Does this issue happen when you share your desktop?</p>
<p>3. Do your coworkers have encountered the same issue?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Also, may I know if you use purge Office 365 cloud-based Lync server or an on-premise Lync server?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Visual C&#43;&#43; 2012 Redistributable &#40;x64&#41; - 11.0.50727.1</h2>
                    I'm using Windows 7 64 bit service pack 1. I recently wanted to uninstall all the Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable packages from windows. This is because I haven't installed DirectX SDK yet. I wanted to install that and I came accros a problem which
 led me to an error. Error code: S1023. Then I found out that I needed to uninstall the C++ packages and proceeded to do that. I could uninstall all the other packages except Micrsoft Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable (x64). When I go to uninstall or change a
 program then select Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (x64) and click uninstall, nothing happens. I waited for a long time but nothing happens. then I tried to click on change and nothing happened either. Please help me with this issue.

            Well I actually solved it. I upgraded from windows 7 ultimate service pack 1 64 bit to windows 10 home 64 bit. Then I reseted and erased everything on my PC (might not be necessary). Then I saw that those two
 part of your screen. Then I again tried to uninstall them. This time it worked and I was able to uninstall them successfully. Hope this method will help others who have this same issue. Just upgrade to windows 10 and then try again. If needed, reset the pc
 like I did. But back everything up before you do.

<h2>            Why does the Bricks Game not work in Win 10&#63;</h2>
                    Bricks is a simple but fun MS-DOS game that ran under Win 7.&nbsp; I have upgraded to Win 10. It no longer works even when compatibility is lowered to Win XP SP3. Why not? Is there a new version that will work?

            <p>Hola&nbsp;lMl Ranger,</p>
<p>Los créditos pendientes requieren un ciclo de depósito para procesar. Una regla general es que los créditos pendientes de la 1a a la 15a serán depositados al final del mes de depósito. Los créditos pendientes del 16 al 31 se depositarán en el depósito a mediados del mes siguiente. Esta es la razón por la cual su evento de referencia el día 10 fue depositado, pero no su evento de referencia el 19. Eso será parte de su depósito a mediados de mes el próximo mes.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting on the Xbox forums. Can you explain what you mean by having to buy the game 3 times? You can't buy a game more than once on an account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Forza Horizon 4 file size is about 75 GB so that is normal, what seems to be the issue with the installation? Are you saying that the game is un-installing by itself and you have to install it every time for it to not let the game load?</span></p>
<p>Explain what is going on with more detail and we can help you figure out a solution.</p>

            Oyunu 1 kere satın aldım fakat bu süre içinde 3 ayrı güncellemeyi yaparken oyun açılmıyordu yani oyun çöküyordu. Bu güncellemeler forzanın 10. güncellemesi, lego güncellemesi (7gb) bu güncellemeleri yaptıktan yamayı yaptıktan sonra oyuna girmiyor. Her
 seferinde yeniden sıfırlayıp en baştan indirmem gerekiyor. Türkçe destek yardımı gelirse dediklerim daha çok anlaşılabilir. Yanlış tercüme edilmiş

            <p>Same here. Haven't been able to install this Cumulative update KB3201845 since Friday 09th when it was released. It's always after the Restart that it fails to install then rolls back before booting back into Windows. My error code shows 0X80070002. Googling
 this code throws up something about a missing file. What file?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've deleted all files from the Software Distribution/ Download folder and the Data Storage folder to force a re-download but still the same problem. I even downloaded manually from the Windows Catalogue and it still fails to install after Restart showing
 the same error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have completed sfc /scannow which passes with no errors of integrity of system files and the Windows inbuilt Troubleshooter found and fixed four errors but still the update fails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now disabled the update in "Services" until something gets sorted by Microsoft. My PC is a gaming machine which I built so it's only for gaming. As long as I can still use Steam to update my games then I don't care. I have a lovely iMac for my other
 Internet needs. I hate Windows 10 with a passion but desperately needed it for PC games!</p>

<p>The specified module could not be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wouldn't it be nice if it would also tell us what "the specified module" is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, what you can try is using the timestamp associated with your error to index into CBS.log (or relevant archived piece) and see if you can glean some more clues that way.</p>
