<h2>            Downgrade from Windows 10 Enterprise to Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to downgrade from Windows 10 Enterprise to Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<ol>
<li>I had windows 8.1 home and upgraded to windows 10 home, using the media creation tool 1809.</li><li>After windows 10 home installation , I went to Settings &gt; Updates and Security &gt; Activation &gt; Go to Microsoft Store. Bought Windows 10 Pro, but instead of Install I did upgrade to workstation.</li></ol>
<p>So now I have Windows 10 Enterprise and I can't activate it, which is normal, cause I bought windows 10 Pro and not Enterprise.</p>
<p>How can I downgrade it to Windows 10 Pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            Hi Leonidas, if this happened during the upgrade, where your system went to the Enterprise instead of the Pro version, your best option is to contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you activate your Windows 10 Pro

<h2>            Trying to get Xbox Live on Xbox one</h2>
                    

<p>Ok so at first my Xbox Live went out, so like anyone I tried buying more on the cards I added at Christmas and they had enough money on them but for some reason I just kept getting the same message. So I gave up and just went and bought a Xbox Live code
 from the store. Once I tried to type it in the Xbox, the 3month thing came up which is what I had so I clicked confirm, then it said something went wrong and gave me the error code "0x80169D3A" &nbsp;I tried submitting the code on the Xbox directly and tried it
 on the website, but still gave me this error Could really use some please.&nbsp;</p>

Error 80169d3a occurs when using Xbox Live on your Xbox 360
<div>
<p>You see the following error code and message when you try to use Xbox Live on your Xbox 360 console:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Can't retrieve information from Xbox Live.</b></p>
<p><b>Status code: 80169d3a</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may mean one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Xbox Live service is temporarily unavailable.</li>
<li>Your Xbox Live Gold subscription or Groove Music Pass has an outstanding balance, and new purchases are being declined.</li>
<li>Your PayPal account country/region doesn't match your Xbox Live account country/region.</li>
<li>Your account has incorrect or incomplete billing information.</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically what you need to do is make sure the billing info you have on your account is up to date and accurate. Log into <a href="http://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.microsoft.com </a>and update your payment info. </p>

            <p>This is, unsurprisingly, singularly unhelpful. &nbsp;Most probate for very poor clients does not ever see a court. &nbsp;Therefore, asking for court documents requiring the email to be handed over to next of kin is like stabbing them in the side, while they're already
 doubled over in grief. &nbsp;It's despicable behaviour. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It was probably very helpful four years ago when the question was asked.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>

<p>There's no mention of court documents or probate in the post you replied to. </p>

<p>That's because the site it directed to was closed down in 2012.</p>

            You can reactivate your Windows Vista installation by performing the following:<br />
<br />
1. Click on the Start button and in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box type in:&nbsp;
<strong>slui.exe 4<br />
</strong><br />
2. Press the Enter key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
3. Select your Country.<br />
<br />
4. Follow the instructions for phone activation (no charge).<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> When you call that number, you will first hear an Automated Voice. If the Automated Voice gives you an option to talk to a
<br />
Live Activation Rep, select that option. If not, do not enter any numbers. This should force the Automated Voice to transfer you to
<br />
a Live Activation Rep. Trying to activate thru the Automated Voice will not work, in your case, only thru the Live Activation Rep
<br />
will your activation be successful.<br />

                    Recent support from Microsoft Concierge for Office 365 resulted in some idiot disabling my fingerprint reader during a screenshare session. Tried all the online suggestions... nothing seems to work.

            Hello Fingerprintfailure,
<br />
<br />To solve your issue follow recommendations below:
<br />
<br />1) Turn off Fast Startup: Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup. 
<br />
<br />2) Reset Fingerprint Options 
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign In Options 
<br />Locate Fingerprint options and click Remove under them. After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint. Reboot your PC if needed. 
<br />
<br />3) Modify Group Policy Settings (for Pro version only) 
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality. 
<br />
<br />Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter. 
<br />Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates. 
<br />Select Windows Components and open Biometrics. 
<br />Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option. 
<br />Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature. 
<br />Reboot your PC. 
<br />
<br />4) Update drivers 
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers: 
<br />
<br />Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager. 
<br />Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them. 
<br />Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished. 
<br />Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC. 
<br />Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes. 
<br />The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers. 
<br />
<br />5) Run Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot. 
<br />
<br />6) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here: <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a> 
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them: <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a> 
<br />
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update (which you can check at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1803 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here: <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>  
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps then run a Fresh Start: <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-fresh-start-feature-in-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Jim,<br />
<br />
<span><span>
<p><span>This issue may occur when you have other Windows Live programs on your computer that conflicts with the installation you are attempting to complete. To further troubleshoot this issue you might need to perform a Windows update, delete the Windows Live
 folder, disable third party firewalls and reset browser to factory settings. Please follow the steps below:
<br />
<br />
<b>1.)</b> Perform Windows update<br />
a. Visit </span><a href="http://www.update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>Windows Update</span></b></a><span><br />
b. Verify if the computer requires updates, and install updates if necessary <br />
c. Restart the computer after you install updates for the changes to replicate<br />
<br />
<b>2.)</b> Uninstall Windows Live Essentials programs that are currently installed on your computer. Please follow the steps in this link:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-uninstall-ui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-uninstall-ui</a> <br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>3.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Browse your computer to C:\Program Files then delete the Windows Live folder if available</span></p>
<p><span>C:\Program Files\<strong><span>Windows Live</span></strong> <br />
C:\Program Files\Common Files\<strong><span>Windows Live</span></strong><b><br />
<br />
<strong><span>Note</span></strong></b>: If there is more than one Program Files folder upon opening C drive, then double click on
<strong><span>Program Files x86</span></strong> instead.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>4.)</span></strong><span> Temporarily disable 3rd party firewall programs (i.e. McAfee, Norton, ZoneAlarm, etc.)<br />
<br />
<b>Note: </b>Disabling the firewall may make your computer or your network vulnerable to attack by malicious users or by malicious software such as viruses. Please make sure that you do not have any other Internet Explorer window open or any other programs
 running while trying to install Windows Live products. Once, you are able to install the Windows Live programs, please turn your firewall back on.<br />
<br />
<b>5.)</b> Reset browser to factory settings:<br />
<br />
<b>For Internet Explorer: <br />
</b>a. Open <b>Internet Explorer</b> <br />
b. Click <b>Tools</b>, and then click <b>Internet Options<br />
</b>c. Click the <b>Advanced</b> tab <br />
d. Under <b>Reset Internet Explorer Settings</b>, click <b>Reset<br />
<br />
</b>If you are using other browsers, please look for steps on how to reset your browser to factory settings via
</span><span><a href="http://www.bing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>Bing</span></b></a></span><span><br />

            <div>Hi Gerard,</div>
<div>I tried all those solutions before I posted, this is what worked, and the only thing that worked.</div>
<p>The solution was simply copy paste those 2 files <strong>wldcore.dll</strong> and
<strong>wldlog.dll</strong> from </p>
<p><strong>c:\Program Files\Windows Live\Shared</strong> to</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>c:\Program Files\Windows Live\Messenger</strong> </li><li><strong>c:\Program Files\Windows Live\Contacts</strong> </li><li><strong>c:\Program Files\Windows Live\Mail</strong> </li></ul>
<div>Thanks,</div>

            <p>Dear Litton_B,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I encouter the same problem. This happens with all the Live applications. I tried the 3 steps you mentioned, however without any luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After installing Live my first problem was that I was missing the file msvcr110.dll. After installing the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package, this problem was solved and this came up about "Error ordinal 53 missing wldcore.dll". I also
 ran windows update without effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you&nbsp;(or anyone else)&nbsp;have any&nbsp;suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            My xbox is black screening.</h2>
                    <p>I was playing my Xbox when I had to change my controller's battery, but it wouldn't reconnect. Then, when I tried to turn my Xbox off and back on, the screen would stay black and in order to turn the Xbox off I have to hold the power button for about 5 seconds. The disc tray works and it makes all of the sounds, but the screen is black. I left it unplugged all night and this morning I plugged it back up and it did the same thing. I've waited about 10 minutes at the black screen like the Xbox support page says, but nothing has changed.</p>

<h2>            Get rid of your Tile Database issue</h2>
                    <p>The very fact that this problem is possible, is a testimate to the overall ineptitude that went into the development of Windows 10. Frequent updates consume an excessive amount of storage space for something that might not be executed upon for months. The
 recent update being the worst offender by far. Not allowing those who suffered failed updates to recover the storage without manually and forcibly removing it though back end channels with advanced technical know-how or 3rd party solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And we have the 'Start Menu' a crucial component so delicate that the slightest thing seems to completely destroy it.&nbsp; Every few months regardless of the system installed upon, regardless of usage, independent of spec or behavior, it will inevitably break.&nbsp;
 And whats more is that the repair process alone is so ridiuclously complicated.&nbsp; It is quite literally a list of shortcuts and thumbnail images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>imagine having a car where your steering wheel (the start menu) constantly breaks and the manufacturer tells you that the only way to fix it is to replace the entire interior (account-profile) of your car.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do these databases so frequently go corrupt? What causes it? Why are they unable to self-heal.&nbsp; Can they be manually edited to purge corrupt data?&nbsp; The fact that you sometimes have to manually create a new account via the command prompt and migrate data
 is far beyond pathetic. And from a development perspective it's negligent and ignorant. &nbsp; If your own product is going to screw up so frequently that you have to create a special file to automate the repair process, perhaps you should go all the way and have
 it automate the account creation and migration as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might actually switch to OSX </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And no, you don't need my system specs in order to provide support.&nbsp; It's an issue independent of user data, It's on your end and always has been.&nbsp; Maybe pay for your development team to go back to school, or re-release Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last thing you did
 that actually worked consistently.</p>

<p>You indicate you have the ports forwarded. &nbsp;Was that done prior to or after the NAT went to strict? &nbsp;If you are able to get into the configuration of the Speedport you could try resetting it to default and enabling UPnP and see if that helps the condition.

<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 Edition - I can&#39;t join realms but I can join multiplayer games</h2>
                    <p>So, I'm trying to play minecraft with my friends. I can join a world if one of them hosts it but I can't join my friend's realm. When I try to accept the realm invite it pops up with a message saying:</p>
<p>"You cannot play online multiplayer through Xbox Live because of how your account is set up. This can be changed in your privacy &amp; online safety settings on Xbox.com."<br />
I don't know why I'm getting this message because I already changed all the settings to allow and I can still play with my friends through Xbox Live, as long as it isn't via a realm.</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums for this issue. Sorry to hear that you're experiencing difficulty in joining up with your buddies in Minecraft, specifically the Realms (which is a subscription service). Is the version of Minecraft that you're
 using the latest Bedrock Engine-based version for Windows 10, or Minecraft: Java edition? If you're using the Java edition then there is a different subscription service available for that specific edition.&nbsp;<em><strong>Note</strong></em><span><em>you
 won’t have access to Realms while using a Beta version of Minecraft.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information you have already provided, if you've already tried to
<a href="http://account.xbox.com/settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
sign in with your Microsoft account</a><span> and click </span><strong>Xbox One Online Safety</strong><span> to review and change your settings online, but still cannot access the Realm and are already a subscriber, then
 I would recommend contacting the friendly folks over at <a href="https://help.mojang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mojang Support</a> (<a href="https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/1018151-minecraft-realms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Minecraft Realms Support</a>) or the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.minecraftforum.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Minecraft

            <p>Hey there to everyone having drifting issues with their controller!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that you're having this issue out of the box, definitely want you to have &nbsp;a 100% functional controller. Have you tried reaching out to your retailer for an exchange? I know supplies may be limited in some areas, but it's possible your store may have extras in case of needing an exchange.</p>
<p>If your store isn't able to exchange it your next best option would be to set up a Repair/Replacement for the controller. To set that up, head on over to our <a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/Pages/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Service Center</a> and register your Xbox One if you haven't done so already. After you register your console you can set up a Repair/Replacement for the controller under accessories.</p>
<p>Once again I'm sincerely sorry to hear about this issue you're experiencing. Definitely want to see you with a working controller ASAP. Please keep us in the loop with how it goes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mister Maka,</p>
<p>Here's how my experience went: terrible.</p>
<p>The retailer I bought the controller from, Amazon, does not accept exchanges, and is completely sold out. &nbsp;So my only option with them would be a return.</p>
<p>In an effort to get an Elite, I decided to contact Microsoft support to see if they would honor their manufacturer's warranty.</p>
<p>The only way that they would send me a functional controller is if I sent them my brand new broken one, and that I PAY FOR THE SHIPPING ON MY DIME.</p>
<p>That is absolutely abhorrent. &nbsp;To sell me a broken controller and expect me to pay more to get a working one is the definition of garbage customer service.</p>
<p>I am sending the controller back to Amazon for a refund and I will not be purchasing one again.</p>

<p>An option in the Xbox Accessories app to allow you to relearn the centre position of the controller thumbsticks would be nice plus useful for all controllers.</p>

<p>Im with Man of War here in that selling broken, unreliable equipment in such limited quantities is pretty bad but then expect you to pay for shipping and in the mean time be without a controller for 3 weeks? Unacceptable. I to am having issues with my Elite
 controller but it is the left thumbstick that has become loose and clicks in and out of place. For the money I spent on the "Elite" console there seems to be nothing "Elite" about it. For $500 i would expect it to last longer then the 6 days Ive had it. Gamestop
 is totally on board with helping me out with an exchange but their hands are tied since this was released with such limited qualities and if they do get any in it will be outside the 30 day grace period so i guess my only option is send it to MS and im sure
 MS is just hoping I buy a new controller in the mean time while I pay them to fix their product so in the end they just win And im sure once they fix it and send it back it will never be right and it will never be the same and probably brake again, and again,
 and again....what a fool I was for buying such junk. </p>

<p>Have you guys read up on the controllers and how to set dead zone and sensitivity and calibrate them?</p>
<p>Granted I know there's a lot of false advertising going around that the $150 Elite controller was supposed to be more durable, this is a big fat asterisk (**), certain parts are more durable, except the controllers weakest point was never fixed, that's the
 analog modules that keep breaking, they're using the same defective ones they put in standard controllers into the new elite controllers, what a waste of craftsmanship Microsoft, apart from that everything else about the controller is solid except that one
 important thing they still ignored (sheesh), if there's a most common mechanical problem with Xbox One controllers it's the modules breaking and they have done nothing to remedy this.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Xbox 360 modules are of far superior construction, those controllers like a good wired one goes for only $30 for the official Microsoft branded one, 1/2 the price of the XBO controller and will last for years (not months), except they
 made sure it won't work with your Xbox One (but it will work with your PS4, oh the irony there).</p>
<p>Hopefully it's not the case your modules have broken, maybe it's just that your dead zone needs adjusting and maybe the sensitivity. This being the case, this might also solve issues with other peoples XBO controllers that don't have elites, the ability
 to adjust dead zones; think about that Microsoft... unless you want people buying new $60 controllers every few months, I think you've probably thought about this more than making sure peoples *** doesn't break.</p>

<p>Could someone from Microsoft officially confirm or deny whether the Xbox Elite controller thumbstick modules are actually identical to those installed in the standard Xbox One controller?</p>
<p>I daren't take mine apart due to warranty, though i have spent some time looking at all the best quality pictures i could find of both the controllers dissassembled; i thought i could see tiny differences in the modules themselves, but i can never be sure.</p>
<p>I could see that the circuit board on the Elite was of a different design, with the microsoft trademark printed on the front to the top left, and below where ABXY sit. Having used the controller for the week that i've had it, i can certainly say that it
 feels of better quality. That being said, i was using a third party 360 controller prior, and haven't had a proper feel for the standard One controller as of yet.</p>
<p>I have also played around in the app, moving the deadzones as close to 0 as possible, and as far as i can tell, my sticks seem to be perfectly centered, and the modules appear to be of good quality.</p>
<p>I hope Microsoft will respond to this enquiry, because as fond as i am of this controller, and their recent generous gift of Windows 10, i've never been a fan of corporations ripping off customers and then refusing to acknowledge the problem existing in
 the first place. Both good and bad things stemmed from the way the global economy developed, and personally i think capitalism could work well if the people at the top weren't so greedy, anyway, my point is; don't make it worse by *** on those that have actually
 accepted this materialstic world.</p>

            <p>i had this same problem on two different computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the first computer, i was using Windows fax and scan. I was sending jpeg, pdfs (as attachments) with NO problem. Then suddently one day, after installing some windows updates (still not sure which ones), it started giving me this exact error message. i did
 some research online, and did a system restore to an earlier date. This worked great, and I had no problems since them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the second computer, during initial setup, it installed all sorts of updates (which is normal when you buy a computer). After these updates were done, I tried to send a fax with an attachment, but i got the error message. Now, because it's a new computer
 and I don't have a restore point, I'm pretty much screwed. I'm on the phone with HP now, because I have an "OEM" version of microsoft&nbsp; and microsoft won't help me with the problem unless I pay $99.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What really sucks about this is that i only have warranty with HP, and its torture trying to get any tech help with Microsoft from HP. UGH</p>

Thanks for the input. &nbsp;If you find a solution with HP I'd be interested.

The fie type you are trying to Fax no longer has the printto command associated with it.<br />
<br />
I used this freeware:<br />
<a href="http://izt.name/apps/types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://izt.name/apps/types/</a><br />
<br />
Let's say you can't fax a .jpg file. <br />
<br />
1. Open the freeware program and type inside it jpg<br />
This will automatically scroll down the list of extensions to jpg.<br />
<br />
2. Double click on jpg to open its options.<br />
<br />
3. Actions TAB<br />
<br />
4. Next to green + type in<br />
printto<br />
<br />
5. Click on green +<br />
<br />
6. Select newly added printto<br />
<br />
7. Next to yellow folder icon paste this<br />
rundll32.exe C:\WINDOWS\system32\shimgvw.dll,ImageView_PrintTo /pt "%1" "%2" "%3" "%4"<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Exit program.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Repeat for all file types you are having problems faxing.<br />

<p>Hi <br />
<br />
I'm so sorry you are facing issues! <br />
My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor. <br />
<br />
To better understand the issue and help resolve, could you please let me know which version of windows do you run Skype on?
<br />
<br />
Looking forward to hearing back from you. <br />
<br />
Thank you, have a great week! <br />

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Version 8.41.0.54 (today) from my MS PC.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>New people are requesting being added, I do &amp; reply, but then they're nowhere to be found in my RECENT chat threads.... Not under, Sort by Time, nor Sort by Unread (I've read &amp; replied to them, waiting for their reply).&nbsp; An hour ago I updated to this latest
 version of Skype, but it's still the same.&nbsp; New convos are gone.<br />
<br />
I was able to reply to "Steven Tim" (not his real/full name), so according to how it's always been, that means he hasn't cancelled or blocked me.&nbsp; Luckily I remembered his screen name, so in search I found him AND our brief chat thread in within the Skype system.&nbsp;
 It's not appearing in MY recent chat thread.... or anywhere else as far as I can tell.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
But<strong> why am I not seeing his (and other people I've recently accepted &amp; communicated with in my RECENT CHATS?
</strong><br />
<br />
To me, it appears that MAYBE only my favorites are showing in RECENT CHATS (which I was not searching.... I'm searching for the new people, not favorites)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>See attached photo.</strong></span>&nbsp; I've put every imaginable bit of helpful information within it, so maybe you can tell me where my convos are disappearing to?</p>
<p><br />
This new version of desktop Skype sucks.&nbsp; I long for the old version.&nbsp; I don't know how long I can keep up with the chaos of new &amp; improved Skype *sigh*</p>

<p>It appears you've gotten the reply problem fixed. (I could reply to other help threads, just not any of yours)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to this problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another thread, you advised me to download this for Win 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download from here the version for Windows 7 : <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34841/updating-to-the-latest-version-of-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34841/updati...</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did, nothing looks different.</p>
<p>The most recent chat is still NOT appearing on the top of the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I DID FIND THIS STRANGE WAY TO FORCE THE CHAT TO APPEAR, but it's not really viable.&nbsp; THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH SKYPE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS IS HOW I FOUND THE MISSING CHAT:</p>
<p>I was so frustrated, looking for the missing chat, I tried to run the sidebar cursor all the way to the bottom of the 'Recent Chats'.&nbsp; It is an impossible task, because I have so many chats there, there was no end to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT an amazing thing happened after scrolling down &amp; down, returning to the top, THERE WAS THE MISSING CHAT!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know WHY scrolling way down, and back up again, would kick the most recent chat to the top, but it did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can that help you in any way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully I'll be able to reply to whatever you may ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

They say to use F8,but on pressing F8 I get the same screen. I tried booting from Windows 7 DVD, but the system can't find my operating system (none of my c: or d: drives are visible). I tried bcdboot and bootrec commands from the command-prompt, but it can't
 find any of my drives.<br />
<br />
I also tried booting up using Ubuntu DVD, and it seems all my folders are intact, but I don't know how to copy those files on my external hard-drive.
<br />
<br />
I have searched Windows forums as well as Google, but can't find any solutions. I appreciate any pointers. Thanks,<br />
<br />

            I am afraid none of the steps you described worked in my case. I ended up using Ubuntu to backup all my data (thank goodness the data was not impacted!) to an external 3TB hard-drive, and then had to completely wipeout my hard-drive, and install Windows
 7 from scratch... What a pain, but glad that I was able to recover all my data...
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your suggestions and help!<br />

            No. Windows 10 does not require you to configure Windows update to run through Firewall. This is itself by design in Windows.
<br />If you are getting an error code let us know.

            The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

            Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

            <p>Hello Jyan,<br />
<br />
The error code 0x80070424 you described also means "ERROR_SERVICE_DOES_NOT_EXIST".&nbsp; Windows Update depends on these two following services:<br />
<br />
1) Windows Update<br />
2) Background Intelligent Transfer (BIT)<br />
<br />
If it happens that these services are disable or missing, you will encounter this error code.&nbsp; Hence, you will need to ensure that the necessary services are available and running.&nbsp; Here's how:<br />
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>services.msc</strong> in the <strong>
Start Search</strong> text area, and then click <strong>services.msc</strong> in the programs list. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Continue</strong>. <br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double-click <strong>Background Intelligent Transfer Service</strong>. <br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the <strong>Startup status</strong> lists Stopped, click <strong>Start
</strong>and then click<strong> OK</strong>. <br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double-click <strong>Windows Update</strong>. <br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the <strong>Startup status</strong> lists Stopped, click <strong>Start
</strong>and then click<strong> OK</strong>. <br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double-click <strong>Workstation</strong>. <br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the <strong>Startup status</strong> lists <strong>Stopped</strong>, click
<strong>Start </strong>and then click<strong> OK</strong>. <br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Close the <strong>Services</strong> window and try to install updates again.
<br />
<br />
If the Background Intelligent Transfer Service does not appear in the list of Services, click the following link to view the KB article on the Microsoft web site and download the update:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/939159/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/939159/en-us</a>.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Let me know how things go...<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; Regards <br />

<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you aware of any changes made to the computer, prior to the issue?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Update should be listed in the Services.msc applet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the reason that you are running the command pointing to WUARENG.DLL?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens if you simply run it through the Start Menu?</p>
