<h2>            Scrub my harddrive and reload Windows 10 from scratch.  TOO many quirks that I have done or not did to repair it.</h2>
                    <p>I have done everything folks.&nbsp; I do not care about the files at this point.&nbsp; I believe the mistake I made was entering myself in each time as a user on four different computers instead of just signing in as the original Administrator from the first one.&nbsp;
 I did not understand the concept.&nbsp; Now I have too many PINs, Passwords, users attached to comingling accounts who are all fighting for rights as the user.&nbsp; SO......I would like to format C: and reload Windows 10 on the main computer and just remove or delete
 the other users on other computers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am open to any and all suggestions and I would like to say that I do not have my Windows disk or software to allow me to reload it.&nbsp; I do have the product key that is listed in the computer though (thinking I could download it to a thumb drive fresh) with
 the thoughts of me just wiping everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And just to let you know, Windows 10, Home. I have already recovered, removed, restored fallen back to a previous copy, tried quick fixes of registry, you name it and that's about it.&nbsp; My family would like to have the wife and mother back in their lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            You can use the Windows media creation tool to create a USB and install Windows 10. You can download the tool with the link below:

            When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi  TamiC, sorry you are going through this . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />You will need to go to a working PC to create the Installation media . . .
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            <p>Hi&nbsp; Gloria and Gerald,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for coming back and providing additional details. It seems that you just click the option to hide the folders in your Windows Live Mail. To unhide it we request that you restore the folders by following these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Use the <strong>Alt</strong>-<strong>M</strong> key combination to bring up a small drop down menu.
</p>
<p>2. Select <strong>Layout</strong>. </p>
<p>3. Choose <strong>Folder pane</strong> and put a check mark in front of <strong>
Show Storage folders</strong>. </p>
<p>4. The disappeared / missing storage folders will be restored in the Windows Live Mail program.
</p>
<p>5. Click <strong>Apply</strong> and then click <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the result afterwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leonard.</p>

            <p>Hello gloriais,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Windows Community Forum. I would like to apologize for the delay in response. I will be assisting you on your inquiry about lost folders within Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the issue, please check the following information below on how to recover your lost folders:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>Since you're using </span></span></span><span>POP account, check if you're leaving a copy of the email on the server. (To check, click on mail account in WL Mail&gt;</span><span>Properties&gt;</span><span>Server&gt;</span><span>Delivery). If the
 settings are ‘<strong>should not be set to delete email from the server</strong>’ then there should still be a copy of the email available on the server.
</span></li><li><span>For IMAP, if you delete an email its gone</span> </li><li><span>For Hotmail account, please refer to “<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/how-recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Recovering Deleted Emails from your Hotmail Inbox</a></strong>”. Emails can still be recovered by Microsoft.</span>
</li><li><span>All deleted emails are stored in the email account's 'Deleted' folders’ for a short period of time for all three types of accounts mentioned above. Check if these folders contain any of the deleted emails.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>- In Windows Live Mail &lt;Email account&gt;/Deleted Items<br />
- In Explorer, %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\&lt;Email account name&gt;\Deleted Items</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>If email is no longer available on server itself, there is a low chance of these mails will be recovered.</span>
</li><li><span>'Storage folders' Deleted Items only contains items deleted from Windows Live Mail’s user created folders. If the program is functioning properly and the deleted messages are not present in the email account's ‘Deleted Items’ folder or not archived
 elsewhere in Live Mail or the user's hard drive, unfortunately, these files cannot be retrieved.</span></li></ul>
<p><font><span>We're looking forward to your response.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span>Thank you.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I am having a problem with my DVD-BluRay drive.&nbsp; The system <u>can see</u> it, but it does not work.&nbsp; I will describe.
<br />
I have Win8 Pro 64-bit. I have loaded the updates. <br />
MoBo = ASUS P8Z68-M Pro&nbsp; bios=3905 updated.<br />
CPU Sandy Bridge i3</p>
<p>My computer can see the DVD-BluRay drive.&nbsp; The Device Manager says: This device is working properly.
</p>
<p>When I push the *open* button on the front panel, the light goes on, then nothing happens.&nbsp; When I click on the software *Eject* from My Computer, nothing happens.&nbsp; When I use a paper clip to open the tray, insert a disk, and push shut, nothing happens.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have checked for the *Hi* and *Low* entries in the registry, but they are not there.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I bought a second DVD-BluRay drive, assuming the problem was the drive unit.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Now I have a Lite-On drive and an ASUS drive that both show the same problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have changed the SATA cables and changed the SATA sockets on the MoBo.&nbsp; No change.
</p>
<p>So the system can see the drive.&nbsp; The Device Manager says it is okay.&nbsp; The system says that the driver for the BD-ROM is the correct driver.&nbsp; But it does not work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I can't be the only one with this problem.&nbsp; I have read posts about problems where the system can NOT see the drive, but mine can.&nbsp; If you suggest adding lines to the registry, please explain what it is supposed to do and if there are any possible problems
 with the addition. </p>
<p>It will probably be a few days before I can get back here to see your reply, but I would appreciate the help.
</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Mike</p>

<h2>            Intermittent Connectivity Issues</h2>
                    
<p><strong>What Country/State/Province do you live in? </strong><b>Ontario Canada<br />
<strong>Modem brand &amp; model number:</strong><span>&nbsp; Thomson DCM476</span><br />
<strong>Router brand &amp; model number: Linksys E3200<br />
</strong><span>How many Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles are connected to this router?:&nbsp; 1</span><br />
<strong>Wired or Wireless (for each console):&nbsp; Wired</strong><br />
<strong>Things you have tried: Rebooting Modem and Router.&nbsp; Set DMZ host to the Xbox One Console.&nbsp; Temporary resolution is to power cycle console (Works with Always On or disabled) but will re occur</strong><br />
<strong>Is UPnP Enabled? Yes/No/Unknown: Yes</strong><br />
<strong>Do you have a NAT error? If so, what is your NAT type?: Open</strong><br />
<strong>Any Error Codes you encounter: "Alert The connection to Xbox Live has been lost.&nbsp; Please return to Grand Theft Auto V."</strong><br />
<strong>Who is your ISP? (Internet Service Provider): Vianet<br />
</strong></b></p>
<p><b><strong>&nbsp;</strong></b></p>
<p><b><strong><br />
</strong>It appears that this only happens (for me anyway) during play in GTA online.&nbsp; This has been happening since Tuesday October 27th and is, as mentioned previously, an intermittent problem.&nbsp; I am not currently part of the preview program.&nbsp; This has affected
 other users either on my friends list or not from the US and some from Australia as well.&nbsp;
</b></p>
<p><b>Once this error is received can not play any multiplayer games but only seems to occur when I am playing GTA online.&nbsp; Can still message friends/voice chat with party member on the console itself not through smartglass.&nbsp; Connection tests show no errors
 89ms latency with 10.52 Mbps down 1.94Mbps up 0% packet loss and 1480MTU<br />
</b></p>
<p><b><br />
The only way to get back to playing multiplayer games is to reboot the console and if playing GTA Online will happen again.&nbsp; As mentioned above have experienced this issue with multiple players friends and otherwise throughout the week.<br />

<p>My issues started Oct 27th. Kicks me out of every 2nd or 3rd Halo 5 multiplayer match. My internet connection shows very good stats and o% packet loss. It's better than a few days ago, though, when i could not play any matches.</p>

<p>Any resolution to this???</p>
<p>I have been having the same issue occur also since 10/27. New modem, new router, new service cable and new Ethernet cable has not corrected. Router settings are correct. ISP has checked everything from me to them and found no issues.

<p>I have played LOTS of GTA and for me the fix for this was to clear the alt mac address...not sure why it worked (this came from Rockstar) but it did work everytime , also would work if I would get put in a lobby with only a few people or all by myself ,
 clear alt mac address and BAM ! full lobby ... SETTINGS&gt;NETWORK&gt;ADVANCED&gt;ALT MAC ADDRESS&gt;CLEAR&gt;....not sure if this woks on other games but worth a try...this is assuming all other things are right , ports , upnp , open nat and so on...</p>

<p>So this is just an alternative to shutting down and booting back up again or does it solve the connection issue? &nbsp;I would prefer if I didn't have to deal with this at all as it started on the 27th and I was having no issues prior to that. &nbsp;I know it is not
 a Rockstar issue as it affects other games as well but only occurs while I'm playing GTA Online.</p>
<p>The confusing part is that all the Live services are still available while this issue is occurring minus the ability to play multiplayer games.</p>
<p>Going through other threads and forums looks like a lot of other people started to have connection issues since October 27th. &nbsp;Maybe there was something changed with the service in prep for Halo 5 that may have impacted the service?</p>

<p>Which restarts the console anyway with the long boot. &nbsp;So its very well the restart that lets you reconnect to live and not the clear alternate MAC as a simple reboot either the long way or instant on way allows me back on to multiplayer games.</p>
<p>I realize that is what Rockstar asked you to do. &nbsp;Why should I have to restart my console over and over again just to be able to play a game for a few minutes and be right back to where I was.</p>
<p>I'm currently in the process of re installing GTA V in the hopes that it might in some way correct my issue before I call Rockstar.</p>

<p>No I realize that it doesn't clear the Alternate MAC but with my dropped connection I just have to reboot either the long boot or instant on and I can get back on. &nbsp;But it only lasts for up to an hour if I'm lucky.</p>
<p>I did try the clear Alternate MAC but it asks you to reboot anyway. &nbsp;Again it is all fine and great that I can get back on for a little while but it is hardly worth the stress or the time to have to be rebooting all the time. &nbsp;Before Oct 27th I had no issues
 at all and that is my problem. &nbsp;If it was a simple server outage I'd be fine with that, I get it it happens. &nbsp;Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be, and if it is, no one is fessing up to whose fault it is.</p>

            <p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
Error code 651 usually occurs when user tries to connect&nbsp;it’s broadband in windows 7 operating system.
</p><p>It shows a message that Your modem (or other connecting devices) has reported an error and Usually the message will be “<strong>Connection failed with error 651</strong>” .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to uninstall the Modem and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also do a right click on the Connections, Select Properties, Then Uncheck the box which says Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please reply to us with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi thank for replying but unfortunately neither of the two solutions seemed to work.&nbsp;But I was&nbsp;able to identify the problem. When I started&nbsp;up the windows network diagnostics,&nbsp;it states that the troubleshoot is&nbsp;unable to automatically fix all of the issues
 found. The problem found is that "Ethernet&nbsp;doesn't have a valid&nbsp;IP configuration" which assuming means&nbsp;my computer has no&nbsp;IP address.&nbsp;Is there anyway to fix this?!?!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Loss of Internet Connection when ICS is enabled</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Hi there, currently my laptop (Windows XP) is connected wirelessly to the internet. I'm planning on using ICS and a LAN cable in order to share that connection with my desktop pc (Windows 7).</p>
<p>Now, I understand I'm supposed to go to Network Connections &gt; Local Area Connection &gt; Properties &gt; Advanced, and check the box that says "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection"</p>

<p>Hi there, currently my laptop (Windows XP) is connected wirelessly to the internet. I'm planning on using ICS and a LAN cable in order to share that connection with my desktop pc (Windows 7).</p>
<p>Now, I understand I'm supposed to go to Network Connections &gt; Local Area Connection &gt; Properties &gt; Advanced, and check the box that says "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection"</p>
<p>The only problem is, once I check that box, I lose my laptop loses its connection to the internet. It goes back to normal once I uncheck the box.</p>

<p>Well, if it is only two computer will connect to this Router and if I understand correctly the Laptop already connect wirelessly to the router and the router has the wireless feature enabled. Why you need to establish ICS connection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easy way is to buy an Ethernet cable or patch cable to connect the Desktop to the router and use the Laptop as is wireless!</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Laptop stuck in Automatic Repair loop - No disc</h2>
                    My Windows 8.1 Lenovo Ideapad Y580 is stuck in an Automatic Repair loop. Since my laptop was originally a Windows 7 laptop (before upgrading), I have no Recovery Media to use so that I can reset or refresh my laptop. I can't even access my product key,
 since I bought Windows 8 before I made a Microsoft Account. I've also tried using System Restore, but there was an error every time I tried, (something about not being able to access the restore point).
<div><br />
<div>
<div>
<div>What can I do to reset it? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div>
<div>
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do have a Product Key (but no disc) for my Windows 7 Professional OS. If I can't restore my laptop back to Windows 8.1, would it be possible to restore it back to Windows 7 Professional?&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd really appreciate some help on this matter! What can I do?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you!</div>

            <span>Hi &nbsp;Sharief! Thanks for the quick reply!</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, none of the links you directed me to could help me. They all seem to assume that you're computer is working fine. I can't get my computer to boot up at all. I'm not sure how to open my computer in WinRE, but I don't have any
 recovery media at all, and I don't think I can follow the steps to create some when my laptop doesn't boot up at all. I've tried the Startup Repair option from the Automatic Repair (the screen that pops up automatically, saying that "Your Computer Has Encountered
 a Problem" or something similar with a sad face)-&gt; Advanced Repair Options -&gt; Troubleshoot -&gt; Advanced Options screen, but it doesn't work. There is an error that comes after Startup Repair has finished trying to fix the problem: Startup Repair can't fix the
 problem. "Click Advanced Options to try other options to repair your PC, or Shut Down to turn of your computer" (or something to that effect). Then it says, "Log File: D:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt" I'm not sure if that is important.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>As you can see, I need some more help before I can fix my laptop. I'd really appreciate another quick response!&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Also, in curiosity, do you know what may have caused this error? A virus or what?</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Thanks in advance!</span></div>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are some of the cause of this error. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Bug check 0x50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM).</li><li>Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.</li><li>Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.</li></ul>

<p>The steps that mentioned by <strong>'Sharief K replied on January 22, 2014</strong>' is to create a new installation media from a different computer and then use it for the afffected system. You can enter to Windows Recovery Environment and
 perform Automatic Repair/System Restore to fix this issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this issue is related to bad memory, we might need to replace RAM or contact computer Manufacturer for more information.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. </p>

            <p>Upgraded from 7 to 8 pro to 8.1 via dreamcast at my college. maybe a partition got renamed or set from active to something else. can't get out of the two window loop of boot manager displaying my system available to recover as 7. no access to any advanced
 start up or bios - no F8, no Discs. I have read countless recovery options that involve botting to this or that or running this or that--the loop and the buttons I can press result in the next page in the loop or a restart back into the loop.</p>
<p>downloaded an 8.1 iso, after the hour+ download the write to usb failed. does the usb have to be formatted to some specific file system?</p>

<h2>            Error Code&#58; 0x80073CF9, Couldn&#39;t Install Forza Horizon 3 on PC</h2>
                    <p>I just bought Forza Horizon 3 for PC and am unable to download it. Everytime I try to download it, it gives me an error "Couldn't Install, we will try again shortly".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm installing it on a external hard drive with 800Gigs free, tried using wsreset, run as administrator to clear Windows Store Cache, to no avail. I tried installing it on another drive, but the same error pops up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've also followed Microsoft's solution to run the trouble shooting app "Appsdiagnostic10", it found a problem, "Windows Store Cache may be damaged", and it was fixed by the troubleshooter, but even after that, trying to download Forza Horizon 3 DOES NOT
 WORK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate any help/answers.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for all the details and the troubleshooting steps that you've provided. Since the troubleshooter found an issue with the Windows Store Cache, we suggest that you reset the cache folder in App Directory. Kindly follow the troubleshooting steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>File Explorer</strong>, copy paste the following path in the explorer address bar and press
<strong>Enter</strong>. Kindly change the <em>&lt;username&gt;</em> with the username associated with your account.:<strong> C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsStore_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState</strong></li><li>In the <strong>LocalState folder</strong>, check whether the <strong>cache</strong> folder is present or not. If the folder is present, rename it
<strong>cache.old</strong>. After that, create a new folder and name it <strong>cache</strong>. In case the cache folder is not there by default, just create an empty new folder and name it
<strong>cache</strong>.</li><li>Close the File Explorer and reboot your system. After the reboot, run the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>I just tried it, I am still unable to download Forza H3. The cache folder indeed was missing from my LocalState folder, I've created it and rebooted, and a new "MBRDNSCache.json" file has been created in the LocalState folder, but nothing in the cache folder.
 This time I tried downloading with my antivirus off, but to no avail.<br />

<p>No, what I meant was that the cache folder was not in the LocalState folder like you mentioned, so I created one. After creating it and rebooting. the cache folder was there (the one I just created), however there is no files in it. (Is it supposed to be
 like this?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for a clean boot installation, I just tried it, and I am still unable to download the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am installing it on a external hard drive, and these 2 folders are created in the hard drive. By any chance are these related to the installation of the game?</p>

<p>Thank you for all the details that you've provided. Since the troubleshooter kept on detecting the damaged Windows cache eventhough it mentioned it was fixed already, we suggest that you use this troubleshooter instead to repair the issue that block programs

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Since the issue is possibly caused by some damaged Windows Store components, we recommend resetting Windows Store and see if it helps. Follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Apps</strong>, then <strong>Apps &amp; features</strong> in the left pane.<br />
</li><li>Locate <strong>Store</strong>, then click <strong>Advanced options</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Reset</strong>.<br />
</li><li><strong>Restart </strong>your computer.<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Also, we recommend temporarily disabling your Norton antivirus when trying to install FH3.<br />
<br />
Update us on the outcome so we can provide further assistance.<br />

<h2>            SKYPE for business webapp not recognizing Webcam on Surface Pro</h2>
                    I recently purchased a Surface Pro from the MSFT store.&nbsp; When attempting to attend a Skype for Business meeting using the webapp plugin, the webapp does not detect a camera on my Surface.&nbsp; On reviewing history, this appears to be a repeating problem for
 the past two years despite them both being Microsoft products.&nbsp; How do we fix this properly?

<p>Hi Phil Morel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A workaround shared by customers is to temporarily disable the rear camera in the device management option in Control Panel. And for a better using experience, we suggest you using our Skype for Business
 desktop client to have online meetings. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, if you'd like us to improve this feature in the web app, you may send us a feedback via the following website:

    <title>18&#43; rated games played by children - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            18&#43; rated games played by children</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Microsoft bosses,<br />
<br />
What are you going to do about the fact that hundreds of thousand young people under the age of 14 are playing 18+ rated games on Xbox Live all the time?!<br />
<br />
I am an adult player at the age of 27 and i'm able to make a clear difference between fiction and reality but these kids aren't like i experience every time that i play online !!!<br />
<br />
I am shocked about the way the kids act during playing that games and i can hear clear signs of a personality disorder from many of that children.<br />
<br />
There is a reason why these games are rated 18+ and this is not only responsibility of the parents to keep kids under 14 years away from such content.<br />
<br />
Hope to get a senseful answer from your community managers or some other responsilbe feeling person!<br />
<br />
Furthermore i'm very angry about the fact that all my posts that i wrote to the different microsoft pages on facebook were deleted immediately !!!
<br />
<br />
I am a community manager and this kind of censoring in the modern IT-World is a pity!<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
Daniel</p>

<p>Not at that time of night on a Tuesday/Wednesday no. Anyways, It is up to the parent to decide what their kid can play. I'm 16, when I go into a store with the intentions of buying an M rated game (I'm assuming those are the games you are talking about since
 I don't know of any AO rated games) I have to make sure one of my parents is with me. There isn't really anything they could do to stop it. What could they do. &nbsp;It's not like they can just stop us, kids, from somehow obtaining the games to play them.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not sure if your in another country that uses a different rating system or not but M rated games are actually 17+, not that it makes that big of a difference other than I've played M rated games probably since I was 12 and as far as my friends,
 my family, and I can tell, I have no personality disorders. Nor do my brothers.</p>

<p>Daniel, it is up to the parents to figure out what they let their kids do. If you don't want to hear them then mute them or set you communication to friends only. As a parent I let my kids play COD games. I have them set to only talk to friends. I took the
 time to explain to my kids it's "just a game" &nbsp;As far as the things you wrote on their facebook page....it's up to Microsoft what they allow posted. Same thing here.</p>

<p>Instead of complaining about how parents are raising their kids and such, you should worry about your grammar. &nbsp;You write like a child, yet say you are 27. &nbsp;Really? &nbsp;And a community manager at that? &nbsp;Why are you so concerned with how others raise their kids
 and what they do? &nbsp;You should really spend more time worrying about yourself and improve your own well-being. &nbsp;And then you talk about censoring, but demand it is law to censor kids from certain content. &nbsp;Are you some deity who is here to make laws for all
 to follow and obey, but not make sense about it all? &nbsp;Just apply it the way you see fit and ignore your own hypocrisy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Daniel..... </p>
<p>I am a parent, teacher and avid gamer. &nbsp;I understand your concern about what young kids are being exposed to and how they are acting online. &nbsp;However, the others who have posted have made the most basic of points: kids gaming habits and capability is first
 and foremost the parents' responsibility. &nbsp;When you come across young kids while you are gaming that are acting crazy and stupid, it is not the fault of Microsoft or gaming companies but more of a lack of parenting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>B4RevenantGamer has a good point that there are rules and laws in place that prohibit the purchase of such games by young kids. &nbsp;However, if the parent buys the game for the kid there is nothing that a distributor can do about it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally I play a lot of Halo. &nbsp;In the past I have gotten very frustrated with how kids talk trash and communicate while playing. &nbsp;It finally got to a point that I realized I was acting no better than they were so I started using Party chat with my friends
 only while playing so as to avoid such gamers. &nbsp;</p>

<p>While I appreciate the OP's point, and agree with him to a point, I don't see this as being a long term problem in general. The age range of gamers is ever expanding, hell my mates grandmother can be found playing Uno and FH Poker most weeknights. This means
 that more and more mature people are being exposed to the kind of games out there through ads on the dashboard, in stores, trailers on tv etc, and I'd bet most of them are responsible enough to make sure their kids/grandkids don't have easy access to them.
 In a generation or two today's children will be parents themselves and will be well aware of the content that features in some games. I know that when I was a teenager I often thought that if I ever became a father I'd be a cool dad, let my kids do what they
 want when they want. Now that I am a father I'm probably one of the strictest out there when it comes to movies, tv, games and internet access! I'm constantly seeing eyes rolling, accompanied by the sound of tutting.....</p>
<p>Of course there will always be some people who are too lax about access, or allow their kids to play mature games, or are not even aware that such graphic scenes are in games. Can't blame Xbox for that though, you wouldn't blame the manufacturer of your
 dvd player if you caught your kid watching Saw on it. </p>

<p>Welcome to the world we live in. You have to understand that some kids want to game correctly and therefore, game like an adult. Xbox cant do anything as it is the parents who buy the games and allow their kids to play 18+ games. You took time to write that
 little rant, but overall, you should be ranting to the millions of parents that allow their kids to game on adult games, not to Xbox on the forums!</p>

<h2>            critical_service_failed</h2>
                    <p>A critical service failed error occurred in the middle of an internet session. Nothing was downloaded at the time as far as files. It was a company website. The computer went blank screen. This windows 10 was loaded as an upgrade around the release date.
 After several automated attempts to reboot itself, i attemted to restore the system from a date last summer. It then ground around for an hour or so and finally gave an error that contained the word twitter and then suggested an advanced restore problem. Solutions?</p>

            Hi AlSaunders.
<br />
<br />If a restore point didn't solve your issue use different recovery option.
<br />
<br />All option you can find here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />Firstly try to use Reset PC with Keep my files option.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have more questions

                    Lately I've been having some lagging issues, mainly with youtube and gaming programs. I have done a full scan on my computer and only had a few simple virus' and one bad one, all of which I have taken care of. I have also defragged my computer twice and
 I am still have slow lagging problems. My internet and networking is working fine and and I have been taken care of computer by the things I download, meaning I know it's clean and safe to use. Though my computer continues to lag on youtube and wont load the

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern. We would like to know which version of Windows are you using? To help you stop the upgrade process you need to get into Group Policy and change the configuration which is only available in Pro edition. You can also do
 it in Home edition using the registry. Please head over to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/3080351/how-to-manage-windows-10-notification-and-upgrade-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for the complete

            Hi,
<ul>
<li>How long have you been facing this issue? </li><li>What were the changes made before the issue occur? </li><li>Did you shut down the laptop or out it to sleep?
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</li></ul>
<div>You may refer these methods and check.</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>
<div>First check by restarting the computer through the power button.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>Start your computer in safe mode and then set your computer to the clean startup and check if it boots properly. If it boots properly may be a third party application or a service is causing the issue.<br />
