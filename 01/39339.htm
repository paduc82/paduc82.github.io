<h2>            Reactivating Windows 10 after hardware change.</h2>
                    <p>Lets start this off with calling didn't help. Twice I have called, twice they have failed to even comprehend what I'm even talking about. I bought Windows 10 Home last year on Aug 12th. And just last night, I upgraded my system Hardware, Mobo, Processor,
 ect. When trying to reactivate windows this morning, I've had nothing but problems. I've got an Error Code 0xC004C003 and any time I run the troubleshoot route it comes up with Unable to Activate Windows. This all getting out of hand, I am NOT going to spend
 another 120$ to fix a really stupid problem that should be extremely easy to fix. For note, I purchased Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just really need this fixed</p>

<h2>            Win 7 drag &#38; drop v slow and bad behaviour with limited user&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I have found some general discussion of drag &amp; drop (esp' with CTRL key) problems in Windows 7 when running as a limited user.&nbsp; I have experimented with this and although it is not completely conclusive and I have found no kb article yet, I am convinced
 there is enough&nbsp;coverage in my tests and consistency in the results and enough discussion to suggest this is a real win 7 problem.</p>
<p>Example:&nbsp; After running laptop for a while, amongst other applications win explorer etc etc, with&nbsp;similar outcomes I have opened a file in paintbrush as limited user and select and drag to move is v slow and drag drop with ctrl to copy is slow and it is
 not until one releases the ctrl key that after a few seconds the selection copies.</p>
<p>Close and rerun paintbrush as Administrator and hey presto it works perfectly, v fast and just in the manner it ought!!</p>
<p>I also had this testing my Vis Studio C# App and it took a while to realise it was not my application.&nbsp; Any ideas why this might be happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For any ones interest:</p>
<p>I have solved this now.&nbsp; I use endnote and Word 2007 with the endnote macros.&nbsp; These together do not truely support Win 7 64bit:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.endnote.com/support/faqs/Install/faq28.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.endnote.com/support/faqs/Install/faq28.asp</a></p>
<p>I had already followed this work around which solves the general case of locking up windows general activity navigation etc to an unworkable extent.&nbsp; However the workaround obviously doesn't quite solve everything.&nbsp; With word 2007 &amp; endnote open together
 and workaround implemented, the drag drop symptoms described ALWAYS occur.&nbsp; With Word 2007 &amp; Endnote closed they NEVER happened.&nbsp; So reasonably conclusive.</p>
<p>Thanks for the input.</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are ways to install a device driver on your Windows 8.1 computer. This can be completed through a USB installer, downloading it online, or through your system device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to check for the latest drivers for your system, we suggest that you go to the manufacturer's website of your DVD/CD ROM and search for the model to get the result of all the compatible drivers for your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can also try installing through the Device Manager. Kindly check the steps on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15046/windows-8-download-install-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support link</a> to complete the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other questions.</p>
        </p>

            Thank you&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Engelsen Fad for your time,&nbsp; and for sharing your knowledge. I really appreciate your response to my inquiry. I have tried all that you have mentioned to
 no avail. The manufacturer (Panasonic) has no drivers for the model on their website and referred me to Matshita's website. I found many links on their website advertising the drivers that I need, however,&nbsp; that is all they were, advertisements. As for the
 device manager, I went to the DVD/CD ROM tab, and there were several generic drivers listed. I uninstalled several of them and rebooted my computer fully expecting that the drivers would be reinstalled, but they never were. So now they're gone as well. I even
 tried to perform a System Restore to an earlier date before I uninstalled the drivers, and they still didn't install. Any advice?</span>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us with the information, Mike.<br />

Since the previous methods did not change anything, let's try using some Registry tweaks and see if it would do the job.<br />
<br />
Before we start, we highly recommend that you keep a backup of your registry.<br />
<br />
This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the
 registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article.
<br />
<br />
How to backup and restore the registry in Windows <br />

<br />
<br />
Once you're done with creating a backup, let's move on to deleting some registry. To do so:<br />
<br />
Click Start, click Run, type regedit in the Open box, and then click OK. Locate and then click the subkey that holds the registry item or items that you want to change. Here are the registry that you have to delete:<br />
<br />
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DeviceInstall\Parameters\DeviceInstallDisabled<br />
<br />
Also, delete the Upperfileters setting<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{EEC5AD98-8080-425F-922A-DABF3DE3F69A}<br />

 but then it takes me the Xbox store home page where you can see the expiration date until your Xbox live Gold runs out. The problem was, the date didn’t change from the last time I saw it. I then think I did something wrong and type in the code again, but
 then it says it’s already redeemed when I don’t have the extra 3 months added. I then go to my Microsoft history to see if I I actually bought it or not. The page loads in, and it says that a gold membership redeem card was added to my account 10 days ago,
 when I know for certain that I didn’t put in a gold membership that long ago. It said that the card had no money in it. So now I’m left wondering 3 things. 1. My Gold card, that I actually did redeem, wasn’t in my recent history of purchases or added into
 my Xbox live gold membership time. 2. Why does it say that I put in an Xbox Live Gold membership card when I didn’t? 3. How could a card, that is recorded in my recent history of purchases, that I didn’t purchase in the first place, from 10 days ago, have
 $0 in value and still show up in my Microsoft history? Maybe I got a hacked/ used card, or maybe something is wrong on Microsoft’s end of things. I don’t know and that’s why I’m asking if somebody can help me understand why my Xbox Live Gold membership card,
 which was unscratched, telling from the covering bar over the code, isn’t working like it’s supposed to.</span>

<h2>            So difficult and confusing is SKYPE &#33;</h2>
                    <p>We find SKYPE so difficult and frustrating to use compared to&nbsp; 10 years ago. Added to this there is no noticeable improvement in:</p>
<p>&nbsp; (1) sound,</p>
<p>&nbsp; (2) more frequent failures ,such as the receiver cannot hear us, and/or we cannot hear the receiver ,</p>
<p>&nbsp; (3) so much really intrusive advertisement forced down our throat when we start SKYPE . Furthermore</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; we cannot start SKYPE without first navigating the thickets of the dreaded abusive advertisement. There</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; are nice advertisement and, there are appallingly intrusive advertisements that are relentless forced
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp; us like an impossible obstacle course to surmount</p>
<p>We hate SKYPE. We really hate SKYPE . After been an active international telephone calls&nbsp; user of SKYPE for 30 years or more.</p>
<p>Microsoft , as SKYPE's parent company and ownere ,is&nbsp; greedy for money from advertisements . It is abusive . It is now putting us off
</p>
<p>using SKYPE.Our experience with SKYPE is so bad . Can some one somewhere advise&nbsp; please? Any suggestions or recommendations&nbsp; to other suppliers globally ?&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;It is really&nbsp; believe you me so frustrating to use SKYPE . It is already tough to find out which version&nbsp; we are using. Because we are business people , not those jobless computer geeks with lots and lots of time to spare. So we will tell you that we are
 using the latest version,that SKYPE kept intruding on us to upgrade to the "Web edition- BETA. . Look it is already dreadful using everytime we had updated SKYPE is become increasingly complex and frustrating to use . Waste our time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have been using Windows 10.</p>

<p>Hi Dana, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We suggest that you run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit. The diagnosis and repair takes about 15 minutes as it would check for both Windows and driver updates. It will automatically install any missing Windows update or driver and firmware update for your
 device<span>. </span><span><span>Click&nbsp;<span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here&nbsp;</a></strong></span>to learn how to run
 the toolkit. </span></span>Force shutdown your device to ensure all updates are applied.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button for a full 10 seconds, until the screen turns off, then release the power button.</li><li>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, use this two-button shutdown process to make sure your Surface completely turns off.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.</li><li>
<p>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.<br />
The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.</p>
</li><li>After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.</li><li>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If running the toolkit didn't help, try to disable the audio enhancements. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>Sound </strong>in the search box. Select <strong>Sound </strong>
from the list of results.<br />
</li><li>The Sound properties box will open. Under the <strong>Playback </strong>tab, right-click the default device – Speakers/Headphones and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
</li><li>In the Speakers Properties box which opens, switch to the <strong>Enhancements
</strong>tab, select the <strong>Disable all enhancements</strong> check box.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Update your Surface Dock if disabling the audio enchantments didn't work. Click
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023478" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> on how you can update the dock.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.</p>

<h3> justinevans1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 6 - Repeated BSODs with exact error and suspected process causing failure changing every time</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a brand new Surface Pro 6 in February 2019 - i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD (LQJ-00016 is the specific model code).&nbsp; It's the commercial model and came with the retail version of Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; Since purchasing, I regularly do manual checks for firmware/Windows
 updates and have kept the device completely update with the newest releases from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything was working fine until about a week ago. While just browsing around the internet, I got a blue screen of death.&nbsp; When I rebooted, it happened again - with a different stop/error code.&nbsp; This happened 8-10 more times over the course of that day,
 each with a different code than the last.&nbsp; After exhausting all of my rollback and device driver re-installation options, I decided to start from scratch and wipe the entire drive using the Windows Media Creation Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After re-installing Windows, I started re-installing the firmware releases (newest versions available on Microsoft's firmware download webpage for the Surface Pro 6).&nbsp; I also stopped automatically updating Windows and device drivers in an attempt to troubleshoot
 the culprit.&nbsp; Everything went fine for about 24 hours.&nbsp; I started slowly re-adding the firmwares and Windows updates back into the mix, which brings me to today - I am right back where I started.&nbsp; I had a BSOD crash yesterday (KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE,
 process: dxgmm2.sys), as well as one this morning (SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION, process: ntkrnlmp.exe).&nbsp; I am at my wit's end, because this is the 4th or 5th re-installation of Windows I've performed within the past 7 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything was working fine prior to the recent crashes.&nbsp; I have uploaded the minidump files from the last 2 BSODs, as well as .txt documents of the text displayed in the windbg tool for crashes that occurred on 6/25 and 6/26.&nbsp; I think I still have some
 of the dump files and can upload them to my Google Drive or Dropbox if needed to assist with troubleshooting.&nbsp; Any ideas you all may have will be VERY MUCH APPRECIATED - my Surface Pro is virtually unusable in its current state.&nbsp; For reference, here are other
 stop codes I have received via BSOD within the last 7 days:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">

The next<br />step is to try the downloadable recovery image specific to your SP6 and run on<br />that for a day or so and see if you still have crashes. Do not manually check<br />for updates. The test is to see if there are crashes with the base image. Don't<br />install/connect any peripherals except the type cover. -<br />Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (with a different Windows computer if yours is not working properly)&nbsp; and download a recovery image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick<br />formatted FAT32 (use a Windows computer). Use FULL format

<p>I misspoke, my apologies.&nbsp; What I actually did was go into Apps &amp; Features and uninstall the "Surface Pro 6 Update" program for the most recent update that I downloaded from here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57514</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I downloaded the recovery image and prepared a FAT32 flash drive per the instructions linked in your reply.&nbsp; I have used that flash drive to "clean" the SSD and install the base Windows 10 Pro 1809 image to the machine.&nbsp; I will put it through its
 paces to see if the blue screen of death returns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else have any ideas or recommendations?&nbsp; Surely someone has seen a situation similar to mine in which a bevy of different BSODs just continue to appear.&nbsp; In fact, this morning I got a BSOD while trying to download the recovery image - PFN_LIST_CORRUPT
 (process name: SYSTEM).&nbsp; After Googling that error, the most common recommendation was to test the RAM for errors, so that's what I did.&nbsp; I ran the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool to completion, which did not result in any identified errors.&nbsp; As recommended
 elsewhere, I also ran a much more intensive test - memtest86.&nbsp; That program went through 4 passes of all 16GB of memory and did not report any errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is crazy to me that a native Microsoft product is having so many and such substantial issues ostensibly related to Windows 10.&nbsp; I have not installed any updates to the machine that weren't provided directly from the Windows Update platform or the manual
 installations listed above in the firmware hyperlink.&nbsp; I have another Surface Pro 6 for work (with different specs) that has not had any of these problems whatsoever.&nbsp; Anything anyone could recommend would be so, so appreciated.&nbsp; I spent so much money on the
 top tier Surface Pro 6 and am about ready to get rid of it after only 4 months.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Press and hold the power button until the screen turns off (about 10<br />

<p>Does anyone else have any suggestions?&nbsp; I completed the Windows 10 reinstall with the Surface image as suggested.&nbsp; As with previous re-installs, it worked for 24-36 hours and then the random rolling BSODs reappeared.&nbsp; I have updated the list of error codes
 with the most recent stop codes I have received on the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like there's something very wrong with the machine, but Memtest86 returns no RAM errors and the culprit process associated with each BSOD seems to change in just about every iteration.&nbsp; Has no one experienced something similar?&nbsp; I'm just about ready
 to file a service ticket online or schedule an in-person Microsoft store visit at the closest location (3 hours away) because the machine is useless as it sits.</p>

<p>It's not possible to convert the PST file itself, only to import the data from the PST file.</p>

    <title>FireWall and Internet Connectivity Compatibility Issues. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ellisrobertszm  say:</h3>
<h2>            FireWall and Internet Connectivity Compatibility Issues.</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so I reset 'my' computer to factory settings as it was given to me as a replacement to my own. The 'new' set-up went fine, as you'd expect and there were no apparant issues as all I was using was Chrome browser and Microsoft Office applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I am starting to download new programmes, such as Steam and the new verion of Java, neither of these are allowed access to the internet? I presumes this was because of my Fire Wall and they were given access. Steam was working okay with no issues
 but Java was unable to download due to my firewall blocking it, or so it said. And now Steam will no longer connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unaware of a fix to this, and from looking online I am unable to find a solution to the issue, or close to the issue that isn't 3 years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I attempt to reset everything again, is there anything I should try? Or consider trying? Any help is really appreciated as this is something I have no experience or knowledge of.</p>

            <p>You can drag a window until your pointer bumps the side to "snap" it into the side (same snap as Windows 7 and 8).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can use a keyboard shortcut to do it: &nbsp;hold WindowsLogo and press the left or right arrow key (this also is the same in Windows 7 and 8 too).</p>

<h3> jen2277b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uncontrolled Scrolling in Windows 7 64-bit</h2>
                    I'm experiencing uncontrolled scrolling on my Dell Studio 1737 with a Windows 7 64-bit OS.&nbsp; It isn't limited to a specific software.&nbsp; Whenever a scroll list is available, the list cannot be pulled down further than what is immediately viewable without
 rolling back up to the top (program list, file list, favorites list in IE, etc.).&nbsp; It is even evident in the volume control in the system tray.&nbsp; If I pull the scroll bar down in the volume control, the bar just rolls back up to the top at max volume.&nbsp; I've
 actually had to mute the volume.&nbsp; Dell is refusing to support the problem (without paying them more!) claiming it's a software issue.&nbsp; I've updated my Bios and sound driver to no avail.&nbsp; Any ideas????

Hi,</p>
<p>Are you using touch pad or any mouse to use scroll function?</p>
<p>You may try reducing mouse/touch pad sensitivity in Alps application on your laptop. Then check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>You may also try the below steps:<br />
1.&nbsp;Click on start button, type ease of access center in search box and press enter.<br />
2.&nbsp;In the pop-up window, click on Make the mouse easier to use<br />
3.&nbsp;Clear the check mark for the following options:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Activate a window by hovering over it with the mouse<br />
•&nbsp;Prevent windows from being automatically arranged when moved to the edge of the screen</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Click on OK button.</p>

<p>How do the pictures normally make it from your phone to your PC?&nbsp; Are you using OneDrive for example so it happens automatically in the background without any cable connection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you can do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Open File Explorer and go to This PC section</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Type the phrase <strong>kind:picture</strong> into the search box at the top (no spaces just a colon between words).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may take a minute, but it will show every picture on your entire computer.&nbsp; Once the results show, you can sort by date to see the newest ones first (which might help) and see if you can find the ones you are looking for.&nbsp; If you find it in the search
 results, right-click it and choose "open file location" to open the folder where that picture file really is stored.</p>

<h2>            Stop name tagging in Skype messages</h2>
                    <p>When typing a message to someone in Skype, if I start to type their name, the message bar will auto populate their full name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance, if I want to type good morning Mish (instead of Mishalee), Skype will autopopulate the full name after I press the space bar after the letter h.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a mild inconvenience but it is driving me bonkers.</p>

<h2>            Windows Hello Recognizes Face Then Fails To Log In</h2>
                    <p>I have just started using windows Hello on a surface book. The "Hello" facial recognition feature works flawlessly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is as follows:</p>
<p>AFTER windows hello recognizes my face it sends me to the login screen and attempts to log in.
<strong>At this point it fails to log in saying</strong>: "<strong>username or password is incorrect</strong>". I fail to understand how my username or password can be incorrect considering I did not enter either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted:</p>
<p>restarting</p>
<p>updating windows (I am verified up to date)</p>
<p>improving facial recognition</p>
<p>changing my Microsoft password</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for inconvenience caused</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will surely assist you to rectify the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Hello is a more personal way to sign in to your Surface with just a look or a touch. The front-facing camera on Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book recognizes your face and iris, allowing you to sign in to Windows 10 without having to touch the screen
 or keyboard. Or, if you have a Surface Pro 4 and a Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID (sold separately), you can use the fingerprint reader on that Cover to sign in with a press of your finger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to refer the article below and follow the troubleshooting steps mentioned in it and see if it helps:<br />
</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry for delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows Hello is a more personal, more secure way to get instant access to your Windows 10 devices using fingerprint, face, or eye recognition. Most PCs with fingerprint readers are ready
 to use Windows Hello now, and more devices that can recognize your face and iris are coming soon. So, you might need to check with Dell support if your system is ready to recognize with Windows Hello or if there is a driver update needed for your system to
 work with the new Windows utility.</span></p>

            <p>Dear microsoft;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also having the same issue. To be clear the issue is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware: Microsoft surface pro 4</p>
<p>Software: Fully updated windows 10 pro</p>
<p>Issue: Hello recognises me. It welcomes me by name. It then says the username or password is incorrect.</p>
<p>Extra information: The above issue happens around 90 percent of the time. It occasionally works. I have tried removing Hello and going through setup again as recommended. The issue is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help?</p>

<p>Try removing the PIN you have set and setting it up again. I had the same problem as everyone else here and it seemed to come out of nowhere but resetting the PIN fixed it.

<p>It seems the problem is the Time Zone and the system time. &nbsp;I use UTC-4:00 time zone, but when I select that, the system has the "Set time automatically"option enabled and never adjusted the hour. &nbsp;When I set this option off and set the correct hour, restart
 the device and face recognition works. &nbsp;I will try it with other 9 Surface Pro 4 users.</p>

</p><p>I have exactly the same issue with Windows Hello face recognition, but with 9 Surface &nbsp;Pro&nbsp;4&nbsp;and 9 different users,&nbsp;Windows recognizes the face, but says that the password is incorrect. also they try the PIN, it says it's incorrect. &nbsp;We are using Office

That's not what the error message really says, is it?<br />
<br />
You don't have an XP problem, you have a Norton WinDoctor problem.<br />
<br />
These files usually fall into the area of influence by the Windows XP implementation of Side by Side (SxS) technology.<br />
<br />
Usually, DLL files would be found in the c:\windows\system32 folder, but sometimes there is a need (depending on the applications<br />
installed) to have two different DLLs with the same name on one computer at the same time (this would be side by side).&nbsp; Ouch!&nbsp;&nbsp; How are you going&nbsp;to do that?<br />
<br />
Since the names of the DLL files are the same they can't both be in c:\windows\system32 (this is called DLL H*ll) and you might not be<br />
able to just overwrite one, so XP can keep the odd one in another folder:&nbsp; c:\windows\WinSxS and find and use the correct DLL there when it needs it.<br />
<br />
The mix up is usually from something that has recently been installed, uninstalled or updated (like the .NET Framework for example).<br />
<br />
You have some options:<br />
<br />
Some people will "solve" the problem by searching their system for the files Norton is complaining about and copy them (usualy from somewhere in the c:\windows\WinSxS folder) into the c:\windows\system32 and think that is a solution.&nbsp; This is really a silly
 idea but it counts as a "solution" for some people.<br />
<br />
You could ignore the errors. &nbsp;In some circles, this is also known as a "solution".<br />
<br />
You could configure Norton WinDoctor to ignore these errors (this is advice from Norton - but then why use it at all?)<br />
<br />
You could not use Norton WinDoctor since they acknowledge the issue on their WWW site (at least in the older versions of WinDoctor).<br />
<br />
You could see if the latest version of Norton WinDoctor will resolve the situation&nbsp;&nbsp;(you neglected to specify your version).&nbsp; At some point after the 2006 and 2007 versions Norton thinks they fixed this problem.&nbsp; If you have a valid Norton WinDoctor subscription,
 updates are free.&nbsp; I don't use Norton, so I don't know if the new version is better or not.<br />
<br />
You could ditch Norton all together and replace it with something a little smarter.<br />

            The above response was way off base, IMHO. Instead of just trashing another company, it would have been more helpful for the responder to have actually known (or researched) something about the problem.
<br />
<br />
There are MANY Microsoft customers, including me, who have had the same or a similar problem with missing files. The cause of the lost files is apparently not known...or least not well documented. However, the missing files affect several applications. In my
 case, they affect Acrobat Reader, HP Digital Imaging (and other HP exe), Quick Books (several exe), Logitech Setpoint and a few others. My missing DLL files (per Norton) are MSVCP80, MSVCR80, MFC80, MFC80U, ATL80 and a few others.
<br />
<br />
By searching the Internet, I ran across several different recommendations for "fixing" the problem. Several responders said to "simply" remove and reinstall the affected application(s). In effect, they said that this would automatically create new replacement
 files for whatever was missing.&nbsp; However, what looked like the best recommendation was to run Microsoft's "scannow." To do this, from Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Run, type in cmd to get to the command prompt. Then type in sfc /scannow (including the space after
 sfc). A message will appear telling you to run your Windows CD (for whichever version you are using). Apparently, the CD should contain all of the missing files, and the "scannow" app will replace anything that is missing or defective.
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the Microsoft instructions for doing all this are either not up to date or not complete, because they do not explain how to deal with some other issues that arise (at least in my case). I am still running XP Home/Media Center edition, and my
 CD is the original version. I have updated it through Service Packs 1, 2 and 3. Consequently, I do not have a CD for my current version. To make matters worse, the scannow app misdiagnosed my system and thinks I am running XP Professional with SP3. I am still
 waiting to hear from someone on that subject and how to make scannow run correctly on my pc. Stay tuned!
<br />
<br />
If anyone else can help me out, you may also be helping the MANY others who are experiencing the same problem(s). It's true that Norton will not fix these problems, but maybe that's because Microsoft will not even let them replace the missing files. That's
 just my guess, because it seems like there are several politically motivated people there who are way down on allowing other companies to solve their problems (and again that's just MHO).
