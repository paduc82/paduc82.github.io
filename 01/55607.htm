    <title>Windows Key &#43; Arrow Key Functionality - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Key &#43; Arrow Key Functionality</h2>
                    The Windows Key + Right/Left Arrow combination moves the active window fine (which I like) but then brings up an option to select which window to place next to it and, thus, losing selection on the current window (which I don't like). &nbsp;I want to move the
 window and continue working in that window rather than press ESC or click back to activate the window again.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to change the way the shortcut works to be more like Windows 8?<br />
<br />

            <p>The option you're looking for is Settings &gt; System &gt; Multi-tasking &gt; When I snap a window, show what I can snap next to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing this to Off prevents the annoying popup you're describing.</p>

<h2>            Error message &#34;Class has not been registered&#34; when trying to browse the web, open Windows Store or click on the Windows Button</h2>
                    <p>My dad has had his microsoft surface 3 for almost 6 months or less now, bought it from jb hi fi. But recently I booted the device up and everytime i wanted to go browse the internet, opening the windows store and clicking on the windows button, but none
 of them works and instead it tells me in the pop-up saying: "class has not been registered".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access the control panel from the file explorer, but not the actual settings app. so from my knowledge, i can only access the what the file explorer shows me and touching the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I factory reset the surface or try contacting jb hi fi for this product and ask for another device of the surface 3?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you guys.</p>

    <title>Can not boot after upgrading Windows 10 from Windows 7&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> omkarjoshi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can not boot after upgrading Windows 10 from Windows 7&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I recently upgraded Lenovo Z580 Ideapad running Windows 7 that came with the laptop. I received the Windows 10 upgrade notification which indicated that the laptop is compatible with Windows 10. So &nbsp;I downloaded the tool and upgraded the PC from there.
 Windows 10 installed and booted. Then I installed all the drivers and restarted the PC but now it is stuck at the boot screen, giving me the boot options. When I select the hard disc, it goes black and comes back to same screen. I have an access to other PC
 from which I am not creating a bootable USB for Windows 10 but if I use that to clean install the Windows 10 on that laptop now, will it ask for activation key?

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your&nbsp;response in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the inconvenience that you are faced with.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You have to create a USB or&nbsp;CD/DVD Media Creation tool and &nbsp;try to access the "Recovery Environment" through it.</span></p>
<p><span>Once you insert the device into your system you will be able to access Startup Repair option. Perform the repair and check if it fixes your boot issue, if not you can perform&nbsp;"Refresh install",&nbsp;with&nbsp;"Keep
 my files and data" as option. This will install the OS again and also keep all your personal data intact.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If however you choose to perform "Clean Install" you will have to create a back up of all your&nbsp;data. If your 10 OS was already activated before this issue, it will not prompt for a product
 key. But if it was not you can activate by typing "slui 4" in Run command (Windows +R to open run command) and following the on screen instruction.</span></p>

    <title>Sticky notes defective after latest Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> algebe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sticky notes defective after latest Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>With the old sticky notes, I could format text in Word and paste it into a note. With the new version all the formatting disappears, leaving a oversized font and over-wide linespacing. As a result, all my notes are now too big.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I could select and right click to copy content from my notes. Now the right click context menu is gone, and instead I get a silly little menu box that appears on a different screen, often hidden behind apps. Did you know that many people use multiple
 screens these days? Couldn't your programmers at least set the thing up to appear next to the notes?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried copying the old sticky notes program from windows.old. My notes appeared with the proper formatting, but right click does not work at all. Also, notes cannot be deleted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used sticky notes for copying/pasting things like phone numbers into forms. Microsoft appears to have robbed me of yet another useful functionality.

<p>
</p><p>Have you tried importing them into OneNote?&nbsp; It looks like you were trying to do more with Sticky Notes than would have been originally intended anyway.&nbsp; E.g. some of the features that you liked in the original may have been more accidents of implementation
 than actual design goals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least one of the problems the new ones fix is whether you Ink or Type.&nbsp; The old ones left that hit or miss.&nbsp; Maybe it is something like that which is causing your "right-click" issue.&nbsp; As for Deletion I don't have a clear idea.&nbsp; I would try running ProcMon
 to see if it gave any clues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW thanks for starting your own thread.&nbsp; Did you create a Feedback item too?&nbsp; Win-F.&nbsp; You could Paste a link to it here and see if others would up-vote it or add their comments to that too.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I wasn't doing anything heroic with the notes. I just listed bits of text information, like emails and phone numbers, so I could copy and paste them into forms, etc. The formatting was simple, too. Larger fonts, closer line spacing. It worked perfectly until
 Microsoft "fixed" it with the latest Windows 10 update. They also "fixed" a lot of other stuff that took me several hours to unfix.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd have to agree with you that something that works well in a Microsoft app is probably accidental.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as Sticky notes is concerned, I downloaded a third-party program called 7 Sticky Notes (donation-ware), which has 10 times the functionality and stability of Windows Sticky Notes. So I'm through with the Microsoft version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway. </p>

If I’m not contacted ASAP by someone from the enforcement team, or by someone who can get me access to my games and movies I will be forced to take legal actions. Your corporation robbed me of thousands of dollars and make it impossible to file an appeal. Again I need contacted ASAP by an enforcement agent, I’m fed up with how I’m being treated as a customer.</p>

First time build, everything went smooth, everything seemed fine until I started playing games. It will randomly freeze and make a loud ERRRRR noise through whatever speaker I have it set to and I need to hold the power button down to restart the PC, then I
 can play again no problem until next freeze. I can play anywhere between 1 hour to 7+ hours before it freezes again making it really hard to test fixes and pin down. I updated my Bios and it seemed to work fine for a whole week straight until I added some
 fans to the case and then the problem popped up again. All drivers are up to date, I've ran windows memory diagnostics and that was fine. I've stress tested the CPU with Prime 95 and that went fine. I've even tried clocking my RAM to slower speeds and that
 didn't help. Still froze. I'm currently trying not overclocking the CPU by turning off Intel turbo boost in the bios, so it runs at 3.7Ghz but I haven't had time to test that yet. Any idea what my problem could be? It doesn't freeze doing anything else other
 than gaming. Games it's froze during are, far cry 5, ghost recon wildlands, fortnite, black ops 4 and StarCraft 2.</p>

<p>Cpu Turbo mode isn't quite the same as OC'ing the base speed so you should be able to enable that again without issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I've even tried clocking my RAM to slower speeds and that didn't help."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>By clocking at lower speed, do you mean you reset BIOS to default ? The highest non-OC speed on this mobo is 2666MHz.</p>
<p>The highest you want to go with your RAM Speed when not OCing the cpu is to use the XMP setting.</p>
<p>If that is not stable stick to the mobo's default speed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The interesting thing about this issue is your RAM can still pass the test, but you can get seemingly random crashes when</p>
<p>you use OC RAM speeds without OC'ing the cpu.</p>
<p>I believe the reason&nbsp; for this, it the test stress the cpu and RAM individually, so when gaming the cpu gets overwhelmed trying</p>
<p>to keep up with the too high OC RAM speed.</p>
<p>Generally games that use more RAM than others, will crash sooner (also why the machine does not crash when not gaming).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is little or no real world gaming benefit to OC RAM these days anyway. Games are far more VRAM intensive than they once were,
</p>
<p>and the gpu/VRAM are the most important factors in gaming performance.</p>

            I turned off XMP and it set the RAM to 2133mhz, it didn't crash for awhile that way, but again it doesn't always crash immediately so it's hard to tell if that was the issue. I noticed a performance hit at that clock speed to I changed it to 3000Mhz and
 it crashed a few hours after using that setting (not sure if that's what caused it). When I set it to XMP it clocks my RAM at 3200Mhz which is what my RAM is rated for.

<p>Yes, well your RAM's XMP may a bit too high then. Try sticking to 2666MHz or less, and if you still get random crashes leave it</p>
<p>there at least until you sort out what else may be involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I noticed a performance hit at that clock speed to I changed it to 3000Mhz "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a bit surprised there would be a real world gaming performance hit with lower RAM speed. At least nothing significant.</p>
<p>

<p>I noticed it in wildlands which I had capped at 60FPS, (uncapped ran between 60-70FPS) and at 2133Mhz it was getting between 50-58 FPS, so I guess not significant, but enough to notice. but as I said my RAM is rated for 3200, which is what XMP sets it at
 so it shouldn't be an issue I'd think? I guess I wouldn't know being new to PC building and all.</p>

<p>If it was steady @60fps and is dropping to 50fps @2133MHz, I would consider that a significant loss, and I agree, if XMP is 3200MHz</p>
<p>it <em>should</em> be stable, but XMP speed is not guaranteed to be stable.</p>
<p>I would still recommend leaving the BIOS at default while troubleshooting the issue so it can be left out of the equation with certainty.</p>
<p>Once the lock-ups are sorted out go back to XMP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT: Just looking back on your first post -&nbsp;<em> "i5 9600k clocked at 4.4Ghz</em>" - Just want to verify. This was the Turbo-boost speed, yes ?&nbsp; ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You may want to post on the Corsair forums. It's been years since I was involved in RAM (also due to trying to push the speed at the time</p>
<p>causing games to randomly lock-up ), so I am probably a bit behind the times. The memory controllers, and other influences have
</p>
<p>changed a lot since then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Post the System Logs&nbsp; Sumit suggested as well.</p>
<p>Because the crash is a lock-up I don't suppose there are any crash dump files being generated, but if there are any</p>
<p>post up to four of them too.<br />

<p>Yes, you can rule out the RAM, but I would leave it at default for now.</p>
<p>Your system report has a lot of DCOM errors, but these shouldn't cause games to lock up.&nbsp; I get heaps of them as well.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly these, as with many errors, have to do with the way I have things setup.</p>
<p>- If you do a search for DCOM errors you may find something that will prevent the errors being generated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Are the games locking up in both single player and online mode ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Software conflicts can also cause games to lock-up.</p>
<p>Because of the randomness it may be difficult to determine if your Anti-Virus is causing the lock-up, but I would be inclined to</p>
<p>disable my AV, at least when playing single player games with Steam/UPlay/Origin in off line mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the lock-ups persist with your AV off try running in <em>Clean Boot</em> to verify if there are any conflicts with a Service or Startup program.</p>
<p>(Note believe Clean Boot does not help find programs you may launch manually after booting into Windows, so keep</p>
<p>all such programs that you may have open when running a game in mind.)</p>

            <p>Hey Hayden,<br />
As ThrashZone has mentioned that, games do take a lot of recourse and more if you are running multiple applications as well as games. Increasing the RAM does help to a certain extent, however before that I would suggest you to install the
<a href="http://www.geforce.com/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">latest drivers for your graphic card.</a></p>
<p>Also run a complete scan using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Safety Scanner </a>and check for any infections. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps and do get to us if you need further assistance. We will be glad to help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just tried it and makes no difference... As I said steam games also have this problem when they are not in full screen mode... Closing all the other programs would make the game minimize to desktop instead&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry for the late reply...<br />
<br />
All programs I have tested + I ran CC cleaner and windows defrag as they are sort of similar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use AVG free software which is up to date ( scans have come back with nothing )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating chipset drivers has not worked either</p>

<h2>            Start Menu and Notifications Window stop working all of a sudden in Windows 10.</h2>
                    Has a working solution to the Start Menu, Cortana and the Notification Windows ceasing to respond after the computer has been on for a while??? &nbsp;I tried most of the suggestions published in the community and also tried the sfc /scannow suggestion which
 says no problems exist on my computer. &nbsp;Even after the "upgrade" to Windows 10 version 10586, I still have this problem. &nbsp;Only a reboot of the computer gets these areas to work again for a while.

<h2>            How do I adjust my &#34;touch pad&#34; cursor for scrolling&#63;</h2>
                    My "ACER" laptop has a "finger controlled cursor pad" that has a "scrolling" option to it if you use the right side of the "touch pad". I can' t seem to get it to "scroll" by using this option. The "wireless" mouse I use will "scroll".

<h2>            Content can not be transferred between profiles</h2>
                    
<p>I had this huge minecraft castle world on an profile that didn't have Xbox live, and I wanted to transfer it to my gold account so I can play with friends, and it wouldn't let me transfer it between profiles. I had deleted the profile, but not the items.
 When I go see the world save in storage, it says unknown profile. When I try to move it to my gold account, it says content can not be transfered between profiles. This has been happening or a while now.</p>

<h2>            Skype Keeps Asking How To Open Pictures</h2>
                    I have version 7.40.0.103 of Skype and since I wiped my computer clean, Skype keeps asking me how to open every single picture I attempt to open: I keep clicking the checkmark box on opening with windows photo viewer, but it keeps asking. I've tried uninstalling
 and reinstalling Skype. I've tried opening with other programs. Skype is the only one that does this, no other picture asks how to be opened. I had this issue before, but I cannot remember how I fixed it.

When I remove
 the stick it will disappear from both places.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I stop&nbsp;my ( E ) drive&nbsp;from showing twice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When I had windows 8.1 all 3 of my ipods worked fine when they were plugged in. Since the upgrade we are also having issues with plugging in Ipod, uninstalled and reinstalled program. one ipod shows as a storage unit and will not play music and my other

<h2>            No right Click</h2>
                    Come on Microsoft. &nbsp;I need my right click. &nbsp;Creating folders, deleting items, sending files etc. &nbsp;Not only does it not work but if you try to use a right click the programme freezes and you have to go back to the beginning of your task. &nbsp;A bit elementary
 I would say. &nbsp;I have been right clicking since windows was invented I can't change now. &nbsp;Only to go back to Windows 7. &nbsp;I would be prepared to swap Cortina for my right click back...please! &nbsp;CB

            <p>I solved the problem today. I went to Office Depot and purchased a Logitech Wireless Mouse and Keyboard.</p>
<p>Came home and plugged them in. That solved the problem. I now have my "right click" back on everything.</p>
<p>I cannot believe for me it was as simple as upgrading my mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            External mic is not listed in devices so unable to use the external mic</h2>
                    I bought a new windows 10 dell laptop and trying to use an external Boya Lavalier mic with it. But when I connect it, my voice still does not get recorded and nothing shows in troubleshooting. The mic is working correctly when connected to a mobile so
 that is not a problem itself. &nbsp;

    <title>How to customize Windows OS like Mac OS X&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reason909  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to customize Windows OS like Mac OS X&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello I'm a Mac user who's moved to PC after decades of Mac use.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I do 3D computer graphics.<span>&nbsp; </span>I still do office communication &amp; office work on a Mac laptop and share files via Dropbox.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I'd like to customize my PC with various add-ons, but I'm afraid to this without a better understanding of what exactly I'm changing.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For example, I'm interested in this .webloc opener product: https://benchdoos.github.io/</span></p>
<p><span>It <em>seems</em> ok, but I really don't know what it's doing technically, and how it modifies the windows OS to accomplish this.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I've come across the following terms in my research:<span>&nbsp; </span>shell scripts, extensions &amp; add-ons.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I don't know what they mean, what the distinctions are between them, and whether they're system-wide or application/program specific.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm mostly concerned with customizations that could make my PC crash, create conflicts with other software, or reduce performance and speed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I'm also concerned they may compromise security, though that seems unlikely if I use a bit of common sense.<span>&nbsp;
</span>On the Mac side there are startup items and control panels, and I have a fair idea of how they'll modify the base system.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm reasonably tech savvy, but new to PC's &amp; Windows.<span>&nbsp; </span>Is there an online guide that explains customizing PC architecture for people like me?
</span><span>Most of the descriptions for these customization products are showing existing features or cosmetic stuff like custom backgrounds.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The advanced setups assume people are PC power users familiar with these terms, not newbies from the Mac side.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>FYI:<span>&nbsp; </span>The customizations I'm currently interested in are to match what I'm used to on the Mac:<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Moving selected items into a new folder (like OSX finder's right-click)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Batch renaming files (like OSX finder's right-click)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Customizing Windows File Explorer to show GB/MB instead of KB.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Better Display of file paths inside an application or when I click alt-tab.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Better previews (like OSX's command spacebar).<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>I'd also like to adjust hotkeys.</span><br />
<br />
BTW, I have Windows 10 and an Alienware PC hardware with a NVidea 1080t GPU.&nbsp; I don't have exact model numbers at the moment, but its a fairly modern setup, bought last August.&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>Thank you for replying.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p><span>I understand that you need the Windows Explorer to be customized like Mac OS X’s finder, however, Windows Explorer
 has its own modifications. You can change the way the files are displayed, you can hide/unhide files. Once you start using it, you may find interesting to navigate around. However, modifying the File Explorer as MAC OSX Finder may not be possible.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For your question related to moving Windows File Explorer files/items, there are many ways you can do it. You
 can cut and paste the items from one location to another. You can also drag and drop the files/items.&nbsp;You can use the navigation pane on the left hand side in File Explorer which will help in organizing the files/items.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I see from the screenshot that you have provided, right clicking on the filename provides the location of the
 current file. However, in Windows, if you right click on the filename on the taskbar it will show the recently opened files from the jump list.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you want the folder name to be displayed when you use Alt + Tab, you can disable the option to display full
 path in the title bar. Please follow the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press and hold
<strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>E</strong> to open <strong>File Explorer</strong>.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facings some issues with apps on your Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to some corruptions in apps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to refer to the Microsoft Help Article given below and check.
<strong>(Refer to the section apps and store to run the troubleshooter).</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Windows 10 help &amp; how-to</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/support</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>NOTE:</strong> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in
 Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when
 you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network
 policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section <strong>“How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”
</strong>to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>

<p><span>The Dell Inspiron is rather large for use as a paper weight and rather badly-shaped&nbsp;for a doorstop and lightweight for
 a boat anchor. So, best to replace the drive and continue to use it as a computer.<br />
<br />
OK Sorry, I should have resisted but....<br />
<br />
If you want confirmation of imminent HD death: <br />
First and foremost-back up your user files. Next, use a different computer to get the disk diagnostics for the make of drive the notebook has. Run the diagnostics on the drive.<br />

            Reinstallation of OS is one another option which you have .. also you can go to repair your computer and try restoring your computer sometimes its regular updates which does not make your system boot up

            Pull the drive and slave it in another system, or use a $20 USB HDD adaptor.&nbsp; Run chkdsk on it.&nbsp; There's a good chance this will repair the damage.

            That code means that there is a bad spot on your hard drive.&nbsp; Back in the day we used to run NDD (Norton Disk Doctor) or Scandisk on the drive to fix the bad sectors.&nbsp; It does not mean that you have to replace the drive unless you get more and more bad

<h3> maverick 104  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Vista doesn&#39;t load, can&#39;t use Safe Mode, etc.</h2>
                    Computer/Laptop: <strong>Dell Inspiron 1525</strong> <br />
Running: <strong>Windows Vista</strong> <br />
<br />
<br />
I hope someone here can figure this out, but it's been a pretty serious problem for me for two days now.<br />
<br />
Two days ago, I started up my laptop as I normally would.&nbsp; I made it as far as the desktop, and then once I tried to move my cursor around, nothing happened.&nbsp; Instead of using the cursor, I tried navigating with the keyboard, once again to no avail.&nbsp; Everything
 was simply frozen.&nbsp; I didn't think much of it at the time, as I had thought perhaps it was simply one of those random freezes that rebooting the computer would fix.<br />
<br />
But my problem only got worse.<br />
<br />
Upon rebooting the next day, my computer made it as far as the black screen with the green loading bar with the words "Microsoft Corporation" under it... and for over 6 hours that's where it stayed.&nbsp; This is exactly what it does every time I restart the computer.&nbsp;
 It just stays in permanent loading limbo.<br />
<br />
I held F12 upon boot-up and ran a diagnostics test, which showed nothing wrong.&nbsp; I tried every option under F8 as well, including all variations of Safe Mode, and once more, nothing worked.&nbsp; Even more frustrating was that the computer couldn't even finish loading
 the Command Prompt when I tried "Safe Mode with Command Prompt."<br />
<br />
The only hint I've gotten so far was one random blue screen with a single line of text that read something like: "<strong>STOP: c00000033 object Name invalid</strong> ."<br />
<br />
Basically put: Nothing works, and I haven't made any changes to the computer itself between the time that it was working, and currently when it is not.&nbsp; It just loads for as long as I leave the computer running.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help or light shed on this subject would be much appreciated, as the thought of losing everything on a computer I've had for nearly two years is quite upsetting.

<p><span>Hi Maverick 104,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><span>Disconnect all the external devices (printers, scanner, USB
<strong>(universal serial bus)</strong> drives, etc...)<span>&nbsp; </span>
Except mouse and the keyboard and then boot up. </span></p>
<p><span>If this corrects the issue then add the devices back one at a time until you discover the piece of hardware causing
 the issue.&nbsp; Then get any updated drivers\software for the device.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
<span>&nbsp;</span>Try system restore (method 1) and startup repair (method 2) as mentioned in the link below:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Your computer may freeze or it may restart to a black screen that has a 0xc0000034 error message after you install a Windows Vista
 service pack</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975484" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975484</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Boot the computer to system recovery options (follow the steps mentioned in the link below) &gt; select command prompt tool
 and run Check disk to fix any bad sectors on the hard drive.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-Vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-Vista</a>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>At the command prompt type
<strong>chkdsk /f </strong>and then press enter. </span></p>
<p><span>Now, type in
<strong>chkdsk /r </strong>and then press enter.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>CHKDSK would try to recover bad sectors on the hard disk, during this process there are chances of DATA loss from that particular sector.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if this works</span></p>
