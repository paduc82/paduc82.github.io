<h2>            Windows Update&#47;Windows Installer not working correctly.</h2>
                    I have had a new Windows 8 system for a few weeks now and have run into a recent problem.
<div><br />
<div>When trying to uninstall a Bluetooth program, I got the message that another program was currently being installed. As I knew of, nothing was being installed, so I restarted my computer. The screen went black, but the power light on my computer never went
 off, so I forced it to turn off by holding the power button. As of turning the system back on, Windows Update notified me to install updates, and when I did, it gave me an error message as well. I have not been able to uninstall/install any programs or use
 the Windows Update service since then. I searched the forums, and tried just about everything, and I can uninstall/install programs by ending the processes of Windows Installer, then installing. During the installation though, a window pops up saying something
 along the lines of "Microsoft Office Office 64-bit Components installation is now paused. To continue current installation, you must undo the changes made by this installation."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks so much!</div>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
From your issue description, after installing Windows updates you are unable to use Windows update service or install a program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Let’s start with some questions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
1. Which Updates did you install, Could you please provide the KB article of these updates?</div>
<div><br />
To view kb article of the installed updates follow these steps.<br />
We keep an update history in Windows Update so that you can check which updates were installed and when. You can also use this list to remove specific updates, but it's usually not a good idea to remove them unless you have a specific reason.<br />
To view your update history<br />
• Open Windows Update in Control Panel by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping Search (or, if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking Search), entering Windows
 Update in the search box, tapping or clicking Settings, and then tapping or clicking Install optional updates.<br />
• In the left pane, tap or click View update history.</div>
<div>2. What are the troubleshooting steps you have performed for resolving the issue?<br />
3. What exactly happen when you try to install or uninstall any program?<br />
4. Do you receive any error message?<br />
5. Is the issue specific to a particular program or all the programs?<br />
6. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I want you to try the following methods to resolve the issue.</div>
<div><br />
Method 1: Start the Windows Installer service and check.<br />
a. Press Windows key + R, type Services.msc and press ENTER<br />
b. Double-click Windows Installer <br />
c. Set the Startup type of Windows Installer to Manual <br />
d. Click Start to start the service. Note down the error message if any. <br />
e. Click OK.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 2: Unregister and re-register the Windows Installer and check.<br />
a. Press Windows key + R, typeMSIEXEC /UNREGISTER, and then click OK. Even if you do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs.<br />
b. Press Windows key + R, type MSIEXEC /REGSERVER, and then click OK. Even if you do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs, or you may briefly see an hourglass. After you run this command, the operation is complete.<br />
c. Try your Windows Installer-based application again.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Method 3: Perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps given in the link below to start the computer in clean boot.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: After performing clean boot refer to these steps to boot to normal mode.<br />
<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot.</strong><br />
a. On the Start screen, type msconfig, and then press Enter. <br />
b. On the General tab, tap or click the Normal Startup option.<br />
c. Tap or click the Services tab and clear the check box beside Hide all Microsoft services, and then tap or click Enable all.<br />
d. Next, tap or click the Startup tab, and then tap or click Open Task Manager.<br />
e. In task manager, enable all of your startup programs, and then tap or click OK.<br />
f. When you are prompted to restart the computer, tap or click Restart.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Now check if you are able to install or uninstall the programs.</div>
<div><br />
You can follow the link for reference.<br />

<div><br />
Hope the above information helps.</div>
<div>Do get back to us and let us know the status of the issue by your next post or in case you need further assistance regarding Windows.<br />

            Sorry for the separate post, however, just after replying, I tried to uninstall Java to manually install the new version, and I got the "Another program is being installed" message. I did the same thing as explained before, I ended all windows installer
 processes, and then tried installing, and got the same popup as it was occurring: "User SYSTEM has initiated an install of Microsoft Office Office 64-bit Components," then I clicked yes to continue the current installation (Java) and another popup appeared
 saying "Error 1704.An installation for Microsoft Office Office 64-Bit components 2010 is currently suspended. You must undo the changes made by that installation to continue." So I clicked yes, and the installation&nbsp;succeeded.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Again, this is what I did previously, and it seemingly fixed the problem until after completing the 2 Methods. (Just now)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again!</div>

<h2>            Scanner Stopped Working - Canon MP230</h2>
                    <p>My Canon MP230 refuses to scan now that I have upgraded to Windows 8.1 - printer works fine and all troubleshooters suggest the scanner is connected correctly. &nbsp;Just wont complete a scan. &nbsp;Have gone to the lengths of reinstalling all software and even replacing
 the actual machine (thanks OfficeWorks).</p>
<p>

            <p>Yes, when I use the bundled software I get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0b6a85f-6d38-47ef-975d-44b685c1e5cb" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use Scan - the windows 8.1 package - (which is another issue ... the damn OS has decided I need my updates in Korean just because I use a Korean keyboard input occasionally) nothing happens when I press the scan button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer is definitely connected, as I can print without any problems. &nbsp;There were no problems with the scanner or software when using Windows 8 - but this has been the case since installing 8.1</p>

            <p>I would suspect&nbsp;that this issue may be related to the upgrade process in that something did not carry forward properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that respect I would recommend to completely uninstall the printer and the printer drivers and any related&nbsp;printer software&nbsp;and then reinstall the printer drivers and&nbsp;any related software:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click the "Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media" icon in the Notification area of the Taskbar&nbsp;&gt; Open Devices and Printers" &gt; right-click the printer and select "Remove device" and then remove the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then uninstall the printer drivers using "Uninstall or change a program".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then restart the computer and install the latest Windows 8.1 drivers and any related software that you would&nbsp;use&nbsp;that is available from Canon:</p>

            Hello Again:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried your solution for making Win7 accept my scanner by installing it in the mode you suggested...Didn't work..I now have an icon for the scanner but that is all...It is still not useable.. I have resigned myself to the fact that this Memorex MEM 48U
 scanner will never work with this operating system and that is a shame as it is a good scanner. I am shopping online,(mainly at Wal Mart), for a new flat bed scanner. I prefer those over the all in one machine. I wish to take a moment to thank you for all
 of you time and trouble in helpin an old codger like me."I'm 75",,,,but only 16 at heart. God Bless and have a good day.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely:<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 killed my Dell Inspiron N5010</h2>
                    <p>After numerous unsolicited prompts to install Windows 10, I finally made the plunge to install.&nbsp; After&nbsp;the software&nbsp;downloaded I clicked to install and within 2 minutes of it starting the install, the&nbsp;speakers began emitting a&nbsp;very high frequency squeal
 at full volume which it has never done before. &nbsp;It was loud enough that it hurts the ears.&nbsp; None of the sound controls worked to either reduce volume or mute.&nbsp; Message said the computer will re-boot several times during the install, &nbsp;so I left the computer
 continue the install assuming the problem might go away.&nbsp;&nbsp;6 plus hours later, the shrieking sound was still there but&nbsp;it appeared Windows 10&nbsp;was installed. I did a normal windows shut down and the&nbsp;restarted and painful sound returns about 1.5 minutes into
 the re-boots,&nbsp;and the re-boot always&nbsp;hangs up. &nbsp; I repeatedly powered it down and up, but windows hangs on the screen with&nbsp;an "8" displayed in a circle while it is squealing. I&nbsp;have tried to let&nbsp;it run for hours, but it&nbsp;never gets any further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This product release is a disaster and severely regret the decision to try and&nbsp;install Windows 10!
</p>
<p>Please help me get back to Windows 7 ASAP.&nbsp; At least that worked properly.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since you are unable to login to the PC due to the issue which you are facing, I would want to
 ask you a few questions regarding it to get a clear picture. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>May I know since when you are facing this issue? </span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Did you make any changes to the computer before this issue occurred?<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 1:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We can try to boot the computer through WinRE by System Restore. Use a recovery drive to restore
 your PC. I will help you with the article to perform System restore on your PC. Please follow the article-

<p><span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options</span></a></span>
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disclaimer- System Restore: Restore points are generated when you install a new app, driver, or
 Windows Updates, and when you create a restore point manually. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 2: I would also suggest you to follow the article below to enable safe mode on Windows
 10-</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Update failed - Error code 80246007</h2>
                    <p>When to download and install the Windows 8.1 Update i see that the update failed, and receive the error code 80246007. I have tried to follow the advice of restarting the Background Intelligent Transfer Service and that has not resolved the problem for me,
 as i did not have any of the problems the link described. I have a feeling this may be related to my recent problem of my laptop bluescreen-ing. When that error occurs i get the error message REGISTRY_ERROR.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again this is the Windows 8.1 operating system.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Run this Fixit to reset Windows Update components: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/en-us</a></p>

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949104/en-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After you run the second one, you have to wait one hour before attempting to download from the Windows Update site.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the computer must remain on and you must have "Automatic Updates" configured.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, the option to receive "Recommended updates" must also be checkmarked. Both of these are located in Windows Control Panel | Windows Update and then click the link to "Change settings" top left.

<h2>            &#34;Windows Shell Common Dll Not Responding&#34; message and more audio video issues.</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 7 64 bit and frequently loose sound and receive the message "Windows Shell Common Dll Not Responding" message.&nbsp; I am having intermittent problems with Zune playing music, and am not able to play video, like You Tube.&nbsp; I read that Vista
 users receiving the above error message should run repairs from their bootable disk.&nbsp; I have the WIndows 7 disk but when I put it in the only thing I was offered was to install.&nbsp; Also not sure if my other audio and video issues are related to the dll issue
 or are a separate problem.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp; Lois

</span></span></span><span>Expand the node that represents the type of device that you want to uninstall, right-click the device entry, and click Uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the Confirm Device Removal dialog box, click OK to start the uninstall process.</span></p>

<p><span>I'm thinking a profile corruption issue prevents you from thetting the needed update, so I'd start by clearing the system cache (it's just updates plus other temporary files, nothing that's at all
 important to anyone) by:</span></p>
<p><span>1) Tap the silver Xbox Guide button on the controller, go right 2 clicks to Settings, pick System Settings.</span></p>
<p><span>2) Select Storage (or Memory).</span></p>
<p><span>3) Move over any hard drive or memory unit (not the Cloud) &amp; press (Y) on your controller &amp; pick Clear System Cache.</span></p>
<p><span>4) When asked to confirm storage device maintenance, choose Yes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that doesn't fix it *please* first</span></p>
<p><span>1) go to <a href="http://www.xbox.com/accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.xbox.com/accounts</a> &amp; click on Sign in at upper right - if you can't sign in then
<span><strong>STOP: DON'T</strong></span> delete your profile. Please call Xbox Support
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/contact-us</a> for help with your account. If you can sign in, delete &amp; redownload your profile on your Xbox this way:</span></p>
<p><span>2) Go to Settings</span></p>
<p><span>3) pick System</span></p>
<p><span>4) choose Storage</span></p>
<p><span>5) pick All Devices</span></p>
<p><span>6) choose Gamer Profiles</span></p>
<p><span>7) pick the gamertag</span></p>
<p><span>8) choose Delete, and</span></p>
<p><span>9) pick Delete Profile Only. This deletes the profile but leaves saved games and achievements. Now, re-download your profile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Re-download</span></p>
<p><span>1) Tap the silver Xbox Guide button</span></p>
<p><span>2) Select Download Profile (and if you don't see it, press the blue X button to make sure you're not signed in) and proceed with Profile Download.</span></p>
<p><span>3) Enter the Windows Live ID for your Xbox LIVE gamertag when asked.</span></p>
<p><span>4) Enter the password for the WLID.</span></p>

<p>OK &nbsp;I was just on the xbox website NOT SIGNED INTO AN ACCOUNT and the ENTIRE download listing for this title (Test Drive Unlimited) &nbsp;&lt;NOT #2.... &nbsp; yes the ENTIRE download listing consists of THREE items. &nbsp;ONE theme, ONE car pack, and ONE game demo</p>
<p>there were at least 6-7 car packs (not including the free ones)</p>
<p>Why is there a discrepancy here? &nbsp;I have the car packs on my console's HDD from a previous gamertag, but I can't unlock/purchase them.</p>

                    All of a sudden my Snipping Tool won't save my snips.... I tried to save a snip to my desktop (test.jpg) and it appeared to save, but when I went to my desktop, it wasn't there. I thought I screwed up with the location and tried to save it again. I got
 a message that said the file was already there and did I want to replace. Say what?&nbsp; 'Cancel'.&nbsp; I went back to my desktop and still no file.&nbsp; ANY IDEAS ON WHAT IS HAPPENING AND HOW TO FIX?

            Hello, this BSOD may be a cause regarding your RAM. Try running the memory diagnostic tool built into Windows. Go to the Windows search and type in Windows Memory Diagnostics. Run it, and select the (recommended). It should restart and run the diagnostics. This may take a while, so wait patiently! Try and see if this fixes or gives any sign of a fix.

<br />During the warranty, it is the responsibility of the manufacturer for the full functioning of the device. I believe there is some sort of hardware issue as Intelppm.sys is for Intel Processor driver.

</p>
<p>I have looked at the forums &amp;&nbsp;it states there should be an&nbsp;option to remove bitlocker howerer I only have windows home edition which may be the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyway that I can remove this with?</p>

            You won't be able to remove the Bitlocker encryption using the Home edition.&nbsp; This is by design.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The reason you needed to remove those programs was because they can aggravate the<br />
issue and make it harder to determine the cause.<br />
<br />
Start at the top of the troubleshooter I originally posted and work down skipping nothing<br />
all the way through all of the troubleshooters. Its a process of elimination.<br />
<br />
If those do not help you can try re-installing Windows. If that does not help then the odds<br />
are it is hardware and you need technical help.<br />
<br />
Remember as noted this is usually a <strong>Fatal Hardware</strong> error and you are mainly trying to<br />
use software which will not help if indeed it is hardware - yes sometimes the issue can<br />
be software so eliminating those possibilities is all you can do.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<p>При попытке добавить свою карту в аккаунт сервис пишет - "<span>Введите действительный номер кредитной карты", хотя все данные корректны. Обращался в банк - сказали что 30 рублей списываются без проблем и они не видят причины, почему карта может быть отклонена.
 Тип карты MasterCard международная.</span></p>

<p>Долго не мог понять что это :D Потом дошло :) Честно говоря ничего интересного. Игра делает две фотки, после чего можно рисовать светом по ней в традициях кинект (руками, ногами). Запустил ее по моему один раз. Она явно не стоит денег, которые за нее просят
 (уж не помню сколько мсп).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Гораздо круче кинект.спортс (жалко только дома ремонт-бедлам места нет для кинект игр :() - когда ее купил пол ночи по инету в боулинг резался :)</p>

<p>240 она стоит, вот из-за цены у меня сомнения и возникли в её "юзабельности" - спасибо за развернутый ответ, не буду брать. А спорт - это да! У меня мелочь 4,5 и 3 год,а в этот боулинг так меня уделывают - что аж играть с ними стыдно (папка лох :) ). Правда
 из "активных" игр у нас на первое место вышел ФрутоНиндзя, надо только успевать батарейки в камере менять - так угарно потом смотреть эти "схватки с фруктами"!!!</p>

<p>Вводить действительный номер :-) О том, что карта существует и нормально может быть привязана говорит временная блокировка, которую присылает микрософтовский биллинг в тот момент когда регистрируешь карту. 30 рублей блокирует?</p>

    <title>How to convert .cda files back to mp3 format - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to convert .cda files back to mp3 format</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: how are .cda files still in existence???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a one of a kind track that I can't replace that was in .mp3 format before I upgraded to 8.1. But now it's in .cda and I can't for the life of me figure out how to get it converted back. It's the standard 44 bytes that every .cda shows as, it's in
 my file explorer but I can't find a file converter that will recognize it. It won't play with iTunes or Windows Media( as is expected) but it WILL play with VLC Media Player. If there are any suggestions I'd love to hear them.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>CDA is a file extension for a CD Audio shortcut file format. Used by Microsoft Windows to refer to audio tracks on a CD, a CDA file doesn’t contain audio but is simply a shortcut to the tracks on an audio disc.<br />
CDA files are files created by the computer's CD drivers which point to the location of a track. MP3 is a file type which uses compression to save space. To convert CDA file to MP3 first make space for your files. You require a folder for the music to go into
 as well as enough space to store all of the music you wish to copy through the process of 'ripping.' Choose a software program such as&nbsp; Windows Media Player. Double-check your setting. You will need to look for settings to let you specify the place you wish
 to save the files and in what format. Finally copy the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please feel free to reply if you face any issues with Windows in future</p>
        </p>

            One thing you could try is setting your monitor back to factory defaults. This is done by the buttons on the monitor, and it differs for every monitor so I can't tell you exactly how to do it, but it should be fairly easy. Most likely it'll be press menu,
 press + or - to navigate to reset/reset to factory/whatever else it might say, then select button, then most likely either select again or +.<br />
It should say on the monitor menu what to press.<br />

            That slider went away with Windows 8 I'm afraid. Now you have the simple choice of small, medium, large and extra large icons, probably none of which are the size you really want.

    <title>Can I get back my original user settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian duda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I get back my original user settings</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to connect my laptop with Windows 7 to a local server and&nbsp; I came across the "Computer Connect" software. I installed it on my laptop and it wanted to do something like create an account on my laptop and then a part about copying my account
 information came up. I thought it meant copy all of my user account settings currently on the laptop to the new account so everything would be the same, but it looks like it did the opposite; it put the new user information over my old user account. Now all
 settings are reset to the default windows 7 set-up, my emails aren't set up in outlook, some programs won't run, bookmarks are no longer in the browser, I feel like I'm rebuilding my machine from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do system restore which brings me back to my original settings but nothing works including the search command. Even the internet wouldn't work. So I had to reverse the restore point. Is there anything else i can do to get my account settings back?
 Can I backup the account after doing a system restore then copy the account information after reversing the restore?
</p>

<p>You mentioned a "local server" in your initial post. Server questions, because of their increased complexity, are usually dealt with in a TechNet forum. When reposting you should also give details on this "Computer Connect" software. Where does it come from?
 Did you check the supplier's FAQs?<br />

            <p>Were you trying to add your PC to a Domain? That 3rd party software isn't what you need. If the local server is a domain controller, then you need the domain information, and go to&nbsp;Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\System. Click Change Settings, and
 change the Workgroup (or whatever) to your domain name, then restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your local server is just a file server or something, then just map a drive to the shared folder on the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mapping Drive: Double-Click Computer icon, select Map Network Drive, select a drive letter, and insert the UNC path or browse to the share. Input your username/password for accessing the shared folder and you're done. If you have problems, start with your
 firewall on the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional Info: A Domain profile is totally different than the PC's local profile, especially if you're trying to do Roaming Profiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More Additional Info: "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now all settings are reset to the default windows 7 set-up, my emails aren't set up in outlook, some programs won't run, bookmarks are no longer in the browser, I feel like I'm

            <p>Thank you for the information. At the moment I do not care about the server portion of this. I only want to fix the mess on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The user account appears to still be there. If I do system restore, everything comes back except nothing works right. What the "computer connect" seems to have done is create the same user but now it's &lt;oldusername&gt;.&lt;newusername&gt; as the profile name. The
 folder for the original user is still there in the users folder. When I choose between accounts, my only options are the new user and "other." Both bring me to what appears to be the same account. How do I access my old user profile? I plan to delete the new
 ones.</p>

            I honestly don't remember where I got the computer connect from. I think microsoft told me to install it to make the computer access a "user" as part of the server's user accounts. I have not looked much into the file sharing with the server, which is
 all I want to do. All I can say is the user account on my laptop got messed up and that's what I want to fix. On the bright side, the laptop sees the folders on the server while all other computers on the network do not. But again, I am only concerned about
 fixing my user profile issue at the moment and will figure out the file sharing later.<br />

</p><p>Does the new profile have Admin privileges?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double-Click Computer icon</p>
<p>Double-Click C:\</p>
<p>Double-Click Users folder</p>
<p>Double-Click old account (this will be named after your old username)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once in the old profile, you can copy the contents of your Documents|Pictures| etc to the new profile in a new window. What I would do, is copy them to an external drive, or a private network resource, then copy them to the new profile so you can at least
 have a bit of a backup of data. Copy any installation .exe files that are required to install software packages that you need.</p>

            <p>Yes, the new profile has admin priv. The old user account also still shows up as an active account with admin rights. I did notice that the domain for each is different. I tried changing the domain and making it a workgroup but I didn't chose the original
 workgroup name that was used as I didn't know it. I just did system restore again and found out it was called "WORKGROUP" so I weill revert back again and then change to that name and see if it recovers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears as if I'm able to login to the correct user now that I'm not part of the domain but the profile is still wrong. I don't know if this is because the workgroup had the wrong name? Also, when I did the system restore again, I found everything to
 be workign properly at first, but then I got a blue screen crash and my nightly browser (firefox 64 bit) would not open anymore. I think it tried to update then got corrupted. I believe the first system restore I tried failed and that's why nothing was working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I should be able to copy the user profile folder over a new user account folder and it will restore everything? If the system restore or workgroup name change won't fix it, that'll be my next step.</p>

</p><p>So I should be able to copy the user profile folder over a new user account folder and it will restore everything? If the system restore or workgroup name change won't fix it, that'll be my next step.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>By default, Windows is in a Workgroup called Workgroup. A Domain is controlled by a Domain Controller (a server) and operates much differently than Workgroups. If the network you're on is a Workgroup with a different name than other workstations, then other
 workstations/resources may not see you on the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a system restore fails, then no changes should've occurred to the PC. It simply reverts it back to its current broken state that it was in when you started.</p>
<p>I wouldn't copy the whole user folder because you will copy data that messed you up in the first place. I've had a few clients that had corrupt user profiles, and luckily a Check-Disk routine fixed them right up, so perhaps try that if you haven't. If the
 username of the old profile and the new profile is the exact same, then put a <strong>
.old&nbsp;</strong>on the old one, so your PC knows what profile to log into, as well as you knowing what profile you're making changes to. Personally, I would rather copy my data to a fresh profile and reinstall programs. I would never suggest taking a whole User
 folder, and slapping it into a new one.</p>

            <p>I can't explain what happened with the first restore that I did. A windows error came up like something didn't work and the whole system was screwed. I reverted back, then did system restore again and erverything was fine, except I got a blue screen error
 when trying to use nightly. SO I tried a restore again and checking other things as I was on this form and then my old restore points were apparently cleared out and now I can't go back.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it looks like I lost my old restore points. I can't restore back to the original restore points that I had. So now I'm stuck with the new profile. I should have just reinstalled my browser which was the only thing not working on the restore that I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems everyone is recommending I just treat this like a fresh install of windows and start over. I really don't want to do that but I will if I have to. Setting up outlook with the 10 email accounts I had takes time and the browser with missing bookmarks
 I can probably reimport but is annoying to do assuming I can find them. I will need to set up all of my FTPs, saved passwords defaults, plugins etc... It's just a nuisance although nothing is technically lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did find on the last rollback on a restore is that I have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The folder containing my old user profile under the users folder</p>
<p>2. in the accounts list, there was "Account Unknown" listed as a user which appears to be my older user profile as it matches the size. That is gone as of the last restore backup attempt. So now I'm stuck with the new profile only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only question I have left which is basically the same original question: I have all of the original files, can I do anything to bring back my original user? Can I add a "new user" which uses those old files that I have? Or I must start from scratch?</p>

<p>I'm seeing this too. When my fiancee and I play together and are both signed in with our accounts, it constantly freezes and crashes, usually at the end of a song. It's happened in the middle of a song too.</p>

<p>I've noticed this occurs on my DCS as well. Typically when 2 accounts are logged in and at end of song. Normally, it occurs on the first or second song played right after I purchase and download a song. All in all very annoying I hope this bug will be addressed.</p>
