<p><strong><span>Hi psciarra,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Do you have integration features enabled?<br />
2. Did something happen before you lost connectivity to the internet like performed windows update, etc?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Just go to All Programs, find Windows Virtual PC, click it and find XP mode, right-click it, choose settings, find Integration Features, and check
 them all. <br />
Also check in Virtual PC Settings that the "Network" includes integration for your wireless adapter. In networking option you will find the selection for the correct adapter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>This exact same thing happened to me. I've tried all the suggestions above plus others I have found but my Virtual PC cannot connect to the internet.&nbsp; It was working one hour and the next I couldn't connect.</p>
<p>I vaguely remember getting a popup alert askiing me if I want to&nbsp;block something and I think it was VPC.&nbsp; I don't know whether the alert came from my Win 7 or XP Mode. But, I don't see&nbsp;anywhere this might be blocked.</p>
<p>Do you have any other suggestions for how to troubleshoot this ?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>MSN Homepage redirects to a random page after signing out of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pault987  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSN Homepage redirects to a random page after signing out of Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>When I log out of my email on Outlook.com, it goes to my home country MSN homepage.&nbsp; That is all good and it hasn't caused any issues until last month when I noted the MSN homepage automatically redirects to some 'random' rewards page (the 'redirected' page
 differs but broadly has the same content about going into a survey to win a prize)&nbsp; One URL is "exclusiverewards38.online" - but there are many others.&nbsp; It's like a pop-up blocker, but takes over the whole tab.&nbsp; You can't use the back-tab - all you can do
 is close the tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note the following <span style="text-decoration-line: underline; color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">

<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>This <span style="text-decoration-line: underline; color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">ONLY </span>
effects MSN homepage - no other page redirects like this.&nbsp; So clearly it is an MSN issue</strong></li><li>I have used multiple browsers - same result on all browsers (so this is interdependent of the browser)</li><li>I have used multiple computers - same result on all computers (so this is interdependent of the computer)</li><li>I have used different Wifi networks - same result on all Wifi networks (so this is interdependent of the Wifi networks)</li></ol>
<p>Furthermore,</p>
<ol>
<li>I have used various malware/virus programs to 'clean' my computers. No change.</li><li>I have pop-blockers installed - but that doesn't help</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the above, the only conclusion is that there is a <strong>script embedded within the MSN homepag</strong><strong>e that
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline; color: rgba(161, 29, 122, 1)">forces </span>this redirection.</strong>&nbsp; I think that is poor practice as it is effectively taking over control of my computer.&nbsp; I am close to changing MSN as email provider due to this.&nbsp; One possible
 solution is to redirect the signout page from Outlook.com to something other than MSN.&nbsp; Any other options?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any real suggestions welcomed.&nbsp; If you can only offer corporate speak from Microsoft, please move on.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Paul,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is an unexpected behavior, since the page redirection happens only after you log out from your outlook account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest to open MSN (</span><a href="http://www.msn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.msn.com/</span></a><span>) in a new tab.</span></p>
<p><span>Sign in with your Microsoft account and sign out.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if signing out from MSN redirects you to any other page, so that we can further investigate it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I also suggest to disable sync on your computer and reset all web browsers.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Disclaimer:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Resetting web browsers might reset security settings or privacy
 settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. It might also reset the parental control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Ensure that your favorites are backed up before resetting
 the browsers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is also possible that a devices in the network are infected. Scammers use malicious software (malware) to take control of computer's Internet browser and change how and what it displays when you're
 surfing the web.. Please refer to the link below.</span></p>

<p>Hi Peer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>This problem about three weeks ago.</li><li>The suggestion to open in a new tab is not a solution.&nbsp; If you don't know already (but as a
<p><span>Microsoft Community-Moderator, you should), that</span> upon signing out of Outlook.com I am automatically taken to the MSN homepage.&nbsp; There is no setting to redirect to another page - if there was, I could solve this in a
 second.</p>
</li><li>I don't have any sync enabled on my computers (unless forced by software companies, like MSN)</li><li>I have already reset my browsers (read my first message)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I have just signed out of Outlook.com, then was redirected to MSN.com homepage.&nbsp; Within one minute of being on MSN.com, the tab was automatically redirected to the following URL (these always change, like random)</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://sweeps9136.drumteam67.life/2241643416/?u=gg4p605&amp;o=5ffwrnh&amp;f=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, this was picked up by my Malware software as a fraudulent website.&nbsp; Even your Windows 10 Defender didn't pick this up - despite being updated automatically. (How crap is that?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue at hand is that this <strong>ONLY ONLY ONLY</strong> happens after being redirect to the MSN homepage after signing out of Outlook.com.&nbsp; Then, normally, within a few minutes, the MSN page will redirect to the fraudulent website.&nbsp;<strong>
</strong>This situation happens on multiple browsers and multiple computers.&nbsp; I find it hard to believe the network is effected as this problem only occurs when I am on the MSN homepage. -
<strong>Hence it is reasonable to conclude that there is a virus embedded in the scripts of the MSN website</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

    <title>Windows 10 printer problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopher.adams  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 printer problem</h2>
                    <p>Help with the following would be very much appreciated.&nbsp; Having upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 a printer would not work. A new Epson 3 in 1 works fine with Windows 10&nbsp;but although the system recognised an ancient Lexmark printer&nbsp;this would not print,
 although it had been working perfectly with Windows 7. The driver for the Lexmark is a Vista driver and unfortunately Lexmark declined to publish further updated drivers for this model. All the basics have been tried e.g. disconnecting&nbsp;the printer from the&nbsp;mains,
 switching the pc off and re-starting and trying alternative&nbsp;USB sockets. As a result of this a couple of copies of the Lexmark were showing in Control Panel and these were deleted. Now it is impossible to get either printer to work. The Windows 10 Troubleshooting
 App can not identify the problem. Trying to print a MS Office document brings up a "No Printer Installed". A click on the "Add Printer" brings up a "The Active Directory Domain Service is currently unavailable". The usual Select Printer panel appears but it
 shows no printers at all and over it is a message "Before you can print you need to select a printer, either double click the Add Printer icon or click the Find Printer ....etc. A click on the Find Printer icon within the Select Printer Panel displays only
 the contents of "Networks". The Epson is shown but selecting it produces "The Network Path could not be found". The Epson is also connected by a lead&nbsp;and under Device Manager the status is shown as "The device is working properly". The "update driver software"
 has been checked and a panel states that the device driver is installed and up to date.
</p>
<p>From the moment the pc OS was updated the&nbsp;pc has always produced a message at start up "The Operating System is not supported by this application" but because everything appeared to be working well, except the printer, I have ignored it.&nbsp;Every suggestion
 will be very&nbsp;much appreciated.</p>

            <p>Thank you Arul D.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your advice through to paragraph 5.&nbsp; With&nbsp;my Windows 10 there is not a "Run as administrator" in para. 5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a&nbsp; "Hardware and Devices" followed by "Find and fix problems with devices and hardware". There is also a tick box for "Apply repairs automatically".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have progressed this with and without the tick in the box and the response to both is a "checking for problems" panel followed by "Restart your PC to finish installing drivers and updates". The result for both of these is the same. Control Panel-Printers
 does show the old and the new printers as being installed. Opening a Microsoft Office Word document or a MS Notepad document and attempting to print&nbsp;either&nbsp;produces the same dialogue as detailed above. It is not possible to print, printers can not be located.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further advice will be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Christopher Adams.</p>

            Very Good. &nbsp;I had the same issue that Chris had but I looked closer and skipped down to the printers repair and the advanced tab was there. &nbsp;From there it was a cake walk. &nbsp;Worked Perfectly! &nbsp;Saved me valuable time!

            The only thing I found -- and unfortunately it's not helpful is the following from
<a href="http://static.agfa.com/digicam_scanner_drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the Agfa Support site</a>:<br />
<br />
"Windows XP does not support the scanners with parallel ports:<br />
SnapScan EZ, SnapScan 310 p, SnapScan 1212 p, SnapScan 1200 p.<br />
<br />
"Agfa will not make XP drivers in the future for these scanners as it stopped its desktop scanners and digital camera business in September 2001."<br />
<br />
The following is a previous answer regarding someone who was unable to make it work with Vista:&nbsp;
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-hardware/agfa-snapscan-1212-windows-vista/c1b8e8cc-60ed-40b5-894f-c5a2940f2954">

<br />
It is possible that Vuescan would work (it lists the Agfa 1212U as compatible).&nbsp; It is free to try but then you would need to purchase it:&nbsp;

After Windows 10 latest updates , my xbox receiver cannot find my xbox 360 controller.&nbsp;<br />
How can i fix that ?<br />
<br />
Not : I tried the things listed below ;<br />
*Unplugged, change the usb ports,</p>
<p>*Uninstall driver and install again</p>
<p>*Uninstall driver and choose another type of device driver ( Charge and Play kit, Xbox Receiver, Xbox Controller from the device manager)<br />
*Try another xbox 360 wireless controller</p>

            I understand that the factory transceiver isn't replaceable, however, on some other forums, people have mentioned that universal transceivers should work for the keyboard/mouse I'm referring to. &nbsp;I'm just unsure of the specs I need.

            Please read again.&nbsp; The transceiver isn't replaceable. There is no "universal" transceiver, for the same reason that no OEM transceiver is available.&nbsp;&nbsp; Logitech has the "Unifying" wireless devices, whereby more than one device can share the same dongle.&nbsp;
 That's no help for a Microsoft product, though.<br />

    <title>Remote Access Scam&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remote Access Scam&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accessed the following link that appeared to be Microsoft help chat and spoke with Franklin B.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/chat/4/?osmcsignin=true&amp;forceorigin=esmc&amp;wa=wsignin1.0&amp;OSMC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Franklin B asked me a few questions about my problem and then asked if I would grant him remote access to my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing a quick search online and verifying that MS techs will sometimes ask to help customers remotely and after he directed me to an online agreement that I had already found myself first and gave me an access code to enter I entered the code and downloaded
 and launched a program called Support-LogMeInRescue.exe Before launching the program I also verified on an MS forum that a tech rep will sometimes use this program to access a customer's PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I again communicated with the rep via this program and clicked to give him access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After he looked around in a few places I expected, he clicked to roll back my video driver, my screen went blank and eventually my PC shut down. I restarted and was surprised to find the tech was still there and had access to my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was very alarmed because I would expect that the tech would warn me if my PC screen would go blank and an my PC would shut down or restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He asked me a strange question related to my problem and then I notice the access light on my external drive was going crazy so by now I was well freaked out and when I tried to shut down the the logmeinrescue program it seem like the tech was trying to
 prevent me from doing so by moving the mouse on the other end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So did I just get scammed or what? Is that link a legitimate MS help chat?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do to check if private information on my PC was just accessed or copied?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you help</p>
<p>JC</p>

            This is exactly how it happened with me. I was asked to go to a Microsoft &nbsp;site and had to click on the terms and agreements. I also entered a code. After nearly an hour of this tech accessing my laptop. He suggested he needed to open another micros account.
 Which has no password. I was alarmed then for the screen to go blank for nearly 40 minutes. Then this strange childish orange scrawl appeared saying restart pc. I later that night when I tried shutting my laptop off it said another person was using the computer.
 &nbsp; I contacted tech support the next day and told her of my concerns thatssomeone was using my computer. &nbsp;And how &nbsp;that I had reservations allowing remote access. She said she would look into it and finished the conversation before I could go into detail. &nbsp;I
 would never again allow remote access again. I mean how do I know &nbsp;if he got my bank details etc..or if he severed the remote access link?

            <p>Thanks for your reply. I was not solicited by anyone. I was looking for help with Win 10 and I found this page on google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/contact-support</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked Ask Microsoft and got this page</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus?forceorigin=esmc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I clicked on Services and Apps and was sent to</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next clicked Windows to</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/windows/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next Tech Support to </p>
<p>
</p><p>https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/windows/ts/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicked Chat online with a Microsoft Answer Tech and was sent to</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/chat/4/</p>
<p>
</p><p>At which point Franklin B chatted a bit and then accessed my PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to me that all this is legit and due to Franklin B not communicating well what he/she was doing, I got totally freaked out when my screen went blank and the PC shut down. Also I don't know why my external HD was being accessed as it only contains
 files etc and all the OS stuff and drivers etc that the tech would need to access are on the main HD. My questions were about my HD going into sleep mode when the settings are set for it to never sleep AND my PC has been crashing in sleep mode, both of which
 started just after my win 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it's possible that a tech is abusing his/her power or at worst, someone has been able to hack into the system and pose as an authorized tech?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or of course, letting someone remotely access my PC has made me extremely paranoid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>

            <p>That's the problem - you cannot get a Microsoft support employee - they outsource it all to LogMeIn Rescue, which is the same company Norton uses for its support issues.&nbsp; As far as I can find, there is no easy way to get a true Microsoft technician, just
 an idiot.</p>

<p><span>It is impossible to actually get their attention - and I mean Microsoft!</span></p>
<p><br />
Edit July 4, 2016:<br />
The above link no longer exists!&nbsp; I clicked on it and a screen comes up from Microsoft saying:</p>
Try searching for what you need
<p>This page doesn’t exist. </p>
<div>
<p>CV: vMs4M3GIkpSVnYAP.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kudos to Microsoft for removing a page that caused problems.</p>
<p>The way to end a remote session is to click the Red "X" at the top right of the window.&nbsp; It will immediate terminate the remote user's access to your computer.&nbsp; I now begin any session with, "PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES ON MY COMPUTER UNTIL YOU ASK ME."&nbsp;
 If they start trying to open things I do not want opened, I take control of the mouse, rather than allowing them to do it, and they usually start typing.&nbsp; I use this time to capture a screenshot/picture by hitting Shift+PrtScn, have a Word document open, use
 Shift+Tab (move between windows) to go to Word, hit Ctrl+Alt+V (paste special) and choose "Device Independent Bitmap" which should be highlighted, and this inserts a picture of exactly what the remote technician is doing, the time, etc.&nbsp; Then hit Shift+Tab
 to go back to the support chat window.&nbsp; Have both open side by side so you can watch what the remote tech is doing while you copy what he/she is doing.&nbsp; He/She can see that you are doing it as well.&nbsp; Another trick is to hit Ctrl+A (which selects all), then
 Ctrl+C (which copies it), then Ctrl+Tab to go to Word, then Ctrl+Alt+V (paste special)&nbsp;to paste it in "formatted" or "unformatted" format.&nbsp; If you don't like the way it looks, hit "Ctrl+Z" (which undoes your most recent action).&nbsp; Keep in mind, the remote tech
 may be able to use shortcuts (macros), I just do not know.&nbsp; So if anything is suspicious, just end the session by hitting the Red "X" and ending the session.&nbsp; The window will stay open long enough for you to copy the contents so that you can keep a record
 of it.&nbsp; Be careful choosing any type of paste except "unformatted text" if any hyperlinks or web addresses are included in the chat transcript.&nbsp; If you paste them in formatted or HTML format, you could infect your computer with malware if they are a bad apple
 or an imposter/scammer.<br />
Another shortcut I love in Edge and IE11 is Ctrl+W - it closes the current-open window/tab immediately.&nbsp; But I would hit the Red&nbsp;"X" first, to make sure the remote session is ended.&nbsp; If all else fails, or to reassure yourself, go to task manager (Ctrl+Alt+Delete)&nbsp;and
 you can forcibly stop the remote session.&nbsp; I hope this helps.</p>

<p>I was connected with Prince P. and the same sort of thing happened with me. My mouse was moving around and someone was in my file explorer after they said they wouldn't look at my files, only settings. When I went to disconnect there was no sign of a red
 x and I was being prevented from hitting any type of X. It said that the technician disconnected and he gave me directions to disconnect as well. I fear that the software remains on my computer and I want to uninstall it. Please let me know of any way to remove
 this from my computer. I was given a code and everything from microsoft after clicking yes on the agreement, so I believe this service is legitimate, however I also believe that my experience was not as promised by microsoft (possibly bad technician). After
 I prevented him from access, I asked where he is based out of, he said India, I am very wary of scammers so I am anxious to remove this from my PC.</p>

<h2>            ASUS Control Deck and Elan errors in Windows 7x64 and Mozilla Firefox.</h2>
                    I have an ASUS A52F Notebook. One month ago ASUS Control Deck 'stopped working'. Now I receive the error message that Elan TPCfg has 'stopped working'. My computer crashed on Thursday but I managed to restore. However I am still receiving the error messages
 that Control Deck and Elan do not work. Can you help please? Many thanks!

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following methods to diagnose and resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1: Try
<strong>Safe Mode</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Safe mode is the configuration of Windows, when it is running on only basic set of drivers and all the startups are disabled. To
 know more about safe mode, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue is resolved in safe mode, follow step 2 after restarting the computer in regular mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 2:
<strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps
 eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><em><span><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Update the drivers</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To update the drivers, you may refer to the link below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Automatically-get-recommended-drivers-and-updates-for-your-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Automatically-get-recommended-drivers-and-updates-for-your-hardware</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists, I would recommend you to visit the computer manufacturer’s support website to download and install
 the Control Deck again and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Also uninstall and reinstall Mozilla Firefox and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this information was helpful.</span></span></p>

<p>A mfg model of pc would help...Either way,if its a Intel based pc,1st install the MB chipset software driver-software,next get the latest Display adapter driver,get these from pc mfg or pc hardware mfg.Once thru,install Microsoft DirectX redistribute 2010.Download,open,extract
 to a new folder you created,open new once extracted,scroll to the Direct X install icon,rest is auto.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Restart pc after each,If problem continues,in run type: DXDIAG&nbsp; run the Direct X tests..Don't forget,video uses a lot of pc resources,best bet is to configure a USB flash device for music/video/user data etc,plus set as a Page File/Virtual memory..</p>

            Hi sivamurali87, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

            Hi  rides90
<br />
<br />Can I presume you have turned on 'Hidden Items' on the View Ribbon at the top of File Explorer?
<br />
<br />Where exactly on your hard drive were these files hidden?

<h2>            Halo&#58; Reach Profile Data missing</h2>
                    
<p>I installed Halo Reach on my Xbox One to play with Backwards Compatibility, but as I started the game, I didn't have any of my armor, campaign progress, level progress, nothing. I appeared as if I was a new player. Since Halo Reach doesn't create a "Save
 File" on the Xbox 360 to transfer it to the Cloud, I don't know what to do to get my data on Xbox One. Please help :(</p>

<h2>            Skype handset not working - options&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Skype phone number that used to ring an IP phone that's on my network. Thus, someone wanting to call me calls that number using an ordinary phone, and my IP phone rings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It no longer does, and the phone displays "Network Error." My understanding is that Microsoft disabled a lot of these handsets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a handset that works? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, what is the point of having a Skype phone number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jack</p>

            You can use a mobile Android device with Skype loaded and use that as a house phone. Some Apple or Amazon devices may also be an option.&nbsp; If you are able to find an IP phone that runs Android 6.0+ (or possibly older with Skype Light) , you may be able
 to install a standard version of Skype on it, that might allow the device to ring, if configuration options exist. I personally still use an old USB to phone adapter with Classic Skype (7.x) running on a laptop, but it is only able to receive incoming calls
 as dialing is no longer supported through that adapter. Even if that device no longer worked, many of my computers are on 24x7 running a Skype client that will ring when someone calls my Skype number.
