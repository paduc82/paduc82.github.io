            <p>Well, it certainly works as bad as last year on my Windows 8.1 64 bit Lenovo.</p>
<p>I really am wondering why I even attempted Turbo Tax again since it worked so poorly last year and the updater crashes every time I attempt to get updates.</p>
<p>So far, the program is just as bad as it was last year and I was foolish enough to think it might have been debugged.</p>
<p>NOT!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Kaushal,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank for replying with the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you said the invitation mail has not been received in child account, you won’t be able to monitor the child activity. Once the invitation mail will be received by the child account, you need to click on the
 invitation link to confirm. Then you will be able to monitor the activity on the child account.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to wait for a while for the invitation mail. If still you won’t get, remove that particular child account and add again. Then check for the invitation mail.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the below steps on <strong>

                    Hi my Corsair headset all of a sudden stopped working. I have tried everything from rebooting, reinstalling drivers, editing playback devices, etc. The problem is it shows up in device manager under "Sound, video and game" it does not show up in audio
 manager in the recording or playback tab. I've used sfs fixer which did nothing, I've switched out the dongles USB ports, I don't know what to do!

            Hi Collin
<br />
<br />Try performing a system restore before this problem started:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: rstrui.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />This will start the system restore wizard. Choose a restore point more than 3 days ago to go back to.

</p><blockquote>Hi Collin <br />
<br />
Try performing a system restore before this problem started: <br />
<br />
Press Windows key + R <br />
Type: rstrui.exe <br />
Hit Enter <br />
<br />
This will start the system restore wizard. Choose a restore point more than 3 days ago to go back to.

Hi so it says System Protection is turned off and it is not letting me continue

    <title>Uninstalling IE 11 on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sjh001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uninstalling IE 11 on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a new desktop with Windows 10 and Edge installed. &nbsp;Due to my lack of familiarity with Edge at the time I setup the machine, and to resolve a setup problem, I installed IE 11. &nbsp; The problem was taken care of and I now want to uninstall or shut off
 IE 11. &nbsp;When I go to do that I get a message saying doing so may effect other Windows features and programs including default settings. &nbsp;Since I also have Edge installed would that prevent those problems from happening? &nbsp;Otherwise, how might I solve this problem?

            <p>As you&nbsp;are aware IE 11 cannot be uninstalled, but can be disabled via; &gt; Control Panel &gt; Programs &amp; Features &gt; Turn Windows features on or off &gt; untick the selection box for Internet Explorer 11. This will effectively turn IE11 'Off'&nbsp;&amp; will no longer be
 available unless you turn the feature back 'On'.&nbsp;The message you recieve (turning IE11 'off') saying 'that by doing so may effect other Windows features and programs including default settings'. Generally will not cause any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE 11 is still recieving updates &amp; will continue to do so until Edge is fully featured and will take over the browser needs of Windows 10 &amp; future versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: To clarify the above comment, IE11 will recieve security &amp; operating updates, till it's end of days but no new features or refinements will be issued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge is still in developement and is lacking several functions ie; Add-ons, +.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it is reccomended that IE 11 to continue to operate along side with Edge, Edge has the option when you select '...' on 'Address Bar' you can select to view the current website in IE11, 'Open with Internet Explorer'</p>

                    I upgraded&nbsp;to Windows 10 last year and it worked fine with Yahoo Mail and Gmail. Then I added an Outlook email account after a factory restore 2 months ago and tried to move away from the Yahoo Mail. So many accounts are linked to the Yahoo Mail that I
 have been forced to keep it. The Outlook email are sometimes not sent or simply disappear after I have sent them. I have not been able to receive or send Outlook email for 24 hours. Restarting the computer has not helped. How can I fix the Outlook email?

            <p>Hi Rupesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that if you upgrade your current operating system to Windows 10 using Windows Updates, then you can choose to save all your settings, programs and other data files. For more information, please refer to the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/help-upgrade-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><em><strong>Help with upgrading to
</strong></em><em><strong>Windows&nbsp;10</strong></em></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there are some programs that need new definitions compatible with Windows 10. Till the time they are unavailable you can install the&nbsp;programs compatible with previous versions of operating system in compatibility mode. If you can access the executable
 (.exe) file for the game, I would suggest you to follow the below provided steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 1:</span></strong></em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Download and save the program on the desktop.</span></span></p>

    <title>Microsoft account creation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ritoburrito  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft account creation</h2>
                    <p>A co-worker of mine is attempting to create a Microsoft account and is getting the following error: "The password contains characters that aren't allowed." &nbsp;I've searched this forum and other places online; however, the closest resolution I could find was
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/the-password-contains-characters-that-arent/1171b86f-8f90-4f95-8afb-68452d71fc21">
this thread.</a>&nbsp; As we are not pasting from a source, we are not sure why this is a problem, as we are simply typing in the information. &nbsp;When we type the information, we are abiding by the password requirements as noted by Microsoft:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c410113a-48ed-4799-bc97-03c85cfce93c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c410113a-48ed-4799-bc97-03c85cfce93c" /></a></p>
<p>We have tried creating the account on Microsoft's website (signup.live.com) and tried doing it through the OneNote app; however, both methods yielded the password error noted above. &nbsp;Also, on website, the form confirms the password matches, which indicates
 we have met the requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen this or experienced this issue? &nbsp;What is the solution to this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: So, we violated a common password requirement, one that I didn't see noted here, in that you shouldn't, or rather can't in this case, use part of your username in the password. &nbsp;I used a random password to get the account created, then changed the
 password in the account settings and noticed this nugget of information. &nbsp;Hope this helps someone else--sometimes it is the obvious things that get in our way, lol.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
A thumbdrive can support only a very limited number of files and folders in the root directory/folder.<br />
To solve this make one or more&nbsp;folders and copy the files into it/them.<br />
<br />
H:\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if H: is the thumbdrive<br />
<br />
Make folders such as (names are your choices)<br />
<br />
H:\MyFiles<br />
<br />
H:\Documents<br />
<br />
and so on and copy the files into those folders. You may have to remove a few files from a seemingly<br />
full thumbdrive to be able to create the folders.<br />
<br />
USB Drive Maximum Number of Files Limit

            Well again if you have too many files, size does not matter, in the root folder of the thumbdrive then<br />
you can't copy any more to it....... try reducing the number of files in the root folder. Try copying all<br />
the files to your harddrive and removing them all from the thumbdrive and try to copy your file to it.

<p><strong>Original title: MSN Games Query </strong></p>
<p>I generally play Spades in MSN Games. I play with those opponents which are found out by the Matching Animation.</p>
<p>But suppose I want to play spades with my friends, whom I personally know, and also at the same time they are online in MSN Games.</p>
<p>Is there any way I can do that?</p>

            yes ReCkle$$ there is a way <br />
<br />
since msn games removed this option from online spades , u dont have the "invite" section like b4,&nbsp; u will need to :<br />
<br />
1) u and ur partner open spades and click the "standard game" at the exact same time . after a 1~5 try u should be and ur partner friend at the same table .<br />
<br />
* ur "Level"&nbsp; and your partners must be close to each other to put u at the same table.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps :)<br />

            Thank you for the responses.&nbsp; Unfortunately I need to find a non Microsoft way to do this as the basic built in tools do not have any real customization.&nbsp; There must be some sort of Reg hack or 3rd party tool that can rewrite some of the code the way WindowBlinds
 can change the desktop experience available for the Lock/Welcome screen.<br />

<h2>            Kinect and Smartglass</h2>
                    
<p>I am having problems with the kinect taking voice commands and smartglass working with the xbox one. &nbsp;They work fine when my controller is on, but when it is off they do not work anymore. &nbsp;I was watching something on Netflix when I would say "Xbox Pause."
 &nbsp;In the top right corner of the screen would say "Xbox Pause" but it was in gray. &nbsp;I repeat it and the same thing happens, but the movie does not pause. &nbsp;The smartglass app tells me what I am watching, but the movie does not respond. &nbsp;I have unistalled and
 reinstalled the app, turned the settings on and off but still having issues. &nbsp;The app does work with the controller on, but what is the point of the app if the controller needs to be on.</p>
<p>Also for tech notes, the Xbox is connected via a wire and my phone has the data plan turned off so it can only connect to the internet via the wireless router I have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, the only time the kinect or smartglass app work is when the controller is on, and stops working when it is off.</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem. &nbsp;in Netflix at least, I have to say "Xbox Select" to bring up the Netflix specific commands and then I can pause with my voice and what not. &nbsp;With smartglass however, I can't scroll through anything in Netflix. &nbsp;It seems only
 the buttons work. &nbsp;I restarted my phone and the One but no change. Sorry I don't have a solution, but at least I know I'm not the only one experiencing this issue.</p>

            <p>Hey, guys! Is this specific only to Netflix? Does everything else work just fine with what you are looking for?</p>
<p>If this is Netflix specific and you've already uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, I suggest <a href="https://help.netflix.com/help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reaching out to Netflix</a> to ensure they are aware that voice commands and Smartglass are not working for you guys.</p>
<p>If this is happening in other apps, please let us know so that we can look into it further. Thanks!</p>

<p>I have exact same issue. And its not specific to Netflix alone. Same issue exists for Edge browser as well. I am unable to click on anything on Edge using Smartglass app on Windows phone. Similarly I am unable to click on anything on Netflix using Smartglass
 app.</p>

    <title>All wifi adapters not working after driver update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> croco1010  say:</h3>
<h2>            All wifi adapters not working after driver update</h2>
                    <p>I have been using the Netgear WNDA3100v2 wifi adapter for over a year now, recently ive noticed that the genie of the adapter is not opening, then i uninstalled the old driver and all the components. After that, I installed the newest driver given on their
 website, I followed the instructions but after installing, I found that the adapter isnt lighting up and no wifi networks could be scanned(all other devices are fine) while the network adapter window displays that its connected to my adapter. I tried to replug
 the adapter and for the first few seconds, it lighted up, but at last, it went back off. Because of this, I tried another wifi adapter which doesnt require driver installation, the same thing happens that it lights up for the first few seconds and went back
 off soon while i cant scan any wifi networks as well.</p>
<p>Could anyone tell me how to fix this chain of problems, thank you</p>

<p>Programs such as Outlook Express won't allow pasting of non web graphics. Paste into MS Paint and<i>Save As</i> a web graphic. If sending the screenshot by email save it as a jpeg, gif, or png file before sending (in MS Paint,<i>File - Save As</i> then choose
 a format in <i>Save As Type</i>). As colour usually isn't important for screenshots a way to make a file really small is save as a Gif (this reduces it to 256 colours), then save the Gif as a Png (lossless and better compression than Gif) or Jpeg (lossy).</p>
<p>To take screenshots of menus in the current window use the <b>Alt</b> key and keep it held down throughout the entire procedure. Alt + a letter key to access menus, then<b>arrow</b> keys to move the selection, then

<p>J'ai donc acheter un adaptateur manette PS2 / USB, j'ai brancher celui-ci, le volant s'allume bien mais ne fonctionne pas.</p>
<p>D'ou ma question : faut il obligatoirement un wfps ou j'ai oublier une manip ?</p>
<p>J'ai vu egalement une video avec un autre modele d'adaptateur ou le gars branchait la manette xbox sur son boitier, je me suis peut etre tromper d'adaptateur ?</p>
<p>Merci pour votre aide.</p>

<p>En fait je pense que le vendeur s'est trompé dans la description de son materiel.</p>
<p>L'adaptateur est plutôt conçu pour brancher les manettes ps2 sur pc ou sur ps3.</p>
<p>Heureusement il ne m'a couté que 6 euros.</p>
<p>Le wfps est-il une valeur sure ? (je ne veux pas investir pour rien)</p>

            Yeah i agree with you. I really want to use my mouse &amp; keyboard for a lot of the games in Roblox. A lot of games on roblox have a Mouse &amp; Keyboard version. This game could easliy support it. So why not?

<p>The maximum range is 18 feet. Believe 5 meters is just over 16 feet (?). Don't see the problem.</p>

<p>No the controller works perfectly fine within 5 meters the problem is the AUDIO ! it keeps cutting every time, Skipping for example every 20 seconds it cuts ..Read the forums im not the only one having this problem.</p>

<p>I believe you are having problems...not disputing that. The controller has a maximum range of 18 feet. I could see having issues the closer you get to that point; as in audio cutting out. My audio is the first to go when I walk to the other side of the house
 to get a glass of tea.</p>
<p>Measured from the room I play in to the kitchen. Roughly start to have problems at the 15' (4.5 meters) mark; audio totally gone at 19' (5.7 &nbsp;meters.). So my point is it's not a problem. Maybe you and others do not like the range, but it is living up to
 the way it was designed.</p>
<p>Peace, J.R.</p>

<p>[quote]...yesterday I was standing just infront of the Xbox playing fifa 16 with my dad both wearing the earphone and both audio were cutting, I just cannot understand it.[/quote]</p>
<p>The X Box One seems to be more internet dependent than other consoles. Could have been a momentary I.S.P. problem, etc. I've noticed if that the controller goes to sleep while making a extended phone call, etc., I'll have to reboot the X Box One to get the
 headset working correctly.</p>
<p>The X Box 360 had less problems with headsets and a much better range, as I used to be able to still hear/talk in chat while on the front porch. Microsoft seems to be working hard on updates, so hopefully they can fix these issues with a patch; though they
 would probably have to put in better transmitters to extend the range.</p>
<p>Peace, J.R.</p>

<p>okay, so i got my 360 slim yesterday, and i was playing mw2 campaign and then i tried going online, it said "The current profile is not allowed to play on xbox live." I read some articles online and some of them said you have to wait, so i tryed again today,
 and have been trying for 5 hours now. I just got my xbox yesterday, created my live account yesterday, and i get the first 30 days free right? so is there any way to fix this?</p>

<p>This may be due to the account not having a GOLD subscription, and therefore not being able to play online. Did you skip out during the account creation process?</p>

<p>i think i did, because when i first started my xbox it was kind of glitchy so i had to turn it off and on many times, if this is the reason, is there any way to get &nbsp;the 30 days back or not?</p>

<p>Press the Guide button on your controller, Press X to sign out of your current gamertag, then you should see Create Profile on the menu. Choose that and it'll take you through the account creation process again. You will need another email address to set
 up another account. To get the free trial during the process, when it asks if you want to Join Live, choose yes. It will give you all the options for paying for a gold membership. Choose Upgrade Later and it should automatically give you the free trial.</p>
