            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows media audio file is itself a common media file and if you will send that file as an email attachment then it will be easily heard by the receiver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more clarification you may refer to the below mentioned link.</p>

            Thank you for trying to be helpful Ramesh Kumar, but the problem is that I sent the audio file to my friend and although she gets my other email attachments and opens them on her phone such as pictures, she could not open the audio file I sent. &nbsp;Can I
 convert it to an mp3 or mp4? &nbsp;Would that be a common audio file easily opened? &nbsp;This file in question is a recording of my voice.

<h2>            Microsoft Surface Diagnostic Toolkit has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to run Microsoft Surface Diagnostic Toolkit that I downloaded from here (https://aka.ms/surfacerepair) but it crashed.</p>
<p>I have tried full factory reset (clean everything) and updated Windows but the problem remained.</p>
<p>The windows version on my Surface Pro 4 is 10 Pro 64-bit Build 10586.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do? Any help appreciated!</p>
<p>

            <div>The first thing to do is wipe and reimage. You don't know what software problems</div>
<div>a used device purchased online might have and this will get you to a good, known</div>
<div>state. You will have to register or enter the serial number. Choose the newest</div>
<div>recovery image available after you go to</div>
<div><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<div>(with a different Windows computer if yours is not working properly)&nbsp; </div>
<div>and download a recovery image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick</div>
<div>formatted FAT32 (use a Windows computer). Use FULL format and not quick format.</div>
<div>Give the volume a name like surfboot.</div>
<div>Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</div>
<div>Step 1:&nbsp; &nbsp; Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power</div>
<div>button for 30 seconds).</div>
<div>Step 2:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 3:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the</div>
<div>power button on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 4:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.</div>
<div>Step 5:&nbsp; &nbsp; When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</div>
<div>Step 6:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.</div>
<div>If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of the</div>
<div>screen.</div>
<div>Step 7:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This</div>
<div>refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 8:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.</div>
<div>Step 9:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Choose Fully Clean. </div>
<div>Step 10:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Reset.</div>
<div>Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process continues</div>
<div>(this can take a while).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You could then go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></div>
<div>and select Update Now to get to the latest version of Windows. After that, go to</div>

            <p>- A lot of people have had issues with this game over the years, but I don't recall seeing this one yet.</p>
<p>If you are using the early disk based version you may need to patch the game (mine is version 1.03,</p>
<p>but I don't recall if my re-release version came patched. There is an updater in the games folder, but it</p>
<p>no longer works. You can download the patch though).</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have not needed to use either of the fixes below, but apparently they work for some.- Disable
<em>Frame Buffer Effects</em> in the games Advanced graphics options.<br />
- Full screen was also less stable for some people, but this may have only been on laptops with native</p>
<p>resolutions that are not compatible with the game ? </p>
<p>Try running in a Window, to verify if the game will load properly this way. Windowed mode can be accessed
</p>
<p>in the&nbsp; <em>swkotor.ini&nbsp;</em> file, which is found in the games install folder (change Fullscreen from 1&gt;0 ).
</p>
<p>You may also be able to come up with a workable resolution by playing with the resolution (Height and Width)</p>
<p>in the&nbsp; swkotor.ini&nbsp; file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If your particular issue is common to the game you may find another solution on a KOTR specific forum.</p>
<p>I believe there may be other 'community' patches as well.</p>
<p>If you are using the Steam or other download version there may be issues specific to that version, so</p>
the relevant forums would be a better choice.

<h2>            &#91;Windows 10&#93; Taskbar flickering on left hand side of screen every few seconds.</h2>
                    <p>Hello community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently acquired an Asus Transformer Book t100 with windows 10 pre-installed. From the very beginning of using the laptop I have an issue where the task bar repeatedly flickers on the left hand side of the screen every few seconds. I have the task bar
 set to be at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>- Updating windows.</p>
<p>- Updating drivers.</p>
<p>- Locking screen rotation.</p>
<p>- Locking/unlocking the task bar.</p>
<p>- Setting the task bar to the left hand side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not installed anything on the laptop except for google chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas/help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT:]</p>
<p>
</p><p>After being in contact with ASUS, they recommended the computer be sent in for repairs. Feel free to try any of the solutions Guru Kiran provided, but for me it was a problem that could not be solved on my end.</p>

            <p>Thanks again Kiran!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a new user did not solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to Asus, this is a problem that requires the computer to be sent in for repairs, so I will do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you kindly for all the help; at least I learned some trouble shooting in the process!</p>

    <title>How to slow down the left mouse button&#63; It acts like a rapid fire - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> statesman63  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to slow down the left mouse button&#63;  It acts like a rapid fire button.</h2>
                    <p>Quickly pressing my left mouse button with the intention of giving just a single click (press) ends up being multiple clicks in all applications including the web, Microsoft office products, and games. &nbsp;It seems that if I hold the button down it is firing
 off repeatedly. &nbsp;I do not want it to do that. &nbsp;A single click should just result in a single click. &nbsp;I have Windows 10. &nbsp;It is a "Microsoft" wireless mouse that I am using on an Asus computer. &nbsp;I went to the Mouse Properties. &nbsp;There is an option to control
 the Double-click speed, but that is not applicable because I need to control the speed of a single click. &nbsp;I played with the Double-click speed toggle bar and that did not help. &nbsp;There is no option to control the speed of a single click. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is there? &nbsp;Please help!!!</p>

            Thanks for responding, but none of these helped. &nbsp;The mouse and laptop are brand new, and the mouse was always like this, right out the box. &nbsp;Is there a way to change the speed setting for a single click? &nbsp;It acts like it is set to keep firing on mouse
 down. &nbsp;Perhaps it is preset to a mouse down event instead of mouse click event? &nbsp;I admit I don't know much about that, but that is my guess based on how it is acting. &nbsp;

<h3> danidarko96  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Accounts</h2>
                    Before the last update, I was able to use more than one Skype account at a time.&nbsp; After the update, it deleted that option and I haven't been able to do it since.&nbsp; Is there a way that I'm missing how to do it?&nbsp; Or is it obsolete now?&nbsp; I used this quite
 often, practically daily, and I would be really upset to have that gone.&nbsp; Does anyone know if there's a way to do it, or if the option to have multiple accounts open at once will be back in a newer update?&nbsp; Thanks.

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In order to isolate the case, we need these information for further investigation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>What Skype version are you on? Please specify the <strong>exact version,</strong> not latest or recent.
</li><li>What version of Windows 10 are you using?<em> (Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10)</em></li><li>When you say "<em>able to use more than one Skype account</em>", is it by&nbsp;using more than one Skype application at the same time?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We are waiting for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Right now I reverted back to an older version, so I can still use the multiple Skype features, because I literally use it every day.&nbsp; The older version I'm using now (that still works) says Skype 7.40.&nbsp; I don't remember the latest update version number that
 automatically updated, but I think it was 8.-something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the instructions I followed in order to have multiple accounts open at once allowed me to have the initial Skype application on my desktop and also a secondary Skype application.&nbsp; You can open as many Skype windows at a time as you want with the secondary
 one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The directions I followed to do that are&nbsp;<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA829/how-can-i-run-multiple-skype-accounts-at-the-same-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">at this website</a>.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/44369ca8-de38-4ebb-b770-080af58126ba" title="DaniDarko96">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With <em>new Skype version (8.13), </em>that option is not yet possible. In line with that, we would advise you to use the Classic Skype version to exhaust that specific feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, you can still utilize two Skype accounts using one device. That is by using
<strong><em><a href="https://web.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for web
</a></em></strong>and <em>Skype application</em>. By that, you can still enjoy the new Skype version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Feel free to post back if you have questions and clarifications.</p>
<p>

            <p>I'm having issues too.&nbsp; I have music that I purchased from iTunes, but also music purchased through Amazon and other sites.&nbsp; When I first installed iTunes on my new Windows 8 laptop, it worked fine.&nbsp; All my music was able to be played through iTunes with
 no problem, my phone synced perfectly, but then it started having issues a few days later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's what's happening:</p>
<p>When I try to play music through iTunes that was purchased through a means other than iTunes, I receive an error that says "Unable to locate &lt;song name&gt;" and gives me the option to locate or hit cancel.&nbsp; When I click 'locate', nothing happens.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, when I synced my phone after starting to have this problem, it cleared every single song off my phone that wasn't purchased through iTunes which meant instead of having 1,411 songs on my phone, I now have 36.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uninstalled iTunes and reinstalled several times hoping for a miracle.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's going on???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please keep in mind, I was able to sync and play music through iTunes on the Windows 8 laptop for the first few days I had it.&nbsp; All of my music is displayed in iTunes, but the only songs I'm able to actually play through iTunes on the Windows 8 laptop are
 the 36 songs purchased through iTunes.&nbsp; Most of my music is purchased through Amazon because it's usually cheaper.</p>

            Thank you. &nbsp;I will try that once I have a chance to reinstall iTunes...AGAIN.
<div><br />
<div>I don't think the files were moved. &nbsp;If they were, then it was when I opened the XBox music player for the first time. &nbsp;Otherwise, they should be in my folder marked "Music" which is where they've stayed since I have owned an iPod/iPhone of any kind. &nbsp;</div>

            <p>I think you might be onto something here.&nbsp; I just went into my Music app on my laptop and ALL my songs were right there.&nbsp; All the ones that won't play through iTunes will play through the Music App on Windows.&nbsp; How do I sync the two or fix this?&nbsp; Do you
 know? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Need to be able to sync to iPhone.&nbsp; I have no problem getting a Windows phone, but I'm not eligible for an upgrade until September 2013 and I refuse to pay $550 or more for a freaking phone.</p>

            <p>What you might be seeing are files from the Xbox Music Cloud, so the songs might be streaming from the Internet. When you first moved all your music over, the Music app was able to scan and match and now that the file might be missing, it's just playing
 it from the Internet for you. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do the Get Info thing I said above in iTunes to get the file path to a missing song. It's going to look something like C:\Users\HayWire\Music\Arist\Album\Song.mp3 See where it's circled on this screen shot?
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwiki.uky.edu%2fmac%2fImages1%2fwhere.png" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you know this path, right-click the lower left corner of your screen and choose "File Explorer" from the menu that appears. Provided the song was indeed supposed to be in your Music folder, click "Music" from the left-hand sidebar of File Explorer&nbsp;and
 navigate to&nbsp;the folders listed in iTunes until you get to the one it was supposed to be in. Is it there? Great! Now the problem is with iTunes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it not there? ****, now we have to figure out where your music went... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>You were right.&nbsp; Those songs are not still there.&nbsp; My other option is to reconnect to iTunes through the previous computer I was using (my desktop) and see if I can reconfigure everything I guess.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have every single song backed up on a 2 terabyte external HD.&nbsp; So, all is not lost.&nbsp; I just want some on my phone so I can plug in the car and that's where I'm having trouble doing it through the laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other suggestions are greatly appreciated and thank you so much for your help so far!</p>

            One tool you might want to look into is <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows7/products/features/windows-easy-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Easy Transfer</a>. Easy Transfer is designed to bring over your files and settings from an old computer to a new one.<br />
<br />
Since I imagine you've already moved most of your files over, I would use the advanced options in Easy Transfer to ONLY bring over the Music folder from the old computer to the new one in one clean package. If you want more instructions on this method, I can
 lay em out for you.<br />

            <p>Thanks Entegy!!&nbsp; I think I'm almost done with this nightmare.&nbsp; I had to transfer the files from the external into a new iTunes folder on the laptop.&nbsp; I then had to go into iTunes and type in the path where the files were located.&nbsp; However, when trying to
 play music, I still had to go in and locate the files manually, but it's doing several at a time.&nbsp; There was probably an easier way, but I've never had trouble until I got this Windows 8 laptop.&nbsp; I love the OS, but hate that Apple and Microsoft hate each other.&nbsp;
 BLEH!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You could do a System Restore which might work however the problem could return. I would use<br />
the methods below to try to solve the issue.<br />
<br />
How to Do a System Restore in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/700-system-restore.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/700-system-restore.html</span></a><br />
<br />
==================================================<br />
<br />
Do these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />

<br />
Then run checkdisk (chkdsk).<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>After the above : (</strong><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.)</strong></p>
<p>Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High<br />
Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version.<br />
Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers.<br />
Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on<br />
and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the<br />
reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot<br />
until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
</span></span></span><br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<h2>            .Wav songs &#40;iTunes&#41; on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I converted MANY lps into digital music using Audacity and merging into iTunes (.wav files).&nbsp; All was fine until I changed over to Windows 10.&nbsp; These songs are still there, but when I play them the sound is way down, and it sounds like I am listening to
 only one channel (the lyrics are almost non-existent and the guitar is audible, but light).&nbsp; I have switched to Windows 10 and un-switched three times.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what the issue is.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

</p><p>Thank you very much.&nbsp; I did as suggested.&nbsp; No updates needed and no trouble found.&nbsp;&nbsp;The wav files do not play on groove music&nbsp;either -&nbsp;so it does not seem to&nbsp;be an&nbsp;iTunes issue.&nbsp; Also, earlier&nbsp;conversions&nbsp;(I would guess using an earlier version of Audacity)
 are ok.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My thought now is perhaps I&nbsp;can download my iPod (which plays all the songs fine) back onto my computer.&nbsp;

1. Click on search box next to <strong><span>Start Menu</span></strong>.<br />

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>NOTE:
</strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When
 you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent
 you from following these steps. </span></span></p>

<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to update and install the latest

<h2>            DVD drive drawer opens of its own accord - since  WIN10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I restart my PC from cold, the DV D drawer now opens of its own accord. It's likely to get broken as space is tight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within <em>Device Manager</em>, I've tried (i) disabling and (ii) uninstalling the DVD drive. But then&nbsp;whenever WIN10 restarts, it automatcalaly enables and adds the hardware - which it presumably sees as new -&nbsp;so the problem&nbsp;recurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can try disabling the Services "UPNP" and disabling "SSDP Discovery" upon startup.&nbsp;But that seems a clumsy&nbsp;and, of course, I wont be able to play DVDs when I want to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more practical solution would be appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> <strong>Change the incorrect boot order.</strong></p>
<p>The issue could be due to incorrect boot order. I would suggest you to enter your BIOS options and check if you have set the CD\DVD as the primary boot priority.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. When your computer starts, wait for the manufacturer logo to check the option for boot menu, it will usually be&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">F12</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span>
<br />
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3. Restart</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;the computer, when the manufacturer's logo is displayed, keep pressing the&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Boot menu</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;option
 key to enter the boot menu and change the boot option to&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Diskette drive and let CD and DVD be last option.</span></strong></p>

            <p>Than you. I've now tried the following&nbsp;without success:</p>
<p>
</p><p>all of the above and I've disabled UPnP and SSD in Services. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time WIN10 starts, is seeks and adds new hardware automatically and won't let me stop that process. Is there something in Registry I can change to stop WIN10 doing that do you think ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I have 2 DVS drives, and only one seems to be suddenly opening of its own accord, I can try physically disconnecting the power lead to the drive.

            <p>SOLUTION FOUND</p>
<p>-------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Administration / services</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>disable SS Discover</li><li>disable UPnP</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In Device manager</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Uninstall both&nbsp;DVD drives (I have two)</li><li>go to IDE / ATE then delete all&nbsp; 4 entries, that was:&nbsp; ATA Channel 0,&nbsp; ATA Channel 0, ATA Channel 1, and ATA Channel 1</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>power off</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>restart&nbsp;PC</p>
<p>switch&nbsp;SSD and UPnP back to manual</p>
<p>after a couple of restarts, Win 10 then finds to "new" DVD drives and loads drivers and resets&nbsp;ATAx4 automatically.</p>

            <p>What a piece of sh$$ - fault still happening. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I opened the PC and physically disconnected&nbsp;SATA connectors x 2 on the 2 DVD drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device driver then shows no DVD drives (yippee) - then I reconnect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WIN10 then loads drivers&nbsp;telling me "you have the latest&nbsp;driver". </p>
<p>
</p><p>While that may be correct, I don't think it helps if WIN10 is giving me a corrupt driver.</p>

</p><p>I would suggest you to try to roll back the drivers from Device Manager and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right Click on &nbsp;windows key.</p>
<p>Open Device Manager.</p>

<p>Restart the PC and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try that - but the problem&nbsp;with my&nbsp;WIN10 is that there is no driver to roll back to - &nbsp;and no easy way I could find to download a driver and instal it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only websites I saw offering WIN10 driver downloads for my DVD drives didn't inspire me with confidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have disabled AUTO RUN and that seems to have fixed the problem&nbsp;now - as least its worked for a few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that Auto Run is very intrusive - more Klingons than Star Trek. It overrides Default Programs and I think ignores uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank&nbsp;you - I'll be back if it all goes pear shaped.</p>

                    Hi--<br />
My screensaver and basically my whole screen come up as way too dark.&nbsp; The picture of a blonde niece looks like she has black hair.&nbsp; On another response someone said to "push the buttons on your monitor," but I don't understand that.&nbsp; I think I can fix it from
 control panel or something, but I can't find it anywhere.&nbsp; I just want to move from super dark to more in the middle between dark and light.&nbsp; Thanks!!!!

            Do you have an Intel graphics card?&nbsp; If so, your computer might have come with a utility to adjust color correction and aspect ratio.<br />
For starters, open the Control Panel.&nbsp; Click "Adjust Screen Resolution" (that's under Appearance).&nbsp; When the Display Settings windows opens, click Advanced Settings...&nbsp; There&nbsp;might be a
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">HUGE</span></strong> tab at the top of that window bearing the name of your graphics card.&nbsp; If there is, click it.&nbsp; Look around the tab for buttons that might open advanced properties.&nbsp; If you find one, click
 it and look around (the brightness setting may be under, say, color correction?)&nbsp; Try that out if you have an Intel graphics card.

<p>Regardless I hate catwoman, but having two playable characters with two different styles is very interesting and enjoyable. I remember the thing I loved most in
<i>Legacy of Kain: the defiance </i>game&nbsp;is that we can play with both Kain and&nbsp;Raziel, each have his different playing style. anyway at
<i>lok </i>the game play and &nbsp;story was outstanding. anyway lets hope they make a good new Batman game.</p>
