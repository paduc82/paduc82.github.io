<h2>            Cannot access My Documents folder&#59; need to change permissions</h2>
                    
<p>I have Win7 on my new computer.&nbsp; I am the only person using it, and am logged in as Administrator.&nbsp; The computer will not allow me to access My Documents folders.&nbsp; This is ridiculous, really.&nbsp; To open my files, I need to use the Libraries.</p>
<p>Mindful of the caution that "unintended consequences" can occur when you try and change permissions, I thought I'd post this question first:&nbsp; In the C:\\ drive, when I right click "Documents and Settings", "Properties", it says "network files and folder

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no "My Documents" folder native to either Windows Vista or Windows 7.&nbsp; Either you created it yourself (unlikely), or it was created by some application incompatible with Vista/Windows 7.&nbsp; What you're "seeing" is called a "Junction Point,"
 whose sole purpose is to direct legacy applications to the correct locations of user settings and data files; it's not a folder that can be opened, nor does it have any contents.</p>

<p>Hi, Bruce - thank you for your reply.&nbsp; When I purchased my new computer in January, I had my online backup, Carbonite, replace my files on the new computer.&nbsp; It was fast and easy, a one-click way to transfer everything.&nbsp; I'm sure Carbonite created "My Documents"
 as I have always had it on my other computer, which ran WinXP Home edition.&nbsp; I don't really need a "My Documents" folder, and could remove it if necessary.&nbsp; But back to my original problem -<br />
<br />
I've read the various articles suggested, but am still at a loss and terrified that I will try to change permissions on my folders and cause dire unintended consequences, as warned repeatedly by the help articles.</p>
When I go to the C: drive and click on the Documents and Settings folder, I find that I "don't have permission to open Documents and Settings", and "to gain access, you need to use the security tab".&nbsp; OK, I click on the security tab.
<p>It opens a dialog box which shows four group or usernames:&nbsp; Everyone, System, Susan (that's me), and Administrator.&nbsp; This is my computer, no one else uses it, and I am the Administrator as well as everything else.</p>
<p>The box tells me "to change permissions, click edit".&nbsp; When I click edit, I am given many choices, but here's where I stop.&nbsp; I am not sure what to click or unclick.&nbsp; My goal here is to be able to access everything on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your help.&nbsp; I belong to an online group of small business owners like myself, and several people are waiting to hear how to resolve this problem, as they also have issues with changing permissions, so you are really helping several
 of us at once, and we all thank you for your time.</p>

<h2>            When will MS come out with a normal 15 inch with surface windows 8 Pro&#63;</h2>
                    I need a&nbsp;<u><b>larger Microsoft Surface</b></u>.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How does Microsoft expect me to work on less than a 15" screen!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Give me a 15" Surface and I will buy it tomorrow. If I need a backup battery, fine OR if I need to plug it in after 3 hrs, fine BUT I need a tool that I can use - not a toy!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And&nbsp;<u>yes, I will pay for it.&nbsp;</u></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>FYI - I use it in tablet mode for taking field notes in one-note, email, and apps. I use it keyboard mode at Coffee Shops, etc where I work 1/3 of the time.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I think Microsoft could gain more traction if they would give me a normal size tablet with attachable keyboard. There is NONE on the market. &nbsp;Business wants a normal size tablet not toys.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

            Hey there,
<div><br />
<div>I really hope the 15" Version becomes true. I'd get one the day it's announced to pre-sales.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I honestly researched the last two weeks for a convertible and yes there are a few W8.1s out there but still, there is none that could compete with a lager version of the Surface Pro 2 / 3.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Sony Vaio Fit Multiflip is the only 15" solution that raised my interest but it has huge problems with it's fan noise and throttling due to it's restrictive heat control and single fan design. I have compared them all, the Thinkpad Yoga 13", the Acer
 R7 17", the DELL XPS 18", Asus Transformer 13".</div>
<div><br />
<div>There are a few things I found worth mentioning about the pro's of a surface compared to most others.</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li><b>Productive Tablet</b> - Productive people need space - Developers, Artists, Business Men, Students - Give us the playing field it needs to be different from using a competitors "play only" device. Split Screen is a breeze to use with 15 inch and up.
 Built something and wrote the doc side by side.</li><li><b>Performance</b> - It has the performance, stability and low noise profile it needs to be used it in cooperate and productive environments.</li><li><b>Wacom Digitizer</b> - compaired to N-Trig the differences are recognizable when it comes to screen detection, Windows Ink API and others like pressure sensitivity. Draw concepts, take notes, you name it - this is important for convertible users.</li><li><b>Touch and Typecover</b> - I haven't found a single review yet where the new versions were not mentioned for their outstanding quality. Imagine a bigger version with a bluetooth transmitter inside. So you could use it in tablet mode and still have the
 keyboard aside to take quick notes.</li><li><b>It's flat.</b> The hinges all have certain downsides, when it comes to note taking. The all may waggle to the sides when I comes to accuracy.</li><li><b>Screen</b> - I am not an artist but the panel used is pretty nice when it comes to color accuracy and stuff and due to the richer contents (HTML 5 and CSS and others) this could be another top prioritized feature for web, or software or UI devs.</li></ol>
<div>Having all that said I hope you understand why this could be a gamechanger for the industry. For me it sure would be. 10.6" is nice to have for a fast look, but if you need to work on it on a daily basis (which you sure could cause it's W8.1) you need
 to carry a laptop with you to get the real work done.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please MS give this a try!</div>
<div><br />
<div>---------------------------------------</div>
<div>I currently have 17" laptop with some extra performance due to data computing and analysis and it's just a tad too bulky. I right now would know 10+ scenarios where a 15" Surface would come in handy at work and at home.</div>

            <p>Yes please. Microsoft is a step closer with the 12" pro. Now that there is a better alternative to the Mac Book Air please give me an alternative for the Mac Book Pro. As a web/graphic designer a 15" surface would be a wet dream for me.</p>

            I am a bandleader and have done all my notation on convertible windows tablets since the original HP-TM2. I currently have the Sony Flip series, but it is plagued with numerous problems. I would highly welcome the productivity of a MS made 15" surface.
 I am also very impressed with the aspect ratio of the 12" surface, but I need a bigger screen. &nbsp;Other than the Flip 15 and 2nd generation Acer R7 (both of which have been discontinued), there really is no other competition for large tablets/convertibles with
 a digitizer. If there's one thing that the Surface line has been great for, it would be showcasing what a good combination of hardware and windows software can do for productivity. Some of us still need a little more productivity though, and are happy to sacrifice
 a bit of portability. Bring it on MS!

            <p>Agreed it is impossible to work on a 13.5 inch screen no matter how feature packed it is. Microsoft engineers just do not listen to their customers. I would buy the Surface Book in a snap if it&nbsp; had a&nbsp; 15-17 inch screen. Maybe even get two machines&nbsp;one for
 home and one for work.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD - driver_irql_not_less_or_equal storahci.sys</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,<br />
</p>
<br />
I've recently begun to experience random BSOD's that are being triggered via storahci.sys, i've done a bit of research into this and there doesn't seem to be a cut &amp; dry fix for it, in terms of hardware I haven't installed anything since December which was
 when I added an nVidia GPU &amp; a Samsung 850 EVO SSD drive to hold &amp; boot the OS, for the last 5 months this new setup has been trouble free.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've scanned both drives with my AV &amp; run chkdsk in command prompt and neither have returned any issues so i'm at the point where the only additional info to check would be the minidump DMP files, any advice would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've included 3 dump files from this evening - <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=DE4E991FCEB91301!156&amp;authkey=!ANXRJtYf3zaJ-AU&amp;ithint=folder%2cdmp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>A few days later the partition deteriorated to the point where I couldn't get to the login screen so I ended up formatting my SSD and doing a fresh install of Windows 10 while keeping the old HDD connected, this again resulted in storahci.sys BSOD's to the
 point where on Tuesday I did another fresh install but with all storage devices disconnected with the exception of the SSD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the issue that's affected the SSD is also on the HDD as my initial SSD installation was an image copy from my HDD via Samsung magician in December so both drives at the time were mirrored although i'm slightly surprised that the HDD could be the
 root cause of triggering the BSOD after formatting &amp; creating a new installation of windows on the SSD. Currently with only the SSD connected it's been stable for the last few days but i'm still in the waiting phase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This leads me to believe that if it re-occurs then that leaves a hardware fault with the SSD or a driver/hardware configuration conflict between the two, I have read a couple of threads online regarding Samsung boot devices not getting along with certain
 GPU's &amp; Motherboards.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to get an analysis of the logs from the 4th of May for a more conclusive answer to this as i'd rather avoid having to replace one/both components needlessly.

            With only the one drive (SSD) running the system has been stable now for the last 3 weeks so there seems to be a fundamental driver issue when more than 1 drive is connected to the motherboard, still awaiting any insight into the dump files before I can
 take any action in regards to hardware replacement.

</span></p><div><span><strong>How To Find Drivers:</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong>Do not use device manager it may tell you the device is up to date but will not tell you if it is corrupt&nbsp;</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><strong>Search</strong> Google for the name of the driver, or go to the computer makers site.</div>
<div><span><br />
<strong>Compare</strong> the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to<br />
<strong>Visit</strong> the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).<br />
If there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program<br />
<br />
The most common drivers are listed on these pages:&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Thanks for the replies, I will see if my HDD setup is stable enough to access the command prompt to run the SFC &amp; DISM and following that looking at updating some of the drivers, if the HDD on it's own proves to be stable for a length of time past that point
 I'll conclude it being down to the drivers being out of date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is not possible i'll probably just replace the HDD as it's over 5 years old and do a better job in maintaining driver housekeeping in future.</p>

            What is the make and model of the printer?
<br />
<br />When it comes to setting up a wireless printer, I recommend you physically connect the printer to the target computer.
<br />
<br />Install the driver software and configure the printer on it.
<br />
<br />Disconnect the printer, restart then check if you can print wirelessly.

<p>As you say it is the Firewall, is it the Windows 8.1&nbsp;firewall or a 3rd party Firewall (Norton, etc.) and what is the exact error message you get?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what is the HP printer Model Number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>With HP printers you run the installation and connect the HP printer to the Computer when HP says so during the software installation&nbsp;and not before.</p>

<p>Could be a retailer released it early. People got RE6 weeks early in some places. As for Doom 1 and 2? I thought there would be tokens to download them from the marketplace within the game case. Perhaps the back of the manual or something? Printed on your
 receipt? Emailed to you? If they're supposed to be on the disc, then maybe it's redeemable through there on the marketplace. If that's the case, it might require waiting until the servers update with the proper information for it or so. No idea, but be sure
 to check everything to make sure you didn't accidentally skip it somewhere.</p>

<p>Could be, but I would think that once you loaded the disc it would show up in your played games. But I'll give the benefit of the doubt, dialtones rep seemd solid.</p>

<p>There's some gameplay footage on YouTube, apparently Australia got this game early (?). Looks quite good! The only small little thing I noticed was the auto-saves, they last a bit too long and it could get rather annoying I suppose. Who cares though.</p>
<p>Hey SimeonOfDeath remember playing QAA together? Wonder if people still play. It's a shame that game never got patched. Could've been a huge hit on XBLA. Wonder if Doom 3 multiplayer will suffer the same issues as QAA did, and Doom 1 &amp; 2 did (virtually unplayable
 online). :(</p>

<p>F...I just wrote a long reply to Johhny but the site didn't post it! ARRRGGGHHH!!!!! I hate these boards. Anyway, this time I'll make it short. Hi Johhny, yep, still remember you &nbsp; :-) &nbsp;Me and somr friends have been on QAA a lot lately, you just missed a
 3 week push to finish our achievements. We will still be on for the next few nights but once Doom 3 hits we likely won't be on QAA for quite a while as D3 will dominate our play time for a while. Anyway, check QAA ranked tonight and tomorrow at 11:00 Pacific,
 we should be on for the next 2 nights &nbsp; :-)</p>

    <title>New password letting me log into safe mode &#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevintan5  say:</h3>
<h2>            New password letting me log into safe mode &#33;</h2>
                    Ok so basically i was trying to follow this tutorial online because my system kept trying to update but it always ended undoing the changes. That has led me to go into safe mode to try to find a solution to my main problem. But then, it didnt accept my
 pin in safe mode (i found out why) and i forgot the main password that was tied to this system. So i went online to microsoft and tried changing my password. I managed to change my password, then i restarted the system (my system is stuck on safe mode) and
 tried again, no success. Ive tried everything in the recovery and everything. At this point ive given up on my main problem and just want my computer to boot normally. Why is my changed password not working, and how would i go about fixing this?&nbsp;

<p>I'm guessing your computer connects with WiFi and has no internet connection in safe mode which it needs to gather up the new password - assuming you do login to your computer with your microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you connect your computer via a network cable it should have an internet connection at startup and its microsoft password will update.</p>

            Try booting your machine with Windows 10 installation media
<br />At the Install screen, click on "Repair" on the lower left.
<br />Then Troubleshoot.
<br />Advanced.
<br />Select Command Prompt and type in the following:
<br />bcdedit /deletevalue {default} safeboot
<br />If that gives an error, use:
<br />bcdedit /deletevalue {current} safeboot
<br />This should get you out of safe mode.

            Media creation tool is used to update Windows, to repair Windows or reinstall the operating system.

<br />This way it should bypass the need for a password &amp; once you run those cmds will get,you out of safe mode.
<br />You usually require internet access for the OS to update the password, so you'd need safe mode with networking.

<h3> chris cleaver  say:</h3>
<h2>            DISM error 1450 from sysprep Windows 7 image</h2>
                    I've created a sysprep'd, Windows 7 pro 32 bit image using dism.exe.<br />
<br />
I've been able to mount this image, add drivers and unmount this image in the past using dism.exe with no difficulties.<br />
<br />
I am now getting an Error 1450 message when trying to add drivers to the image.&nbsp; The description is "An error occurred while attempting to access the Image.<br />
<br />
If I look in the log file I see an error stating "Failed to mount the remote registry"&nbsp; and another stating "Failed to set the windows directory to 'c:\mounted-images\windows'"<br />
<br />
Anybody have any suggestions?<br />

Go to HP site and install all the win7 drivers for your model, if they are avilable from HP. If not check the HP site to asertain whether your model actually supports win7, not all do.</p>
<p>Do not try Compatibility mode options</p>

What do you mean do not try compatibility mode options? Another person had issues with their HP Tablet which ran Vista, but the drivers were not working in Windows 7, then they tried compatibility mode and it worked. You have made two very unusual replies so
 far. Is everything ok?<br />

    <title>How to restore Windows Firewall rules to default settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redmondgiant  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to restore Windows Firewall rules to default settings</h2>
                    <p>* Original Title: Win7 firewall rules are gone AND the HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services\SharedAccess\Defaults are also gone
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you get these restored once a virus (or whatever did this) removes them? It not only removed the current Inbound and Outbound rules, it removed the DEFAULTS themselves that everything from the Control Panel-Windows Firewall-Restore defaults to netsh
 uses to perform a restoration from a known set of initial default settings. So none of those options work, and I do not have another machine to get anything from to copy. This can't be that uncommon lately, as viruses get more aggravating by the hour. Any
 virus that wants to do a thorough job of **** you off would clearly remove the defaults as well as the current rules precisely to make it hard to restore them. There must be some way to get a standard set of initial defaults back, either: - some low-level
 utility - repair operation - fixit - canonical list Microsoft has for Win7 Right??</p>

<p>That said, if you mean can you uninstall the updates with Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel, the answer is "no".&nbsp; If you mean can you delete all of the $NtUninstallKBxxxxxx$ files in C:\Windows, then yes.</p>
<p>If you do the latter, then you should be able to attempt to uninstall the KB patches in Add/Remove Programs.&nbsp; The process should tell you there's something wrong&nbsp;and remove the entry from Add/Remove Programs, but the update will still be installed.&nbsp; My opinion
 is that disk space is cheap.&nbsp; Why remove the folders just because they take up a little room?&nbsp; Unless your hard drive is approaching 80% full or so, performance shouldn't be affected.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 Search in File Explorer does not work&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicolas dusaussoy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Search in File Explorer does not work&#33;</h2>
                    Here is an inconsistency in the way Search works (or does not work) in Windows 8.<br />
<br />
I have installed a version of Windows 8 Pro on my new computer.&nbsp; I have a partition C: for the OS and applications and another partition E: for data and user files.&nbsp; I relocated My Documents to E:\Users\nicolas\Documents using My Documents Properties.<br />
<br />
So far so good.&nbsp; I can access my files either through Libraries\Documents or through E:\Users\nicolas\My Documents.<br />
<br />
However, if I use Windows Explorer and the search function (Ctrl E or upper right corner) and type *.doc, the behavior is not the same whether I start from Libraries\Documents (does not work) or E:\Users\nicolas\My Documents (works).<br />
<br />
This is inconsistent.&nbsp; I suppose this has to do with the way file indexing is set on the computer.&nbsp; But I would assume that by default search should always look for files when starting from Windows Explorer instead of saying "No files found".<br />
<br />
Charm search does not find the files I am looking for either.<br />
<br />
I wish Search would work consistently without having to rebuild indexes or change settings.<br />
<br />
How come Libraries are not included in the Search Indexes?&nbsp; I thought this was the default?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help,<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Nicolas</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&nbsp;select a single drive and perform a search,&nbsp;only that drive will be searched. If you want to search All Drives, in File Explorer, select Computer and perform the search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description, search should be working from the Documents Library as long as the Documents folder on the E: drive has been added to the Documents Library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this still does not work, you might want to Rebuild the Index.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press WinKey+X to display the system menu and open Control Panel/Indexing Options.</p>
<p><br />
Select the Advanced button and click the Rebuild button. This will delete the current search index and rebuild it from scratch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: The indexing is designed to work best when the computer is idle. If user activity is detected, the indexing will pause and wait for an idle condition before starting again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Let us know if this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Regards</p>

            Thank you for your answer.<br />
<br />
I am rebuilding the index following your suggestion.<br />
<br />
Two Users folders appear in the Included Locations: one for Drive C: (this one excludes AppData) and the other for Drive E:&nbsp; (where my files are located).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Under Libraries in Window Explorer I can see all my documents (on the E: drive).&nbsp; So I assume it is properly added to the Documents Library.<br />
<br />
I still don't understand why Search works when I search directly from a folder on the E: drive but not from the libraries.<br />
<br />
Since I can access the same documents both ways, it's frustrating getting conflicting search results.&nbsp; I hope rebuilding the index takes care of the problem.&nbsp; But why I should do this unless I want to add a new location?<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
<br />

            <p>Microsoft:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is something your team should be deeply embarrassed over. &nbsp;You should actually FIRE the whole search / explorer team. &nbsp;The work on this is extremely sloppy with horrible UIX design to top it off. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, this is stuff that worked in DOS!!! Windows 8.1 still can't search a directory tree for files of a certain name. &nbsp;For shame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is SIMPLE stuff. &nbsp;I search for a file name at a root folder and the search function only finds 1 file. &nbsp;Even though I have directed search to find the files in all sub-directories. &nbsp;It simply quits after finding the first match.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is NOT a matter of indexing. &nbsp;And if it is, you should have your heads examined. &nbsp;I simply want to pull up a list of files and (in 2014 on a "modern" OS) cannot do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shame on you. &nbsp;You deserve all the bashing non-Microsoft users heap upon you. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Amazingly, stunningly, poor engineering.</p>

            Similar but even simpler problem here. I want to filter the files in a single folder using the search bar. No results ever. It worked great in Vista but here it does absolutely nothing.

            <p>Since windows explorer in win&nbsp;7 pro&nbsp;doesn't reliably search a directory and its subdirectories for a particular file type, I now open a command window, navigate to the top-level directory I want to search, then use the "dir" command with the "/s" option,
 e.g. "dir /s *.doc".</p>

<h2>            Xbox won&#39;t connect to Xbox Live on start up, getting teredo message</h2>
                    <p>So this morning I came to turn on the One X (love it btw) and I see that it didn't automatically connect as usual, so I ran a test. I got something that says "xbox.com/xboxone/teredo" try going to this website and I get a general multiplayer test tutorial. I have honestly gotten this error message quite often and just merely restarting the Xbox doesn't fix it, I have to do a full restart on my Xbox and also restarting my modem and router which is a complete hassle each time (this happens at least 3 times a week). Is there a known reason for this error? or is something supposed to turned on or off to negate having this happen in the future? Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Also&nbsp;when this error occurs and I can't connect to Xbox live, my two PC's, phones and tablets are connected to the internet and run perfectly fine while this error is up and before I restart everything.</p>

<h2>            Windows Photos App won&#39;t open&#59; says trial license is expired</h2>
                    <p>The Windows Photos app suddenly refuses to open. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It first says "There's a problem with Photos. Contact your System Administrator about repairing or reinstalling it".</p>
<p>
</p><p>After clicking OK the next error dialog says "This app failed to launch because its trial license expired".</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this? If I go to Settings =&gt; Apps &amp; Features the "Uninstall" button is disabled. It seems to be a core component of Windows that cannot be uninstalled and reinstalled. There is no repair option listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
app store listing</a> does not list anything about a paid version or trial version which leads me to believe some Windows built-in licensing mechanism just screwed up and there isn't actual a trial license that expired.</p>

</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to assist you with your concern about the Photos App not opening, kindly answer the following questions first:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What changes have you done to your computer system prior to getting this issue?
</li><li>Do you currently have a subscription with any Microsoft applications?</li><li>When you try to open the application, does it launch and turns off immediately? Or it doesn't respond at all?
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your post and we appreciate your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<h2>            Also can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t change gamer pic</h2>
                    
<p>Yup, similar problem here.</p>
<p>I have never owned an Xbox. I made my profile and customized my avatar&nbsp;a long time ago (I assume on the Xbox Live site since I have never had access to an Xbox).</p>
<p>I recently switched my main computer to a Windows 8 machine and decided to check out the Games app. I went ahead and updated my avatar, thinking my profile pic would update automatically since I didn't see a way to do it in the app. Well, after about a week,
 I decided to figure out why it hadn't changed.</p>
<p>Now, come to find that there is no way to change it. The Microsoft answer seems to be "go to a game store, login on an Xbox there and then change it". As the previous poster said, this is ridiculous. Not only would I have to drive out to a store (which may
 or may not have a display Xbox that can be used), I would have to trust that I could safely enter my login info on a device that is dubiously secure (have not had good experiences with electronics stores wiping sensitive data off of devices).</p>
<p>This is definitely&nbsp;not a reasonable solution to this problem. Ironically, this kind of situation makes me even less likely to buy an Xbox or Xbox games since I do not trust the kind of support I'd get.</p>

<p>Hey there,<br />
<br />
Hmm, there's a couple things we can try for that. &nbsp;First off, does it let you change the pic if you go through the
<a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-US/AvatarEditor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Avatar Editor</a> on the website? &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also, as for your old threads, you can get to them by going to "Your Discussions" button on the main page of any Forum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The webpage you directed me to shows a Games app button and says, "To edit your avatar, start the Games app."</p>
<p>The Games app doesn't have a way to change the gamer pic - hence me starting this topic.</p>

<p>Also, the "You Discussions" button only helps you find your threads after you have navigated to the correct support sub-forum; it does not appear on the main forum page and thus leaves you completely out of luck if you don't remember what sub-forum you posted

<p>Almost two weeks and still no response...</p>
<p>This seems like it should be a common enough situation that someone would have come across - if, for example they had been using the Games for Windows Live application that has been integrated now with the Xbox Live Marketplace.</p>
<p>For those people who don't have an Xbox, it seems strange that Microsoft Games are still managed through an Xbox-centric client.</p>

<p>Hey there! &nbsp;I'm so sorry you were waiting for a reply. &nbsp;We try to get to every thread every day- not sure how this one slipped through. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I confess that I don't use GFWL myself, and as we're Xbox Support, there might be something blocking you that I don't know about. &nbsp;If we can't get it, you can also try posting in the
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/gfw/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">GFWL forum</a>- someone might have a fix there that I am likewise unfamiliar with. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
OK, this is what I see when I click that link</p>

<br />
Do you get anything like this at all? &nbsp;And since I'm guessing not, can you upload a pic of what you DO see?</p>

<p>It doesn't seem like there's a way to change your gamer picture on Windows 8 just yet (even as of Windows 8.1).<br />
<br />
It also doesn't seem like you have the ability to change your gamer picture on the Xbox.com Avatar Editor unless you've first downloaded your profile to a Xbox 360 console at least once.</p>

</p>
I'm getting a blue screen about once a day. I'm running Windows 10 (upgraded from Windows 8.1) on a Samsung Ativ Book 9 Lite.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bluescreenview is reporting that is caused by two drivers (sometimes caused by one, sometimes by the other): ntoskrnl.exe and hal.dll. The minidump file is here:&nbsp;https://www.dropbox.com/s/uy1gnqsxcmd54ar/060716-15953-01.dmp?dl=0<br />
<br />
I've seen reports that this can be solved by installing a Standard SATA AHCI Controller. I have done and the problem still exists. Can anyone help? Many thanks in advance.<br />

            <p>I would uninstall Kaspersky then run their removal tool. To remove the rest of it</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can cause that stop error. I would also uninstall or update whatever Roxio/sonic program you installed</p>
<p>

            <p>Also, many of the minidump files referenced the athw10x.sys which is the Atheros wireless driver so&nbsp;try updating the&nbsp;wireless driver:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Device Manager and expand "Network adapters" and right-click the Atheros wireless adapter &gt; Update Driver Software &gt; Search automatically for updated driver software</p>
<p>
</p><p>There did appear to be Kaspersky drivers&nbsp;involved in&nbsp;a crash so I would agree to suggest to uninstall Kaspersky, at least temporarily, and use Windows built-in antivirus (Windows Deandre) and firewall.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Window thinks the current device driver is the most up to date. I've found a more up to date one online which I'll try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm reluctant at this stage to uninstall Kaspersky. It's very good virus software and I'll be amazed if it's causing the crashes. Any other way of resolving things would be preferable.</p>

            <p>Dont use device manager / windowsupdate to find drivers. It doesnt always find updated drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to whatever site and get a later driver, if it's available</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if the wireless drivers are crashing , a separate firewall program,&nbsp; can cause it<br />

<p>Uninstalling Kasperksy can be temporary for troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, at this point can you provide the following information which may help determine&nbsp;any issue(s):
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Key + R&nbsp;&gt; type <em>msinfo32 </em>in the "Open" box&nbsp; &gt; OK &gt;&nbsp;File &gt; Save &gt; then save as an .nfo file</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then make the resulting .nfo file&nbsp;available via&nbsp;Dropbox</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, can you do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Key + R&nbsp;&gt; type <em>eventvwr </em>in the "Open" box&nbsp;&gt; OK&nbsp;&gt; expand "Custom Views" and then right-click "Administrative Events" &gt; select "Save all events in Custom View As" and save as an .evtx file</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then make the resulting .evtx file available via Dropbox</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've installed the most up to date driver I can find and am still persevering with Kaspersky. No crashes in the 24 hours since I installed but early days.

<h2>            Skype 8 for Desktop crashes anytime I try to share my screen</h2>
                    <p>Skype for Desktop crashes every time I share my screen. Skype UWP does not crash on share. Steps I've taken already:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Run dxdiag with no issue</li><li>removed and reinstalled display drivers</li><li>removed and reinstalled skype numerous times</li><li>removed skype 8.37 and tried 8.36, same issue</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The only lead I have is that in my event viewer this pops up EACH time I try and share my screen.&nbsp;<strong>Session "RtcPalVideoEtwSession" failed to start with the following error: 0xC0000022&nbsp;</strong></p>

<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />Please try closing down all instances of Skype and then running it as administrator. It can be a admin rights error.

<p>All - thank you for your suggestions. I finally figured out it was an executable called "videochannelmonitor" that comes with a call recorder I use, Evaer. Once I terminated the process, the screen share went great.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to everyone here for the prompt response and help. Really appreciated!!!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Net use per user &#63;</h2>
                    <p>My main issue is, running this C# line of code <strong>Console.WriteLine(Properties.Settings.Default.GreetingText);</strong> throws this exception :&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>System.ArgumentException: The parameter is incorrect. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070057 (E_INVALIDARG))<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;at System.Security.Policy.PEFileEvidenceFactory.GetLocationEvidence(SafePEFileHandle peFile, SecurityZone&amp; zone, StringHandleOnStack retUrl).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the process using that line of code is started with user "A" from a mapped drive created by user "SYSTEM".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the mapped drive created by SYSTEM is showing an X (disconnected) in explorer, but is still accessible by all users. This shows most probably that&nbsp;what I am trying to do is not supported by Microsoft. I was running several processes (C# or Native)
 without any problem until we used that particular process with that C# line of code. We tried to remove the line of code, but other C# line of codes are causing a similar problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was looking into changing how the "net use" is created to use a supported way, but my research led to think that net use is PER USER ...
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">but with the exception of SYSTEM user</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I could create a S: mapped drive with SYSTEM and the same mapped drive S: with the logged in user, this would solve my problem, but its apparently impossible since the S: drive is seen in some way by the logged user even if doing "NET USE" doesn't show
 the S: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to run this C# code on a mapped drive by SYSTEM user ?<br />
How can this problem be solved without having to define another letter ? Having to support 2 drive letter would have a huge impact on the scripts running all the processes because some are running SYSTEM, others are running as the logged user.<br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">-&gt; Mapping with another PC or mapping with the local PC will result in the same problem I have in the end. So I am reducing the complexity of the problem.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You
 are pretty close to reproducing the problem I am getting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">From there, you can notice that in explorer, you see an "Disconnected Network Drive S:" with a big red X. But like me, you noticed that its usable by doing the "DIR" command. I was able to use that drive
 by loading processes from that mapped drive for a while without any problems. Still, this is odd when the documentation says that NET USE command is per USER. How come we can use the mapped drive by SYSTEM with a named USER account ?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">While searching for my problem, I found this post&nbsp;<a href="https://www.visualcron.com/forum.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=3147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.visualcron.com/forum.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=3147</a></span>.
 From there, there is a TestProcess.zip that can be downloaded (search for File Attachment) with all the code. If you run the TestProcess.exe from the S: drive you just created with your USER account, it will fail with the mentioned exception in my first post.
 If you run "psexec -s cmd.exe" and run the same process from the S: drive from the SYSTEM account, it will succeed. Its the simple line&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span><strong>Console.WriteLine(Properties.Settings.Default.GreetingText);</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;
 that throws the exception.</span></p>
