    <title>Recently Installed Windows 10, no mouse cursor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> collect12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recently Installed Windows 10, no mouse cursor</h2>
                    After updating to Windows Ten, I preformed a reset on my computer. Once the reset was finished, my computer rebooted itself and displayed the "Basics" screen. This screen asked for my region. However, I was not able to select a region, as there was no
 cursor, any my mouse was completely unresponsive. My keyboard also did was not able to do anything. Both my kryboard and mouse connect to my PC via USB, so my guess is that this may be a case of the drivers not properly updating. Is there any fix for this,
 or is my computer gone?

    <title>When will Wacom drivers be available&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidraabe  say:</h3>
<h2>            When will Wacom drivers be available&#63;</h2>
                    First, about me:<br />
For the past 5 years I've been an avid Tablet PC user, starting with an HP TX2 and moving onto a TM2 a year-and-a-half ago.&nbsp; The TX2 used N-Trig, which meant no pressure support in important software such as Blender, Gimp, and Photoshop, since it piggybacked
 on Microsoft's Ink platform instead of licensing WinTab.&nbsp; The TM2, however, used Wacom and WinTab, and worked in all the above software as it should.<br />
<br />
I bought a Surface Pro because it is the Holy Grail of Tablet PCs.&nbsp; A Wacom digitizer on a 1080p screen in a tiny, powerful form factor?&nbsp; Yes please.&nbsp; One of the first things that I did was to test if the digitizer was in fact Wacom by making sure it worked
 with my Penabled pens: it did so.&nbsp; It was only this morning that I attempted to do some sketching with the Surface Pro that I realized that there are no Wacom drivers installed (and therefore no pressure sensitivity or eraser support in my sketch program of
 choice, MyPaint).&nbsp; I figured that was easily-enough solved, so I attempted to install Wacom drivers from Wacom's support site, both through their installer (which gave me a "No supported hardware" error) and manually (which told me that the drivers weren't
 for the platform).<br />
<br />
So I brought the situation to Surface support, and received the answer that the device does not support Wacom drivers.<br />
<br />
Why not?&nbsp; And if it does not now, will it soon?&nbsp; I bought this device over others primarily for the Wacom digitizer, and if it's not going to work any better than my old TX2 compatibility-wise, then I will have to return it or keep a $1000 device that's just
 going to frustrate me every time I think "Ah, I want to do some sketching now!"<br />

<p>maybe you can edit the Wacom driver files to include the device codes of the surface digitizer?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in a more serious note, Microsoft will have to get this going, one way or the other... people want to use photoshop and other solutions which heavily rely on pressure sensitivity.</p>

<h2>            Receiving calls on Ipad</h2>
                    Most calls I receive on skype through my ipad cut out as soon as I click accept. I then have to call the caller back and it's fine. The callers are always calling from phones - not from skype. Anyone know why this might be happening? I don't have 'audio
 settings' on the ipad app - before you suggest changing those. Thank you!

    <title>Use Surface pro with dead SSD&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scruncher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Use Surface pro with dead SSD&#63;</h2>
                    The SDD in my Surface Pro has died. Is it possible to boot and run an OS from an external drive using the USB port, which is still functioning. Would the touch screen&nbsp;and the keyboard&nbsp;be usable if I did? MS want £330 pounds for a replacement, but I could
 probably get a second-hand Surface Pro 3 for only a little more, so I'm loathe to spend that much. Despite my experience I'll probably be investing in the forthcoming Surface Pro 4 anyway.

            <p>Just save your money and get the Pro 4.&nbsp; It will probably be announced on the 6th of this month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to salvage the Surface Pro, you can go to http://www.ifixit.com and there, do a search for "surface pro" and look for the teardown guide.&nbsp; They sell tools and some parts as well but there, you can get a higher capacity SSD card and replace the
 broken one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, it may not be worth doing that because the teardown of any of the Surface tablets is a disaster in the making.&nbsp; If you do it, follow the guide to the letter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Pro 4 is coming out, the Pro 3 models will probably be discounted and you might get a good deal there as well.&nbsp; I would wait until October the 6th and see what is announced and then come up with a game plan on what to do to keep the cost down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your data, of course, is gone with the exception of the OneDrive contents.&nbsp; That data is still on the web site http://www onedrive.com and you can get to it anytime you want.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem might be caused due to outdated drivers or compatibility with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now we would suggest you to use the normal USB key board and mouse, and login to the pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are able to login, you can visit the computer manufacturer website and install the latest chipset and Bluetooth drivers for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps, for further assistance please reply.</p>

            &nbsp;If I had a USB keyboard or mouse I would have tried that already. So basically I need to go buy a new mouse and keyboard in order to get back in and use my own computer. Somehow I doubt Microsoft is going to buy them for me &nbsp;hence my frustration.&nbsp;

                    <p>Original Title: Masters of Orion 2.</p>
<p>Loved the game, but it won't seem to even install on my Windows7 system.&nbsp; Tried changing compatability to windows 95, 98, and even XP with service pack 2 and it keeps telling me I need a 32- or 64- bit version of the program and to contact the software manufacturer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Any ideas?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Since the system originally had another version of Windows did you run the Upgrade Advisor and<br />
check the Compatibility Center for the CD/DVD compatibilty (and other devices as needed).<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor - please run this now.<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
<span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx</span></a>
<div>
<div>
<p><br />
Also check the Compatibility Center (for major devices)<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>Check with the System maker and the Device maker for information about drivers for Windows 7.<br />
(BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and other major device drivers).<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Check these :</p>
<p>The DVD drive does not function after you install Windows 7 - these are different Sony drives<br />
however the same issue could be affecting your drive.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975270/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975270/</span></a></p>

<p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If the System can run Windows 7 AND there are drivers for the devices these might help :<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

                    Halo Forum Members,<br />
<br />
I see the replication of "\Application Data\Application Data\..."<br />
such as in folder:<br />
<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Application Data\Application Data\Application Data\Application Data\Application Data\..<br />
<br />
MS Security Essentials, which is regularly updated, does not report any problem about this.<br />
<br />
Is it actually a problem ?<br />
If yes, how to solve it ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            This is the result of the PC manufacturer incorrectly applying "Junction Point". What you see is not duplication but the effect of folder names referring back to themselves ad infinitum. You could fix the error but since it usually causes no problem you
 might as well ignore it.<br />

    <title>Problems following Windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frbskate63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems following Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my laptop from Windows 7 to Windows 10. &nbsp;For two weeks, everything was fine. &nbsp;But two days ago, I logged on, and after a few minutes my session was terminated with an announcement that a restart was needed to complete installation of
 updates. &nbsp;(I have huge issues with not being given the option to defer the restart to a more convenient time, but that isn't my main problem.)</p>
<p>My laptop restarted, gave me the Windows 10 logo and start-up jingle, and then went to a blank, unresponsive screen. &nbsp;No cursor, and ctrl/alt/delete did nothing. &nbsp;Eventually, after leaving it for 30 minutes, I powered off.</p>
<p>I tried starting up again, pressing F12. &nbsp;This brought up the following messages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel UNDI. PXE-2.8 (build 083)</p>
<p>For Atheros PCIE Ethernet Controller v2.0.2.3(05/18/10)</p>
<p>Check cable connection!</p>
<p>PXE-M0F: Exiting Intel PXE ROM.</p>
<p>Reboot and select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

            <p>Hi Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. However, I cannot reach my desktop - when my laptop starts up, it goes to a blank screen, which does not respond to anything, including ctrl/alt/delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I press F12 during start-up, I get the messages in my original post. It seems to be trying to boot from the CD drive?</p>

            I really hope that Vector Unit does plan updating this game with that feature. &nbsp;However we'll never know how good gaming will be on Windows 8 apps. &nbsp;Most of what you see are either quick simple console ports or even cell phone ports. &nbsp;I don't think some
 companies plan on making amazing games on Windows 8 but I do hope we see more and hopefully it'll change the words coming from my mouth. &nbsp;

    <title>Windows wont boot properly after uninstalling theme pack - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tommy sidorski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows wont boot properly after uninstalling theme pack</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To days ago, I installed the alienware red themepack. After using it for a couple hours, I just didn't like it. When&nbsp; I went to change the theme back to windows 10 default, everything seemed fine but when i would type something the font color
 was red and I just couldn't stand it. So I uninstalled the theme Uxstyle thinking that the the theme's ui would stop working and would revert to the original windows 10 ui; I also uninstalled "Modify Registry" by VIA Technologies. But when I restarted my pc,
 i was greeted with an unpleasant screeching sound and a screen that was black and would sometimes turn white. I could still move around my mouse cursor. I tried pressing the windows key, and CTRL ALT DELETE, but that didn't do anything either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In attempt to fix this problem, I plugged in my usb drive which had the windows 10 installer on it. Then launched the pc repair, and tried system reset, but it said that my drive was locked and said to unlock it and try it again. I do not know how to unlock
 it, but if any of you know please tell me how.</p>

Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Method 1: &nbsp;</span></strong></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would first suggest you to remove all external devices connected to the
 computer except essential devices like keyboard and mouse and then boot the computer. Now, try to install and check.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> The issue could be due to some Software/update causing the issue. I would
 suggest you to press the <strong><span>Shift key and hold the power button</span></strong> so that it will go to the
<strong><span>recovery options</span></strong>, Select safe mode and boot to the desktop. I would suggest you to boot the computer into clean boot and Check if the issue persists.

            Please go back and read the steps I gave again.  It explains that the onboard Repair Mode repair tools may require a password to access,so in this case you need to create bootable media to access them without a password.  Then you can try enabling the Hidden Administrator to create a new Admin account to sign into and move everything over from the old account.  
<br />
<br />Only if this fails because the entire install is corrupted and not just the user account would you need to do the Reset or even the Clean Install using the media - which is the best option actually because no one who does that Clean Install I linked ever comes back with further problems that I have seen.

            Hi Ab.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />  I'll give you everything possible to try for sign-in failure so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Next try enabling the Hidden Administrator account to log into and set up a new Local Administrative Account to sign-into, move files over and set up, using Option Five here:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br />
<br />To do this you'll need to access a Command Prompt in repair mode using whichever method works here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  You can also try the option to System Restore.  If you don't have the password this may be limited to using the booted media.   
<br />
<br />If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options to try System Restore, or if that fails the Command Prompt to enable the Built-in Admin account .  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the Troubleshoot Options try a Reset, saving files.
<br />
<br />If this fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope having the full range of options helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might arise if the space provided for the recovery partition has been occupied and a new partition has been created to place the leftover recovery files. In Windows 10, some additional space is allocated for the recovery files if the designated
 partition is filled to the brim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, I would suggest you to unhide the partition and check what type of files are consisted by the partition. In order to unhide partition:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start Disk Management (diskmgmt.msc) on your computer and take a closer look at your hard disk. Note the disk number and the partitions.</li><li>Start DiskPart and select your disk: <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>DISKPART&gt; select disk 0</strong></span></li><li>List all partitions: <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>DISKPART&gt; list partition</strong></span></li><li>Now, select the hidden partition (see step 1) <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>DISKPART&gt; select partition 1</strong></span></li><li>Type <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>DISKPART&gt; detail partition</strong></span> and verify that it is hidden. Remember the Type value, this will be handy if something goes wrong.</li><li>Set the type of the hidden partition to 07. Type <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>DISKPART&gt; set id = 07 override</strong></span></li><li>If everything goes ok, you will receive the following message “<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Diskpart successfully set the partition ID<em>.</em></strong></span>“</li><li>All&nbsp;done. Type <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Exit</span>
</span></strong>to close DiskPart.</li><li>Check the Disk Management to see witch drive letter has been assigned to the recovery partition.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we will be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Singh. Here is the partition detail info. Again, this matches my Win 8.1 info precisely including the offsets, which are in bytes this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) How can it be the offsets &amp; sizes remain the same with a new partition added?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- The partition seems not to have been added at the end of the disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- I dimly recall seeing&nbsp;I had only ~1 MB unallocated anyway (somehow in Seagate's DiscWizard).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- DiscWizard &amp; MS's System Image Backup do happily still work &amp; report no error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) Which is the true physical location of the new 471 MB partition?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) 6th place going by diskpart list partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 4th place going by diskpart list volume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) 6th place going by offset. (I guess this is it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) 5th place going by DiscWizard's Disk Mode view (below) &amp; Disk Management (above).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e) 4th place going by DiscWizard's Partition Mode view (below) &amp; Disk Management (above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>(3) Why do neither Disk Management nor DiscWizard show DiskPart's 128 MB partition 3 (reserved)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(4) I believe partition 7 (8 GB) is my Dell system image of Win 8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Is it best not to unhide that one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(5) My 40 MB&nbsp;Partition 2&nbsp;(called Diags by&nbsp;DiscWizard) was reported to be empty by DiscWizard</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I viewed it in Win 8.1 - now it is full. Could that be what you meant?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT 8/23/15:&nbsp; OK. I see what happened. Partition C: was shortened &amp; the new 471 MB partition put between it &amp; the Dell image of Win 8.1. None of the numbers changed because offsets are partition start positions (unchanged), &amp; the size of C: isn't reported
 precisely enough by DiskPart to reflect the loss.</p>

            <p>Thank you, hjlhv. That's an informative site. Once, I hoped DiskPart &amp;/or Disk Management would do all I needed. But, if I've got a useless partition preceding C: on my disk - or even useful ones that have much unused space inside&nbsp;- I'll need something like
 AOMEI to merge&nbsp;the space into C:. If Terabyte is still around, I think I owe them a look too, though. Terabyte was useful to me back in my Win98 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was BINGing around to&nbsp;discover what was my new 471 MB partition. AOMEI has convinced me it is Win 10's version of WINRETOOLS (as named in DiskPart list volume). Of course, the new one has no name. Win 8.1's version retained the name, &amp; I guess it's still
 there in case I want to revert. (In my BINGing, I discovered people who did revert from Win 8.1 &amp; then repeated the upgrade - got an additional unnamed&nbsp;WINRETOOLS each time. The old ones were never deleted or reused.&nbsp;Looks like that would happen again with
 Win 10.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe space for my 471 MB unnamed WINRETOOLS was taken from the end of C:, &amp; the 471 MB partition was situated between the shortened C: &amp; my Dell factory system image (PBR Image of 8 GB). Finally, I've realized DiskPart list partition shows the&nbsp;actual
 order of my partitions on the SSD. I didn't at first see those offsets are in order lowest to highest. Seeing the offsets in bytes using DiskPart detail disk (as Singh instructed - but I had a set of them from Win 8.1) this time finally sunk it in. DiskPart
 list volume puts names on some, which can be matched to the partitions by sizes. I also see names in Seagate's DiscWizard, which can be matched by position...</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>So, what are these partitions? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Partition 1:&nbsp; 500 MB. Label is&nbsp;ESP. Status is&nbsp;EFI System Partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Need it be this big? What is it for?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partition 2:&nbsp; 40 MB. Label is&nbsp;Diags says DiscWizard. Status is Primary Partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this from MS or from Dell, i.e., is it Dell's WINRETOOLS? Dell's BIOS diagnostics?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partition 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&gt; 128 MB. Label not shown. Status not shown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&gt; This shows up <em>only </em>in DiskPart. Type is Reserved &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&nbsp; What is this?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partition 4:&nbsp; 750 MB. Label is WINRETOOLS. Status is Recovery Partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;do believe this belonged to Win 8.1 &amp; is now not active. Needed it be this big?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would it reactivate were I to revert to Win 8.1? Or does revert create a new one too?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe (from AOMEI) that my Dell has its own WINRETOOLS somewhere else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would Dell want this around -&nbsp;or recreate it - should I go back to factory image?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a big, big candidate for deletion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partition 5:&nbsp; 921 GB. Label is PCR Hard. Status is Boot, Page File, Crash Dump, Primary Partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may relabel that to PCR Solid, when fully convinced I've got an SSD in here &amp; not an HHD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partition 6:&nbsp; 471 MB. No label. Status is Recovery Partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Win 10's WINRETOOLS. Shift+Restart goes here &amp; produces the Choose an Option screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partition 7:&nbsp; 8 GB. Label is PBR Image. Status is Recovery Partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my Dell factory system image. Going by AOMEI it may also contain Dell's WINRETOOLS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has the same type as my two other WINRETOOLS, so maybe so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then what is Diags - hmm, that could be my Dell BIOS diagnostic tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is another candidate for deletion. I believe it's on&nbsp;my Win 8.1 Recovery USB, anyhow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 9/4/15: The following command indeed shows Partition 6 is my active WIN 10 Recovery Partition, &amp; that Partition 7 is the Dell Factory Image...</p>

<p>Sometimes it can be a DNS issue, because some of the dashboard elements are connected to the internet, so that can be contribute to a slightly sluggish experience. If you reset the consoles and the modem and nothing has changed then it may be worth checking

<h2>            Windows 10 stuck on lock screen</h2>
                    I recently upgraded from windows 7 to windows 10 on my Acer laptop. The upgrade went fine and I was initially able to use it, but now I can't get to my desktop. When I power up, I get to the lock screen where it tells me to hit ctrl-alt-delete to unlock.
 I do that and I get a circle indicating it's loading. After a few minutes it goes back to the lock screen. The screen where it asks to choose a user to login never appears. Any help on my options for fixing this problem would be appreciated. Thank you.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to boot you computer to safe mode and check if you are able to do so. If the operating system is able to boot successfully and allows you to log on to your computer with an administrator account, entering into Windows 10 Safe Mode should be
 easy (and so would rectifying the issue). Boot the computer to Safe mode and check if it persists. Follow the steps given below to boot the computer in safe mode.
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Press
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Shift Key</span><span> and then restart your computer,
</span></li><li>
<span>Windows 10 will reboot and ask you to select an option. Choose
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Troubleshoot</span><span>.</span></li><li>
<span>Then, on the </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Troubleshoot</span><span> screen, select
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Advanced</span><span style="font-style: italic">
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">options</span><span>.</span></li><li>
<span>On the </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Advanced</span><span style="font-style: italic">
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">options</span><span> screen, choose
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Startup</span><span style="font-style: italic">
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Settings</span><span>.</span></li><li>
<span>Windows 10 notifies you that you can restart your device in order to change advanced boot options, including enabling
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Safe</span><span style="font-style: italic">
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Mode</span><span>. Press
</span><span style="font-style: italic">Restart</span><span>.</span></li><li>
<span>After Windows 10 reboots, you can choose which boot options you want enabled. To get into
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Safe</span><span style="font-style: italic">
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Mode</span><span>, you have three different options.
</span></li><li>
<span>To enable </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Safe</span><span style="font-style: italic">
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Mode</span><span> press the
</span><span style="font-style: italic">F4</span><span> key on your keyboard.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the status of the issue.</p>

Hi. This is the exact same problem I'm having with my desktop pc. I've been searching for an answer and so far haven't found one, please Microsoft help here. I managed to make a bootable usb for windows 10 but it does nothing either, I'm thinking the pc isn't
 seeing my mouse, keyboard or maybe even the usb ports. Really need a fix here.

<h2>            My Dell Inspiron 1525 wont start&#33; &#40;Vista&#41;</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron 1525 (Its old, but it worked alright for me) and a while ago it stopped working ever since then I've been using my desktop computer though it is a family computer so I have to share it with the WHOLE house so its not all that convenient.
 So today I finally got fed up and went to see if my Inspirion would work, but it didn't of course but now I actually want to try and see if any of you have ideas of how I could fix it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So basically, I start up my laptop and everything goes fine. But it goes to the screen that says "Windows Error Recovery" and below it says two options; Launch Start Up Repair (Recommended) and Start Windows Normally. Well I wanted to fix it so I selected
 Launch Start Up Repair, well it starts to load and then NOTHING just a black screen but it is still on (It didn't turn off at all) and it will sit there and sit there, wont do anything. So I thought I could try the Run Windows Normally option, so I did. No
 luck it started to load, then the black screen that is NOT turned off.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'm so confused and getting fed up of having to share the computer with everyone, its going to be even worse now because school has returned and I have projects that I need to do on the computer, and I cant finish it in time because of my family.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please someone help, I am honestly so confused.</div>

StartUp Repair often works from a Windows Vista Installation Disk or Windows <br />
Vista Repair&nbsp;Disk when it&nbsp;does not from Recovery or a Recovery Disk. If needed <br />
how to make a Windows&nbsp; Vista Repair Disk is below. A Repair Disk can be made <br />
on any computer with a CD burner&nbsp;running XP, Vista, or Window 7 as it uses no <br />
files from the Host computer.<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair from the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista <br />
disk - if you |do not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friends (they are not <br />
copy protected) or make one.&nbsp;Also your System maker will sell the physical <br />
disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />

<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Vista disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you can try System Restore from the Recovery or Vista disk.<br />

            <blockquote>I have a Dell Inspiron 1525 (Its old, but it worked alright for me) and a while ago it stopped working ever since then I've been using my desktop computer though it is a family computer so I have to share it with the WHOLE house
 so its not all that convenient. So today I finally got fed up and went to see if my Inspirion would work, but it didn't of course but now I actually want to try and see if any of you have ideas of how I could fix it.
<div><br />
<div>So basically, I start up my laptop and everything goes fine. But it goes to the screen that says "Windows Error Recovery" and below it says two options; Launch Start Up Repair (Recommended) and Start Windows Normally. Well I wanted to fix it so I selected
 Launch Start Up Repair, well it starts to load and then NOTHING just a black screen but it is still on (It didn't turn off at all) and it will sit there and sit there, wont do anything. So I thought I could try the Run Windows Normally option, so I did. No
 luck it started to load, then the black screen that is NOT turned off.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'm so confused and getting fed up of having to share the computer with everyone, its going to be even worse now because school has returned and I have projects that I need to do on the computer, and I cant finish it in time because of my family.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please someone help, I am honestly so confused.</div>

            Hi Olivia,I also have a Dell Inspiron 1525 (5-6 years old,) Mine ended up with a black screen too,I took it the repair shop,the tech'told me this is a fault that comes up when using "Hibernate".He depressed the start button for a little while and waalla
 the screen came to life. &nbsp;whether he pressed another button at the same time I do not know.(I could not see as he was using his right hand with the thumb extended.) Best of luck. &nbsp; &nbsp;Lionel.Meech-Noyes.

<h2>            PC won&#39;t wake up from Sleep Mode</h2>
                    I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.&nbsp; When I want to turn my desktop from suspension I cannot get it to work.&nbsp; I have to press the power switch and literally after some minutes turn it on again. So getting back from suspension does not work.&nbsp;

            Hello,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As per the description, I understand that you can’t wake your PC up from suspension. I will certainly help you with this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to know:</div>
<div><br />
1)&nbsp;Do you mean “SLEEP” mode by suspension?<br />
2)&nbsp;Did you make any recent changes in Hardware and Software?</div>
<div>3) What is the make and the model of your PC?</div>
<div><br />
I would also suggest you to follow the steps as mentioned:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1</strong>:</div>
<div><br />
1. Open the Control Panel.<br />
2. Click Hardware and Sound.<br />
3. Click Power options or Change power-saving settings.<br />
4. Click the Change Plan link under any of the plans to get the Edit Plan Settings window as shown below. If you wish for the computer to not go into Standby or turn off the screen select Never.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong>Update Display Adapter from Device Manager.</div>
<div><br />
•&nbsp;Press Windows key + X<br />
•&nbsp;Click Device Manager<br />
•&nbsp;Once device manager is open, select the Display adapters, right click it and click Update Driver Software.<br />
Search automatically for updated driver software - its possible Windows might have the driver software if you have not checked it yet, if its taking too long, then the next option is usually best.
<br />
Browse my computer for driver software - if there is a compatible driver and you already have the driver files, then all you need to do is point to it and Windows automatically install it for you.<br />
•&nbsp;Select Search automatically for updated driver software<br />
•&nbsp;Click Next and wait while the wizard completes the installation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<p><span>Try to run <strong><span>Power Troubleshooter</span></strong> which is built troubleshooter and you may follow the steps mentioned below to run it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press the <strong><span>Windows key</span></strong> and
<strong><span>X</span></strong> at the same time.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now click on <strong><span>Control panel</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the <strong><span>search box of Control Panel</span></strong> type
<strong><span>Troubleshooter</span></strong>, and select <strong><span>troubleshooting</span></strong> among the list.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Under <strong><span>System and Security,</span></strong> click
<strong><span>Improve power usage.</span></strong> </span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now try to run the <strong><span>troubleshooter</span></strong> and check if it helps.</span></li></ol>
