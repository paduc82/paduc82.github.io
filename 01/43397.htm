<h2>            printer prints blank pages with a line of gibberish on top randomly.</h2>
                    <p><u>original title:Windoes 7 printer error</u></p>
<p>My college just switched updated to windows 7 and soon after we are experiencing weird printing problems.
</p>
<div>We are seeing some users print jobs show up as blank pages with a line of gibberish on top. Also if the user prints 3 pages we can see hundreds of pages of gibberish.</div>
<div>This happens randomly on only one of the 5 printers we have. The printer is a few years old. We updated firmware and drivers numerous times and we still see the same issue. We have another printer, same model a few years older that is fine. We are stumped
 over here.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for all of your help.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>In my experience, the problem described most often happens if the printer is being driven by a mis-matched printer driver. The driver used is a close enough match to work OK for some functions but not others so you can see bursts of output interspersed with
 lots of garbage.</p>
<p>You mention that the problem affects one in 5. Is it the same printer each time?</p>
<p>If so, the trivial solution is to not use that one printer.</p>
<p>Assuming that you are not the network administrator, ask the admistrator or help desk for assistance (again [???}).</p>
<p>The printers really do need Windows7 drivers. Vista drivers are usually OK in a pinch. Virtually all XP and earlier are hopeless. Of course, the drivers much match the bitness for the OS. 32 bit drivers for 32 bit systems, 64....</p>

            <p>Hi...sounds like you got the Anniversary upgrade to 14393...I wish I got it.</p>
<p>You will notice some nice changes to the start menu.</p>
<p>In the future set your Windows updates to '<strong>Notify to Download</strong>'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rather than '<strong>Automatic</strong>'...which I am sure you have.&nbsp;&nbsp; and
<em>that</em> is why you received the upgrade with out a notification....</p>
<p>Nothing you can do as far as what happened....yes there may be a 'Windows OLD' folder like Lawrence said...hopefully you can retrieve those programs and re-install them...to see them:</p>
<p>Path:&gt; 'This PC'&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; select your drive C &nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows.OLD&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

    <title>XBox Live disconnecting in the middle of play. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zibberroo  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox Live disconnecting in the middle of play.</h2>
                    
<p>XBox live will connect with no issue, and I will being to play. I have no internet issues and even contacted my ISP which tested my connection and said everything was fine. I did this because, in the middle of playing the XBox Live will drop off giving me
 a warning that nothing will be saved. I lose all that was needed to start the game and achievements during play. This is disconcerting since the only way to retrieve more of this is through playing online uninterrupted or with real money. This problem is new
 since the new year, but has been occurring often since. I did a network test after a disconnect and it would only fail at the XBox Live check. In about a minute after the disconnect, the connection is restored as if nothing was wrong.</p>

<p>Hey Jolly, sorry to hear about the issues with staying connected to LIVE! Okay, two things here. First, can you please tell us the exact error message you're getting while playing online (and if it's only with one game, what game is that)? Secondly, can
 you please try resetting your network hardware? You can reset your modem and router by unplugging power to both for about 15 seconds. When restoring power, plug the modem in first, and then wait for all of the lights on the modem to come up. When those are
 all active, plug in the router. Once those lights are flashing normally, go ahead and run a LIVE connection test on the console.

<p>Ok, so this has been happening to me for about a year now. I can play on Xbox Live with my friends perfectly ( No Lag, no issues) but at about 8:03 PM or somewhere around that time, my xbox just disconnects me. And when I go and do the xbox live connection
 test, it tells me "your dns server can't resolve the xbox live server names" (that happends when my xbox is using Manual network settings) and if I change them to Automatic it just tells me that my xbox can't acces the internet. ( but my computer is running
 perfectly so it's obviously not my internet). The Status Report is this: </p>
<p>W:0000-000B&nbsp; </p>
<p>X:0000-F001 </p>
<p>Y:0000-0000 </p>

<h2>            microsoft visual c&#43;&#43; runtime library error abnormal program termination</h2>
                    Hi I'm running WinXP Service Pack 3 and use a program called ProVenture Invoices and Estimates. I've been using this program successfully under Windows XP for years and just yesterday began getting this Microsoft Visual C++ run time library error abnormal
 program termination error message when trying to open this application. I am assuming this was caused by a Windows update as nothing else has been installed or uninstalled on this PC. I've used the system restore feature to restore the system to an earlier
 time, but this does not correct the problem. I also have tried both the Win95 and Win98 compatibility mode options on this problem with no effect. The company that created this program appears to be defunct, so I cannot contact their tech support. Any help
 would be greatly appreciated. <br />

                    <p>I installed Windows 10 (upgraded from Windows 7) on an iMac using Parallels to run Windows 10. I now have a new MacBook Pro and need to install Windows 10 on this machine. The migration assistant did not transfer Window 10 from the iMac to the MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>I do not want to use bootcamp because I cannot run both the Mac OS and Windows 10 at the same time as I can with Parallels.</p>
<p>Nor do I want to buy a new copy of Windows 10. What are my alternatives?</p>

                    <p>Hello to anyone reading this I am having a bit of an issue trying to find a portable wifi system (modem)&nbsp;&nbsp;I can take with me on the road and have my Xbox connect to it. I work away from home alot and hotels do not offer very good WiFi.&nbsp;is there anything out there anyone is using that works really when traveling. It would be nice to be able to play online. Also using my phone for a hotspot is sadly not a option.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> daniel tamsky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing unused user accounts</h2>
                    <p>I created an extra account on my computer to help solve a Windows 10 problem, on the advice of someone at MS or in the MS Community. The problem is gone, but the extra account remains. We didn't discuss how to delete the account, but it appears in File Manager
 but not under User Accounts on Control Panel. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only account listed under User Accounts has my name and has Administrator rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I remove the other account that appears in File Manager? I don't think it has any files that I want to save.</p>

<br />
<br />2. In the User Accounts window so appeared, on Users tab, under Users for this computer, select/highlight your user account you want delete and hit Remove.
<br />
<br />3. Click Yes on following confirmation prompt and remove the selected user account permanently. The associated user data will also be deleted for ever. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this works!

<br />Also, when you say "but it appears in File Manager " you mean the folder is in C:/Users/  foldeR?

<p>That looks like an unnecessary user account to me. It really should show up in NetPlWiz. Have a look at it in a Command Prompt. Then take ownership of it, &amp; it may delete.

<p>That's a puzzle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) What did the DIR command do?</p>
<p>(2) Did you try the RD command anyway? Maybe try it with a /Q at the end to prevent a slew of confirmations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(3) You can try it in the Recovery Environment where Takeown may be unnecessary...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(a) Hold <strong>Shift</strong>, &amp; click <strong>Restart</strong> to reboot to the Recovery Environment at the "Choose an Option" screen.</p>
<p>(b) Click "<strong>Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Command Prompt</strong>".</p>
<p>(c) Enter...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>DIR&nbsp; C:\</strong>&nbsp;<strong> /a</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;&lt;Should list Users as one folder.
<span>If not, try other letters.</span></p>

<p><strong>DIR&nbsp; C:\Users\Test&nbsp; /a&nbsp; /s &nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&lt;&lt;Does this show its contents?</p>
<p><strong>RD &nbsp; C:\Users\Test&nbsp; /S &nbsp; </strong>&lt;&lt;Deletes it recursively. Maybe add a
<strong>/Q</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(d) <strong>Close </strong>the Command prompt, &amp; click <strong>Continue </strong>
to get back to Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Edit</strong></span>: Maybe it's just that the Takeown command needs a full path specified...</p>

<h2>            PES Files that converted to PDF files that Adobe won&#39;t open</h2>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; I need to know how to convert my embroidery&nbsp; files back to PES files. &nbsp; I do not know how this conversion happened, but I definitely need help getting them converted back.&nbsp; Adobe Acrobat will not open them. &nbsp; I have Windows 10. &nbsp; There was support
 for Windows 7 with the same issue, but that isn't working for my Windows 10.

            Hi, Nancy,
<br />
<br />Upload your existing PDF file to a free conversion website and convert it into an image file. PNG files maintain the best image quality but these files are acceptable - jpg, jpeg, bmp
<br />
<br />Save the images to your computer
<br />
<br />Open PE Design Center &gt; Design Center
<br />
<br />Open the Image file you saved by going to File &gt; Input from a File
<br />
<br />Select up to 5 colors to convert into black outlines. 
<br />Change Line thickness if necessary 
<br />Unselected colors are converted to white
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Modify stitch length if not to your liking
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Modify thread colors, stitch types and any other formatting choices until the embroidery design is to your liking.
<br />
<br />Save the design as a PES file &gt; Select File &gt; Write to Card &gt; Other &gt; PES files

            Hi Nancy
<br />
<br />Rest assured your files have not converted to Acrobat files, your Pes files are fine and the embroidery designs are intact . . .
<br />
<br />What has happened is Windows does not know how to open embroidery files and is trying to open those files in acrobat
<br />
<br />Open the Embroidery program you use and from there try opening a Pes file, it should open without any problem.
<br />
<br />If you cannot open a Pes File form inside that program, please let me know . . .

    <title>How to wake from Hibernate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marydavey  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to wake from Hibernate</h2>
                    <p>I managed to re-enable hibernate after upgrading to Windows 10, however:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It didn't wake on mouse movement although the mouse had remained powered.</p>
<p>It didn't wake on keyboard - the method I usually use.</p>
<p>It didn't wake on LAN, I didn't power down the router.</p>
<p>It didn't even wake on power button, not for a short press and not for a long press.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only method that worked was to drop power externally - fortunately this is a desktop or I would have had to extract the battery - reconnect power and start with the power button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm fine with technical answers, including Registry hacks.</p>

            <p>I too have seen spurious wake on Sleep and wake on Hibernate in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So just to give the braintrust some additional places to look during the brainstorming phase of diagnosis, note this link:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/955262/windows-10-waking-from-sleep-with-unknown-reason" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 waking from sleep with unknown reason</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That forum thread points to two possible causes:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1) Windows Update has some new capabilities? that allow it to wake the system even from hibernate in order to accomplish the final phase of an update which requires a reboot (done by default in many cases at 3:30am)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2)TeamViewer is generating some spurious wake commands. (I have TeamViewer installed on the systems experiencing this so that is a very real possibility for me).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I hope this helps point people in the right direction to confirm or deny these two causes. #2 is looking most likely in my case (4 systems affected).</p>

            I am not aware of TeamViewer, so that is not relevant to my experience.<br />
<br />
I've changed the Update/Restart option to "Notify to schedule restart" but it still seems to restart automatically at 03:30. &nbsp;Perhaps it wakes the computer at 03:25 and shows a warning like "Restarting in 5 minutes unless you wake up and cancel".

            <p>I have found the following fix on an independent forum:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From the Start button type 'Task Scheduler' and click on the name in the results to open the tool. In the left hand pane open 'Task Scheduler Library'
 by clicking on the little arrow head. Open 'Microsoft' then 'Windows' the same way. Scroll down to find 'UpdateOrchestrator' and click once to highlight it. Then, in the upper pane in the middle and right click on the name 'Reboot'. From the right click menu
 select 'Properties'. Open the 'Conditions' tab and clear the tick from 'Wake the computer to run this task'.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have just done this so I don't know if it will solve the problem entirely.</span></p>

            Hi ChinatownChang
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera &gt; Make sure following 
<br />Allow access to this camera on this device is set to ON 
<br />Allow apps to access your camera is set to ON 
<br />Also down below Choose apps that can use your camera is ON for appropriate apps
<br />
<br />Let's execute following steps for this problem if above doesn't solve your problem. Please update me once done.
<br />
<br />1. Use the Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &amp; Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter &amp; follow on-screen directions &gt; Restart the computer after troubleshooting is completed
<br />
<br />2. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to invoke Task Manager &gt; Go to the “Processes” tab &gt; See which programs are currently running in the background of the system and     If you found an app that uses Camera, end that program
<br />
<br />3. Switch Off your Antivirus temporarily and check. Switch On antivirus when testing is over.
<br />
<br />4. Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices
<br />Locate your Webcam
<br />Right click &gt; Roll Back
<br />If Roll back doesn't work - Right click &gt; Update Driver

            Hi Mahendra,
<div>1. Did you make any changes prior to this issue? <br />
2. What is the IP address of the printer?<br />
3. Is the printer configured to obtain its IP address from a DHCP server or is it set to a static IP address?<br />
<div>Please try the following methods&nbsp;:</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method I</strong>: I would suggest you to delete the existing printer and add the printer using the “Add print wizard”.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Visit the link below that talks about how to remove a printer and to install a network printer.<br />
<br />
Install a printer<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Install-a-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Install-a-printer</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Right click on (Network) Printer , choose Properties , go to Ports tab, choose Configure Port , then uncheck the SNMP Status Enable option
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method II:</strong></div>
<div>I would also suggest you to uninstall the software and drivers, then reboot the system and reinstall the latest drivers for the printer from the manufacturer’s site.<br />
<br />
Refer this link: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a><br />
<br />
a. Reboot your computer.<br />
b. Turn on Network Discovery.<br />
c. Turn on File and printer sharing.<br />
<br />
If your computer is connected to a network, network policy settings might prevent you from completing these steps.<br />
<br />
By default, Windows Firewall blocks network discovery (formerly called UPnP technology), but you can enable it.<br />
<br />
1. Open Network and Sharing Center by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Network and Internet, and then clicking Network and<br />
Sharing Center.<br />
<div><br />
2. If network discovery is off, click the arrow button Picture of the arrow button‌ to expand the section.<br />
<div><br />
3. Click Turn on network discovery, and then click Apply. Administrator permission required If you are prompted for an administrator password or<br />
confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />

            <p>Hey there!</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks for posting!&nbsp;Just wanted to hop in and suggest a couple steps to try, but you may want to report in-game issues such as this to the developer just in case they have any specific information. After a little research, do you happen to be playing with a custom 3rd party Xbox One controller or an&nbsp;Xbox Elite Controller?&nbsp;Swapping buttons seems to cause similar issues for others, and playing&nbsp;with a default set-up may help out with that.&nbsp;If that doesn't apply to you, checking in with developer will be the next best step.</p><p><br /></p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

    <title>Stuck on Please Wait after booting Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> austephner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stuck on Please Wait after booting Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've been having a lot of issues with Win10 starting as of last week. I centered them in on my wireless USB wifi adapter. Plugging it in caused Win10 to completely shutdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then mostly my issues I've been seeing are with booting and applications / Explorer randomly freezing. I tried doing a system reset but it was stuck on 40% for almost two whole days (ended up canceling it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a system restore yesterday and after booting I get nothing but a gray screen that says "Please Wait". I just tried rebooting earlier today and the same thing has been going on. I haven't touched it since then and it hasn't moved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't even get to the login or welcome screen. Anyone have any ideas what I should do about this?</p>
<p />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;Start computer in safe mode and then perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a. When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong>Shift key</strong> when clicking the <strong>Restart button.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. The next screen will present you with three options. Click <strong>
Troubleshoot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>c. Next, hit <strong>Advanced</strong> options followed by <strong>Windows Startup Settings</strong> from the next screen.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>F4 for Safe Mode </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>For more information you may refer to the article mentioned below.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>Windows Startup Settings (including
 safe mode)</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>

    <title>One or more audio service isn&#39;t running - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> holotaku  say:</h3>
<h2>            One or more audio service isn&#39;t running</h2>
                    <p><em>Original title: Not sure if this is the right topic, but I've got a couple strange problems that I think fit here.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently got a new laptop and up until now it has been working great. However, upon starting up today I noticed this:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/543c6945-66e7-41d0-9679-0bfebee25cd8" /><br />
For whatever reason, my audio isn't working. Right clicking it opens a "Detecting Problems" page that results in this:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5ab87e8-60c0-47f8-9668-74d643f1d907" height="332" width="442" /><br />
The obvious solution would be to press the "Explore additional options" button, and so I did, but that just brings me here:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/593f3a04-f0f2-4a09-8286-224059e9ce1a" height="269" width="490" /><br />
This page is completely unresponsive. I can't close it, move it, or anything. It doesn't even come up saying that the page is unresponsive, it's just completely frozen. It's also worth mentioning that opening the "Control Panel" results in the same thing.<br />
At this point I decided to take to the internet. I found and attempted some suggestions for problems similar to mine, but none of them worked. I attempted a clean boot by disabling all non-Windows services in msconfig and disabling all startup programs in the
 Task Manager, but it didn't help at all.<br />
My third and final problem is this: After all else had failed, I decided to try running "sfc /scannow" in the Command Prompt as an administrator. Unfortunately, attempting that just results in this:
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0dd2bab-6a91-48be-bb65-2f4ffc945b22" height="359" width="551" /><br />
Nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me with this string of problems?<br />

<h2>            Borderlands question</h2>
                    
<p>Whatsup guys, just a quick question. Me and two friends are picking up Borderlands to play the campain in coop. I was just wondering. If I choose a character in my singleplayer game and my friend happens to have chosen the same character, can we still both
 play as that character in a coop game? Or would one of us be forced to choose an alternate character? Thanx !</p>

<p>You can both play as the same character, there's no limit on how many of the same character there can be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also watch out for people using modded weapons. If a guy comes into your lobby and starts 1 hitting everything or his pistol is spraying grenades, it's a modded weapon and you should kick him immediately, they ruin the fun very quickly and there are a lot
 of them. That was the main reason I stopped playing Borderlands.</p>

<p>We plan to play the campain just the 3 of us in a private coop (if that's possible) so cheaters shouldn't be a problem. Thanx for the heads up man..</p>

<p>Me and a &nbsp;friend were farming MINAC to get the last collectible achievement when a random modder dropped into the game because I &nbsp;forgot to set it as private. When he capped MInac he started challenging us to deuls. His modded sheild was over 10,000 and
 he stomped my friend, butwhen he tried me he went down to one shot from my sniper as I had maxed out my Bypass shields skill. I'm sure he freaked out over that.</p>

<p><i><span>That is not entirely true. If a high level character goes into a low level characters game then his/her weapons would do more damage because they are stronger. It doesn't always
 denote a modded weapon. </span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span>OP here is a link to help you determine what weapons are legit and what are modded should you trade weapons with other players.
