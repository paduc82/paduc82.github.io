<h2>            Account reset&#63; Gamertag gone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p><p>I had some problems running far cry 5. The game simply didn't start. So I tried the support steps until step 10 for Xbox reset. I picked reset with keeping my scores and games. After the reset I had to log in again. I entered my email account and afterwards my Gamertag suddenly changed. Now every score is gone and I am logged in with my former email address but with a new Gamertag. Can anyone help me getting this right the way they should? Is there any chance I can get back my scores?&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you!&nbsp;</p><p>BR M</p>

    <title>Updating widows 10 using a SD card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james millsxo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updating widows 10 using a SD card</h2>
                    I had recently went to micro center and got a 128 GB SD card to be able to update windows 10. When I had plugged it in and tried to update windows I can not find out how to use the SD card instead of the 32 GB internal flash thing(I know it is not a SSD
 or a HDD and that it is soldered on to my motherboard so I could not upgrade it like my original plan). So am asking if it is possible to use the SD card to update windows 10 and/or if there is a way that I can put all of my files on the SD card instead of
 internal storage and still use them normally.&nbsp;

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating Windows 10 surely needs extra space for the update to be downloaded and installed properly. However, using an external storage to update your operating system wouldn't be applicable. The update would be applied to the storage that the operating
 system is currently installed. You may use your SD card in transferring your files to free up some space on your hard drive. If you are having issues in updating due to low storage, it would be best to transfer some of your files to your SD card to free up
 some space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps and if you have any other questions, don't hesitate to post back.</p>

            <p>Hi Vince, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These errors occur maybe due to Volume Shadow Copy and Backup service being stopped.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform steps mentioned below and see if it helps. </p>
<p><strong>a:</strong> Type <strong>Services.msc</strong> in the start search box and hit enter.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Now look for services called</p>
<p><strong>Volume Shadow Copy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Backup</strong></p>
<p><strong>c:</strong> Make sure the services are started and set to automatic.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: Click <strong>Apply</strong> and then <strong>ok.</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a Nice Day!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply if you have any questions. </p>

            I opened Backup/Restore through the Control panel and started Do Backup Now.&nbsp; It runs for some time - 30 minutes at least - and then ends with the error code mentioned.&nbsp; What does an error 0x8007010b mean?&nbsp; I can't find any place that tells what the error
 code means.&nbsp; If I knew what the error means, I might be able to figure out what is wrong and fix it.<br />

            <p>Hi Vince, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you done a Task Scheduler for the Windows Backup Process? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error code<strong> 0x8007010B </strong>usually is associated with Task Scheduler function.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When setting up a scheduled task under Windows 7 , if you dont specify the correct value in the “run in” field, you will receive an return error code of 0x8007010B when trying to run the job. The error being directory name is invalid.
</p>

            In order to setup automatic backup, I went to the Control Panel and set it up there.&nbsp; I defined the backup destination and the times to run.&nbsp; Does this set it up as a scheduled task?&nbsp; If not then how do I change it to specify this?&nbsp; Where do I specify
 the "run in" field?&nbsp; This is usually associated with icons on the desktop.&nbsp; I have tried to start the backup manually through Control Panel -&gt; Backup/Recovery.&nbsp; It runs for a while (at least 30 minutes) and then fails.&nbsp; What you have said does not make sense
 nor seem like something I can do.<br />

<h2>            Black screen</h2>
                    I haď an identity theft issue with my surface pro 3 and I found the program they used to hack into my system but was unable to delete it. I took the laptop which was less than 1 year old and hardly used to the store and their technical team and asked them
 to format back to factory defaults. They had me power up, boot up and log in. There was never any hardware issue and I was able to locate the hack pgm. All I wanted was to rid my system of any other hacks. They removed the keyboard and power cord and said
 they would call when the laptop was ready. They called the next day and said the laptop had a black screen and they couldn't fix it. I now have a nearly unused laptop that is useless. I tried holding down the power and volume buttons for the proscribed time
 but no go. Is my laptop terminally dead or is there something else I can do?&nbsp;

<h3> rhenntaguiam  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t uninstall Windows Live Essentials &#40;2012&#41;</h2>
                    Well, a few weeks back, I updated my Windows Live Essentials from 2011 to the latest one (2012), and I got Movie Maker in it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I tried to open Movie Maker, it wouldn't open, and it says my graphics card is incompatible. So I decided to uninstall Movie Maker and get the one I had before the upgrade. When I searched on how to uninstall Movie Maker, it says I have to uninstall
 Live Essentials. Since it's not in the Programs List, I figured I have to delete Live Essentials manually. I went to Computer, went to Program Files, and I deleted the Windows Live folder.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I downloaded and tried installing the 2011 version of Live Essentials, it told me I still have the latest one installed and I have to delete it. But all the ways I searched on how to delete it fully must have the 2012 version installed (that which
 folder I deleted a while ago).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I decided to install Windows Live Essentials 2012 again. I thought that would give me all the programs I deleted back, but it only gave me the Writer. Now, when I try to install Live Essentials 2012 again, I can't, because it tells me I have it installed
 already.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to uninstall Windows Live Essentials if I've deleted the core folder?</div>
<div>Or</div>
<div>Is thee a way to install Windows Live Essentials programs if it still says I have the latest ones installed even though I don't?</div>
                </div>

<p>This question falls a bit outside the usual questions handled here, where we support folks who are having problems installing and activating Windows 7. I would seek out the IT Pro forums on the TechNet section of Microsoft, or the MSDN forums for the server
 gurus, and ask them for assistance.</p>

    <title>Win10 Fonts are oversized and bold in several applications&#39; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> turnip_879  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 Fonts are oversized and bold in several applications&#39; configuration screens</h2>
                    <div>After fresh installation of Windows 10 I started experiencing font issue with two of my applications (not all).<br />
Configuration menus, such as options-&gt;configure, or edit-&gt;configure show font that stretches past the visible<br />
edge of the configuration window. It is also bold. However, the rest of the fonts appear normal. I have attached<br />
two screenshots to illustrate. </div>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>So far I have tried the following to resolve<br />
1. Reset the fonts under control panel -&gt;appearance-&gt;Restore default font settings<br />
2. Used 3rd party FontReg.exe application to re-register the fonts<br />
3. Change scale and layout under Display configuration, and also Advanced scalings with 'let windows try fix apps so that they arent blury'<br />
4. Tried to change the applications compatibility, DPI scaling settings (I didnt have to do this before reinstallation, both apps just worked).<br />
5. Made sure that cleartype is enabled<br />
6. Reinstalled applications into different folders in order to re-create registry entries.<br />
7. Can't revent to previous restore point as system is new and none exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the entire configuration screen. as you can see part of the text is off-screen and text is
<strong>BOLD</strong></p>

            Hi turnip_879
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Though your installation is new, I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>thatnks for the suggestion. I tried it and no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess another avenue to try is to figure out what fonts and /or font setting an application is using. How would I got about doing that?</p>

<h3> serendipme  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 upgrade has given me robot sound</h2>
                    <p>upgraded to window 10 from win 7 on Toshiba satellite. sound on win 7 was perfect and&nbsp;is now&nbsp;on and off like a robot and distorted/buzz and then&nbsp;stops working completely&nbsp;until I close and reopen whatever program I was using (ie windows movie maker and audacity
 plus&nbsp;youtube&nbsp;so far--upgrade was only a week or so ago, so haven't used it much).&nbsp;seems to be in playback only--I think mic is fine so far...although it does seem to be a progressive problem.... also it is in both speakers and headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;tried updating drivers through windows, and used your&nbsp;trouble shooter a few times. generic driver gave me no sound at all. suspect the sound&nbsp;driver for my amd c-50, I ghz dual core&nbsp;processor&nbsp;needs to be upgraded&nbsp; by whatever tech gods create it? did the
 Microsoft gods not work with the other tech gods to get all their drivers in a row before rolling out win 10 upgrades? looks like lots of folks are having sound issues, but none I read seem exactly like me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>so the driver that is giving me some sound if problematicly so, is <strong>Conexant smartaudio hd</strong>. I did turn off enhancements and tried to manually check for updates,&nbsp;as&nbsp;Microsoft sound fix page says,&nbsp;but no joy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>i need to make our&nbsp;2015 project for awesome vid&nbsp;for my volunteer gig&nbsp;before next Friday and thought upgrading would make that easier....my bad I guess. I checked the specs and my comp&nbsp;was within the upgrade parameters&nbsp;so&nbsp;I thought this was a stable upgrade
 release that would make things work better. if&nbsp;the Microsoft gods&nbsp;can fix the bug or sort the issue soon that would be amazing.&nbsp; or of any other users have a fix? it's making it really hard to do the vid. already spent twice as much time on it as I planned
 and i'm nowhere near done....ack!</p>
<p>
</p><p>help!</p>

<p>Hi Seren,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are facing sound issues on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the device settings are incorrect, corrupted or incompatible drivers or due to hardware problems.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Most Audio interfaces require driver software to work properly. If you recently upgraded from one version of Windows to another, power outages, viruses, or other computer problems, it's possible that the drivers have become corrupted. Downloading and installing
 the latest driver can resolve these types of problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <strong>manufacturer's website </strong>and install latest available drivers. If you don’t get the driver that is compatible for Windows 10, you can download the driver that is compatible with Windows 8.1 and can make it run in Windows 10 with Compatibility
 mode. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A compatibility mode is a software mechanism in which a software either emulates an older version of software in order to allow incompatible software or files to remain compatible with the computer's newer hardware or software.

            <p>hi kumar</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your prompt reply =) I&nbsp;really appreciate that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I had already tried up update via device manager repeatedly to no avail. did follow your prompt and did download their
 know it says it's a basic tutorial but not for newbs for sure. i'm a geekling and had to try it a few times). fyi all those drivers are from 2013. there is a
<p>
</p><p>anyhoo, for the moment, not roboty, but the sound does disappear a few minutes into youtube vids. so what now? is there some other driver compatibility affecting things? if&nbsp;sound driver&nbsp;is corrupted&nbsp;did&nbsp;the new download replace the old? do I need to do an
 uninstall/reinstall? was afraid to do that in case I made things worse....</p>
<p>
</p><p>thoughts? suggestions?</p>
<p>*bangs head softly against computer* </p>
<p>=P</p>
<p>
</p><p>added info-- using it for a few hours and sound is&nbsp;dropping so much I am having to get a friend edit the audio&nbsp;for my volunteer p4a vid&nbsp;for it won't stay on long enough for me to do so. seems to have recorded ok for the most part, but the sound just wont'
 stay on for any real length of time. most of my friends are afraid to upgrade to win 10 because of concerns about stuff like this, and now I am not sure you will ever get them to lol.&nbsp; they're all o.o re my sound issues.

            <p>hi again kumar</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope you are still tech godding this issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>talked with three&nbsp;different chat&nbsp;tech support folks.&nbsp; as per their instructions did full uninstall reinstall with driver from Toshiba site and compatibility applied again, command prompt check sfc/scannow which said there were no integrity violations&nbsp;and
 sound&nbsp;still dropping although it seems less roboty. </p>
<p>
</p><p>have spent over 15 hours trying to fix this and am tired and cranky especially as last tech said I should contract my manufacturer re driver o.O. feel strongly that if you have a stable upgrade all that should be sorted.&nbsp;conextant is a pretty big dog for&nbsp;Microsoft
 not to have&nbsp;worked with then to make&nbsp;the drivers would work....</p>
<p>
</p><p>chat wanted to do remote access and I feel nervous about that for it says it will record the access.....that sounds worrisome.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>please advise, what is the what? why is this happening and what is to be done. if I knew&nbsp;microsoft were working with&nbsp;conextant/Toshiba/amd/whoever&nbsp;else,&nbsp;to sort it, that would at least be something...</p>

            <p>had a email to let you know this is still not resolved and after an insane amount of time with chat and phone tech support the problem got worse, ie remote access with techs somehow made it so i cannot roll back to windows 7 till you sort it. that sucks
 really bad. there are many features in windows 10 i quite like outside of automatic updates, but having these sound issues make the operating system fairly pointless to me. plus it runs a tich slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the long and short is that the conextant driver is from 2013 and operating system won't accept any of the newer ones so maybe working with conextant to make a newer more compatible one is the route to success.</p>

</p><p>yes we did that, and a full ininstall/reinstall with that. the techs did all the things.... except windows 10 reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT am wondering about bios update. with one microsoft phone tech remote accessed my comp and used an app to update bios but just poked around and i think it's still an old one. so maybe needs to be done manually.&nbsp; he said old bios can affect things like
 sound. </p>
<p>
</p><p>still seem to have 1.60 when there seems to be a 1.80 for my comp http://support.toshiba.com/support/modelHome?freeText=3025135</p>
<p>
</p><p>is this a good bios update how to? https://aps2.toshiba-tro.de/kb0/HTD9502M10000R01.htm#</p>
<p>two concerns</p>
<p>*it doesn't say for window 10 although to be fair was posted&nbsp; before win 10 came out. do you have a better bios update for toshiba in win 10?</p>
*so many forum threads saying they bricked their computer doing a bios update wrong o.o
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>also this forum thread says setting boot to normal speed helped bios nightmares they were having.
</p>
<p>http://forums.toshiba.com/t5/General-Troubleshooting/3-10-BIOS-Update-for-Satellite-Pro/m-p/285057/highlight/true#M40138</p>
<p>is this the same way to do it in win 10? is normal speed a good idea for bios update</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BIOS is a program built into personal computers that starts the operating system when you turn on your computer. It is also referred to as system firmware.
<strong>BIOS is part of your computer's hardware and is separate from Windows</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Updating of the BIOS </strong>depends on the BIOS manufacturer. If you think you need to update your BIOS, check the information that came with your computer or go to the computer manufacturer's website.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Disclaimer:</span></p>
</strong>
<p>Be careful when changing BIOS settings. The BIOS interface is designed for advanced users, and it's possible to change a setting that could prevent your computer from starting correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating BIOS should only be done if necessary (to solve a compatibility problem, for example). It can be a complicated process, and if an error occurs, your computer could be rendered inoperable. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions exactly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you face any issues on Windows in future. We will be glad to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

 i was told by that update notice my computer is compatible, but having an upgrade that can't deal with my bios isn't a compatible upgrade in my book, considering that a bios upgrade is so dangerous....</p>

<h3> perkins.t  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to add a Path in Environment Variables in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a program I like to run from command from any directory called xl.exe. In Win 7 and 8 I was able to add a path to environmental variables by putting ;C:\xl at the end of 'Path'. I tried this with Windows 10, but when attempting to run the program
 I get the error "'xl' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file." I need to go all the way back to c: to run the program, which is inconvenient because the files I want to work with are not on c:.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried putting C:\xl at the beginning of the list, the middle of the list, and the end of the list.&nbsp;I have changed the name of the program (in case it was too short? I know, that's dumb...) I have tried it with and without the .exe. I have tried making
 a folder so that the program is not&nbsp;directly on the c: drive, in case that is somehow causing the confusion. I have tried all of these things under both user variables and system variables. I have restarted my computer between every attempt. What am I doing
 wrong?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Marrko,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this how you verified that Chrome is not in your Startup?</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Task Manager </strong>by right-clicking on the Taskbar, or using the
<strong>CTRL + SHIFT + ESC</strong> shortcut key.</p>
<p>2. Then clicking “<strong>More Details</strong>,” switching to the Startup tab, and then using the<strong> Disable button
</strong>to disable Chrome browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that didn't help, we suggest you perform a clean boot. For a detailed instruction, kindly refer to the article below.</p>

            I still use windows XP Service pack 3 on a EMachine desk top computer that is 9 years old and has never had any updates, as I have them turned off. I recently bought a new lap top with Windows 10. I have the same problem with Chrome. I'm very disappointed
 with the way Microsoft forces updates that are not needed, my computer was fine until a recent update. I have restored my computer from the beginning and turned off windows updates for my windows 10 lap top, and I have not had a issue so far with Chrome opening
 on start up. As I said, windows updates are not needed, I have proof with a 9 year old desk top running Windows XP SP3 that I use more than the lap top with windows 10. But of coarse there is a lot more you can do with windows 10 and that is why I had to get
 something that is compatible with the new age. Still, I wish XP was compatible with most of our new technology.

<p>Maybe I found a solution. Open Chrome (oh it's already open...&nbsp; ;-) </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to settings for Chrome</li><li>Click Advanced, so more settings appear. (It's on the bottom of the Settings page, that you just opened)</li><li>In the second last group of Settings it says :"Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed"</li><li>I turned that setting off - and since then Chrome doesn't start up during Windows startup.</li></ol>
<p>(I do not recall ever having turned this setting on, perhaps it happened during an update of Chrome I never was aware of)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did it work for you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- Ok, there was another problem too, for the original poster: Chrome going to support.microsoft.com on startup. Change the "On Startup" setting to for example "Open the new tab page" - this is the last setting just before the "Advanced" section in Chromes
 settings.</p>

<h2>            How to exit Safe mode</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to exit Safe mode if password was forgotten?</p>
<p>I entered mode without network. Done many things to reset password using cmd and registry from bootable USB, but without result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Left Dart to use, but I need a big USB to save files.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also changed account password, but it didn't worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's urgent. I'm a student, and need to work on notebook before Monday</p>
<p>

            Hi, Anna
<br />
<br />My name is Mays and I am an Independent Consultant. I would love to help you today.
<br />
<br />To exit Safe Mode, open the System Configuration tool by opening the Run command (keyboard shortcut: Windows key + R) and typing msconfig then Ok. 2. Tap or click the Boot tab, uncheck the Safe boot box, hit Apply, and then Ok. Restarting your machine will exit Safe mode.

            Your reply didn’t appear so I don’t know whether you can try my suggestion.
<br />If you do not have the installation media you need to use another PC to download the media creation tool &amp; choose to create media for another PC - you’ll also need a 8-16GB USB drive.

            If you typed the strings please note the space between boded it &amp; /deletevalue &amp; current/default &amp; safeboot. Often an error is due to missing the space when running the cmd.

<p>hi all</p>

<p>looking to buy this game used, been looking on ebay, but wondered if the 'DLC' comes as a code that has most probably already been used or if all the extras that the ultimate box brings is already included on the disc?</p>

<p>thanks</p>

<p>oh ok, so is there any point buying a used copy of the ultimate box then, should i just buy the standard version as it sounds like ill get the same 'content/extras' as i would if i bought the ultimate box, but what you are saying is with the ultimate box
 those extras are on the disc already and with the standard version the extras come as a free 1gb update is that right? thanks</p>

<p>The 'extras' are what is part of the free 1.3gb update you get from Live if you buy the regular version, just now included on the disc.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>What I posted above covers it. All the Ultimate Box does is prevent you from having to download 1.3gb, which may be useful if your internet connection has a bandwidth limit.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>As to whether you should buy the regular or the Ultimate version of the game that would depend on the price difference between the two in my opinion.</p>

<p>ok thanks very much voteDC for clarifying things, the standard version seems to be coming out cheaper on ebay and new too obviously and my internet is easily up to the job of downloading a 1.3gb update so i guess standard version it is. thanks again very
 much</p>

    <title>Unable to burn CD or run Itunes Diagnostics - Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to burn CD or run Itunes Diagnostics - Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
It seems this is a popular problem across the net and believe me when i say i have done my research and tried all the possible solutions that are on the Internet. I am desperate.<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 Ultimate on a 32-Bit system after upgrading from Vista over a year ago. My CD/DVD Drive is a Mashita UJ-875S ATA and is still capable of ripping CD's and DVD's as well as playing them. It is burning to disc which is my issue.<br />
<br />
I have burned numerous CD's in the past but have not needed to do so for a long time until last week. Upon trying to do this in Windows Media Player (I always use WMP to burn &amp; rip) it became apparent that the drive was unable to write music/data onto a blank
 disc. The drive was able to recognise a blank disc and offer me the usual autoplay options. I received no error codes in WMP, just a quick whirring an attempt to burn and then the CD ejects. I do get a message saying an error was encountered. I thought this
 was a WMP issue so i opened Itunes to try and burn...slightly different problem whereby i was told there was no drive (error 4900 also came up). I downloaded a 3rd party software (CD Burner XP) and still i was unable to burn.<br />
<br />
Here are the things i have tried to remedy the problem.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Checked for driver updates</li><li>Reinstalled CD/DVD Drive</li><li>Run a CHKDSK upon start up</li><li>Defragemented my drives</li><li>Deleted the upper/lower filter and all Gear4 Drivers from my registry (GEARAspiWDM) as per the numerous articles on the Internet</li><li>Uninstalled &amp; Reinstalled itunes and all apple components</li><li>Run Microsoft Mr. FixIt tool for CD/DVD problems</li><li>Removed Magic DVD ripper from my PC in case of conflicts with drive</li><li>Removed all other 3rd party CD software that was present (CD Burner XP)</li><li>Tried different blank CD-R's &amp; CD-RW</li><li>Tried burning at lower speeds</li></ul>
I guess the problem i'm having is i don't know when the problem started given that i haevn't needed to burn a CD in months. Interestingly somewhere in the midst of all these remedies i was able to burn 2 tracks onto a CD and play them on a CD player. Thinking
 i'd cracked it i immediately tried another burn but it failed and i was back to square one.<br />
<br />
I have also attempted to run iTunes diagnostics but it crashes everytime i press next. Now i have edited my registry for the upper and lower filters i recive the message "<span style="font-style: italic">the registry settings used by the iTunes drivers for importing
 and burning CD's and DVD's are missing. This can happen as a result of installing other CD-Burning software. Please reinstall iTunes"</span>
<br />
<br />
I have reinstalled iTunes and it has made no difference to burning capabilities regardless of whether or not these Filters exist. This message is also present until i manually go and place the filters back into the registry.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any pointers for me? I am considering reinstalling Windows 7 Ultimate if i can't resolve this problem.<br />
<br />
Any help welcome<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

            Perhaps, but this does not explain why i cannot run ITunes diagnostics. Given the vast amount of information on the internet relating to software/registry issues, diagnostics crashes and being unable to burn CDs i don't think I can blame Matshita just
 yet.<br />
<br />
As well as this it has burned 2 tracks and operated fine for almost 5 years previously.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your reply and perhaps they are not a high end drive but still it does not offer me much help<br />

            I would check with Mashitas website to see if they have any diagnostics that can be run to see if it is a hardware issue.
<br />
<br />
You have tried most of the troubleshooting steps that I can think of. <br />

            This may sound daft but i can't seem to find a web-site for Matshita. I know they are a panasonic company and have also searched for Masushita as that came up on a few sites but to no avail! Do you have a link?
<br />
<br />
I'm starting to believe my drive burning capabilities are gone due to a drive error but the fact i was able to burn 2 tracks in the midst of my repairs keeps making me try more things.
<br />
<br />
Itunes has now given me an error of 4280 instead of the previous 4800 error. I am still unable to run iTunes diagnostics. registry errors perhaps? I have cleaned the drive laser heads with a drive cleaning kit (no difference)<br />
<br />
My last hopes are creating a new user profile and see if a clean registry is opened and then if all else fails a fresh install of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway Marilyn<br />

I know you have stated you have uninstalled iTunes before. <br />
There is an Microsoft Automatic Fixit for uninstalling programs that replaces the Windows Uninstall Cleanup Utility.
<br />
</p>
<p><span>You can try the Microsoft Automatic FixIt for Uninstalling programs.

It states: Automatically diagnoses problems that can prevent installing and uninstalling programs on your computer. Assists with programs that will not uninstall correctly and programs blocking installation of new program installations.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 5 modes of USB data transfer, in order of increasing bandwidth: Low Speed (from 1.0), Full Speed (from 1.0), High Speed (from 2.0), SuperSpeed (from 3.0), and SuperSpeed+ (from 3.1); modes have differing hardware and cabling requirements. USB devices
 have some choice of implemented modes, and USB version is not a reliable statement of implemented modes. Modes are identified by their names and icons, and the specifications suggests that plugs and receptacles be colour-coded (SuperSpeed is identified by
 blue).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To determine what version of USB your PC is using: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Device Manager and expand the "Universal Serial Bus Controllers" section.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Referring to the list of USB ports in that section, you can tell which version of USB your computer by looking at the port name, based on the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>USB 3.0 - USB port name will include "USB 3.0." <br />
</li><li>USB 2.0 - USB port name will include "Enhanced" or "Enhanced Host" (may also include "Universal Host").</li><li>USB 1.1 - USB port name will include "Universal Host" (will not include "Enhanced").</li></ul>
<p><span><strong>Tip:</strong></span> If your computer was built before 2001, it is likely that it has USB 1.1 or 1.0 ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other concerns, don't hesitate to get back to us.</p>
<p>

<p>Unless your PC is 10 or more years old, you are unlikely to have a USB 1.0 or USB 1.1 port. The visual difference between a USB 2 port and USB 3 port is that the latter has a blue colored tab inside the connector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not seen the message "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">... this may operate quicker/better ..." in Windows 10. However, Windows 8 would display a similar message if you plugged a USB 3 device into a USB 2 port. That message meant
 that you might experience faster data transfer if you plugged a USB 3 device into a USB 3 port.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Since, in real life, you won't always discern a difference between a USB 3 device and a USB 2 device, my guess is that Microsoft removed the message so as not to alarm users.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>USB 4 has yet to appear.</p>

            Cheerz Bulldog, that all makes a lot of sense.<br />
I'm not th fastest at responding or glimpsing th whole message that appears; I recall that ['..may operate faster..']&nbsp;was what used to appear, so assumed that was roughly what th message was saying. It's only started happening since I installed a wifi dongle
 in one of th rear facing USB ports. I wasn't sure if th ones on th front of my tower might be quicker, hence my question. But it seems I get th same message no matter which port I use.....Thanx&nbsp; :)

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Please try the below steps:
<br />First of all:
<br />Try re-registering Store and clearing cache:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-register-store-app-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-reg...</a>

<br />If that doesn't help, make sure:
<br />You are not using a proxy server/3rd Party Firewall or a VPN.
<br />The next step would be to disable metered connection if you have set so.
<br />If all of these doesn't help, try doing a repair install that keeps everything.

<br />See if the marked Answer here helps:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_store/unable-to-install-apps-in-windows-store-error-code/ad8361b1-8d04-4454-9275-a2873a108c32?auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If not Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that fails then Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that fails then reinstall Store.  Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</code>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />If these all fail then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

    <title>Short Day of Week no longer works in taskbar date - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikerackham  say:</h3>
<h2>            Short Day of Week no longer works in taskbar date</h2>
                    <p>Recently my date disappeared from the taskbar. I'm still not using small icons, and I'm using the horizontal taskbar at the bottom of the screen. I've tracked it down to the short date format.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"ddd dd-MMM-yyyy"</strong>: this is my desired date format. When I change Short Date format to that in Customize Format, the date vanishes from the taskbar. I want it to display as&nbsp;"‎Mon ‎07-‎May-‎2018"</p>
<p><strong>"dddd dd-MMM-yyyy"</strong>: If I add the additional 'd' on the front, the date reappears on the taskbar under the time as "‎Monday ‎07-‎May-‎2018"</p>
<p>
</p><p>ddd still shows as a possible notation in the Date formats section of Customize Format in Regional and Language Settings, so what's the deal?</p>

            For some strange reason, it appears that the problem only occurs on Mondays. On Mondays, the date disappears from the bar. I can change the date format back to have "dddd" and then it comes back as Monday 14-May-2018. Other days of the week seem to allow
 the 3-character day--it's just Mon that doesn't work. Very odd.

    <title>File Recovery doesn&#39;t put recovered file in original folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> winsol  say:</h3>
<h2>            File Recovery doesn&#39;t put recovered file in original folder</h2>
                    
<p>I have&nbsp; tried two file recovery programs:&nbsp; Recuva and Pandora Recovery</p>
<p>Both programs recovered numerous deleted files from my inadvertent deletion of my Documents folder.&nbsp; However, I was expecting that the recovered files would be recovered back into their original folders that were in my deleted Documents folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead,&nbsp;the
 files were recovered as separate files and not recovered back into their&nbsp;original folders. Is there a recovery program that would recover the files back into their original folders that were in the deleted Documents folder?&nbsp; Otherwise, it seems that I will
 have to open about&nbsp;7000 files and sort them out into their respective orginal folders. This seems like an enormously time consuming and difficult task. Can someone help me? Thank you.&nbsp; John G.</p>

<div>I think you will be lucky to recover anything.&nbsp; Where a file is located is not part of the file -- it is metadata that is stored elsewhere, so it may not be possible to recover the files to their previous location.&nbsp; In the future, it would
 be much easier to restore the files if you have a backup.</div>
