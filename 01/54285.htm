<h2>            Lsass.exe - Exception Processing Message c0000135 Parameter 10010 75b6bf7c 75b6bf7c 75bf7c</h2>
                    <p>My computer running on windows XP crashed during a Microsoft update download. It is linked to LSASS.exe, and the message which appears during start-up declares that its&nbsp;"Unable to Locate Component". Pressing OK or dismissing the announcement causes the computer
 to try to re-boot and repeat the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to use the Windows installation disk to sort out the problem by repairing the operating system. Fine, until it starts to ask some weird questions as to the name I want to give to some file or other. Aghhhh!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The internet is littered with descriptions of this problem, but solutions seem to be extremely obscure Those that I have found&nbsp;range from "switch it off and on again" to dialogues about how important "LSASS.exe" is, &nbsp;and that it isn't "isass.exe".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that I can go for a "clean installation" of windows but this will involve a complete loss of data , many hours of reloading programs and the expense of repurchasing programs that were bought on-line. (yes, I should have kept copies of downloads and
 passwords but ...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anybody have, or can direct me to, a recovery procedure? &nbsp;How do I copy files in to replace the ones that have obviously been damaged or deleted? Why does this sort of problem happen on Microsoft Windows but (apparently not) on Android?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All sensible instructions and directions to my first two questions welcome - the last is for the boys in Seattle alone to answer.</p>

<h2>            Computer Freezes and also Freezes during Windows Defender Scan and Anti Virus Scan.</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I&nbsp;have had a number of&nbsp;problems. Youtube said I had to download an updated version of adobe to play videos. I uninstalled&nbsp;the&nbsp;version I had&nbsp;following the instructions, and installed the new one following the instructions, and it still didn't work. I have also
 had trouble with my computer freezing and not responding to different tasks and programs&nbsp;so I thought I'd scan my computer. My Anti-Virus software (McAfee) freezes now&nbsp;everytime I run a scan, and then I tried with Windows Defender and that also freezes mid-scan.
 I tried updating Windows Defender, which didn't work saying there was an error. I then tried to open the cmd prompt, but the computer froze when I tried to right-click on cmd to run it as an administrator.&nbsp;My computer now more often than not freezes when I
 right-click on any file. Each time the computer freezes I have to reluctantly perform a hard shut down. How can I find out what the problems are and where do I solve them?

            <p>McAfee and Windows Defender are not compatible with each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>McAfee should have disabled Windows Defender when it was installed.&nbsp; Since&nbsp;Windows Defender&nbsp;is still functioning you need to disable it and that might stop the issues you have described.</p>

            Aha, one problem down! However, the same things are still happening. The computer is still freezing on different tasks and McAfee still freezes mid-scan. I've spoken to McAfee and they've checked my anti-virus software, it is all fine.&nbsp;They gave me a link
 to the&nbsp;Microsoft fix it website and everything I click on states&nbsp;it couldn't find a problem. I also keep getting errors on Explorer when troubleshooting connection problems when a page doesn't load. Videos still aren't playing either.

            <p>The first thing I do when I set up a new computer that is equipped with McAfee is to remove McAfee.&nbsp; Based on past experiences, everything you describe sounds like McAfee is causing performance problems and instability on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>McAfee won't like my next suggestion but I would totally remove McAfee including using the McAfee Removal&nbsp; Tool:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be very cautious and try to access links and webpages that you know to be safe...see if you&nbsp;still have freezes and application hangs.&nbsp; If not, then you have identified your problem and you can pick an antimalware product from here:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If removing McAfee does not eliminate your problems then post here providing&nbsp;as many details as possible (and feel free to reinstall McAfee if you so desire) and someone (other than me) will try to help you resolve your issues.</p>

            Ah I've had my computer for nearly two years and only just started getting problems. Something different happened last night when I did another virus scan, instead of freezing,&nbsp;it said the hard disk had stopped responding or something? I've also scanned
 for malware using different software&nbsp;and there was&nbsp;nothing picked up. Where would I be able to find the faults?

            <p>Some fake antivirus programs will give you such messages but if malware scans are negative you must assume your problems are not malware related.&nbsp; Trust you did not install any other AV programs to run with McAfee?&nbsp; Scanning with Malwarebytes Free or an
 online scanner is not a problem...installing additional real time scanners can just further hose up your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you uninstall McAfee and see how your computer was running?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is certainly possible that you have a pending hard drive failure... </p>

            Indeed, I used Malwarebytes and&nbsp;it didn't pick anything up.&nbsp;Yeh I uninstalled it&nbsp;but the computer was still freezing doing certain tasks, so I re-installed McAfee again.

<h2>            Native resolution not supporting after upgrading to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>When I upgraded to Windows 8.1 recently in my years old Dell XPS 1640, it is not detecting my integrated graphics (ATI Radeon 4670) card. &nbsp;Instead it is showing&nbsp;ATI ATOMBIOS with just 256MB of graphics memory. Everything was working fine in Windows 8. After
 upgrading it stuck with 1920x1440 where it should be 1920x1080. I have downloaded and installed the newest driver from AMD website, but still it doesn't help. Tried to uninstall, update the driver from screen resolution&gt;graphics properties, its not helping
 either. Then I did a clean format and installed windows 8 and again it started working fine. Then it got auto upgraded to Widnows 8.1 and now facing the same graphics issue. Please help me how to solve this. Thank You. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Soumya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your troubleshooting skills so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue normally occurs when the graphics driver is outdated, you may have to update it to the latest version from the Manufacturer website. It could also occur if the graphics card is not compatible with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the below methods and check if that helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You may check the Windows updates for any optional update for this driver or device and install those updates accordingly.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>U<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ninstall the graphics card drivers and install them in compatibility mode and check if it helps.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 1:</span></strong><span>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To uninstall device:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press “Windows Logo” + “X”.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on “Device Manager”.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Device Manager will then display a list of installed devices in the right pane of the console.
</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Expand the category for Display Adapter.
</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right-click the device and select Uninstall.
</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dialog box will pop up asking you to confirm ‘Uninstall’. Click OK to proceed.</span></li></ol>

<p>Haha, I don't even think there was pong on the Xbox 360! That truly is a game that I don't think many care to play today, haha. Though you might get lucky as Fallout 4 has a lot of classic games you can play on your pipboy, no guarantee pong is there, but
 I saw a lot of games that reminded me of those earlier days of gaming.</p>

            Gaming has moved on from games like Pong.&nbsp; You might try one of the legacy game consoles that are currently being produced.&nbsp; I agree some of those games were fun and what a lot of gamers got started on but like everything else things change.&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p><p>I've suffered from the same battery problem with my 1-year old laptop (since Windows 10 update): a Toshiba Satellite P55T-B5262 bought in April 2015 from Microsoft Store. The problem has been reported fully to MS and Toshiba forums:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I think the BIOS/UEFI failure to charge indicates it is a battery cell problem, or a firmware problem. From the sound of Greg our support representative here, they can fix this with software, which would indicate a firmware problem. I'm skeptical myself,
 but hopefully he is correct.</p>

<h3> rmi_howard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Logon Failure&#58; The user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer.</h2>
                    <p>I have an existing network of computers that do not have any issues seeing and accessing each other's files. &nbsp;They are all on the same homegroup and workgroup. &nbsp;One of those computer have died and I have replaced it with a new system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new computer is able to access all the computers on the existing network except for one computer (computer A). &nbsp;No other computers on the network have problems accessing computer A. &nbsp;As far as I am aware, they are all set up the same way and are all
 running Windows 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the new computer tries to access computer A, I receive the following error:</p>
<p>"\\Computer-A is not accessible. &nbsp;You might not have permission to use this network resource. &nbsp;Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logon failure: the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check computer A, sharing is enabled and access permission has been given to "Everyone". &nbsp;I've also checked the group policy on computer A and network access is available to "Everyone". &nbsp;It is accessible for all the existing computers on the network
 so I really don't understand why it is not accessible for the new computer, especially when the new computer is able to access all the other computers without any problems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I noticed that if I try to access computer A via its IP address (from the new computer), it will ask me for login credentials instead of giving me an error. &nbsp;But no login information that I know of appears to be correct (including the user name and password
 used to login locally). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any suggestions? &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

    <title>Touchscreen on HP Touchsmart 8.1 not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eddieallred  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touchscreen on HP Touchsmart 8.1 not working</h2>
                    <p>First, this is NOT the intermittent issue many people have had (I was a lucky one there, I guess). &nbsp;Touchscreen on HP 8.1 Touchsmart laptop stopped working after the attempt to do the free upgrade to Windows 10. &nbsp;It never took (I had the common "not enough
 space on Recovery Drive D:" message so many have had.) &nbsp;I was forced to keep 8.1. &nbsp;Again, Windows 10 downloaded but never even tried to run due to disk space. &nbsp;So the attempt to upgrade is somehow the trigger, but this is 8.1 &nbsp;Here is what I have tried so
 far (besides numerous reboots):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Drivers for touch screen were in Device Manager, and enabled. &nbsp;I uninstalled/reinstalled anyway, verified that Device Manager shows it as installed, working and up to date. &nbsp;Downloaded HP Assistant it also told me everything is fine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;Also tried the calibration utilities in System and Control Panel. &nbsp;No change. &nbsp;Touchscreen is good to go according to everything I can find, but it has zero response to anything on the touchscreen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;Tried system recovery, also no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Called HP and they tell me that my free upgrade voids any warranty with HP because it was from Windows, blah, blah.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose my next step is to do a complete system recovery from scratch. &nbsp;I'd really hope I can avoid that. &nbsp;Please... any ideas??</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. &nbsp; I have an HP m6-k022dx, Touchsmart/ &nbsp;x64/ &nbsp;Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to your methods, as mentioned in my initial post, I have already tried method 2. &nbsp;No change. &nbsp;Device shows up in Dev Mngr, and says driver is enabled and working. &nbsp;An update driver check says it is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your first method, I &nbsp;downloaded and tried running the Microsoft Fixit. &nbsp;It installed fine, and ran. &nbsp;The only thing it detected was that the windows updates were not set to automatic download and install. &nbsp;I went ahead and changed it, but it was already
 up to date. &nbsp;No other changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still unable to run HP Recovery Manager for a reinstall. &nbsp;The utility opens but within seconds goes to "not responding" and shuts itself off. &nbsp;I had the same result from a newly created profile and also from safe mode with minimal set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions appreciated and thank you again for the reply.</p>

</p><p>Thank you again, for responding. &nbsp;I have already tried all those options under "HP Touchscreen issue". &nbsp;Most did not apply to my issue and the one that did, did not help. &nbsp;But I tried them all anyway. &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;I will not try a recovery, as you say. &nbsp;Most
 especially because HP Recovery Manager will NOT run, as I have said earlier. &nbsp;It launches, locks up and shuts it self off In a few seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i thank you for your attempts to help, though. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:

<p><span>"C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Administrative Tools"</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Method 3:&nbsp;You may also</span></strong><span> set your computer in

<h2>            Windows lags every time I plug in External Harddrive after a forced shutdown</h2>
                    After a Forced shutdown due to computer creezing and not responding, whenever I plug-in my external harddrive, on both Windows XP and Windows 7, it causes the computer to lag badly, even though it's not consuming any CPU or RAM. It also doesn't let me
 open any folders and iexplore, until it's un-plugged as it's lagging. But as I opened Task manager, I checked that all processes of explorer if launched, will be killed. But if the harddrive was un-plugged, all the processe rush back as though it was all opened
 immediately. But after a CHKDSK on Windows 7, it fixes an MFT error, and the lag lessens only on windows 7. Windows XP will still lag badly, if not slightly better than before.And the odd thing is, it doesn't even show up in My Computer as a plugged-in harddrive.
 Does anyone know how to fix this error?

            Hi,
<div><br />
You may try the following methods and check if it helps.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1: Run virus scan<br />
</strong>I would suggest you to run a virus scan on external hard drive and check if it helps.<br />
You can download Microsoft Safety scanner, which provides on-demand scanning, and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.<br />
Refer to the link provided below to download Microsoft Safety scanner on the system.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
<strong>Note:<br />
</strong>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />
<strong>Disclaimer:<br />
</strong>Any data files that are infected may be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2: Check in Safe mode.<br />
</strong>How to start computer in ‘Safe mode’, refer to the following link.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></div>

            I'm using Windows Vista &amp; XP and I have the exact same problem on both computers.
<div><br />
<div>I tried to run the anti-virus scan, but the external hard drive lags the anti-virus software as well, but the moment I force unplug the drive, the anti-virus runs smoothly as if nothing happened.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm not too sure if it's a hardware or a virus problem. Please help! Thanks!</div>

<h2>            Ive been waiting for pixark to get fixed and it&#39;s still not. Can I get a refund</h2>
                    <p>I got this game for my self on day one. It was broken off the bat. Crashing was the worst issue. Big update comes out I but it for my kids thinking it's fixed and it's even more broken to the point my son walks around with no body, the amount of animals spawned I my area is stupid, and the best part is that the game won't play for more than 30 minutes without crashing 4 to 5 times. Best part about the crash is what ever I or my kids did prier to the crash is gone. Is there any way to get a refund cause snail games is not doing there job correctly to get this game fixed. $50 down the drain.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Xbox One wireless controller too lose of tension on thumb sticks&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One wireless controller too lose of tension on thumb sticks&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I was wondering what you guys felt about the tension of the thumb sticks? I feel they are a too lose. I kind of feel like when playing Ghosts that it's a little floaty and I don't have as much as control as I did with the Xbox 360 remote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Impressions?</p>

<p>Yeah, I was just actually googling that to see if there was a different controller to buy so they didn't feel so loose.</p>
<p>After going back and using a 360 controller, I found I was a lot more accurate and felt more in control than I do on the Xbox One. Will we ever get a controller that will be more like the Xbox 360's? (mainly stick-wise. I also prefer the 360's triggers too)</p>
