<h2>            Hot and noisy power transformer-charger</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed today that the electrical transformer part of the charger for my surface pro 4 is rather warm, and is making a slight hissing noise when I listen closely to it. Nothing catastrophic so far, but I'm worried there's some electrical bridging going
 on, so I don't want to charge it when I'm out of the room in case it gets frisky. Anyone else notice this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pete</p>

    <title>wbadmin.exe file is corrupted. How do I recover&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mickylee3  say:</h3>
<h2>            wbadmin.exe file is corrupted.  How do I recover&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows Home Basic Ver 6.0.6002.&nbsp; I can't execute wbadmin.&nbsp; It is unfound.&nbsp; I found a writeup at WhatIsDll.com explaining that a known virus is corrupting tens of thousands of computers by altering that command, rendering it useles for us (and probably
 useful for the virus).&nbsp; The instructions they gave there for me to fix it myself did not work.&nbsp; The product they're trying to sell to fix it, DLLSuite, does not report it as a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found its code in my RECOVERY drive in four WINDOWS/WINSXS subdirectories beginning with X86_MICROSOFT-WINDOWS-BLB..... but I REGSVR32 fails when I copy it back to the C Drive and attempt to register it.&nbsp; It cannot load it.&nbsp; That copy may be the corrupted
 version. I have no idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need this command to create a task to backup my computer regulary and automatically.&nbsp; I hate to restore the original operating system from disk and then do all of those updates that I've done for years.&nbsp; I will do that if there is no better solution.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you know about this?&nbsp; What can be done?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Micky,
<p>Thank you for posting your issue on Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>From the issue description, i understand that wbadmin.exe file is corrupted.</p>
<p>Let me go ahead and help you with the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a few methods which you can follow to resolve the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Check if issue persists in clean boot.</p>
<p>Refer to the link:</p>
<p>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>Note: Refer "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot"</p>
<p>under more information to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Run System File Checker (SFC) scan to fix any corrupt system files. To do this, follow the steps mentioned in the link below:<br />
<strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072bc">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Check the computer for virus.</p>
<p>Refer to the link:</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/sysreq.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072bc">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/sysreq.aspx</font></a></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><b>Note:</b> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this resolves the issue. If issue persists, you can write to us and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>

            <p>I found no problem with the msconfig steps.</p>
<p>SFC found problems. After rebooting, wbadmin.exe was still not&nbsp;recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner found no virus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My RECOVERY disk has four subdirectories in D:\WINDOWS\WINSXS that appear to contain all of the code for wbadmin.&nbsp; there first part of the directory names are X86_microsoft-windows-blb&nbsp; Those subdirectories don't even exist on my C drive.&nbsp; An article at
<a href="http://www.whatisdll.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.whatisdll.com</a> explained that&nbsp; a known virus corrupts wbadmin for its own purposes.&nbsp; I don't know what it does or if it deletes it afterward, but the code isn't there.&nbsp; So a virus scanner isn't going to find it now.&nbsp;
 It's possible, I suppose that the virus did its dirty deed and then was found and cleaned afterward.&nbsp; So, the virus is no longer there nor is the code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know what SFC does or how complete its scan is.&nbsp; It looked very hopeful but it did not recover wbadmin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would love to know if microsoft has simply removed that functionality from Vista Home Basic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need it to create a task in the Task Scheduler to backup my PC regularly.&nbsp; I presume there is a way to do this and WBADMIN is the program to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only solution I can consider is to completely reinstall the operating system from scratch.&nbsp; I really don't want to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there documentation of the extent of SFC's functionality.&nbsp; Would it find&nbsp;a missing program in WINSXS?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            &nbsp;I have a dell computer which has a RECOVERY partition where I can recover the original installation. I have learned there is an option to recover without reformatting the hard drive. F8 at bootup, I believe. Dell's reinstallation DVD appears not to have
 a repair function for the operating system or an option to skip formatting the hard drive.
<p>So, I have given up trying to do this any other way. SFC didn't work.</p>
<p>I had hoped to avoid having to do this but I find nowhere in the Microsoft support discussions any hint that there is any other way to repair this particular program and its DLLs.</p>

    <title>I forgot my email password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tuneablesword5  say:</h3>
<h2>            I forgot my email password</h2>
                    
<p>I made this account so I could ask this question. Years ago I made an xboxlive account with an email I no longer use. I have it set up so it automatically signs in each time &nbsp;so I &nbsp;have never worried about it. Last night I tried to change some settings via
 xbox360 and it was asking me to enter a password for my microsoft account. I do no longer know the password or security question for the account.</p>
<p>I have my xbox live subscription set up to automatically renew each year. This is a problem if I can not even acess the email or xbox360 account.</p>
<p>Making a new live account is not an option because I do not want to lose my name and gamer score.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
If you can't access the e-mail which is preventing you from resetting the password then you need to try your luck with
<strong><a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">filling out the Microsoft Account Recovery form here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
That would actually be your one and only way to get out of the situation you are currently in unless you are able to get into the e-mail that the account is associated with. For that you'd need to talk to the e-mail provider if it was different than @Hotmail/@Live
 account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Try this solution here - <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/windows-live-id/error-email-password-not-valid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>From this solution you can try the following - <a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx</a></p>
<p>You may still run into a problem if you can no longer access the email account your XBOX Live account was bound to. Microsoft did release a security statement over a year to remind everyone to set a secondary contact such as a cell phone or secondary email
 acct.</p>

<p>No, I'm sorry it's not. You would need to fill out the Microsoft Account Recovery form as said in the post above. If you are unable to then you will need to contact phone support and have them cancel the automatic renewal on your account so you aren't charged
 for an account you cannot get into.<br />
<br />
That is the one and only way you'd be able to get back into the account is via a successful account recovery from the Microsoft account team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/af60679b-c0e0-4f4d-8d3e-4581c5535208" title="Briddie">
Briddie</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Can my husband and I both have the same number attached to our individual Skype accounts?</em></p>
<p>Skype paid features such as a Skype Number, as well as subscriptions, cannot be shared between accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>Can I transfer my current VoIP number? to be a Skype number?</em></span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Skype does not have available what is called in the telephone industry as inbound number portability.&nbsp; Therefore, we cannot transfer into Skype numbers from other carriers regardless of whether the numbers are landline, mobile, or other VoIP
 numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sharing a single account, where the account could be signed on more than one device and/or location, may lead that account to be suspended out of concerns that the account may have been compromised.&nbsp; Please also note that it is not possible to join an incoming
 call such as via an extension or second phone at home or in an office - you could answer an incoming call on only one computer or device (handheld tablet, smart phone).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Elaine</p>

            <p>I rolled back to my snapshot before sysprepped and uninstalled McAfee <br />
agent and sysprepped again which worked the first time (no logon service<br />
profile errors). Then I rolled back and tried the same thing again <br />
(just to make sure) and the second time it didn't<br />
work. Then I tried disabling copyprofile (unattend.xml)/uninstalling <br />
McAfee which seemed to work. And now I think I have a working image <br />
without using the copyprofile switch in the xml with McAfee installed <br />
(which I tried many times before and it caused the<br />
user service profile to break). I don't even consider this a workaround<br />
as it seems very unreliable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other thoughts on this?</p>

<h2>            XBOX 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows is not working with usb 3.0</h2>
                    I purchased the receiver about 2 months ago and it has worked flawlessly with my laptop since day one. keep in mind my laptop only has USB 3.0. However, today the Xbox 360 controller wasn't working in any of my games. I decided to trouble shoot the receiver
 from my control panel and it said to plug in my device to a USB 2.0 port since it could have issues in a USB 3.0 port. This is a problem since i don't have any USB 2.0 ports. My laptop is an ASUS G75VX. Is there anything i can do to fix this?

<h2>            Icons still on apps page after unistalling game programs in windows 8.</h2>
                    After uninstall of game programs the icon still shows on the "all apps" page. Right click on the icon, go to file location...doesn't exist. Uninstall takes me to control panel "uninstall programs"...program doesn't exist. Can you tell me now to remove
 the "ghost icon from the apps page? I see others have the same issue but no one shows a resolution. Does anyone know the file path to apps icons?<br />
<br />
Windows 8 OS.<br />

Thanks for your help.

            Hi Anshul,<br />
Appreciate the counsel. I completed both of your suggested methods but neither took the icons from the apps.<br />
I deleted all temp files.<br />
I ran fix-it. It asked if install or uninstall...I answered uninstall. It didn't find problems so asked me to ID the program...it wasn't listed. It then asked for the product key. These are Wild Tangent games that came pre-loaded on my Toshiba Satelite C855D-S5320
 laptop...therefore, no product key.<br />
As I said earlier, I uninstalled all games programs. I also searched for, found and deleted several files/folders containing games.<br />
Where can we go from here?<br />
Thanks...Tim<br />

            1) A careful manual edit of the registry or
<div>2) IOBit has a program called Advanced System Care 6. Within that software is a program called 'Uninstaller'. It&nbsp;separates the uninstall into two parts. First, it will invoke the uninstall that came with your game (or other program) and secondly, it gives
 you an option called Power Uninstall. This is the registry sweep for the stuff the games uninstall skipped. It works and It works well. There is a free trial version available, but since I've been using the Pro version since v3.0 I cannot recall if the 'Uninstall'
 product is on trial or not.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>...one last thing. If the program you want to uninstall does not appear in the ASC6 Uninstall program list, simply re-install the game (or other software) then allow ASC6 Uninstall to do it's thing.&nbsp;</div>

<div>And deleted every Multi-String Value containing the name of the unistalled program, closed the registry and the "ghost" icons where gone!</div>

</div>
<div>For the first time today, I noticed that the desktop icons on my Windows 8.1 Pro laptop are acting strange. While some of them look as they should, others have this faint square around them that is barely visible unless you pay close attention. I even
 have one program (NetBeans) that doesn't use its regular icon, and is instead showing the icon that you see in the Programs and Features menu. Below is a screenshot of a small portion of my desktop that accurately depicts all three of these situations. I just
 noticed the problem now, but at the same time, I can assure you that I did not have n issue with this earlier.</div>

<p>
</p><p>I just got a new laptop with Windows 8.1. Everything seems to be fine, except for push notifications. I've downloaded the facebook app, however, it never shows anything when I get a message or a notification. Usually, when an app is installed, I will get

    <title>New Windows 7 Install triggers large amounts of updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johncabrall  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Windows 7 Install triggers large amounts of updates</h2>
                    <p>I just built a new desktop, and after activating Windows 7, I'm confronted with massive amounts of updates every time I shut down or start up the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll get statements likes: "Please do not power off or unplug your machine . . . Installing update 1 of 156"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each update takes up to 5 minutes, so it means hours and hours of update install time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this normal?&nbsp; Will it get better as the machine 'catches up' with all the updates to Windows 7 since the OS was released? Or is there a way to download something that skips all the intermediate updates and brings the OS current in one cycle?</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Information: Windows 7 64 bit, I believe i7-4790K processor, Gigabyte Z97X-UD3H Motherboard, 250 Gb Crucial M.2 SSD on MD. - there is also an additional 500 Gb SSD</p>
<p>, and a 500 HD.&nbsp; The 500 Gb SSD has an earlier W7 install on it, but I (had) designated the first boot to occur from the M.2 SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: writing this question on another computer. New Computer shut down after installing around 135 updates of the 156 listed.&nbsp; After going through startup repair, am getting the statement: "Startup Repair cannot repair this computer automatically" (ouch)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm attempting to go through multiple 'Startup Repair' cycles - will post more information about the system when I can get windows up and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-----------------------------</p>
<p>After unplugging all drives except the M.2 SSD, and checking the BIOS (which, by the way didn't 'see' the M.2 SSD), the system is now restarting and 'Configuring Windows updates'.&nbsp; Got to a 'Reverting Changes' point, and have my fingers crossed</p>
<p>____________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got the system back up - can now say that it's at Service Pack 1</p>
<p>---------------------------</p>
<p>Looking at the Installed Updates list, can see updates with Installed On dates from yesterday - nothing appears to have today's date on it. Checking Windows Update, I see that
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel at this point that I need to disable updates!!!!!!!</p>
<p>---------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created a restore point, turned off updates and checked the updates list (113 'Important' updates, and 55 'optional' ones)
</p>
<p>GOING TO WAIT UNTIL I GET SOME ADVICE BEFORE INSTALLING ANY UPDATES!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

            <p>My history of install updates shows 180 Windows Updates (and I started with Windows 7 SP1).</p>
<p>There are 7 Framework updates.</p>
<p>And that's only the ones that are uninstallable. There's probably some IE updates as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just keep going until all updates are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can view what the optional updates are and if they are applicable to you.
</p>
<p>Any updates for drivers should come from the manufacturer's site.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You can always change the settings of Windows Updates to notify you only</strong>, that way you can check on what's being offered before you install.</p>

            Thanks for the reply. From what I can see, with 113 updates in the list, I've just cut a notch in the surface of the updates out there.&nbsp; My plan is to move forward very cautiously, setting restore points along the way and installing updates manually a
 few at a time.&nbsp; That way I know which updates are getting installed and I can identify the ones that crash my system (ugh).<br />

            <p>.Net Framework comes in 2 parts.</p>
<p>1) The Software Development Kits (SDK): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_SDK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>used by the developers to code using includes programming languages such as C++, C#, Visual Basic, Etc. and test applications.</p>
<p>Visual Studio: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd831853.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>2) The Runtime Redistributables: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>that are installed on your PC in order to run an applications that have been created using the software languages above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing .NET Framework or an Update to .NET framework are usually the most CPU / Time consuming of all updates. In additional more often than not, require you to restart your PC. Unfortunately the 'Restart' message usually pops up too soon and you should
 wait until all CPU and disk drive activity cease before restarting the PC which then completes the .NET installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>.NET comes in many versions (1.0 all the way up to version 4.5).&nbsp; If you have no applications that require version 4.5 then there is no need to install it. Most applications when you install them will detect if the correct version is installed.</p>

            Hi Seabass.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />3) Re-register all affected apps from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Fixed: I have Nvidia card that uses gsync. I enabled gsync to all fullscreen and borderless instead of only fullscreen. This caused major issue with windows UI. Leaving gsync to only the fullscreen will fix this issue.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Just fixed same issue. In my case not enough rights to "home folder" was a trick.
</p>
<p>I don't know why but "Adobe Premiere" tries access \\filestorage\home1$ all the time, and that exactly was a dvaui.dll crash reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example User's Properties\Profile\Home Folder\Connect &nbsp;- was configured to \\filestorage\home1$\username, but \\filestorage\home1$ "Security" tab wasn't configured to permit by "Authenticated Users". So I just redirected "home folder" to \\filestorage\home5$\username
 which has "Special Permission" for "Authenticated Users".</p>

    <title>Wifi No Longer Working after Upgrading to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wifi No Longer Working after Upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am having an issue with a computer that is unable to connect to wifi after upgrading to Windows 10. Now just to give a little background, I am an electrical engineer, so I am generally good with computers. The machine I am working on is an HP Pavilion
 Desktop computer, p7-1167c. I have run into this same issue in the past with other computers and always found it to be an issue with a missing wifi adapter driver (sometimes the upgrade deletes the current driver). So, that was the first thing I checked in
 device manager, and sure enough there appeared to be no driver specifically for the wifi adapter (though there were still several other network drivers). My next step was to try to find a driver and reinstall it onto the machine. After some searching I found
 a version for Windows 8.1, and even though it was not technically the correct driver, I tried it anyway. It didn't work. Anyway, I can't find a driver for Windows 10 online, so at this point I'm not sure what to do. While it is possible the driver is not the
 issue, based on past experience and my observation of the current state of the machine, I am 95% sure that is the problem. I know this is a pretty common issue and I have checked other people's responses, but none seem to have a clear resolution without rolling
 back the software to an older version of Windows. Any help would be greatly apprecitaed, thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I restored the computer to its factory settings and wiped all data. Did find the driver software but sadly still did not work. I'm giving up on this one, seems like it could be more than a software issue.</p>

            Yes, sorry for not being specific--the ethernet still works (hence the other network drivers still visible in device manager) and I can use everything else normally. I have the machine directly connected to the router now.

<p>My desktop did not come with Wi-Fi but I have plugged in a USB Dongle with Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>After installing and loading the software it shows in Device manager and works.</p>
<p>I also have an Ethernet connection.</p>
<p>I use Netgear equipment.</p>

            Yes and that is a possibility, but considering that mine did come with wifi, I would prefer a solution that doesn't require any additions or changes to my current system.

            Yes of course, I've run the troubleshooter multiple times. However, that only would diagnose the ethernet connection (I suspect because it is likely a driver issue with the wifi, the troubleshooter didn't even bother checking). The computer basically acts
 like it never had wifi in the first place.
