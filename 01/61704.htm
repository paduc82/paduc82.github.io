    <title>Windows 6 64 bit unable to wake monitor from sleep - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 6 64 bit unable to wake monitor from sleep</h2>
                    I am experiencing problems on my windows 7 computer. When my computer goes to sleep i am unable to get my monitor to wake up. My processor, fan and everything else apear to start up ok. I am running windows 7 ultimate 64 bit edition with an asus P6T deluxe
 board, 6gb of ram, 2 x 500gb sata drives set at acpi mode in the bios and an ATI 4850 graphics card. When this happens i have noticed that the windows event viewer creats a 219ID log as follows The driver\Driver\monitor failed to load for the device DISPLAY\GSM56CF\5&amp;1ec2f98B&amp;0&amp;UID257
 and wondered if this is any clue to my problem. I have trawled the internet and looked on the microsoft websites for answers to this error log with no joy. Can anyone point me in the correct direction. All drivers for motherboard, graphics driver, opperating
 system etc are up to date.

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
That seems to be a graphic driver issue. I would ask you to update the display driver and check. Also check if there is any Windows update available for the graphics card.</div>
<div>You can try removing the external devices and check (do not remove mouse and keyboard).</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1.</strong></div>
<div>To get all the available updates for your devices, periodically check Windows Update for all available updates, including optional updates. You can review the available updates and then select them from the list of updates that Windows finds for your computer</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2. </strong></div>
<div>Check if allow this device to wake the computer is checked in Device Manager.
<br />
1. Click Start, type Device manager in the Start search box and hit Enter.<br />
2. Select keyboard, it will display your keyboard, right click and select ‘Properties’.<br />
3. Select the ‘Power management’ tab.<br />
4. Check the “Allow this device to wake the computer” check box.<br />
5. Repest these steps for Mouse and Network adapters as well.</div>
<div><br />
Also, just to be double sure you have the latest drivers, you may check by visiting the manufacturer’s website and confirm the same.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3.</strong></div>
<div>Type <strong>eventvwr.msc /s</strong> in the address bar.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp; List any events that are listed as "Error" in the main window when you go to "Windows Logs" and "Application." There are often a lot of them. Send us whichever ones you see listed for the last couple days. (Please also do for the logs in "System"). When you
 do, provide us the name of the "Source" and whatever is listed in the description box below the list of logs when you click on one.</div>

<h2>            VT1708 6 -Channel High-Definition Audio CODEC</h2>
                    <p>I have an Asus Motherboard Model P5KPL-AM EPU. When I had windows 7 I was able to get my 4.1 speakers to work ever since I upgraded to windows 10 i haven't been able to get the rear speakers to make any sound. I have tried installing older drivers and it
 just gives me a blue screen of death which makes me have to reboot a couple times before windows starts to trouble shoot then I have to click buttons until I can boot into save mode and then I uninstall the audio driver that's causing the BSOD and reboot then
 the computer runs normal and it installs the same driver that doesn't use my rear speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inside the driver I have check marked speaker fill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have done different things asking windows to trouble shoot my sound device it never finds anything wrong. I've tried installing older drivers but during the install process I'll get the BSOD. its become a huge pain in my butt upgrading to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>first it takes about 25 retries to install the damn thing and then it has problems installing critical updates and I counted 45 times it tried and failed to install.</p>

<h2>            Remote Desktop Connection error &#34;An internal error has occurred&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I try to use&nbsp;Remote Desktop Connection (RDP) I get the error "An internal error has occurred" comes up!</p>
<p>I am trying to connect from my Win 7 Pro (W7P) PC Desktop to another W7P PC over a LAN!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have tried many solutions</strong> which I found on varioius website, Incl. Microsoft TechNet etc etc &amp; Including my</p>
<p>Internet Security Provider - None have Worked!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access the Remote PC via the LAN &amp; also via Homegroup without any problems using my explorer and</p>
<p>by various Network tools. I have even refreshed the "MachineKeys" Certificates; Checked the firewall etc etc.</p>
<p>BUT,&nbsp;&nbsp;I just keep getting the same error msg. No joy in the windows event's log either - nothing that would help</p>
<p>anyway!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried the "Remote Desktop Connection Manager" v2.7 - NO Go!</p>
<p>
</p><p>RDP is version 6.3.9600 and Protocol 8.1.....</p>
<p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Stumbled across the solution while looking for information on changes made to my PC systems (All Windows 7 Pro) and found a security document on Wanacry!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This led me to the following Documents "<span>How to detect, enable and disable SMBv1, SMBv2, and SMBv3 in Windows and Windows Server", Link is "</span><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2696547/how-to-enable-and-disable-smbv1,-smbv2,-and-smbv3-in-windows-vista,-windows-server-2008,-windows-7,-windows-server-2008-r2,-windows-8,-and-windows-server-2012”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I found that in fact
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>On Checking my system
<strong>NO</strong></span><span> versions of Server Message Block (SMB) were enabled.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I also Noted the warning in the “How to detect, enable and disable SMBv1, SMBv2, and SMBv3 in Windows and Windows Server” document Quote..</span></span></p>
<span>“Warning: We do not recommend that you disable SMBv2 or SMBv3. Disable SMBv2 or SMBv3 only as a temporary troubleshooting measure. Do not leave
 SMBv2 or SMBv3 disabled.”</span>
<p>So after Enabling SMBv2, Check the Firewall and restarting the PC's&nbsp;and was able to Connect &amp; Logon to the remote PC's on my LAN,
<span><strong>BUT</strong></span><span> with the warning MSG “The Identy of the remote computer cannot be verified. Do
 you want to continue anyway!”. I Did Continue without any Prob's as I know the PC is on My LAN. If It was on the Internet I would need to Make sure it was the right PC of coarse.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In Essence I had failed/overlooked the warning!! I Suggest the above article (Tung in cheek) be READ CAREFULLY!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps others!</span></p>
<p><span>Regards</span></p>

    <title>Why do calls no longer connect via Skype saying &#34;weak - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshdaley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do calls no longer connect via Skype saying &#34;weak connection&#34; even when i&#39;m connected with 50Mb Fiber&#63;</h2>
                    This all started with Microsoft's wavy lines and teenage-friendly stickers. Suddenly, I never get a ring tone — only that ominous Skype, "we haven't reached anything yet" sound — followed by a message that wrongfully declares my connection is weak. My
 connections are urban, 4G &amp; 50Mb Fiber connections.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The weakness isn't on this side. Still looking for a replacement for this now defunct service.<br />

</p><p>FaceTime is a video telephony product given by Apple Inc. As of now there is no such provision of using FaceTime in Windows 10. However, you can use Skype for doing video telephony or connecting to your contacts via internet VOIP.

    <title>The latest Windows 10 update in mid May 2018 practically destroyed my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tony de lima  say:</h3>
<h2>            The latest Windows 10 update in mid May 2018 practically destroyed my computer.</h2>
                    <p>I am currently living overseas on a business assignment and about a week ago Microsoft made an update on my laptop that put it into a state of total collapse. Prior to the update I had Windows 10 running on my Samsung laptop that I purchased in the US a
 few years ago that has 8 gb of ram on an Intel&nbsp;64 bit operating system&nbsp;and a 5.8 Windows experience index now, which never gave me any hardware or software problems until Microsoft&nbsp;insisted to install&nbsp;Windows 10 on me. The last update came with the messages
 that the computer would start and stop several times that this was a particularly long update and that I should do nothing but wait and let Windows do everything and that this update was to improve my security on navigating the internet. Well when the update
 was finished and the computer restarted all I had in front of me was a black screen with no indication of anything I had on my computer. All I could see on the screen was the recycle bin on a black screen. I had to consult someone to find out what to do since
 the computer did not respond to any commands and had no mouse or keyboards response. Well eventually we performed a system reset and it went all the way back to Windows&nbsp;7 home edition. &nbsp;I lost almost everything I had on the computer. All my bookmarks, favorites,
 history, passwords, etc.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do now many of the items lost or that I can't find were work related. I don't even know if I should try to get Windows 10 back on the computer since it was the cause of all my problems. If I do get Windows 10 again will I recover many
 of the things I lost or can't find?</p>
<p>Never again will I let Microsoft do an automatic update on any of my computers until I find out if there have been complaints of problems or bugs when the updates are released. I remember having a problem about a month after I first got Windows 10 on my
 computer. It froze my computer for a while but I was able to resolve that problem at the time without a major&nbsp;catastrophe but it should have served as a warning to me not to let any automatic changes to my systems in the future. Now I need Microsoft to indicate
 what would be the best solution to my problem and what direction to take. But don't steer me into a worse situation (if a worse situation is even possible).</p>

            Sounds like you have logged into a temporary profile. Try restarting your computer a few times. Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />At the sign in screen, click the power button, then click Restart. Do this a few times then try signing again. If the desktop still does not show up, then you will need to  create a new local user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Shift + Esc
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Enter a user name
<br />Password, confirm it, create a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Finish
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files 
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account. 
<br />
<br />Or
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />
<br />Type: explorer.exe
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Another option is to to kill the File Explorer process completely.
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />
<br />Type: CMD
<br />Hold down the the shift key
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Type: 
<br />taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Exit Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />
<br />Type: explorer.exe
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hi Tony, this is not a good sign . ..
<br />
<br />1803 has not been installed correctly on your system, you can try rolling back to 1709, but honestly your best and probably only option is to reset Windows 10, while keeping your files and apps . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<p>Thank you Andre and Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I attempt any of your suggestions let me tell you what&nbsp;I have now. I was able once I got Windows 7 on my laptop&nbsp; to get several items on my screen. Some of which I haven't seen in a while. I have along with the recycle bin a few others like the Best
 Buy PC app (where I purchased the computer), the Intel wireless display, the Samsung support Center and the User Guide Icons all items that had disappeared when I had the first Windows 10 installation, plus an e music icon that I don't recall having at all.</p>
<p>With that said what do you recommend that I do to try to restore some of my previous material. I installed Google chrome but it doesn't recognize any of my Gmail's&nbsp;&nbsp;passwords or my accounts. Since I am transferred overseas&nbsp;to Brazil now 3 years I can't give
 Google a US telephone number now that I have a local number here and lost my US phone some time back and didn't feel a need to replace it. (Which I now regret deeply).</p>
<p>So what do you suggest I do to try and recover my Google mail accounts, my lost passwords, my favorites bar and bookmarks, if possible, since most were work related.</p>
<p>I see you gave me several recommendations that I didn't try any yet, until I checked back with you or the community, so I wouldn't make matters worse. If that is possible. Thanks for any help or orientation you can give me now since I'm almost afraid to
 touch my computer any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rgds.</p>

<p>Gentlemen I have not tried any options yet to my computer because after I did a system reset and this brought me back to Windows 7 Home (which I did not have on my computer when purchased). This after the latest update from Windows 10 destroyed my computer
 and left me with a black screen and no response from my keyboard or mouse but only the recycle bin showing on a black screen. After the system reset and losing almost everything on my computer from passwords to email accounts, losing my bookmarks bar and all
 my bookmarks (work related), favorites etc. I thought that I could at least work with 7 after I figured out what to do.
</p>
<p>However, after a couple days Windows would shut down my computer again with a message coming on the screen saying "Windows will shut down to prevent damage to your computer" This happened several times and again today (6/6/18). The message said check hardware
 or software to see if properly installed. ( I did not have any hardware installed and the only software was an important update to Windows 7, so Microsoft said). It indicated to start again using Safe mode, which I did but a couple days later the same message
 repeated again. This time I started the computer on normal mode and it worked fine for several days until today when the same message appeared.</p>
<p>For general information I have a Samsung Laptop with 8gb of Ram and a Intel 64 bit operating system that I never had a software or hardware problem with it for several years that I have it. Until Windows decided to come up with Windows 10 for me and send
 me the lates update in May that kept saying that it was a long update that would shut down and restart my computer several times, that I should do nothing and that this update was to keep me safe on the internet. But, unfortunately, not safe from Microsoft.
 Someday give me a suggestion of what I should do now and if I should try to go back to Windows 10 and how can I locate the items I can't find on my computer.</p>
<p>I need some concrete suggestions and indications if this damage to my computer is beyond repair and if can be undone.
</p>
<p>Why does Microsoft do this to it's users?</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for the reference, but I have already tried that method and Windows has not brought up the warning dialog box again. I don't&nbsp;know that it's an Internet Explorer issue because I had already installed the program onto my computer, and I
 was trying to run it, not open/save it through IE. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did find a "RunInvalidSignature" key (set to: 0x00000000 (0) )&nbsp;in the registry under the
</p>
<p>"Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_TUSER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Download"&nbsp;section and wonder if it could be related?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a "(Default)" and a "CheckExeSignatures ...&nbsp;yes" key in the same section as well;
</p>
<p>and in IE control panel the:</p>
<p>"Launching Applications and Unsafe Files" is set to "Prompt" and</p>
<p>"Check for signatures on downloaded programs" is enabled.</p>

            Thank you Linney, for your reference; I followed those instructions and found no entry in the specified registry folder except the "Default - (value not set)" entry, so I think it must be something else.
<br />
<br />
All the researching I've done has all led me to the same "Open or Save?" in Internet Explorer.
<br />
I can't seem to find how to change the option of what Windows does with a file from an unverified publisher after that file has already been downloaded onto the drive?<br />

Everybody mentions the option involving the HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \ Microsoft \ Windows \ Shell \ AttachmentExecute, but if you don't have it then try these.</p>
<p><br />
"You might try the other option, Internet Options&gt; Security&gt; Reset all zones to default level."</p>

<p><br />
The other thing that might work is to create another user in Windows and use that user instead of the current user?</p>

            <p>I uninstalled the program that had been bringing up the verification box, and reinstalled; hoping that it might help somehow.&nbsp;Sure enough, when opening the install .exe file there was the warning/verification box (it's actually labelled "Open File - Security
 Warning").</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you both SO very much for your help; I don't know what exactly did the trick but the box that I thought I would never see again has returned (to my great relief).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a link to a picture reference of the box I was inaccurately describing:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/attachments/tutorials/171496d1313991224-open-file-security-warning-enable-disable-warning-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/attachments/tutorials/171496d1313991224-open-file-security-warning-enable-disable-warning-1.jpg</a></p>
<p>and this is the article the above picture came from:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, thank you both exceedingly for your help and references; I cannot tell you how relieved I am to know that Windows will still alert me of unverified publisher's .exes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely and Deeply Grateful :)</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the easiest way to determine if it's the console or the monitor would be to connect the console to a different Monitor or TV and see if the same thing happens, if the same thing happens then it's the console, if it doesn't happen then it's most likely the
 monitor.</p>

<p>Hi Valentine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would like to follow up if you're still having an issue with your device driver. If so, I would like to confirm if there are any changes made before this issue came up. If you recently installed Windows 10 update, I highly suggest to rollback
 your Windows 10 update to the previous version. To go back to an earlier build of Windows 10, open Start Menu &gt; Settings &gt;<span>&nbsp;</span>Update &amp; Security<span>&nbsp;</span>&gt; Recovery. Here you will see<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Go back to an earlier
 build</em><span>&nbsp;</span>section, with a<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Get started</em><span>&nbsp;</span>button. Click on it.
<span>You will see a<span>&nbsp;</span></span><em>Getting things ready, This wont take long</em><span><span>&nbsp;</span>screen. Once the process is completed, your computer will restart and you will be taken back to your old build.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<br />
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes.</p>

            There are several versions of Nuance Dragon NaturallySpeaking v9, check the site below for your version - one is compatible, others are not:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Software&amp;s=Dragon%20NaturallySpeaking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Software&amp;s=Dragon%20NaturallySpeaking</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If it doesn't install you can try compatibility mode:<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Troubleshoot Compatibility</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>This can help with some (but not all) programs/drivers:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next window click "Start the Program" to install it.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in Windows 7.

<p><span>Hello Erinstar – Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community.<br />
<br />
Some system recovery programs (like HP and Compaq) can recover the <br />
Software and keep the user data. However, if you didn’t make any backup<br />
then there is nothing to do. Unless you find a way to jump to the disk sectors<br />
and restore material from those discs in the disk. Since some parts might <br />
not have been zero. <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
I hope you find this information useful and if you need any further assistance,<br />
please feel free to contact me and let me know.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this information was helpful…</span></p>
<p><span>Have a nice day…</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Was it working earlier?</li><li>Have you installed device driver oon your computer?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try these methods and check the issue status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Run the diagnostic tool Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows</p>
<p>Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Uninstall the device driver, download the latest driver by downloading from the device manufacturer's website, install on your computer and check the issue status.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Start button, click Control Panel, click System and Maintenance, and then click Device Manager.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the list, double-click the type of device, and then locate the specific device that isn't working properly.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;If an exclamation mark appears next to the name of the device, Device Manager can't find the device driver. Go to "Use Windows Update to find a device driver."<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;If no exclamation mark appears next to the name of the device, go to "Uninstall and reinstall the device driver."<br />

<h2>            Unknown USB device, WiFi not connecting and Bluetooth is missing.</h2>
                    <p>Edit: I just confirmed that this Unknown USB device appears only when Bluetooth is
<strong>enabled </strong>in BIOS</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bluetooth is not showing in Settings/Devices , Marvell WiFi adapter shows correctly, but reports "No network found", Device&nbsp;Manager reports&nbsp;shown below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>Tried all the solutions, downloaded latest drivers from Surface support site, hard reset, reset to default factory settings... nothing fixes it.</p>
<p>I suspect this error is a culprit. </p>
<p>Anything else can be done to get Bluetooth going at least? thanks!</p>

<p>Thank you for posting recovery image, it may help someone else.</p>
<p>I&nbsp; made arrangements to send my device for exchange, it is obviously a hardware issue...</p>

<p>How do we use this feature to connect our phone straight to Xbox One to use Smartglass?</p>
<p>I know they said that it is possible but my Galaxy S3 will not&nbsp;find my Xbox One. I'd rather not connect through my router.</p>

<p>The Xbox One connects to your router not your phone.</p>
<p>Simply put your Xbox One on the network and your SmartGlass app on your phone should see your Xbox as long as you are pointing to the same router/network.</p>

<p>Correct, at this time the Xbox One SmartGlass application must be connected to the same home network that your Xbox One console is connected to in order to discover and connect to your Xbox One console.</p>
<p>@EvoFool, can you double check that you have installed and are running the Xbox One SmartGlass app? &nbsp;This is a new application specifically for connecting to the Xbox One as distinct from the previous Xbox SmartGlass application which is used to connect
 to the Xbox 360 console. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello @evofool. &nbsp;I'm sorry you are having trouble getting your devices to connect. &nbsp;Please take a look through the Xbox One SmartGlass FAQ here for additional tips:</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4274/t/1628885.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../1628885.aspx</a></p>
<p>The main thing is to ensure that your ipad and iPhone are connecting to the same network as your Xbox One console is connected to (on same wifi router, no cellular network, etc.). &nbsp;One other thing just to start from a clean slate, unplug your Xbox One console
 for like 10 seconds then plug it back in and turn it on. &nbsp;Then kill the SmartGlass app on your ipad and iPhone and start them fresh to see if you can discovery/connect to your console.</p>

<p>Naja, nur weil ein Account im Forum posten kann, heißt das nicht, dass er auch Zugriff auf XBL hat. Das sind zwei völlig verschiedene Dinge. Wie das ganze aber mit dem Zugriff auf den Marktplatz hier auf der Seite hat und ob man da merken würde ob der Account
 gebannt ist, weiß ich leider auch nicht.</p>

<h2>            DO NOT BUY SILICONE CASES IF YOU WANT TO USE YOUR MICROPHONE</h2>
                    
<p>Since the adapter has to be tightly snug to begin with, I had problems trying to plug it in with a Silicone case over my controller.</p>
<p>The only possible way to get it to fit was to stretch the silicone case then plug it in. But then there lies the problem where the silicone would stretch and wouldn't match to my buttons/analog sticks.</p>
<p>Just an FYI if your looking to get a case for your controller.</p>

<p>Wouldn't touch a controller cover. Just ask for a few extra wet wipes every time you go KFC and use them to clean when necessary.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Fair advice though, as mentioned, just try cutting around it a little more for some extra space. Chances are the case was designed with the hole in mind but never actually tested with a headset connected.</p>

<h2>            How to enable&#47;disable the fn key on my windows 8.1 laptop</h2>
                    As the subject is stated, I am currently using a HP pavilion notebook and mine was set so that I don't have to press the fn key to use the functions. &nbsp;I want to ask how to change the fn settings so that if we want to use f1 - f12 we have to press the fn
 key.
