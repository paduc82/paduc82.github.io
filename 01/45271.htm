                    <p>skype has taken 285 euros from my account, what is that payment for?</p>
<p>I have not even used skype for a long time, not at least with that amount.</p>

    <title>Slow Wi-Fi speed on Surface 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike vega  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow Wi-Fi speed on Surface 3</h2>
                    <p>I am not the first one who reported the problem, but seems there is still no solution for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surface and iPhone are both connected to the same network. Testing was done at the same time and it was repeated more than 10 times. I always have
<strong>1-2Mbps</strong> download speed on Surface and <strong>~40Mbps</strong> on my iPhone (wi-fi assistant is disabled so there is no LTE )</p>
<p>Upload speed on both devices is very high. More than <strong>~100Mbps</strong> on Surface.
</p>
<p><em>Means the problem only related to the download speed.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>winver - 15063.413</p>
<p>marvel driver -&nbsp;15.68.9112.23</p>
<p>Cisco hotspot, daul band (2.4 and 5).</p>
<p>All updates are always installed on weekly basis.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>what I tried:</p>
<p>- registry tweaks with&nbsp;TxAMSDU</p>
<p>- disabling location services</p>
<p>- configuring wi-fi adapter to work only with on 2,4 or 5 GHz</p>
<p>- uninstalling/reinstalling/rebooting etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing from the said above has helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed driver version&nbsp;15.68.3073.151 and ... <strong>my surface wi-fi started to work extremely fast</strong> (sometimes faster than iPhone, what's expected).&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Means the problem is related at least to the driver. </em></p>
<p>Honestly I can't use this outdated driver due to it discharges battery power extremely fast as well as my Bluetooth MS mouse stops to work every time after&nbsp;hibernation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be cool if anyone from MS comments my findings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Finally it looks like a <strong>solution was found!</strong></p>
<p>We have tweaked Maximum Segment Size of the AP from default 1363 to 1360.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take a look at the results:</p>
<p>Maximum Segment Size -&nbsp;1363</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/389f4517-ba66-4d58-b73d-ba3d4262e626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/389f4517-ba66-4d58-b73d-ba3d4262e626" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Maximum Segment Size -&nbsp;1360:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>It is still not clear why only Surface devices were affected in our company, but I am happy we were able to sort out everything. I plan to update MS support about that solution and hopefully they would post a KB.</p>

    <title>No Access to SDHC in Windows Vista SP2 in SD-Card-Reader-Slot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anacunga  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Access to SDHC in Windows Vista SP2 in SD-Card-Reader-Slot &#40;Workaround with CF-Adaptor&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Following situation here:</p>
<p>- several PCs running Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista (x86/x64)</p>
<p>- each PC has a multicardreader (for CF/SD/SM/MC/etc.)&nbsp;as 3.5"-drive-bay-adaptor connected to one of the internal USB-connectors</p>
<p>- several other multicardreaders to connect to an external USB</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remark: I call here the "windows explorer" with the name "finder" - so that there will not be any confusion with the "internet explorer".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behaviour with SDHC-cards (bigger than 2GB):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 2000 SP4: insert in SD-card-slot -and "finder" hangs; to access SDHC, a CF-adaptor works without problems.</p>
<p>Windows XP SP3: full access through SD-card-slot - no problem, no hang</p>
<p>Windows Vista&nbsp;SP2 ("fully updated"): same problem as Windows 2000: inserting a SDHC-card into a SD-card-slot makes the "finder" hang - until the card is taken out</p>
<p>On one&nbsp;Vista-x86-PC there is a problem with&nbsp;a driver and it is asking for a driver):&nbsp;system does not recognize that a SDHC-card was inserted).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;All PCs (incl. Vista PCs) work fine with a 1GB-SD-card in any SD-card-slot (also that one that lacks the driver).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936825/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936825/</a>&nbsp;does not apply as it does not apply to Vista SP2, only to Vista without SP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is definitley no hardware problem as access to SDHC works directly (without the need of a CF-adaptor)&nbsp;with all cardreaders when booting and accessing them under Windows XP SP3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not expect that Vista SP2 still has same problems that were found in Windows 2000 ... :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wha'ts the solution to access SDHC directly in the SD-card-slot (without needing to take SD-to-CF-Adatptor) under Windows Vista? Thank you for an answer solving the problem.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>problem exists absolutely independently of USB-port, SD-Card, Card-Reader! It is a pure dependence of Operating system: Windows XP SP3&nbsp;is working, but&nbsp;Windows 2000 SP4&nbsp;and Windows Vista SP2&nbsp;are not!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;behaviour is the same&nbsp;with EVERY card-reader here&nbsp;(hama, c-enter, lantec, teac, etc. - there is also a Diskette/CF/SD-reader-combo-drive)</p>
<p>- behaviour is the same with EVERY SD-Card here&nbsp;(Platinum, Lexar, Kingston, Xmorestore, green,&nbsp;etc.)</p>
<p>Behaviour is only dependent on OS:&nbsp;Windows XP&nbsp;SP3 is&nbsp;working fine, but Windows&nbsp;2000 SP4 and Windows Vista SP2 are not!</p>
<p>- EVERY&nbsp;CARD-READER here has&nbsp;DIRECT ACCES&nbsp;to SDHC-card (4-8GB) IN SD-CARD-SLOT when using&nbsp;under WINDOWS-XP and works fine</p>
<p>- EVERY card-reader here has NO DIRECT ACCESS AND HANGS when inserting SDHC&nbsp;under Windows 2000 and Windows Vista into SD-Card-Slot&nbsp;and any SDHC-Car can only be accessed when using&nbsp;SD-to-CF-ADAPTOR</p>
<p>- EVERY Card Reader does read SD-cards up to 2GB without problems in the SD-card slot, but NO SDHC in the SD-card slot (SDHC works with CF-Adaptor in CF-Slot)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With ALL devices, device manager is reporting: "GENERIC USB DEVICE" and with the Floppy/Card-Reader-Combo "FLOPPY DISK DRIVE".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, neither any SD-card nor any Card-Reader are findable with that search tool you linked to - and that is not suprising as Card-Readers are accessed through generic drivers. Please enter ANY Brand of RAM (Infineon etc.), or any model and manufacturer
 of harddisks: it won't show any result. It does not seem that this tool is applicable for generic storage devices!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It really looks&nbsp;that there is a generic SDHC-driver provided only for Windows XP, but not for Windows Vista. But it can be installed as a patch for Windows Vista without SP (cf. KB936825), but is&nbsp;not applicable when having installed SP1 or even SP2 - and
 that means: "direct support for SDHC" is given in Windows XP (SP3) and can be installed for outdated Windows Vista without SP, but cannot be installed for Vista SP1 or Vista SP2 ...</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check whether you face the same issue while logging in the safe mode. It is a possibility that there is some third party application or a driver is causing this issue. Let us boot into the safe mode and check. If you are able to use the ESC key in
 safe mode we can perform a clean boot to find the root cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Follow steps and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step 1: Try to login into Safe Mode.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Boot the computer in Safe mode and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to start the computer in safe mode.
</span><span>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</span></span></p>

                    <p>Windows7 SP1 64Bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC Freezing....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opened Mange\Windows Event Viewer. &nbsp;Many entries within minutes of one another; Event 7023; Service Control Manager......"The IPsec Policy Agent Service Terminated with the following Error: &nbsp;The requester Service Provider could not be loaded &nbsp;or Initialized.</p>

</p><p>Went to SERVICES; IPsec Policy Agent this service showed Manual, Right click clicked START....Windows could not start the IPsec Policy Agent on Local computer. &nbsp;Error 10106: The requested service provider could not be loaded or Initialized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things that will not run&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Windows Update....going to Computer\Properties\Windows Update....PC Freezes.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Ran sfc /scannow.....1st time....showed there were corrupted files that it was able to Repair. &nbsp;Ran it a second time and showed No Violations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what to do next. &nbsp;Did check Microsoft Security essentials.....it shows last Update 7/8...so Update is impacting this software as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key issue seems to me to be the Event Viewer ERROR that is showing frequently as outlined above. &nbsp;Or at least, if there are multiple issues, ie Windows Update\Windows Update Service won't run....System Restore won't run...its turned off and won't turn
 back on......that one may need to be corrected 1st. &nbsp;</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
</span>I understand how frustrating if things don’t work as expected.<br />
<br />
Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
The issue could be due to some third party program causing the issue. I would suggest you to boot the computer into safe mode.
<br />
<br />
Start your computer in safe mode<br />

<br />
If you are not facing the issue in safe mode, then I would suggest you to perform clean boot.

            <p>I'm having exactly the same problem.&nbsp; I don't recall installing anything specific, and it had been a couple of weeks since my last reboot.&nbsp; Everything was fine until I rebooted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once I logged back&nbsp;in after the reboot, there was about a 4-5 minute period
 where I could move the mouse and start some programs, but most system-related programs wouldn't do anything.&nbsp; I couldn't get anything in the control panel to start, nor the event viewer.&nbsp; Task manager would start but if I tried to enable showing processes
 from all users it would lock up.&nbsp; After 4-5 minutes, they all started responding again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I noticed that many network-related system services stopped functioning altogether .&nbsp; They wouldn't start even though they are enabled.&nbsp; Most display similar errors (error 10106:&nbsp; The requested service provider could not be loaded or initialized.).&nbsp;
 The FTP server won't start, Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service won't start, Peer Networking Grouping won't start, Peer Name Resolution Protocol won't start, Windows Update won't start ("Windows Update cannot currently check for updates, because the
 service is not running."; it terminates with error %%-2147014790), Background Information Transfer Service won't start (one message says the error is %%-2147014790, another says it's 0x8007277A).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even more bizarre--some programs can't resolve DNS host names.&nbsp; Internet Explorer, Battle.net and Steam all work, but Newsbin Pro, nslookup and ping don't.&nbsp; This probably has to do with some of the background services that won't start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restored a full system backup from about a week ago but after rebooting it, I ended up in exactly the same boat.&nbsp; I have even older backups, but I'd rather not have to restore from an image from that long ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be something stupidly simple that's gone wrong, like a corrupt file or registry entry that causes one service to fail to start, cascading through the system, affecting a lot of other services.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I don't know of a way to easily trace
 the problem back to its origin--the event log isn't very helpful in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run sfc /scannow and found no problems.&nbsp; I've run a boot-time chkdsk and not found any corruption.&nbsp; The system starts quickly and without error in safe mode.&nbsp; I've used msconfig to turn off all system services and startup programs.&nbsp; The system doesn't
 hang at boot time, but not much works either.&nbsp; Once I start re-enabling services (starting with the most basic, core services), there is no "aha" moment where enabling a particular service creates a notable startup delay.&nbsp; Startup just gets progressively slower
 with each service I enable.&nbsp; Eventually, once enough of them are enabled to allow me to try to use the network, I see the same symptoms I do now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than restoring to a month and half-old image (which may still not work), are there any other suggestions?</p>

            <p>I forgot to mention--along with all the network service problems, my system stopped recognizing all USB drives, no matter their source.&nbsp; I've tried both SD cards in an external&nbsp;card reader and USB sticks plugged directly into my machine.&nbsp; Device Manager
 simply says "This device cannot start. (Code 10)".&nbsp; The driver for these devices is, in all cases, from Microsoft, version 6.1.7600.16385 (disk.sys and partmgr.sys).&nbsp; Other USB devices, such as my keyboard and mouse, work just fine.</p>

    <title>IPv4 connectivity on a WEP ad hoc network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> han t  say:</h3>
<h2>            IPv4 connectivity on a WEP ad hoc network</h2>
                    I am trying to create a ad hoc network for my house but it seems that my windows 7 computer doesn't want to share it's internet.&nbsp; I have made ad hoc connections on my windows vista before, and it has work, but now when I try my windows 7 doesn't want to
 connect.&nbsp; So now I believe that the only connectivity problem is with my windows 7, it always says:<br />
"IPv4 Connectivity:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Internet Access"<br />
"IPv6 Connectivity:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Internet Access"<br />
Everything SEEMS to be in order but the IPv4 and IPv6 connections, this only shows up on a wireless signal.<br />
<br />
Both computers are HP.&nbsp; Windows 7 computer is a HP Touchsmart300 PC, Windows Vista computer is a HP Pavilion dv6000.

Hi,<br />
<br />
Release and renew IP. This should help.<br />
To release and renew your IP address:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to Start &gt; Run <br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type cmd and select OK.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type ipconfig /release and press ENTER.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the prompt returns, type ipconfig /renew, then hit Enter.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type Exit and press ENTER to close the window.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Check if this helps in getting Internet Connection.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems like the Internet Protocol Suite i.e TCP/IP&nbsp; needs to be reset to its original state. This will ensure that the system looks into the new router IP address.
<br />
However, before going into TCP/IP reset, you can try disabling and re-enabling IP/V6. In most cases this helps. Check if this applies in your scenario too.<br />
<br />
Method 1: <br />
<br />
Step 1: Disable IP/V6<br />
<br />
Follow the steps to disable IP/V6<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; View Network Status and tasks (under Network and Internet)<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chose Manage Network Connections on the left side menu<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click Local Area Connection and choose Properties<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the pop-up box, uncheck the following: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK and then restart your computer.<br />
<br />
Step 2: Enable IP/V6:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow steps 1 to 3 from above.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o In the pop-up box, put a checkmark on Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6).<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK and then restart your computer.<br />
<br />
Test your internet connection. If you can connect, you’re through with this post. If you still face the same problem, you can go ahead with TCP/IP reset.<br />
<br />
Method2 : Reset TCP/IP<br />
<br />
You must be logged on to the computer as an administrator to do so.<br />
<br />
The article below has a Fix It automated solution to reset TCP/IP. My suggestion is to click on the Fix it link to run it. However, if you are convenient with the NetShell utility, you may perform the steps on your own.
<br />
<br />
Detailed information is in the article below:<br />

Hope it helps.

    <title>Windows 10 Unattended Installation Help - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> direjester  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Unattended Installation Help</h2>
                    <p>We have quite a few users who are going to be upgrading from (mostly) Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 Pro soon. I will be using a USB memory stick installed using the Windows 10 boot software. I would like to create an unattended installation media to save a lot
 of time in installing 10 on each laptop. I found a nice <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3020-windows-10-image-customize-audit-mode-sysprep.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows 10 Image Customization in Audit Mode">
link</a> that gave a lot of information, but not exactly what I'm after. </p>
I'd like to:
<p>-Know that a (semi) automatic installation of Windows 10 is even possible (difficulty doesn't matter)</p>
<p>-Understand what exactly an answer sheet is</p>
<p>-Find out how to create an Unattend.xml file for Windows 10</p>
<p>-Point the Setup process to the answer file</p>
<p>-Ensure the unattended installation of Windows 10 is compatible with all "tops" (desk/lap) that run 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, after the installation is compete, I would like to have the following:</p>
<p>-Software to be used on all laptops (Outlook, Firefox, etc., proof of concept will work fine)</p>
<p>-Network information with SSID and password</p>
<p>-Domain added with credentials (user/pass)</p>
Any information would be useful, and I thank whomever provides pretty much any relevant information.

            Hi! Thank you for getting back to me about my question.<br />
<br />
I followed the steps outlined to see if they could get my Ease of Access Center to load.<br />
<br />
I started my laptop in safe mode per the instructions in Step 1. I tried to open my Ease of Access Center through the control panel and I still received the same message "Page Failed to Load"<br />
<br />
I then restarted the computer normally and performed a clean boot per the instructions in Step 2. I did not perform the clean boot from Safe Mode. I restarted the computer in normal mode and then set up the clean boot from there. I am not sure if that matters
 but I want to give the best possible information&nbsp; to those of you who are trying to help me.<br />
<br />
After the clean boot, I received the same message when trying to load the Ease of Access Center:
<br />
"Page Failed to Load."<br />
<br />
I then restarted the computer in normal mode with all of my usual startup and other processes and ran the SFC program in the Command Prompt per Method 2. I received this message: "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."<br />
<br />
I closed the SFC program and went to check on the Ease of Access Center. Same message as usual: "Page Failed to Load"<br />
<br />
Any help or tips are greatly appreciated. <br />
<br />
I have not made any changes to my laptop recently. I did add more RAM when I first got the computer about 2 years ago (I think, I am not totally sure when I got the computer)<br />

    <title>Screen is dimming for dark window images - IE and Media PLayer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Screen is dimming for dark window images - IE and Media PLayer</h2>
                    I have Vista Home Prem on a Dell Desktop - OEM installed.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
When a dark image opens in a window like a webpage with dark back ground in internet explorer or a video with dark intro in Media Player- the screen is automatially dimming.&nbsp; I really can't stand this feature - esp for websites -where you are trying to read
 light text on a dark background.<br />
<br />
<br />
This started a few months ago and I have searching for a solution - I can not beleive no one else has this issue.&nbsp; I have found some notes regarding Application&nbsp;Sharing and having to go into the registry to edit but this seems like it is tied to Live Meeting.<br />

            Hi PaulJMoore,<br />
<br />
Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers forum.<br />
Try performing a clean boot. If this is the case it means that there is a program trying to optimize your video experience and once you target the application affecting the video, then you can change its settings or remove it.<br />
<br />
I am including the knowledge base article below to assist you in a <strong>clean</strong>
<strong>boot</strong> process. <br />

                    I have a Windows 10 Pro computer with multiple local user accounts that have separate desktop icons and desktop icon settings.&nbsp; The computer was upgraded from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; The problem I have is that the desktop icon settings for the
 arrangement of the desktop icons is not being consistently saved between user switching, logoff and reboots of the computer.&nbsp; I also have intermittent occurrences of a desktop.ini file being saved in the Desktop sub folder of Users on the C drive for users
 when they log off or the computer is switched between users or the computer is rebooted when multi users are logged on to the computer.&nbsp; Is there something I can do to keep this from occurring? &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

                    When I go to settings/update and security/ windows security and press "open windows defender security centre" the blue screen with windows defender opens up and then goes off and puts me back to where I was. I'm concerned that the security centre may have
 been overridden somehow. I've tried several restarts with the same result.

<br />
<br />1. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter

<br />
<br />3. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try these suggestions:
<br />
<br />Run services.msc to open Services Manager. Ensure that the Windows Defender service is started and set to Automatic.
<br />
<br />You may need to re-register the following dll files and see if it helps you. Run each command in an elevated command prompt one after the other and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />regsvr32 wuaueng.dll
<br />regsvr32 wucltui.dll
<br />regsvr32 softpub.dll
<br />regsvr32 wintrust.dll
<br />regsvr32 initpki.dll
<br />regsvr32 wups.dll
<br />regsvr32 wuweb.dll
<br />regsvr32 atl.dll
<br />regsvr32 mssip32.dll
<br /> 
<br />Also run regedit command and navigate to the following key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender
<br />
<br />Here ensure that the value of these DWORDS is 1 : DisableAntiSpyware and DisableAntiVirus.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<p>Thank you Vijay. I followed 1 and 2 above. That may have solved the issue - for several attempts afterwards Defender would not open, but after repeated attempts it did finally open, and all areas were ticked. However, after a restart I had the same problem
 and Defender would not open from settings menu despite repeated attempts. It did, however, open from the "hidden icon" screen. I'm currently running a full scan with Defender.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

    <title>Hearing beeping noise while pressing q button on keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hearing beeping noise while pressing q button on keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Hearing a beeping noise when I press Q</p>
<p>My Q key started emitting a beeping noise in my headphones when I use it, once when I press it and once when I release it (kind of sounds like push-to-talk). Sometimes I will even hear the default windows 'alert noise' in addition to the beeping. &nbsp;I disabled
 sticky keys and filter keys to no avail and haven't found anything in my 'ease of access' settings that would cause this. I use my Q key a lot when gaming, sometimes holding it down for 5-10 seconds, so I figure it must have started there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

    <title>Constant disconnections and error codes. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roy himo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Constant disconnections and error codes.</h2>
                    
<p>This is an issue that has plagued me for months. Every day at EXACTLY 5 PM for about 6-7 months my Xbox would disconnect me. If I logged back onto Xbox Live, it would let me play for maybe 5-10 minutes, but the connection would be wonky and I would have
 severe trouble accessing online servers for some games. GTA V, Mass Effect 3, Black Ops 2, Halo, and other various games. Eventually though after that 5-10 minute span, it would disconnect me again, and every time I try to reconnect, it would stop me from
 reconnecting for 5-10 MORE MINUTES before deciding it'll allow me only only to rinse and repeat. The problem in it's entirety persists anywhere from only having disconnected me once, to 5 CONTINUOUS HOURS OF CONNECTION ISSUES. Now, I will go on record and
 say that I have adapted to it before, every day at 5 PM, shut off my Xbox when I get disconnected, throw on a movie, go for a walk, whatever. And I will also say that if this problem occurred at 5 AM instead, I wouldn't care in the slightest.</p>
<p>Now, the main reason I am making a post now, is because the problem get SEVERELY worse in the last 3 weeks. Happening anywhere from 12 PM to 12 AM, all hours when I am up and available and want to play with my friends. Constantly getting disconnected, and
 when I try to reconnect, it says I can't, and I always get error code 80151904, or error code 8015190E. I looked up both codes, and followed guidelines for how to fix them. Fiddled with my router, deleted my profile and redownloaded it, updated my security
 in case that was it, cleared my cache, and all manner of things. All of which has done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to resolve the problem. And it has only gotten worse and worse in recent weeks.</p>
<p>I make this post in the hopes that I may receive answers and resolve my problem, though I doubt it will happen. I saw a post made before of someone with the same issue, only he was far worse than I, and so far, all the answers he was given on how to fix
 it, were things I have already tried. There is one "fix" I have not yet tried, and don't intend to because somebody else already confirmed that it didn't work. The "fix" was to remove the Xbox Hard Drive and use a Thumb Drive or external Hard Drive that has
 already been made Xbox ready, and turn the Xbox on without the hard drive in it and only using the thumb/external drive.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no faith in Microsoft or it's "support team", I'd probably be better off &nbsp;taking advice from random strangers online, hence the post.</p>

<p><span><span>Hello dgbikeme,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting. You can change the way that the desktop background picture is displayed by following these steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on the desktop away from any icons</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Personalization</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Desktop Background</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Locate the “How should the picture be positioned” heading</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the picture that you are using is being stretched to the width of the screen and it is being distorted I would recommend that you select the “Centered” option</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Ok</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using Wallpaper that is included in Vista, scroll down in the window that previews the pictures and you will see a selection of “Wide Screen” photos.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can try these to see if they are a better fit to your laptops display.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this information is helpful.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Jack</span></p>

<h2>            Set time and 3D text as screensaver at the same time</h2>
                    <p>Tried googling this, but I'm curious if there is a way to use the custom text on the 3D Text Screen saver but still add the time to it. I tried "random %time%" (without the quotes) just for giggles, but it did not work unfortunately.</p>
