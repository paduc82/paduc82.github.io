            <p><span>Hi Dr. Raza Gardezi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could be due to corrupted icon cache.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s delete the icon cache and check if it helps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, click on
<strong>Control panel</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Folder Options</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click the <strong>View</strong> tab.</span></li><li><span>Under <strong>Advanced settings</strong>, click
<strong>Show hidden files, folders, and drives</strong>, and uncheck </span><strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Hide extensions for known file types</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Navigate to the following location:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>C:\Users\User-Name\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Delete the contents from the Explorer folder.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Clearing the thumbnail cache will only empty the cache and not delete it. The cache will rebuild
 itself as Windows reloads the thumbnail images for the icons back into the cache as you navigate through File Explorer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep us posted on the status of the issue.</span></p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
From your issue description, I understand that apps on start screen are not connecting to Internet.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Could you please answer the following questions so that I can help you in a better way.</div>
<div><br />
1. Do you receive any error message when you try connecting to internet?<br />
2. Are you using any proxy connections for connecting to internet?<br />
3. What is the security software installed on the computer?<br />
4. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div><br />
Now let’s try some steps for resolving this issue, which I have described as methods given below.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>You may refer to the link to download and run the app troubleshooter on the computer which checks for any issues with the Windows apps on the computer:</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 1:<br />
</strong>Run the App Troubleshooter</div>
<div>Before I provide the steps for app troubleshooter, I would like to let you know about basic information before running an app:<br />
&gt; User Account Control settings must be enabled.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> User Account Control (UAC) notifies you before changes are made to your PC that requires administrator-level permission. By default, UAC is set to notify you whenever apps try to make changes to your PC, but you can change how often UAC
 notifies you.<br />
&gt; To snap apps, you need a screen resolution of at least 1366 x 768.<br />
&gt; Requires Microsoft Account.</div>
<div><strong>Note</strong>: The troubleshooter automatically fixes some issues that might prevent your apps from running, including suboptimal screen resolution and incorrect security or account settings.</div>
<div><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2:<br />
</strong>Please go through the following link for troubleshooting further if the troubleshooter does not help:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>If you have enabled any proxy connection on the computer, I would suggest you to disable it and check if it helps.<br />
You may follow the steps to do so:<br />
a) Open Internet Explorer on the desktop.<br />
b) Click on Tools icon option on the top right corner.<br />
c) Select Internet Option from the list.<br />
d) Click on Connection tab.<br />
e) Click on LAN Settings.<br />
f) Uncheck the box which says “Use a Proxy Server for your LAN".<br />
g) Click on OK.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong>I would have you clear the Windows Store cache.<br />
Refer the steps-<br />
a) Click on the “Windows+R” key simultaneously and type “WSReset.exe” (without the quotes) and hit “Enter”.<br />
b) Now, try to launch and connect to the app store.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 4:<br />
</strong>I would suggest you to temporarily disable Antivirus security software installed on your computer and check if it helps.<br />
<strong>Important Note:</strong> Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. <br />
If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Hope the above information helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Do let us know if you have any other queries pertaining to Windows in the future. We will be happy to help.<br />

<h2>            Does not recognize keyboard after update on 6&#47;14</h2>
                    I have the standard keyboard/cover (Model 1535) for my Surface Pro 8, been using it for a year now with no problem. &nbsp;Yesterday, after an update, it now does not recognize my keyboard. &nbsp;What should I do? &nbsp;<em>Is anyone else having this issue?</em>&nbsp;

            <p>Hi tkufeldt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting the Surface Community! That doesn't sound good that your keyboard is no longer working after the most recent update on 6/14/14.<br />
</p>
<p>Could you verify that you are using the Type Cover (original version)?<br />
When you installed the update, was the keyboard attached to the device?<br />
I see that your Cover is not recognized; but just to confirm, you can use neither the keys nor the touchpad, correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,&nbsp;try a 2 button shutdown:</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Power off the Surface Pro<br />
<strong>2) </strong>Hold Volume Up and the Power button for 10 seconds<br />
<strong>3) </strong>Release buttons<br />
<strong>4) </strong>Wait 5-10 seconds<br />
<strong>5) </strong>Power on the Surface</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon!</p>

    <title>Unable to play video file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasmine deberry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to play video file</h2>
                    I recently made a movie with the 2011 version of Windows Live Movie Maker and then tried to play it on my lap top (I made it on a different computer), but when I tried to open it up on my lap top, a pop-up window came up and said "Windows Media Player
 cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file." I tried downloaded VLC player and the K-Lite Codec Pack 1400 Full, but they both still could not play the file on my lap top.
 Is there something else that I could download or use to play the video on my lap top or on another computer that does not have the 2011 version of Windows Live Movie Maker?

<p>Hello Jasmine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file. You might encounter this error message for one of the following reasons:<br />
<br />
a) The file type is supported by the Player, but the file was compressed by using a codec that is not supported by the Player.<br />
b) The file might have been encoded by using a codec that is not supported by Windows Media Player. If this is the case, Windows Media Player cannot play the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you with your concern, I'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the file type of the video file that you're trying to play? You can check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/316992/file-types-supported-by-windows-media-player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>to make sure that the file is supported by Windows Media Player.</li><li>Kindly check the file size of the video file, right-click on it and select Properties. There's a possibility that if the file size is small then it could be corrupted.</li><li>Were there any recent changes made prior to this issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>I'd recommend performing a full reboot of your laptop, and see if that helps resolve the audio issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, then I'd look into resetting your Xbox App but clicking on Settings &gt; Apps and finding Xbox app in the list.&nbsp; From there, click the app and select "Advanced options" on that next page click "Reset".&nbsp; Let it do it's thing and then try
 the app and streaming again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if those don't resolve your issue.</p>

</p><p>My Skype randomly stopped picking up my voice from my mic. It is registering that my mic is available, as well my PC registers my mic is available and working correctly. It seems to be happening only in Skype calls(tried the test call as well and nothing),
 I am able to speak in other applications such as Discord, Mumble, ect. Not sure what exactly happened, would appreciate any help!</p>

    <title>Teredo IP Address issue when attempting to check multiplayer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luisimo rocks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Teredo IP Address issue when attempting to check multiplayer connection on XBOX One</h2>
                    
<p>For the past few days i have been attempting to fix an issue regarding not being able to connect to multiplayer due with the error regarding a Teredo IP address. I believe it is related to my NAT type which currently says that it is behind a firewall. I
 am currently using the Draytek vigor 120 modem and an apple time machine as a router.</p>
<p>Any help would be really appreciated!!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I've read about this before. The apple time capsule blocks Teredo tunnels by default.</p>
<p>I have copy and pasted this from the network hardware forums.</p>
<p>Known issues</p>
<p>On the Xbox One, if you are having issues getting into multiplayer gaming with this router, it may be blocking Teredo tunnels. This is a setting that is left unchecked by default on this router.</p>
<p>To allow Teredo tunnels:</p>
<p>1.Open the AirPort Admin Utility. (It is installed in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder on a Macintosh computer, and in Start &gt; All Programs &gt; AirPort on computers using Windows.)</p>
<p>2.With the Utility open select your device from the menu on the left.</p>
<p>3.Select Advanced from the menu at the top.</p>
<p>4.Select the tab labeled IPv6 Firewall.</p>
<p>5.Check the option to Allow Teredo tunnels.</p>
<p>6.Select Update.</p>

<p>Tranquillo, non hai buttato via niente ;)</p>
<p>Prima cosa prova a ripetere il download. Anche qui sul sito se vai su Account troverai sotto la voce "Storico Marketplace" lo storico degli acquisti e codici riscattati. Aggiungi i giochi alla coda dei download e una volta che accendi la console ripeterà
 il download.</p>
<p>Se il problema dovesse persistere prova ad eliminare prima il file dalla console andando nella memoria ed eliminando il gioco incompleto. Poi, come prima, fai ripetere il download del gioco dallo storico degli acquisti che verrà scaricato appena accendi
 la console.</p>
<p>E' molto probabile che ci sia stato un problema nel download, ripetendolo dovrebbe risolversi senza ulteriori problemi :)</p>

<h2>            &#34;Windows explorer has stopped working&#34;&#47;&#34;windows is restarting&#34;</h2>
                    I recently started getting these message errors about 3 or 4 days ago.&nbsp;When I&nbsp;try to open my personal folders and other WINDOWS related folders, I recieve this:<br />
<br />
<p>Window #1:</p>
<p>Windows Explorer has stopped working.</p>
<p>Windows is searching for a solution.</p>
<p>Option: Cancel box</p>
<p>Window #2:</p>
<p>Windows Explorer is restarting.</p>
<p>Option: Cancel box<br />
<br />
I "chatted" with two HP representatives and they suggested that I had viruses and that the viruses were the cause of the problem. One of them made me try "MalWareBytes". The other suggested that I use "SUPERspyware". Both services found viruses/spyware and
 hopefully, they are gone. I currently am using Verizon Internet Security Suite and do not plan on getting rid of it. All I want to know is how do I fix this issue? I do not want to pay to fix this because I am a full time college student and fall semester
 is in a few days.&nbsp; I am running on Windows Vista Home Premium and have a HP Pavilion a6519fh PC (Intel Premium Dual-Core Desktop Processor E2180 ). HELP ME PLEASE!! Thanks :)</p>

            Hello people, seems like some fellas out there are still having trouble with this random crashes. I have the same problem except that it occurs whenever I access my multimedia archive on my network storage. It would seem that there's a bug or something
 with windows that causes this problem when you access a media storage folder like mine, especially when the file size is extremely large(I archive all my movie discs there for convenience and streaming =), about 1TB of data). Windows try to generate the thumbnail
 images for your files and thus crashes explorer.
<div><br />
<div>I've solved this by going to My Computer &gt; click on "Organize" tab (top left) &gt; folder and search options &gt; view tab. Check "Always show icons, never thumbnails" option and uncheck "Display file icon on thumbnails". This stops windows from generating the
 images and solved the problem for me. Less visually flashy yes, but at least no need for a wipe and restart =).</div>
<div><br />

<p>Hello EmilMuzz,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Since&nbsp;you are still having problems after a SFC scan with corrupt files it couldn't fix, then&nbsp;you can try a
<strong>In-Place Upgrade</strong> which will do a repair of the operating system.&nbsp;You will need to have the DVD installation disc from the PC manufacturer.
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">BACK UP</span></strong> all of your data&nbsp;you want to save just incase something goes wrong!<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Note:</strong> After performing In-Place Upgrade, your personal data and installed programs will not be removed but&nbsp;you may need to run Windows Update to install all the available updates for your system to update these
 system files to the current version. This troubleshooting process is time consuming and may take several hours to complete.
</span></p>
<p><span>If your DVD installation disk is prior to Sp1, and you have SP1 installed on your computer, you will need to uninstall SP1 to complete the in-place upgrade and then reinstall the necessary windows updates.
 This applies if you have SP2 also.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you would like to perform the In-place Upgrade, let’s refer to the following steps.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Start the computer by using the current Operating System.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Insert the Windows Vista DVD in the computer's DVD drive.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Use one of the following procedures, as appropriate:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>• If Windows automatically detects the DVD, the
<strong>Install Now</strong> screen appears. Click <strong>Install Now</strong>. </span>
</p>
<p><span>• If Windows does not automatically detect the DVD, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click <strong>Start</strong>, click
<strong>Run</strong>, type <strong>Drive:\setup.exe</strong>, and then click <strong>
OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Note Drive is the drive letter of the computer's DVD drive.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click <strong>Install Now</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. When you reach the "<strong>Which type of installation do you want</strong>?" screen, click
<strong>Upgrade</strong> to upgrade the current operating system to Windows Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you. Let us know either way. Make it a great day!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<p><strong>This is not surprising as I bought the software and installed it in March but only started to use the machine I had installed it to a couple of days ago.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I've tried activating by phone but that doesn't work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have investigated and it would appear that the producd id is not a genuine one, at least that is what I'm being told. However I don't know if thats because the productID I am using is not genuine OR the product ID has been flagged with microsoft
 as expired because of the 30 day expiry issue and that it was genuine before. I need to know this for sure before I go back to the supplier of the software.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can anyone help?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thanks</strong></p>

<p>Your Windows Product ID: 00359-<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>231</strong></span>-7645166-86901</p>
<p>Lately there have been several reports of instances of blocked MSDN keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media and reciepts, if you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the store you purchased
 it from and report it to www.microsoft.com/piracy&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you have purchased a key, with or without DVD's or packaging from EBAY or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN key because your key has been blocked you can check a few things yourself, if you received your key with the physical product
 go to www.microsoft.com/howtotell and verify your product however some counterfeit software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.<br />
<br />
To check your PID press the win key and pause at the same time, or open system properties through the control panel, scroll down to activation section and look at the PID It will look something like this 12345-067-1234567-54321, the portion you are interested
 in is the three digit section, if it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have an MSDN key.<br />
<br />
065, 066, 067, 068 for Ultimate, 220 area for Pro and the 230, <strong>231</strong> , 221 area for<strong>Home Premium</strong> , there are probably others but they should be close to those posted<br />
<br />
If you have a similar PID, or your key is blocked and you want confirmation post a new thread with a report from the MGADIAG tool, download and run the tool, click copy and paste it in a new post here and Darin Smith from MS can verify your key for you. NEVER
 post your key, the report will suffice.<br />

<h2>            Windows Update not working,bits query state is STOP_PENDING &#40;NOT_STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows Update</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last month, I encountered a problem with my Windows Update system. When I check the Update screen to see what is being downloaded, it remains on 0%. I've tried many&nbsp;given solutions to the problem, including:</p>
<p>-net stop bits/wuauserv (says it's starting or stopping, try again later)</p>
<p>-Service config</p>
<p>-Reset Windows Update (WinReset)</p>
<p>-Disabling and reenabling Bits and Windows Update (didn't work)</p>
<p>-Sfc scan (nothing found)</p>
<p>-Windows update troubleshooter (also says nothing is wrong)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I've done sc query bits, which came back saying that the service's state is STOP_PENDING (NOT_STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN). I haven't been able to find why the state has been stuck in this position and few solutions have been
 given to fix it (and the ones that have haven't worked). If there is anyway to fix this problem, please help.</p>

            <p>Sorry for not responding earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the advice, after doing the clean boot, I was able to download the updates. There were some hiccups with it (I had to restart the download a couple of times), but ultimately it managed to work. Having said that, I feel that the problem will pop
 up again and I would prefer to not have to clean boot the computer everytime a new update comes around, so here's the situation with my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) It started happening a month ago, as that's when the first update appeared, but didn't download properly. At this time, I also had issues with my internet cutting out at random times, even when other computers or otherwise had no problem connecting to
 the internet at the same time, so they may be connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I changed out my Mcafee product at that point in time and downloaded Java to the computer. For the former, I switched to Total Protection from Lifesafe as I had a previous subscription to the former and didn't want to start up a new one for the latter.
 As for Java, I only used it briefly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) None that pop up on the screen, I only noticed this problem when looking up the Windows Update setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps in figuring out this problem.</p>

            Yes, this will be because of the Ethernet cable, since the connection is either wired or wireless, you can't receive both.

<p>
</p><p>The well-known methods (group policy editor, editing the registry manually, using a dodgy tweak tool) that appeaar in the first 5000 Google results, no longer work in the anniversary update. That's right, not even the
<strong>built in </strong>group policy setting doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to clarify: when I press Win+L, I want it to display the login prompt. NOT a pretty picture that requires a keystroke+slight delay before I can enter my password.</p>

            <p>Anyone? I want this useless screen gone. All it does it display the time and pretty good-for-nothing picture. It's impractical for actual office use. It requires a keystroke to go away, and that's really all it adds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, put the login prompt ON the lock screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, when I've locked my pc, and I return to it later, I want to be able to type my password
<strong>right away</strong> and get back to work. Requiring a keystroke before entering the password is nonsense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So again, how to disable the lockscreen? For real this time?</p>

            <p>Hi...you cannot disable Lock Screen,..... but you <em>can</em> disable 'sign-in' if you want...</p>
<p>Read this thread '<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/killing-the-sign-on-password-in-windows-10/1ccb3bde-b50c-4384-8003-07a3b23c625f">Killing the Sign-on Password</a>.'</p>
<p>Your windows will boot into your desktop.</p>
<p>BTway...what's wrong with the Lock screen view ?...I still have it working and in use on many of my systems...I like to have my personal choices of pictures for each different system.... and I have ten of them.</p>
<p><strong>or</strong></p>
<p>Have you created a simple four digit pin number password?</p>
<p>When the lock screen comes up just type in the four digits and you are on your way.</p>

            <p>I want it gone, because it is utterly useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, all it does is display a pretty picture and introduce the requirement to press a key before logging in. How is that useful, other than for aesthetic reasons?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottomline is: to me and surely a LOT of others, the lock screen makes no sense whatsoever, and we want it GONE.</p>

            <p>That's good and all, but still how do I disable the lock screen??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had it disabled in the pre-summer update version of Windows 10, but it got enabled again, and all tricks to disable it, will fail. Ergo, disabling the lockscreen that way has been removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words: <strong>how do I disable the lock screen in the post-summer update of Windows 10?</strong></p>

<p>No you can not just extract to an .ISO and then use that to create a bootable DVD.</p>
<p>Even if you could you may have defective recovery&nbsp;media in which case the error would not be eliminated.</p>
<p>Order a set of replacment media. Use it to reinstall Windows, then delete/uninstall the bloatware and make yourself a set of custom recovery media.</p>
<p>How to use windows 7’s Backup and Restore to create your own customized set of recovery DVD media.<br />

<p>If you have just installed Windows 7 or purchased a new PC but do not have an external hard drive to store image backups, using Windows 7’s Backup and Restore ‘System Image’ feature is a great method for creating your very own custom set of recovery media.
 You can use the recovery media you created in lieu of the manufacture’s recovery disc or partition.</p>

<h2>            E68&#58; Point Rouge Sur Le Bouton De D&#38;&#35;233&#59;marrage</h2>
                    
<p>Bonjour tous le monde! Hier, lorsque je jouais à Forza Horizon sur la <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em><strong>Xbox 360 Slim</strong></em></span>, une lumière rouge s'est allumée de façon continue sur le
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>bouton de démarrage</strong></em></span>. Il y avait un message à l'écran (E68). C'est la première fois que cela m'arrive et je n'ai aucune idée de quoi il s'agit. Par contre, j'ai visionné beaucoup de vidéos
 sur YouTube à ce sujet. J'ai débranché les fils qui relient la Xbox 360 à la TV et ceux qui relient la Xbox à la prise électrique, mais rien ne fonctionne, le point lumineux rouge ne change pas en vert. Ma console est-elle brisée? Ah oui et j'ai aussi un disque
 dur de 320 GB... Peut être que je devrai le changer... &nbsp;À l'aide!!</p>
