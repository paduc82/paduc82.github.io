<h2>            I have a Windows 7 new build and constant crashing starting since Windows update&#63;</h2>
                    I just built a new desktop running Windows 7 and everything was good for a little while (about 2 months) then I had some windows updates that came through and after that I started getting some freezes. The freeze screen looks like this:&nbsp;<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/110509630105120760697/September192012#5790017628663946818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://picasaweb.google.com/110509630105120760697/September192012#5790017628663946818</a>&nbsp;.
 My build consists of:

</div>
<div>

GIGABYTE GA-Z77-DS3H Board

Intel Core i5-3570K CPU

2 sticks of ADATA 4GB DDR3 RAM

Seagate 1TB HDD&nbsp;

24x DVDRW&nbsp;

Ultra 650W PSU

</div>
<div>I'm not a newb at changing stuff around on my computer but if you have a definitive solution I'm down for listening as long as you explain the steps clearly. I'll include the log. Hopefully someone has seen something like this and thanks again!</div>

            I'm sorry, it was not an assumption that all of it would be read. I included it all because I didn't know what I should or shouldn't include (or more importantly what whoever is reading would need to see to solve it). System restore did not work (if I
 recall correctly it said it couldn't perform the action oddly enough).
<div><br />
<div>Is there a simple way to cut and paste the windows update history? I'd be glad to do whatever. As for knowing which update initially caused the problem it's hard to say due to the fact that this was a new build and about 120 updates hit the computer. Should
 I un-install all the updates in safe mode (works fine in safe mode) to start over? &nbsp;</div>

<h2>            input signal out of range</h2>
                    I am running with Vista.&nbsp; i attached a new monitor/tv to my computer, and when it boots up i get the message on a black screen 'input signal out of range'.&nbsp; from the little research i have done, i understand that the video settings need to be changed,
 but when i log in on safe mode, the settings will not be applied.&nbsp; i also read something about a 60hz setting but i am unable to locate where to change that.&nbsp; i also found a page advising to log in under something about a VGA, but I don't have that option
 when I hit F8 while booting.&nbsp; please help.

 is. However, since the screen is black, I can't get back into&nbsp; Vista to change the resolution. I can boot into safe mode but resolution changes there don't affect the normal windows boot.<br />
<br />
It's ridiculous that, unlike other screen settings, this one did not revert back after 15 seconds.&nbsp;Is there any way to change monitor resolutions with the monitor unavailable?

<p>Hi&nbsp;McQ_AS,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please be informed that the latest version of Skype are working on Mac OS X version 10.9 or higher. And since you have a lower version of operating system, it would not be possible for you to use Skype there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly update your operating system, if this is not possible as of the moment. You can use a different device for the meantime, to access your account and continue using your Skype services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information regarding Skype's system requirements, please refer to this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype?q=System+requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What are the system

<p>OpenOffice.org DOES appear, and when I click on it in the list and click <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

 comes up with "A system error occured, or there isn't enough memory to start Microsoft Access. Close uneeded programs and try again." I don't have any other programs open and this system has 3BG of ram. I really need to be able to run Access on this machine.
 Help</p>

    <title>&#91;SOLVED&#93; Win10 Upgrade Stuck at 82&#37;, Configuring Settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> next-lover  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93; Win10 Upgrade Stuck at 82&#37;, Configuring Settings</h2>
                    <p>Hi all. As per subject, &nbsp;I'm stuck on 82%, Configuring Settings (which is at 29%) for a little over an hour now. &nbsp;I've read previous topics about a version of the tech preview doing the same thing and people waiting upwards of 6+ hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is about my HD light; it's not flashing, just a solid color for this whole time. Does this mean it is frozen? It is sitting silent, too. How long should I wait until I try a forced shutdown? Is this normal?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have Bluetooth on this laptop, &nbsp;disconnected printer and also my external keyboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I deleted all the files in the install folder (SoftwareDistribution/Downloads), tried to install with admin rights via cld prompt, and failure with similar results. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is Error: &nbsp;C1900101-4000D</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am updating from Windows 8.1 x64, Toshiba laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: SOLVED! <br />
<br />
For anyone with similar problems, this is the Error: 0xC1900101-0x4000D - The installation failed in the SECOND_BOOT phase with an error during MIGRATE_DATA operation</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed all the steps here: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-troubleshoot-common-setup-and-stop-errors/324d5a5f-d658-456c-bb82-b1201f735683&nbsp;&nbsp; *Control + F the whole error code*
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also deleted everything inside the Download folder in C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download along with the $Windows.~BT folder in C:\ drive. I also disabled Windows Defender, Windows Firewall and my Anti-malware application and made sure only my mouse+keyboard
 was connected, nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The whole thing took ~3hrs. Hope this helps :)</p>

<p>I downloaded Movie Maker 2012. I already have Direct X11. Video runs much better, although still with millisecond pauses. I guess this is as good as it gets?</p>

 being taking notes. I'll admit I'm quite lazy when it comes to notes&nbsp;and that's why I hoped that Cortana would be&nbsp;able to help me this coming year&nbsp;in school. Dose&nbsp;anyone know if programmers are working on&nbsp;this or if they&nbsp;will ever update Cortana to do this
 task?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Id imagine you could say "hey Cortana take notes for me for the next 90 minutes" that way it knows when to start and when to end.</p>

            <p>Hi Jesse,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the description, I found that you are unable to use Airport Express on your computer. I will certainly help you with a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To use <strong>Airport Express, </strong>you need to install <strong>AirPort Utility
</strong>on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer the link below to download <strong>AirPort Utility 5.6.1</strong> and install the same:</p>

    <title>Need help with DMP file after Driver Verifier BSOD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> enmushroom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need help with DMP file after Driver Verifier BSOD</h2>
                    <p>I've been experiencing loads of BSODs and black screen in the past weeks, all related to "disk read error" or "recovery" and similar. I had similar issues a couple of months ago and received help from you guys after i posted about it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the instruction that i received back then i ran the Driver Verifier and stumbled in a BSOD with the error "Driver_Verifier_Detected_Violation" without any error related to a specific driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Windows 10 with Driver Signature Enforcement disabled seems to lower the number of BSODs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help with the DMP file to find out which driver is causing the BSODs (i already posted 2 weeks ago but received only a generic answer about BSODs and no actual help).</p>

<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong>Do not use device manager it may tell you the device is up to date but will not tell you if it is corrupt&nbsp;</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><strong>Search</strong> Google for the name of the driver, or go to the computer makers site.</div>
<div><span><br />
<strong>Compare</strong> the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to<br />
<strong>Visit</strong> the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).<br />
If there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program<br />

            After removing that driver my PC crashed again to a bsod and now it is completely bricked. Every time I turn it on it just shows either a recovery blue screen about errors such as "0xc0000225", "0xc0000225", "0xc000007b" and "0xc00000e9" or black screens
 saying "a disk read error has occurred", "select a proper boot device" or "missing operating system". I tried to boot it in safe mode but it just won't even start &nbsp;windows up. Is my PC's hd gone for good?

<p>

<p>

</span></p><div><span>You may be able to get into safe mode on a non booting computer by starting the boot and holding down the power button for 5 seconds to stop the boot and turn off the computer. &nbsp;Do this two times and on the third attempt you will be given advanced

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>BCC225 means Windows cannot find the System Files used for booting. The causes may be the following things.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The System files are corrupt.</p>
<p>2. The disk File system has bad configuration. </p>
<p>3. Hardware fault.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Build 7601 This Copy of Windows is not Genuine - Product Key Unable to Re-activate</h2>
                    I bought my Toshiba laptop one year ago in South Korea with Windows 7 Home Prem pre-installed. I have since returned to the UK and have no way of contacting the retailer (the shop was in a legitimate electronic shopping mall), I also have none of the Microsoft
 DVDs.<br />
<br />
The computer worked fine for over one year but now the following is happening:<br />
<br />
In the bottom right hand corner of the desk top screen it states 'Windows 7 Build 7601 This Copy of Windows is not Genuine'<br />
<br />
I also get a Windows Activation icon that keeps making a window appear and then disappear, then reappear in the middle of the screen. The window asks me to enter a product key. I entered the product key on a sticker on the base of my laptop and a new window
 appears stating that 'The product key you have entered will not work with this edition of Windows 7' and 'You must either run Windows 7 set up or enter a Windows 7 Ultimate product key'<br />
<br />
I have noticed that the product key given on the sticker on my laptop is different from the one given on the diagnosis report below.<br />
<br />
I have looked at other similar threads and found no solution but was advised to run a diagnostic tool and post the results to identify the problem.<br />
<br />
Here is a copy of the diagnosis tool:<br />

<br />
I have a bad feeling that I purchased a counterfeit copy of the software, but can't understand why it worked for so long and has suddenly stopped working.<br />
<br />
Any advice about the actual problem and any solutions would be very much appreciated, I must admit I'm not very good on computers.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any help provided.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />

            looks like you were sold fake products.
<div><br />
<div>The reason you don't post a product key is to avoid misuse, such as someone publishing it on the internet and having it installed on too many computers which results in the&nbsp;product&nbsp;key being blocked.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Unfortunately I do not see form that information where the problem may be.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problem may actually be with a component of Windows.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What I might suggest at this point is to try to capture a user-mode dump of the explorer.exe crash.<br />
<br />
You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.<br />
<br />
If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file, then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file&nbsp;at the time explorer.exe crashes&nbsp;should be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:<br />
<br />

<p>Hi there Gt3guy7315,</p>
<p>I'm very sorry that the effort you have put in has not helped you as of yet. I'm sorry to say that the Halo Reach beta has unfortunately stopped as the beta's purpose was to allow people to test and give feedback to Bungie before the game was released. If
 you would like to continue playing the campaign of Halo Reach I suggest that you download the demo of the game. Otherwise I am sorry to say that you will have to buy the game to get the other features. I hope that this helps solve your problem and good luck
 with your search :)</p>

<p>Beta was for storage (new way to add more information on DVD) and not for game, they just used Halo Reach as the medium</p>

<p>I believe there is some confusion with the OP's message. I think what he meant to say was that he participated in the Xbox beta update, where participants received a full copy of Halo: Reach in order to test disc formats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize you're having this issue. I still have the email they dispatched to the beta participants. This email should have been sent to the email associated with the gamertag you used to sign up. The email was sent September 23, 2011. That email contained
 the code needed to download your copy of Reach. The email doesn't state an expiration date, however that does not necessarily mean that there is not one. Your best bet would be to try to locate this email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also if it helps you search through old email, the address the email was sent from was *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

<p>As stated before, this was for the Xbox Dash Beta/Storage Beta update, I was in it as well.</p>
<p>Actually thinking of this, about 6 months ago I happened to think what would happen and found out a DLC code was sent to everyone in the beta (to the E-mail addresses they used to sign up with.) but I never really bothered to check as I already had a full
 retail purchased copy I bought on release date, but to my surprise after searching my E-mail I did indeed have the code and it was still valid after all that time.</p>
<p>So you may very well have a code in your E-mail account somewhere if you did not delete it. Otherwise I would attempt to contact xbox Support again via 1-800-4MYXBOX (1-800-469-9269) if you're in the U.S. or contact @xboxsupport on Twitter.</p>

<p>Greetings Gt3guy7315! It is as XX HellHammer has stated, you may have a code in your email that you should definitely check for! If not, I'm afraid we are no longer fulfilling for this Halo Reach Beta Preview disc as it has been well over a year since the
 offer. I am sorry for any inconvenience here! I know you're just trying to play your game but as we have no more tokens we cannot fulfill you. If you have any further questions please feel free to send me a Private Message as I'm going to lock this thread.
 I'm still here for support! :)</p>

                    <p class="contentStandard">
Hi,</p>
<p>
<br />
I just bought the surface pen to go with my new surface pro 6, and it is less than a week old. The pen just stopped drawing, and I tried changing the battery (twice), resetting the Bluetooth and restarting the computer, and did the diagnostic test twice. Nothing
 seems to work. The pen is fine other than the tip. I can click the eraser, see the light when I click the side button,&nbsp; it is connected to the computer and&nbsp; I can see the cursor when I use the eraser end of the pen. Not sure what the next step would be, should
 the pen be replaced ?&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            VirtualStore folder missing, help&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 Ultimate and I have recently noticed that files are missing from my Hearts of Iron III save folder. The save games are located under C:\Users\Cata\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron III\save games</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done some research on the matter and I found out that files that go missing are usually caused by a folder in C:\Users\Cata\AppData\Local\VirtualStore</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I navigate to Local, I do not see a VirtualStore folder anywhere. I tried locating it through Command Prompt, and found no such folder. I tried through Windows Explorer, and nothing. I also enabled hidden files and folders from Control Panel
 and it's still missing.</p>
<p>Any idea where my save games keep going? They have a .hoi3 extension if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Typically the VirtualStore folder won't get used unless the game tries to save to a protected OS system files location.&nbsp; Since it was supposed to go to your documents (which is not a protected OS system files location), the VirtualStore folder rightly should
 not have been created or used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, just to do a full intensive search, try this.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Command Prompt, and type these two commands, pressing enter after each one:<br />
<br />
<strong>cd \</strong><br />
<strong>dir /s *.hoi3</strong></li></ol>
<p>The command will search your entire hard drive and tell you if any HOI3 files are found, and where they were.</p>

            Thanks, I did what you said and it found the save files that I already knew about but none that were missing. It's really strange, I even tried a Recovery program and it couldn't find anything .hoi3 related except some screenshots. Is it possible it would
 have saved those games on a different Windows account?<br />

            <p>It could be. That DIR command can't search folders you don't have access to.</p>

            What if the command prompt was as an administrator? Would that command line syntax have all access then?

Blows me away when the machine is the boss!<br />

            <p>Your access is never in question.&nbsp; If the computer belongs to you, then you can set the security permissions however you want.&nbsp; If someone else is the administrator (like a company, school, or whatever), then of course you may need them to do it for you.
 But if you own the computer, you can set the security however you want.&nbsp;But no, running-as-admin does not make the command prompt ignore the security settings of the folders.

            Hi Price
<br />
<br />If you are unable to get into your PC, please try this
<br />
<br />Start up your PC, boor into BIOS - usually you can do that by pressing F2, F12 or Del repeatedly on the manufacturers logo screen
<br />
<br />In BIOS, temporarily disable Secure Boot, save that and restart your PC
<br />
<br />Does your PC boot into Windows?
