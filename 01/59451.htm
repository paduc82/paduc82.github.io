    <title>Wallpaper lag &#124; stuttering problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wallpaper lag &#124; stuttering problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Since an update of Windows 10 I have this frustrating thing on my wallpaper that everything stutters and lags and all the bad things... But as soon as my cursor hovers a window all is fine, or when a window is full screen. When I close all windows it's almost
 impossible to open up something again.</p>
<p>Also when I open up a game, like Overwatch, I see my screen flashing from black to an illuminated black until the game starts. I don't know if it has anything to do with it, but that didn't happen before also.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So my question is, if someone has experienced this as well and knows how to fix this? Because I'm all out of hope.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Nope,<br />
<br />
Nothing helped one bit. And if I do use safe mode, all is fine. But it's worse now. Nothing succeedes to update now... not Nvidia Drivers, not my Razer Synapse, nothing.
<br />
I can't even reinstall to an older Nvidia driver because it just gives me an error that it can't make a temp folder.<br />
I'm really frustrated because of this.<br />
</p>
<p>Which doesn't mean I don't appreciate the help, it's just annoyingly frustrating that this only gets worse.</p>

    <title>Upgrade from XP to Windows 7 x64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grantanning  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade from XP to Windows 7 x64</h2>
                    I'm having trouble completing a system reinstall on my old Dell XPS 420.&nbsp; The computer originally came with Vista 32 bit but I converted it to XP Professional 32 bit years ago.&nbsp; When Win7 was released, I upgraded to the Home Premium x64 edition without
 problem.&nbsp; I started the system reinstall by doing a complete hard drive format and installing Windows XP.&nbsp; I've installed all the updates and authenticated my version of XP but I'm having trouble upgrading to Windows 7.&nbsp; When I put the 32 bit install disc
 in, the upgrade starts fine - the problem is, I want the 64 bit edition.&nbsp; When I try to run the 64 bit installation disc, I get the message "This installation disc isn't compatible with your version of Windows.&nbsp; To upgrade, you need the correct installation
 disc......"&nbsp; The only difference in my hardware is that my old video card gave out and I replaced it with an HIS IceQX 6950.&nbsp; Can you tell me why the 64 bit edition installed without problem the first time around but now won't?&nbsp; Also, why will the 32 bit edition
 install but not the 64 bit?&nbsp; I've tried booting from the Win7 disc and doing a clean install but the partition I want to use does not show up.&nbsp; Any ideas??<br />

            <p>You can't do an inplace upgrade from Windows XP to Windows 7 64 bit. It wouldn't make sense anyway, just boot from the Windows 7 64 bit DVD and do a custom install:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot from the Windows 7 64 bit&nbsp;DVD</p>
<p>To learn how to change your BIOS options to boot from the DVD drive, the following tutorial:</p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://notebooks.com/2011/05/05/how-to-load-bios-and-change-boot-configuration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://notebooks.com/2011/05/05/how-to-load-bios-and-change-boot-configuration/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Install Now<br />
<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 Click Next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your quick reply.&nbsp; I've booted the computer off the DVD and selected Custom Advanced install, but the partition I want to use is not visible.&nbsp; I am setting my computer up as a dual boot system with Win 7 x64 on the C: drive and Windows XP Professional
 32 bit on the F: drive.&nbsp; I currently have Win XP installed on both partitions and am trying to upgrade the C: drive to Win7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a single hard drive with four partitions: a 54 MB "OEM reserved" partition that Dell created, a 15 GB recovery partition that Dell also created, a 74 GB partition (F:) with Win XP installed and a 210 GB partition (C:) also with Win XP installed.&nbsp;
 When I begin the Custom Advanced install I can see the first three partitions but not the fourth!&nbsp; Any ideas why not and what I can do?</p>

            Hi Denise.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.   
<br />
<br />Check the Power Settings at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Change Plan Settings &gt; Change Advanced Power Settings under Sleep, Display and Hibernate, Are these set to the timeouts you want?
<br />
<br />To be sure you can choose to Reset Default Settings for this Plan at the Change Plan Settings screen.
<br />
<br />Then also check at Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Lock Screen &gt; Screen Saver Settings to make sure it's set to None as some Themes may invoke a 1 minute blank screensaver for unknown reasons that we're waiting to get fixed.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved

<p>Hi Greg,&nbsp; I just got a new computer, about a month ago, and I'm having this same problem.&nbsp; Tried everything!!!&nbsp; It seems like it gets fixed for a few days at most, and then always goes back to its terrible ways.&nbsp; Hopefully what you described will work...
 but can you detail how to do this a little more?&nbsp; Like, exactly how to get to Power Settings etc.&nbsp; I can't seem to get to the places you described.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, are you saying that I cannot use a screen saver until this issue gets figured out by Microsoft??</p>

<p>My Lenovo does this too. I have windows 10 but it came factory installed with windows 7. I have changed every setting in power settings to "never"</p>
<p>I finally had to install an app called "Move Mouse" which periodically hits a key or moves the mouse to bypass the power settings. Software bugs are frustrating. Install move mouse.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 8 refresh, DirectX corruption - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8 refresh, DirectX corruption</h2>
                    <p>I recently conducted a windows refresh and cannot load any games that use direct X. I did a search on my hard drive using software to find files flagged for deletion on my hard drive and found that the refresh had wiped out many DLL's needed for direct x
 to work such as "d3dx9_35.dll". I have tried reinstalling the game, and altering my registry to think it has an old version of direct X, then installing the direct X&nbsp;redistributables off of Microsoft's website. Nothing has worked and I cant play anything involving
 direct x. When I tried reinstalling directx 9.0 it told me that it is not for my operating system...which is strange because I'm pretty sure it installed initially with no problem. I also noticed the WOW node is now missing from my windows registry ...and
 a lot of games I play are 32 bit and they have worked before. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could use some help Microsoft...or community.</p>

            <p>Hi Charles,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>- What version of DirectX is currently installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to update all the drivers installed on the computer (mainly the chipset and the video drivers) by visiting the computer manufacturer website and installing the latest drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the drivers have been installed, re-install the game and check if it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, run the Direct X diagnostics and check what version of DirectX is currently running on the computer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may even run the Microsoft Fixit to uninstall the games completely, so that they remove all the files and folders as well&nbsp;as the registry keys associated with the game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Direct&nbsp;X Version 11</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chipset and video drivers were reinstalled. That was the first thing I did. The registry keys were wiped out during the refresh, as well as the WOW node. Reinstalling the games has not been able to fix my problem. Before I could install the games fine
 but when it request to install DirectX 9.0c it says that it is not supported by my system. Before It was not giving me this error and I suspect it may have something to do with the WOW node being deleted. I'm not sure what to do...I tried tricking my computer
 into thinking it had an older version of direct X by altering the registry key for it, and installed the direct X user runtime (2010) to no avail. If I had known Windows Refresh would have caused this problem I never would have done it.

            <p>Following diagnosing-basic-problems-with-Direct X like I found that:</p>
<p>"Check the version of <span>DirectX</span> that your app or game requires

<p>Some app and games require <span>
DirectX</span> 9. However, <span><span>Windows&nbsp;8</span></span> and
<span><span>Windows&nbsp;RT</span></span> include a more recent version of
<span>DirectX</span>. If you install an app or game that requires
<span>DirectX</span> 9, you might receive an error message, such as: "The program can't start because d3dx9_35.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem." The last two digits of the file name
 might vary. If you receive the same error message after you reinstall the app or game, go to the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=159853" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#1570a6"><span>DirectX</span> End-User Runtime Web Installer
</font></a>webpage and follow the instructions to install <span>
DirectX</span> 9 and receive updates to <span>DirectX</span> 9 and previous versions of
<span>DirectX</span>. "</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One game gives me this error "The program can't start because d3dx9_35.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem." which is why I tried the DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer....but
 nothing has worked. </p>

<h2>            &#34;Change PC Settings&#34; and &#34;Shop&#34; not opening</h2>
                    <p>So I purchased a Samsung Laptop Model #NP365C-S05US and I started it up and right out of the box the "Shop" app didn't open. Even when I went online Windows Store, nothing. Then I noticed I only have 4 tiles appearing on START screen, no Mail, Calander,
 no Travel or Sports. After attempting to go into the "settings" and then "Change PC Settings"&nbsp; again, nothing! As many times as I click it or the Shop tile,&nbsp; I GET NOTHING! I went to register the product so I could contact Samsung Technical Support and they
 couldn't find the model number! lol I just want to fix my windows, can anyone help?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have run sfc/scannow Corrupt files were found in the CBS.log and successfully repaired, but still my issue has not been resolved. Thank you for your time!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also do not have a disc or system image or what not, can I manually reset my windows 8? Also, I cannot add a user, I click add user and I receive no response (just like with PC Settings and Shop app)</p>

            <p>It seems your HDMI cable is damaged or it is loose on the port to your TV. Replace the cable or try exchanging the ports around. Please make sure your console is NOT&nbsp;turned on while doing this because HDMI cables do carry power to the TV. It may be small, but you dont want to cause further damage.</p>

<h2>            SCOM 2012 - The localtion monitoring object is not managed</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just extended out SCOM deployment to a new site and deployed a gateway server to this site. (same domain kerb auth used)</p>
<p>I have then deployed agents to all the windows server 2012 operating systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the agents have shown up in SCOM as agent state grey tick healthy but the agent state from health service watcher states a green circle not monitored.</p>
<p>When I attempt the start the audit collection services from the ops manager console it states Failed to submit task, task output - The location monitoring object is not valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are receiving alerts in the active alerts section of the console, however I believe there might have been a step that I have missed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when I set the management point as the primary collection point for the object and bypass the gateway server the same issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to run the discover wizard with the gateway server and discover computers but I also receive the same the of error when attempting to run the discovery, "The location monitoring object is not managed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This SCOM environment has been around for quite a while. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Luke&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Recycle Bin Settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glenn mcmurrian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recycle Bin Settings</h2>
                    <p>For some strange reason every time I try to empty my recycle bin it wants to clean all the files on my boot drive which is drive C:\ and not just the erased filed in my recycle bin. When I try to clean the file's in the recycle bin it says that there is
 a total of 110 GB of file's in the drive to be cleaned and my drive C:\ boot drive a SSD 120 GB with only Windows installed on it and nothing else and that is why it say that there is 110 GB to clean minus the Windows installed on it. So how do I set it up
 correctly so that it will only delete the erased files in my recycle bin and not the full drive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>WOW 110GB in recycle bin. Just empty the recycle bin and you are ok. Unless you went into computer management or such and deleted your EFI boot files, then you may have a pickle there. Also have you or anyone else been deleting files from any folders like
 C:\Program Files, C:\Program Files (x86) or C:\Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not you are OK. I would go to </p>
<p>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Administrative Tools&gt;&gt;Disk Cleanup and run 2 scan cleaning system files and restore points to free up more space. Do not delete your thumbnail, install or upgrade log files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, if you have not done this before or for awhile, windows update clean up will take a long time to scan and delete the files, so sit back and be patient. you can use you PC while this is working. afterwards, restart pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would create a new restore point before doing anything and maybe back up your personal files using BU/Restore(win7) in control panel onto a separate location such as DVD, BluRay, network public folder on another pc on your home network, &gt;USB Thumb Drive
 or USB hard drive&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only if you deleted your EFI boot files would they be in recycle bin, so if you are sure you did not delete them, then just empty recycle bin</p>

    <title>password reset disk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> h. tom  say:</h3>
<h2>            password reset disk</h2>
                    <p>I forgot the admin password on my windows 7 computer.&nbsp; Since I had made a "Password reset disk", I followed the procedure to reset the password.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when I tried to use the password reset disk, Windows 7 says "This is not a password reset disk".&nbsp;
 I thought maybe my renaming the file to AdminPW.psw was causing the problem.&nbsp; No matter what I did, the computer keeps saying "This is not a password reset disk".</p>
<p>After spending over 6 hours searching the net, trying different solutions I gave up and went to bed.&nbsp; This morning, I decided to try something else.&nbsp; I tried to use my user password reset file instead of the admin password reset file. I got the same result,
 "This is not a password reset disk". Thinking maybe it was out of date, I created a new user password reset file.&nbsp; Windows responded that I already had a password reset disk and continuing would invalidate my existing user password reset disk.&nbsp; So this process
 recognized my user password reset file, but over wrote it!&nbsp; Surprise, when I tried to reset my password, I got "This is not a password reset disk" again.&nbsp; What gives?</p>

            <p><span>Hello H. Tom,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing. To understand the issue better, I would like to ask
 a few questions.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do you have any other administrator account on this computer?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Did you create the password reset disc on any other computer?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, If the disc is not accepted as the password reset disc, there is no other way to reset the password. This usually happens when you
 use the password reset disc of a different machine or if the data on the password reset disc is altered or corrupt. This is by design, for the security of the user.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer to the following and try again with the same disc and check if it works.</span></p>

                    <p><span>Hello</span> </p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Re Windows Spotlight not working </p>
<p>Spotlight was working perfectly but a few weeks ago a problem startedâ€¦â€¦. when my pc starts the lock, screen is the same as if I had set it to â€œPictureâ€ in Lock Screen settings, when the fact is My pc set to â€œWindows Spotlightâ€
</p>
<p>When I press the windows key+Lâ€¦.. it goes to a black screen with white writing (which is information about the photo) on it, also on the screen is the â€œpin login boxâ€, soon ever I click anywhere on the screen it loads the â€œWindows Spotlightâ€ photo.
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>What I have tried to fix the problem : --<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<pre><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </span>1.<span>Deleting the two files in the â€œ</span><span>ContentDeliveryManager_&lt;characters&gt;\Settingsâ€ folder (did not fix the problem) <br /></span></pre>
<pre><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2. Re-registering â€œwindows Spotlightâ€ using Windows Powershell (did not fix the problem)</span></pre>

<h2>            Force Ctl&#43;Alt&#43;Del to unlock Virtual Windows XP running on Windows 7 </h2>
                    
<p>Is there a way to configure the Virtual Windows XP system to require a user to hit Ctrl+Alt+Det before unlocking a Virtual Windows XP session.</p>
<p>I have looked at the Registry and Local Security Policies. They are configured in a way that it would typically require Ctrl+Alt+Del.</p>
<p>However, when the virtual PC is Locked it goes right to the Username and Password box.</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate any suggestions / ideas on how to make it require the Ctrl+Alt+Del screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Sysprep Deployment error in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>
Hi</p>
<p>
I have a situation that the solution has been escaping me. &nbsp;I have sysprep successfully a machine, create a WIM image and manage to redeploy it to 4 out of 6 machine successfully. &nbsp;The last 2 however, prompted me with an error during the deployment. Reviewing
 the setuperr.log file, the error is&nbsp;</p>
<p>
2016-07-26 15:12:45, Error &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[0x0f0082] SYSPRP LaunchDll:Failure occurred while executing 'C:\Windows\system32\capisp.dll,CryptoSysPrep_Specialize', returned error code 1627[gle=0x000003e5]<br />
2016-07-26 15:12:46, Error &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[0x060435] IBS &nbsp; &nbsp;Callback_Specialize: An error occurred while either deciding if we need to specialize or while specializing; dwRet = 0x65b</p>
<p>
I looked online around the capisp.dll and I found a possibility of where the 2 machine had a different device configuration and the recommendation was to change my&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">PersistAllDeviceInstalls in
 my unattend.xml to false and have it rediscover the devices. &nbsp;I did that but still the same outcome.</span></p>
<p>
I have run out of ideas and I need help to move forward. &nbsp;Please help.</p>

<p>128gb ssd samsung pro 850 - that's where my system is stored</p>
<p>256gb kingstone hyperx pci ssd - that's my software temp location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand this may not be the strongest pc out there but since I've performed sys update im just keep getting disappointments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wen i was testing win 10 there was no sound... whatsoever. Update performed some installations of default sound devices there was no way to get rid of them.</p>
<p>I was thinking ok Microsoft is just not ready with windows 10. Ive returned to windows 8.1 and it was a smooth ride for about 1,5y.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this update to win 10 was necessary to avoid payment in the future.</p>
<p>It looks like this system isn't still ready.</p>
<p>Or migh have to perform pure installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im using this pc for video and pictures.</p>
<p>Problems started with crashes and my pc being unable to reboot from a full dump.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows fast boot turns out to be the issue. I got it off for now and no issue so far. Im happy with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now im getting messages about temporary paging file of a size of 17gb+</p>
<p>
</p><p>My paging file was off on all drives since ive never managed to exceed 10gb of ram used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution to that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or would it be best just to simply pure install 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is win 8.1 still more stable?</p>

            Create a fixed page file of 2 gb on your C partition and a fixed 14 gb page file on any other internal drive. You could put the larger pagefile at the beginning of the drive in a dedicated pagefile partition to eliminate defragmentation if it is a conventional
 (not SSD) drive.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I'm not at home and i control my pc remotely i think i am actually facing something bigger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive managed to switch page file back on (auto)</p>
<p>And it looks like it solved one issue but I am now facing another issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzlX-WE7CejYNl91WVBJaUJGMnc/view?usp=drivesdk</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The computer has rebooted after bug check."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I don't like to compromise settings...I am considering fresh installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because all issues started literally while pc was idle...on stand by only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very unusual. Rebooting was so often i had to switch the machine off and im on my way home to diagnose further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This never happened on win 8.1 and i think i should give some more information on that pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like to go with a bios-like philosophy;</p>
<p>If pc is running properly don't change things.</p>
<p>What i mean here is that there is NO automated updates on my system if its a driver or software i only perform updates if i know they are valuable or important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only issue i have now with win 10 is that it gets updates even with windows update service being switched off...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll report more asap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some technical details as my first post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've build desktop pc entirely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Motherboard is Asus Crosshair V Formula Z i think it's a second revision if there is any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll upload all files asap as I'm a bit behind my schedule with a few works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should have everything ready within 2 days i hope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've managed to discover so far is that Google remote desktop was trying to perform unusual operation and this was causing some crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep in mind it never did that before and updates as far as i know are off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wll report that to Google as well within upcoming days.</p>

</p><p>There was no issues while Lightroom nor Premier Pro. Can't figure our with event viewer neither.</p>

</p><p>World of Warcraft Legion started series of BSODs just today again - while before pc was iddle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Series of BSODs continued even at login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BIOS settings are now as default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I play some other games as well with Steam. There was no issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I was trying to figure out but I can't. There was no issues for a few days after I have changed few settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just today getting constant BSODs. Will post more in a sec - constant BSODs every few minutes...</p>

<p>
</p><p>PC is well build with clean cable management within Cooler Master case.</p>
<p>PC is being cleaned by myself every few months due to dust accumulation.</p>
<p>Power supply is;</p>
<p>Corsair RM850 gold certified modular PSU (90% of power claimed by the producer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also planning to check electric installation at home but I don't think there is any issue here as no other house equipment suffers from any electric issues and my PC doesn't really need that much power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extension cord I have my PC plugged to is some high Wattage cord handling more that 3800 Watt.</p>
<p>Also I do not use anything else from that cord - no other household equipment is plugged there.</p>

            <p>Series of BSODs ended with windows repair menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was crashing while gaming, while idle, at windows login screen for ... Reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a bootable pendrive ready for clean installation but I'll be happy to further investigate for community if needed for a few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was no gpu driver update in the past few days so I'm not entirely sure what is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Started with remote desktop... unpredictably wild. Last thing I didn't do is a virus check.</p>
<p>I should perform this tomorrow with avira set to deep scanning.</p>
<p>Since all my drives are nearly full this will take a while...</p>
<p>
</p><p>21/09</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there is no reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I researched a bit more from event viewer and one of some more issues might be GPU unit (It comes from a PC that got some coffee shower :( some time ago).</p>
<p>
</p><p>"\Driver\WudfRd failed to load for the device ROOT\WPD\0000."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess this might also be a problem - surprisingly it worked just great before. I already have a new graphic waiting but since it's too big...now I need a new case...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Antivirus couldn't find anything interesting apart of some things creepy like binary viewer applications that I used to use. It was a full scan that took over 28hrs to finish. There was 15 detection I know about that they are not any threat.</p>
<p>Hopefully I'll set up everything tomorrow - I'll try to make PC sweat to see if any of above issue would occur again on a clean win setup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed another change since Windows 10 upgrade - my drive - Samsung ssd has now 4 partitions for who knows what reason (it used to have only 2 while win 8.1 - looks like entire system was moved a bit for one of partitions being placed at the beginning
 of the drive)...anyway since nothing else comes to my mind I'll go ahead with format in upcoming days once I'll manage to get new pc case and replace possibly defected GPU. Unfortunate for me is size of new GPU - it doesn't fits in mid-size cases...and I have
 to wait for delivery with new case.</p>
