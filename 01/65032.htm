<h2>            OneDrive 1 TB student plan without using Office 365&#63;</h2>
                    I see in a Computerworld article (<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2491125/cloud-computing/microsoft-to-double-onedrive-free-space-slash-extra-storage-prices-up-to-73.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Microsoft to double OneDrive free space, slash extra storage prices up to 73%">Microsoft
 to double OneDrive free space</a>) where "students who have subscribed to Office 365 University, an $80 four-year program, also will receive 1TB free of charge". &nbsp;I remember looking into a trial of Office 365 some time ago incorrectly thinking that it had
 full-featured online Office apps (as opposed to the standard limited functionality web versions available with OneDrive). Already having purchased a license for Office 2013 Pro, I stopped when I discovered that it would replace my current Office installation.<br />
<br />
I would consider paying the $80 for the 4 year 1 TB storage plan but only if I didn't have to replace my Office 2013 installation. &nbsp;I currently have a OneDrive account with the desktop sync app installed. &nbsp;Does anyone know if I can do this with just the desktop
 sync app?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<p>Just a note in passing.&nbsp; You can use 2013 &amp; office365 (I am logged in to office365) and running local word 2013.&nbsp; The one thing you may want to consider before you buy is that MS may only give you the 1Tb for as long as you are paying for the Student version.&nbsp;
 After that you would probably have to buy it at the regular price. Something to investigate as I am not sure about what happens after<br />

<h2>            hp color laserjet 8550 windows 7 drivers lost output desination problems</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>I have a clj 8550dn that was working perfectly in xp-sp3.</p>
<p>Recently installed Windows 7 64 bit and allowed Windows to install drivers. It is a very basic driver. There are no option selections. I have used the printer in every upgrade since the printer came out new and never had problems. (PS or PCL)</p>
<p>The option to use a straight paper path (left output) is no longer available.&nbsp; I found drivers on th HP site and tried Windows 7 64 bit, Vista 64 bit, tried running in compatibility mode with the same results. I finally found one for the PS driver that gives
 me a document output option for straight paper path under the finishing tab, but it continues to output to the top. Not good when running thick paper which I do all the time. I also do alot of 6x9 envelopes that need to go to the left output tray. The PCL
 driver I installed does not have this option at all and keeps telling me I have a conflict with mailbox output and scrolls thru about of dozen output errors before it settles down to the print dialog box. Under Windows XP SP3 I use both PS and PCL depending
 on the printing needs. I have a small print shop and this has cost me much time loss.&nbsp; My only salvation is I have installed Win 7 on a separated hard drive and XP is on another separate hard drive so I can boot to either one until I was satisfied that Windows
 7 will provide the performance I need before I shut off xp for good.</p>
<p>I am very disappointed in the lack of support for the old workhorses. I am also experiencing similar disfunction in the CLJ4550 and LJ4100, Scanjet 8250.</p>
<p>Would appreciate any productive assistance in getting things up and running properly.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>As a small workaround, you can download and install XP mode on your Windows 7 computer and check if that helps.<br />
</p>
<p>Click on the following link to download XP mode on your computer.<br />
<strong>Download Windows XP Mode with Virtual PC<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx</a><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: You must have Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate to run Windows XP Mode.<br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps.<br />

<h2>            Windows Live Mail Slide Show not working</h2>
                    I have Windows Live Mail 2012 on my PC running Windows 8.1. If more than 1 picture is attached to a received email I cannot view it in the slide show. I can only click on and view 1 picture in Windows Photo&nbsp;Viewer.&nbsp;Any other attached photos will not open

<h2>            Wifi occasionally drops connection forcing me to troubleshoot fix&#47;unplug and re-plug network adapter</h2>
                    <p>I've just recently updated to windows 10, all is good no major or minor problems other then one. Ever since updating to windows 10 sometimes I lose the connection to the internet. I am pretty sure it has to do with windows 10, as all my drivers are updated
 and the same problem happens with multiple network adapters. Basically I could be doing anything and then suddenly when the game disconnects or the video stops playing I look in my bottom right corner and I have that yellow triangle or red X telling me there's
 a problem. Yellow triangle I can just right click and troubleshoot and it fixes itself by resetting the network adapter. If i get the red X I have to unplug my network adapter and re-plug it in for a reset and then it starts working again. If this didn't happen
 constantly I could let it slide and deal with it but its happening to frequently for me to ignore it. I don't know what triggers it because if i'm playing a game I wont lose connection, nor when i'm streaming a video but if I am just surfing the web or my
 computer idles for a few minutes without me doing something that requires a constant internet connection it breaks and I get the yellow triangle / red X even just typing this so far I have had to reset twice. Doing any of the hardware troubleshoots and constantly
 checking for driver updates from manufacturer hasn't helped anything. Any thoughts other then the usual would be appreciated greatly.

            <p>Hello and thank you for the fast response. I have updated the Asus driver to the latest from the manufacturer, I did try the safe mode/clean boot and it still happened but it didn't seem as frequent so i'm unsure what that means. Windows updates I check
 daily for things and as of now I am up to date. I have just disabled Wi-Fi sense and I don't believe it fixed it. I am truly at a lost I guess I just have to deal with it for now.</p>

            <p>Oh my gosh I can't believe I didn't check this earlier but I found the freaking problem. My network adapter would turn itself off to save its power which is why watching videos or something i'd have the issue but not when I was playing games or something
 that required constant connection</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel - Network and Internet - Network and Sharing Center - click change adapter settings - click on your wireless adapter - click properties - click configure - go to power management tab - if the box saying "Allow the computer to turn off this
 device to save power" is checked, uncheck it, for the love of god uncheck it.</p>

            Well it seems for whatever reason it stopped happening briefly...for maybe a day I didn't even notice this happening other then when I woke my computer from sleep, but that was no big deal just having to fix it one time instead of like 30+ times I could
 live with. Now it seems to be happening even more frequently and I am at a lost again

<h2>            System Image restore fails&#58; &#34;0x80070057 the parameter is incorrect&#34;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>When trying to restore my Windows 10 system disk from a System Image, I received the error message "0x80070057 the parameter is incorrect". The restore was c95% complete at that point and the auto-repair offered by the system could not recover.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>After that failure, I could not reboot from the system disk. </div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>After some research, I made a second attempt to restore the System Image and selected the option to repartition the system disk. That attempt failed with the same error message, having almost completed.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I'm: <br />
&nbsp;- running Windows 10 Home Edition with the latest updates applied<br />
&nbsp;- booting from a System Repair CD<br />
&nbsp;- attempting to restore from a 10 day old System Image stored on an internal HDD<br />
&nbsp;- restoring to an internal SSD</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I've found several references to the error on this forum and on others too. However, none of the offered solutions seem applicable or accessible in my particular predicament.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Is the situation retrievable by restoring the recent System Image? If so, how would I circumvent this error?</p>

<div>Hi Devlin, </div>
<div>Thanks for your interest in this problem and your follow-up questions. </div>
<div>Firstly, I have made and noticed no changes to system settings. However, three auto-updates were installed after I made the System Image and before I attempted the restore:
<br />
&nbsp;- 2017-09 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based Systems (KB4038788)<br />
&nbsp;- Malicious Software Removal Tool (KB890830)<br />
&nbsp;- 2017-09 Security Update for Adobe Flash Player (KB4038806)</div>
<div>Secondly, I have done no troubleshooting other than the second restore attempt described above. I've requested help in this forum on the slim chance that the problem is familiar to someone who has a silver bullet solution.
<div>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no known silver bullet, I will: <br />
&nbsp;- reinstall Windows, create a new System Image and test that it can be resored on my configuration<br />
&nbsp;- if the test restore works, I will try to restore from my exisiting image one more time.
<br />
&nbsp;- if the test restore fails or my existing image fails, I will rebuild my system disk by hand<br />
Given the potential horror of an application by application rebuild, I do hope there is a silver bullet!</p>

<p>Hello again Devlin,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I'm still stuck with this failed system image restore: <br />
&nbsp;- image creation/restore works on a new install of Windows 10<br />
&nbsp;- restore fails consistently from my critical system image</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>The log file within my critical system image is error free.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be grateful for help to diagnose the cause of the failure with a view to fixing and restoring the system image.
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>If a fix and restore is not possible, a diagnosis would help prevent future recurrence.
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help?</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the issue is due to the system restore point being corrupted. Therefore, we advise performing the System Restore using a new Windows 10 installation media. You can create a new installation media using the
<strong>Media</strong> <strong>Creation</strong> <strong>Tool</strong> found from this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link</strong></a>. Follow the steps under <em>Using the tool to create installation media to install Windows 10 on a different PC</em>. After creating the Windows 10 installation disc, boot your PC with the disc inserted. Select
<strong>Repair your computer</strong>, in the Windows Setup screen. Go <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt;
<strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>options</strong>, and then select <strong>System</strong>
<strong>Restore</strong>.</p>

<div>Hi Devlin, </div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your helpful instructions, which I tried out today. They did not enable a restore but the failure yielded a coherent error message:
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>“Windows cannot restore a system image to a computer that has different firmware. The system image was created on a computer using BIOS and this computer is using EFI.”</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>It begs the question <em>why </em>there is a perceived BIOS/EFI clash but at least I now have a diagnosis.
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help. </p>

<p>Thank you for the prompt response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to confirm some information regarding your Windows 10 PC. Did you change your hardware component setting before performing a system restore? Judging from the error message you're getting, it seems that your PC setting needs to be changed. That
 being said, we advise contacting the device manufacturer for the steps on how to change it back to the previous setting. After getting the firmware back to BIOS, try performing the system restore again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<div>I made no change to hardware components or firmware settings between making the system image and the failed image restore.
<div>
<p>
</p><p>It is likely that my subsequent new install of Windows 10, introduced EFI on to the configuration I created for testing. This would explain the EFI/BIOS conundrum. I guess that also means I still don’t have a diagnosis for the failed restore.
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>However, it’s now time to close this incident and move on. I’ve:<br />
-&nbsp;made a clean Windows 10 system;<br />
-&nbsp;moved off BIOS and see no reason to backtrack;<br />
-&nbsp;tested system image creation and restore satisfactorily on this configuration; and<br />
-&nbsp;commenced other aspects of the system rebuild. </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I dislike leaving the original failure unsolved but this is unproductive for me.

<h2>            How to work on the touchpad when all the fingers are resting on it in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: How can I allow my trackpad to function even when 5 fingers are touching it simultaneously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I got a new computer with a full trackpad (the left and right click are included in it, it's one surface) but the way I use the click makes it very hard to use the computer.&nbsp;<br />
When I'm just browsing I tend to rest my 4 fingers on the click and move the mouse around with my pointer on the other hand, but the computer disables the trackpad when more than 1 finger are touching it.&nbsp;<br />
I want to turn that off, so I can have all 4 fingers on it without using a clump of tape to stop the trackpad from detecting my fingers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
short:<br />
I need a program that allows for more than 1 finger to move the mouse simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before assisting further, which manufacturer touchpad drivers are installed in the PC?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The finger gestures enabled on the touchpad differs from manufacturer to manufacturer. You will be able to enable the option you are looking for only if the manufacturer has released the touchpad
 drivers which resembles the feature.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to get in touch with the touchpad manufacturer installed of the PC for further assistance on the above query.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link below o

<p>The Xbox 360 you probably have is region locked to NTSC/USA. The version you purchased from Amazon.com.uk is a PAL vesrion. That is why you would get that message. The only solutions are to to send it back to amazon for a refund or to purchase a PAL Xbox
 360. </p>

            <blockquote>It is a wmv file. I downloaded what you recommended but it still won't play although it keeps saying windows media player cannot play the file.
</blockquote>
=====================================<br />
Apparently the .WMV file is corrupted in some way.<br />
<br />
Could you ask the sender to send another copy?<br />
<br />
If this is very important...the following info on creating<br />
a new version of the .WMV file may be worth a look:<br />
<br />
In many cases I have found that converting a .WMV file<br />
to the .WMV format could produce a new version of the<br />
file that is compatible. Sounds redundant I know but it<br />
can work.<br />
<br />
Microsoft Expression Encoder 4 can do the conversion.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Download Microsoft Expression Encoder 4 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=24601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=24601</a><br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
If you want to try Expression Encoder 4 the following<br />
info may be useful:<br />
<br />
Launch Microsoft Expression Encoder 4<br />
(Start / Programs / Microsoft Expression /<br />
Microsoft Expression Encoder 4)<br />
<br />
On the 'Load A New Project' screen...<br />
Left click...'Transcoding Project'...<br />
<br />
When the program opens...go to...File / Import...<br />
<br />
Left click (highlight) the .WMV file and left click the Open button.<br />
<br />
You will see the file in the 'Media Content' pane.<br />
<br />
In the right column...left click the 'Output' tab...<br />
<br />
Open the Directory drop window and choose an Output Folder.<br />
(This is where you will find your converted file)<br />
<br />
Left click the 'Encode' button.<br />
<br />
Wait....encoding video is CPU intensive and may<br />
be a slow process. It's always best if you do not<br />
multi-task while files are being encoded.<br />

<p><br />
Hi</p>
<p>You still need to contact Samsung support. The USB driver for the phone is proprietary and supplied by the device manufacturer.</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from the user manual.</p>
<p>Note: The Bluetooth feature must first be disabled before initiating a USB connection with the phone. Prior to connecting the USB cable to the phone, install the latest version of the PC Studio application. This application installs the necessary USB drivers
 onto your machine. If<br />
necessary, to update your PC Studio application, please visit:<br />
<a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.samsung.com/us/support</a></p>
<p><br />
You may be using an outdated version of the software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            When you do a refresh the Apps that came with Windows 8 and the ones you downloaded from the store will be saved and you installed from disc or downloaded from the web will be removed and a list will be provided in a folder on your&nbsp;desktop This is clearly
 stated before &nbsp;you start. I don't feel sorry for anyone who fails to read or doesn't back-up anything they can't afford to lose.&nbsp;Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to help you.

            mmm so you refreshed your pc using the windows 8 menu this is a problem as it will take your pc back to default and as far as i know it is a one way only no going back unless you have made recovery discs.<br />
<br />
Windows 8 refresh sets your pc back to factory settings on all installed programs but keeps your docs but that is it i am afraid you will need to sit and reinstall all your programs again&nbsp; the list you posted above in xml so i have listed it below for you

            It most certainly does in fact it could not be plainer. The problem is that people to day either can't read or won't take the time. Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to help you.

    <title>Unable to Remove a Live Xbox Game - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cheneriviere71  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Remove a Live Xbox Game</h2>
                    <p>Good evening</p>

<p>Excuse me if my English is a bit twisted.</p><p><br /></p><p>So, I explain, my xbox live account is associated with my facebook account. I used to play with my facebook account rather than with my windows account. Only, here under Modern Combat 5 blackout, my xbox account has been associated with my brother's facebook account. So I wanted to erase my progression on xbox live, so I followed the method of microsoft, except that in my xbox account the part delete does not exist. I can not reset the game and my progression has become my brother's progression.</p>

<p>So I would like to know how to reset the game or completely erase xbox live and start a new game with this time my associated accounts.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p><p><br /></p>

            <p>Hey there,</p><p><br /></p><p>A Facebook &amp;&nbsp;Xbox Live account link is primarily to find more of your friends on Xbox Live. It sounds like you may have linked your Facebook profile to that specific game and Gameloft.

<h2>            I want refund Minecraft for Windows 10 Edition</h2>

<h2>            How to fix&#47;solve Windows 7 problem&#63;</h2>
                    So I have a big problem with windows 7. I accidently did something really bad with device manager and usb. And now there's no internet connection, no sound, windows 7 theme changed to classic, i can't turn on Windows Security Center service or other protection,
 i can't restore. All I can do is run my downloaded programs and games (without internet). I think i did something bad with device manager. NEED HELP!

<h2>            share screen and sounds on a mac book pro</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I often use my windows laptop to share screen and sounds during a skype call, thus the one who I am calling can listen to what video and audio I'm playing on my screen with the option "share screen and sounds". However, on my mac's version of skype, there
 is only the 'share screen' option and not the 'share screen and sounds' </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please explain and help me configure this so I can do the same with me mac as my windows laptop...</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/219374ee-717d-4cf5-a9a3-82e2d6707639" title="jeroenaalders">
<p>
</p><p>In the new Skype, the only option is screen share. But nothing to worry, as the sound will be shared as well. All you need to do is make sure your microphone is not turned off during screen share.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post.
<br />
Thank you!<br />

            Thanks for the fast reply. So you are saying that I can 'catch' the playback sound of i.e. an MP3 or YouTube video with ny on board mic and send the sound to the one I am calling during share screen modus?

<p>Yes, that is correct. The sound will be shared as well to your contact during screen sharing.</p>
