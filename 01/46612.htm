<h2>            Windows 10 Doesn&#39;t Save Window Positions After Reboots</h2>
                    <p>Windows is no longer remembering the location of program positions after rebooting.&nbsp; For instance I open MS Word on one monitor and drag it to the second, then close the program.&nbsp; The next time I open it remembers this till I reboot the computer, then its
 back on the main monitor.&nbsp; This seems to now happen with any application and app. &nbsp;

<h2>            Missing Regsvr32 Initpki.dll, cannot configure router</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10, latest update (creators Edition, I assume).</p>
<p>I need to sign into my Linksys Smart router to configure stuff using ciscoconnectcloud.com (the default site for internal changes). My default web browser is FIrefox. The error I get is "<em>Peer‚Äôs Certificate has been revoked. Error code: SEC_ERROR_REVOKED_CERTIFICATE</em>"</p>
<p>My time and date are correct, as is my region.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone through all the troubleshooting steps in Firefox, checked in Linksys for issues and have taken the troubleshooting steps in Microsoft until I get to the
<span>"Regsvr32 Initpki.dll<span> " module where I get the error message that I cannot mount the program.<br />
<span>"Regsvr32 Initpki.dll<span> " module where I get the error message that I cannot mount the program.<br />
</span></span>I'm having no trouble with any other web site.</p>
<p>There are suggestions in the community pages, but they are for Vista and 7, and I know there is a lot of changes in 10, so I'm not certain to try them in this application.</p>
<p>I cannot try and connect in Edge, because I can't get into, or download, Edge.</p>
<p>How can I get into the specific web site?</p>

<p>

<p>I see Edge in my installed programs bar, but it won't open and I try to go into the Microsoft site and download it, It coughs like the Millenium Falcon after a visit by Darth Vader.</p>

            We appreciate your response.
<p>
</p><p>Internet Explorer and Edge are both browsers under Microsoft, but totally different with each other. We would like to know what happens after accessing the site in IE.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned that Edge's not opening; most of the time, it gives error message. If your getting any, send us a screenshot of the exact error message.</p>

<p>Firstly, when I try and access IE from Program files, it opens with Quebec based Yahoo - and I live 3000 miles away. To me toot suite is the washroom, so IR's useless for me.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Looks like they want to sell/install a security system, asking for my zip code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't connect to my Asus router securely after it reboots for any reason. &nbsp; I'll have to use IE to bypass the instructions that appear saying something to the effect the sites certificate is dangerous &amp; then use the address bar to view the certificate
 and proceed to make a new certificate and save it on my pc to the security root certificate storage. &nbsp; Then things work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds like if in your shoes I might want to be running a virus scan. and SFC &amp; DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth .&nbsp; Perhaps uninstalling my cisco software program and reinstalling it after downloading it freshly from cisco - or search for&nbsp;<span>Initpki.dll
 on your pc in the cisco folder and register it as windows regsvr32 cant find it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Unable to play games.</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">So Last Night my laptop was updating, when I woke up the next day i decided to just play a computer game since i was really bored and something to do to pass the time. So i open a game (otherwise known as Sleeping Dogs) and i get
 a 0xc000007b error (The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b) Click OK to close application) . I've always been able to fix these errors before by using a repair utility. I go an open that up but then I get an errors that i have never had
 before, the erorr is a profapi.dll error it says "The code execution cannot proceed because profapi.dll was not found. reinstalling the program may fix this problem so I uninstall it go to the setup and get the same error. I initially thought the game probably
 not wroking correctly I'll just wait next update so I go ahead and play another game same profapi.dll error. The error noise bugged me so I go ahead and try using some 3rd party program to fix it it downloads fine but opening the setup same profapi.dll error.
 I tried something different like uninstalling the update but nothing happens, I try system recovery nothing happens I checked my Laptop for any viruses nothing. I try scanning my hard drive nothing. So I basically have the windows 10 equivalent to a Chromebook
 Please can some one help me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Restarting your computer can fix common issues with the apps that are not able to start.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 2</strong>. Run the game as administrator.</p>
<p>Right-click on the game icon and select <strong>Properties</strong>. Go to the
<strong>Compatibility </strong>tab and check <strong>Run this program as an administrator</strong>.</p>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

<h2>            WD HDD 1TB not recognized by Windows XP</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a WD HDD 1TB. I needed to formate it onto exFAT in order that my Mac Computer can work with it.</p>
<p>Now I bought a second hand PC with Windows XP on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I plug-in the HDD of 1TB, it is in the machine, but it does not show it in MY Computer.</p>
<p>When I want to unplug it and go to the extraction arrow on the right down corner of the task bar, it shows that there is a USB Mass storage to eject. But it does not show any name or size.</p>
<p>I tried to download drivers from Microsoft, but no result.</p>
<p>Can somebody tell me what to do? I have already 500GB data on it and do not want to lose them. I still can use the HDD on my MacBook.</p>
<p>Thank you for help,</p>

    <title>How can I prevent Task Scheduler Engine from being shutdown, get New - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ldiaquosinspironvista  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I prevent Task Scheduler Engine from being shutdown, get New Display Detected to work, and avoid receiving the message &#34;Internet Explorer has encountered a problem and is shutting down&#34;&#63; __</h2>
                    
<p>My laptop is a Dell Inspiron 1520, running Windows Vista Home Premium Edition and Internet Explorer 9.&nbsp; My additional monitor is a Sharp Aquos LED HD-TV, Model LC-46LE700UN.&nbsp; I have been using a VGA cable to onnect the laptop and TV monitors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The laptop appears to function normally when not connect to the TV.</p>
<p>As soon as the VGA cable is conected to the laptop (without being connected to the TV) the following message is displayed:</p>
<p>"Microsoft Windows - Task Scheduler Engine has stopped working.&nbsp; A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.&nbsp; Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is found."</p>
<p>When I initially connected the laptop to the TV, "New Display Detected" was automatically acti vated.&nbsp; Soon it was no longer automatically activated.&nbsp; I was able to activate it manually using Windows Mobility Center when the automatic activation failed initially
 but now Windows Mobility Center no longer detects the new display.</p>
<p>Using Fn+F8, I can display the picture on either the laptop or the TV but not both simultaneously.</p>
<p>The "Internet Explorer has encountered a problem and is shutting down" message appears intermittently but I can still switch internet sites and view content after the message appears.</p>
<p>I did download software, specified by the website myp2p.eu,&nbsp;to facilitate watching "streamed" TV programs, including PPStream, Sina Live, Sopcast, Stream Torrent, Swarm Player, TVAnts, UUSee, VGO, and&nbsp;Veetle, and cancelled the downloads for PPL (which failed
 an integrity check), PPMate (corrupted), and TVKoo (blocked).</p>
<p>Norton Security quarantined&nbsp;the UUSee setup program, indicating it was a high risk program with many users.</p>
<p>At a computer repair shop and using a different flat screen additional display,&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not duplicate the problems yesterday (October 4, 2010), when "New Display Detected" was activated automatically, and I was able to view the picture on either and both
 displays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I attempted to restore the system to a date (on the list) previous to when the problems first occured - System Restore failed.&nbsp; I attempted to use scandisk but received&nbsp; no indication that it had run and&nbsp;corrected any errors found after Windows restarted.&nbsp;
 I have reviewed forum answers, Display Setting and New Display Detected support literature.</p>
<p>How can I prevent the above problems?&nbsp; Help!!!</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
Did the system restore end up with any error message?<br />
<br />
This could also be happening if any of the background programs is conflicting with the smooth running of your computer. To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues,<br />
you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />
<br />
Steps-<br />
1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights<br />
2. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue<br />
3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)<br />
4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all<br />
<br />
Note: Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services.<br />
If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points<br />
<br />
<br />
See this article-<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135<br />
<br />
This should fix your issue.<br />
<br />

            <p><span>Hi Yii-Huei Phang,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may uninstall all the USB entries from Device Manager.
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on Start and typedevmgmt.msc, and then click OK. Device Manager opens.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers.
</span></p>
<p><span>Note: You might have to scroll down the list to find this item.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Right-click the first USB controller under Universal Serial Bus controllers, and then click Uninstall to remove it.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Repeat the above step for each USB controller that is listed under Universal Serial Bus controllers.
</span></p>
<p><span>e. Restart the computer. After the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan for hardware changes and reinstall
 all the USB controllers that you uninstalled.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if it is working. If you are still facing the issue, then you may need to get in touch with Apple support for
 further assistance.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Mixed Reality - Microsoft&#39;s request for FOV change. Please help</h2>
                    The lenses on the HMD change easily. I can install ordinary glass lenses instead of fresnel lenses, but there is a fish eye effect. Can you add a software adjustment of the angle of view (FOV) in order to get rid of the fish eye effect?

            You do not understand me. I ask to add the FOV setting in the device settings. I changed lenses on my Lenovo Explorer. Image clarity is much higher. There is also no blur around the edges of the lens. But now the fish eye effect has appeared. This can
 be corrected programmatically.

Thanks, Deepak. I have already used the System File Checker (SFC) tool; it cannot repair my autochk.exe because the copy in the store is corrupted also. This is why I need a fresh, uncorrupted copy.<br />

    <title>Unable to mount .iso file in Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> makerel obeora  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to mount .iso file in Windows 8</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
While I very much appreciate the innovations on Microsoft's part and support the direction they are going in with Windows 8, updating (From Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 8 Pro)&nbsp;turned&nbsp;out to give me more troubles rather than benefits.<br />
<br />
So, I tried to mount an .iso image with&nbsp;Daemon&nbsp;Tools. That didn't work, since the program simply stated that it wasn't able to mount the file. Well, I then found out that mounting and burning .iso files is now a native feature of Windows 8 (which is great!).
 So I&nbsp;uninstalled&nbsp;Daemon Tools and tried it with the native feature, sure that it would work. It didn't. After trying to mount the file, the little blue circle appeared next to my cursor, where it stayed until Windows finally stated, after something like 15
 minutes (seriously):<br />
<br />
"Sorry, there was a problem mounting the file."<br />
<br />
Great. I restarted. Same thing.<br />
I installed all the updates and haven't found any solution that worked for me! Seriously?! Do I really have to install Windows 7 again? How pathetic is that?! Sorry, I&nbsp;always&nbsp;get worked up over problems with the Computer, for which there are no obvious solutions.<br />
<br />
I hope you can help, thanks in advance. :D

            What worked for me is to simply copy the iso file. You can even make a copy within the same directory. Right-click on the
<u>copy</u> and Mount. It worked. I believe there is a flag that gets removed when copying the file.

</p><p>The task was created as MyTask (had forgotten to add a proper name).</p>

</p><p>I find this very interesting, considering it's the same user doing both actions. I never even logged out between the two actions. Can anyone suggest how I can delete this task?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is there a switch I can add to the command line when creating the task&nbsp;to avoid this issue? I am trying to create a script to automate this process for several users, who will need to be able to delete the resulting task(s) easily (i.e. from the GUI).</p>

<p>My desktop (for the most part) seems to display fine, anything that doesn't rely on DirectX, such as web browsers, seem to display fine as well. The issue doesn't start to appear in full until I use something that relies on DirectX like a game, then it will
 become apparent/obvious. Grays/shadowed areas in a game don't display correctly, appear washed out/ugly. Colors in general have a really bad "stepping" to them. I thought for a bit I might just be misremembering things however after testing out a game with
 a different monitor, it's apparent there's an issue.</p>

 at this point is the problem) and waiting for windows to redetect it/install drivers, as well as some other things but nothing worked. After searching around for a bit I found out about a program called Powerstrip which even though it says it isn't for Windows
 10 still seems to scan registry entries all the same.</p>

<p>What's interesting is the EDID reports differently:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d07a6a92-02a3-480b-8fc9-a5853fecde97?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d07a6a92-02a3-480b-8fc9-a5853fecde97?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I was hoping to try and use this for a workaround to the issue since this program has the ability to create inf files, trying to install the .inf file it makes makes as a driver gives the error "The parameter is incorrect." If you're familiar with this program
 you probably also know it can change timing parameters manually,&nbsp; this option is unavailable on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm completely at a loss of what to do, I came across someone on nvidia's forums with a similar looking issue however I don't know if they had installed the update as well, though the time it was posted would seem that way. Any help anyone can provide would
 be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A configuration in the system settings might have caused your PC's inability to choose the highest resolution. Let us try to change the resolution of your monitors through Windows Settings. You may follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>, then select <strong>System</strong>. </li><li>Under System, click <strong>Display</strong>, and then hit <strong>Display adapter properties</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>List All Modes</strong>, and then select 1920 by 1080 on the list.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, kindly get back to us. </p>

<p>Sorry Vanessa I feel like I should've mentioned that Windows display settings correctly displays it as 1920x1080, it even says that's the native resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd also like to add I used Custom Resolution Utility to try and jerry rig a solution, however even after changing settings so that a 1920x1080 PC resolution becomes available in Nvidias control panel, the problem persists. Even after digging out my VGA
 to HDMI adapter and trying that, it still happens.</p>

<p>The driver of your graphics card might not be updated for it to conform with the latest Windows version. May we know if you have tried updating the driver? What we recommend that you reinstall the driver directly from the manufacturer's website. If the issue
 persists, kindly uninstall the driver, then reinstall the driver that you have downloaded.

<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. As I understood on your post, you want to use a .VOB file in Movie Maker. If this is the case, You can try extracting the .VOB file first on your computer by opening your media device with the .VOB format, copy the files
 and paste it within your computer. Afterwards, you can now drag the video to your Movie Maker for you to edit the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Normally, .VOB file is supported by Movie Maker but, in case you're having issues using .VOB file, e<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>nsure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio files ‚Äì audio and
 video require codecs to play the file and it‚Äôs important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.</font></span></p>

    <title>Realtek HD Audio Rear Audio Inoperative With Front Audio Ports - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> punchard-steve  say:</h3>
<h2>            Realtek HD Audio Rear Audio Inoperative With Front Audio Ports Connected</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Win10 and found that&nbsp;my Realtek audio&nbsp;subsystem appeared to be falsely detecting the presence of a front port headset. That&nbsp;disables the rear ports so the system appeared to have no audio. I did not have anything plugged in the front ports.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default for the HD Manager is to mute the rear ports when a front panel headset is plugged in. I disassembled my front audio device and can test the mini jack and have verified that the jack in not malfunctioning. Additionally when I plugged in a microphone
 to the front panel the port detection mechanization was confused and the port was oscillating between connected and disconnected quickly but not at a constant rate. Also the cable and front port I/O hardware&nbsp;work properly in another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now I have unplugged my front port audio jacks from the motherboard&nbsp;which stops the false detection and restores audio. An alternative is to change the setting that mutes rear audio when front jack connection is detected. I prefer the option that does
 not leave a port in a bogus state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of 08SEP2015 I have all the latest updates installed.</p>
<p>My mobo is a Gigabyte GA-MA785GMT-UD2H with a Realtek ALC-889A codec.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Realtek driver is 6.0.1.5864</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that there still may be something else causing this issue but these tests are all I have to work with.</p>
<p>If anyone at MS is working on the drivers this information may help them.</p>
<p>Happy Trails</p>

 on my computer for my profile. How do I change this? I have tried removing him from Microsoft family, but every time I login it logins in as him and joins him up again

<p>When the download completes, close all open browsers and programs. *IF* a 3rd party firewall is being used, temporarily disable it and *enable* the native Vista firewall for now. Now run au_check_v78_codeplex.exe.</p>
<p>Reboot afterwards and try to update. Did that resolve the error code ?</p>
