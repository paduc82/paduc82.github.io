    <title>Windows OS Spread over 2 Hard Drives - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows OS Spread over 2 Hard Drives</h2>
                    <p>I have two (2) SSDs; C:/ and E:/. In an attempt to keep the C:/ drive uncluttered, I began installing programs on the E:/ drive. When Windows Creators Edition came out, my computer would not automatically update. Windows Support had me do a complete new
 install, after which my "main" drive became my E:/ drive. Everything works fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I've discovered, that the updated OS is actually spread out over both the E:/ and C:/ drives. For example, if I physically disable the C:/ drive, the system won't boot because it can't find certain required files (which are on the C:/.) Likewise,
 if i reconnect the C:/ and disable the E:/, the computer will not boot, this time because it can't locate the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For various reasons, I'd like to consolidate the OS onto a single drive, ideally without having to do another complete reinstall. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Anti-Fraud Network</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">Xbox Anti-Fraud.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">What is it? You may wonder why? Let me explain it step by step for you.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">This software is designed to protect your from hacker and lost console, also lost accounts.&nbsp;<br />
One of the main functions of this Anti-Fraud system is that it will check so your credit card is&nbsp;<br />
not used by a another IP adress. It will in detail show you where your credit card has been used.&nbsp;<br />
If you suspect something unnormal usage of the credit card, you can simply report it in the report tab.&nbsp;<br />
Then one of the people at Xbox Anti-Fraud Team will take a look at it.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">As we know the Enforcement Team do have a lot, then I mean a lot of work. This would do so that the&nbsp;<br />
Enforcement team can focus on more important things.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">When you have setup your installation wizard, the software will automatically install on your Xbox 360, Xbox One&nbsp;<br />
and also on your Xbox software on your Windows computer.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">To be more specific, It's a file that scan for unnormal behavior on your Internet connection.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">But what if the hacker is hidden behind a VPN or a secure webbrowser, or directly is connected to my computer with a Trojan Horse?&nbsp;<br />
That is a important question you did ask! Well let me explain that to you also.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">The Anti-Fraud software is connected directly to the Anti-Fraud servers at Microsoft. So if it suspect another IP or system it will give a warning.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">As this software will be included in Windows Update servers, it will then be a security file that will check if your information is used by another IP adress.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">But, the hacker maybe dont have the Anti-Fraud?&nbsp;<br />
That is what I mean that it's in Windows Update, when you have fill in your information in the Anti-Fraud Network website, It will recognize as I typed above, another IP adress.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">Because of the security file that is installed with Windows Update. it will locate the IP adress. (The IP adress will only be seen by the Xbox Anti-Fraud Team).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">But what if someone is saying bad things to be and it takes 2-4 month before something happens?&nbsp;<br />
Well. With this software it wont take 2-4 month. It will recognize if someone is typing horrible words to you, if you report that player. The system will directly ban that user.&nbsp;<br />
But BE AWARE, If you use it for bad things, your account may be locked. As the Anti-Fraud Team can check if you did it for fun or if it was a real.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">Two pictures of the design as it's now:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/650981dd-ecf3-4ec2-af52-0d6552576190" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/650981dd-ecf3-4ec2-af52-0d6552576190" /></a></p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e24193f4-1514-41c8-9cf3-2828d32556f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e24193f4-1514-41c8-9cf3-2828d32556f7" /></a></p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">I'm still working on this, so updates will come.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to the xbox.uservoice link of this idea on the software <a href="https://xbox.uservoice.com/forums/251653-xbox-com/suggestions/13520370-xbox-anti-fraud-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>I'm very happy that you did comment on this post, as for now It's not possible to get this software for public, but I have been doing BETA test of it, and It seems to go well, let's just hope that Microsoft or Xbox will help me so It can be for public use.</p>

<p>Hello LAGRIFFE2007.</p>
<p>Sorry for late respons. It seems that the guy that had the account before have made something to that account, it's possible that the user did do some credit fraud from another user, therefore the account got banned. Talk with the xbox support again, and
 tell them exactly what happen'd. I'm one of the admins of the xbox anti-fraud software. We are working on a website with a forum where people can help us improve the software and maybe more unique ideas, possible other software that help other gamers also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It goes slowly the progress, it's because we are only two that are working on the software. Microsoft is taking long time also. They need to get this idea/software approved before we can really do anything else, at the moment we might setup a server and
 try to get the software to work via the xbox system. But we need to have information that only Microsoft have to get the software connected to Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

            Well i hope you manage to do your stuff but i m not staying on Microsoft boat next year for two simple reasons 1: a crystal white profileless xbox one thats useless bought second hand that makes me feel scammed and guilty for someone else criminal acts.
 2: i got banned for texting " are u stupid and retarded or what? To some player who team killed me in Rainbow 6 and got banned two weeks for it ( 2 days left). No way to contact ET nor they answered review. I m french and i feel like i have been under a US
 federal criminal investigation and being sent to federal prison. Next year will be my farewell to Xbox live and PC gaming will welcome me as online is free. Its been since 2002 i chose Xbox rather than Playstation well i guess i m play some tomb raider like
 game sooner than i thought. About that XxREXGAMERXx this guy has -6000GS and i m over 210000GS so thats like my penis is bigger and i believe my spendings on the xbox store were the same. Well mate thank for the reply and... May the force n

            The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions. 
<br />

    <title>I have no sound after a remote desktop logon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrei v.  say:</h3>
<h2>            I have no sound after a remote desktop logon</h2>
                    This is what happens: my win7pro 32 bit system is running fine, the sound card is ok. I log on through remote desktop. I hear all the sounds from the remote machine (the default setting is to get the sound events, I didn't chage that).<br />
But, when I return to the console and log on locally, I have no sound at all.<br />
I checked and the default output device is my Audigy Value sound card. Also, on the volume slider from the system tray, the green indicator is moving, showing that sound should come out.<br />
If I restart my computer, everything returns to normal, and the sound is back.<br />
<br />
This started after a recent update from Windows Update that included an update to my sund card driver. The installation status for this update is "sucessful".<br />
<br />
And, as a related problem, the creative auto-update software says that I have no creative product on my computer!!! Before this driver update it detected my Audigy card just fine.

<h2>            This Microsoft account is associated with a different xbox live profile</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I get this error when I try to log on to Xbox Live on my Xbox: "This Microsoft account is associated with a different xbox live profile"</p>

<p>A different xbox live profile? What other &nbsp;Microsoft account? I only got 1 Microsoft account and I certainly don't have other xbox live profiles.</p>
<p>This is my first xbox. I've had it for over a year, close to 2 even. Never had any problems with signing in using same mail and password all the time.</p>
<p>How come this happens?</p>
<p>I've looked at this:&nbsp;http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/manage-microsoft-account</p>
<p>Please don't tell me I have to go through that step with creating another profile and linking one to another. And waiting 30 days.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t change default apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drakath  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t change default apps</h2>
                    <p>Recently Windows default app selection has stopped working. I cannot change any default app by file type. For example, XML files open with Internet Explorer and I want to change it to notepad. "Open with" function works, however checking the "Always use
 this app to open .xml files" does not change anything. I've also tried using the Settings app, but to no avail. Clicking on a different default app just turns off the popup and the default app does not change. I tried running some DSIM.exe health checks, but
 it found no problems. How do I fix this?</p>

            I have exactly the same problem. I've had the problem before and managed to change the apps...but this time no go. It's just simply APPALLING that microsoft decides, without permission, to change default settings on my computer without permission. I am
 a professional musician, I do not wish to have all my music files changed to some awful app that is, in fact, useless for any professional audio or video editing purposes. Simply disgusting.

<h3> aidedcardinal1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Risk Factions and the lack of Support</h2>
                    
<p>This game has numerous bugs. &nbsp;I have emailed the developers with no response and now I'm forced to post on here. &nbsp;The game is easily freezable when leaving on the rewards screen. &nbsp;This is the most well known and abused bug. &nbsp;Guaranteed card freezes the game
 after 'x' amount of turns. &nbsp;The defensive die is grossly unbalanced and broken. &nbsp;Host migration is horrible at best. &nbsp;If a player quits with a territory frozen, the territory will never unfreeze and hence you will be unable to take that territory. &nbsp;This is
 just the tip of the iceberg. &nbsp;I've played this game for over 2 years and I am absolutely appalled by the lack of support and updates for such a hugely successful game. &nbsp;Stainless steal/EA games should be ashamed for their lack of due diligence on this game.
 &nbsp;The video game industry is one of the few industries you can put out such a broken product and get away marketing and selling that product to consumers without being held responsible for the integrity of that product. &nbsp;It is one thing for their to be a problem
 that you acknowledge and it's another thing for a consumer such as myself to email developers about very FIXABLE issues and receive NO response to my emails about my concerns. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Problem with Sticky Keys since upgrading to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dbassman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Sticky Keys since upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    I'm a quadriplegic and use sticky keys all the time it's one of the best things Microsoft ever did for someone in my condition! I just upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 and now in most cases I have to hit the key I want held down twice instead of just
 once. <br />
<br />
Here's a couple examples: <br />
#1. To minimize a window I used to be able to hit the Windows key once + down arrow, now I have to hit the Windows key twice + down arrow and then hit the Windows key once more.<br />
#2. To highlight the cursor to the end of a line, I could hit shift once + the End key, now I have to hit shift twice + End and then hit shift once more.<br />
<br />
I know hitting a sticky key twice holds it down until you hit it once more, and heading at once holds it down for one keystroke, which is what I'm trying to do, but ever since upgrading to Windows 10 is not working.<br />
<br />
Does anyone here know of any way to put it back so I can just hit it once?

            Thanks for your reply Jenith, when I followed your first suggestion "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" was already unchecked.<br />
<br />
In regards to the second suggestion to download Windows 10 drivers, you did not specify which drivers I should download. I have a custom-built desktop PC that a friend help me build it. All of my drivers in device manager look good.<br />
<br />
The sticky keys still work, just not the way they were intended to (and the way I get used to using them since Windows XP).<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

<h2>            Liteon EZ-DUB DVD&#47;CD rewritable drive model DX-20A4PU</h2>
                    
<p>Ive tryed fixin the problem with the ppl of Liteon and the told me to ask yall. I have copyed and pasted in this what i was talkin to them about&lt;Technical Support: Hello, cody. Thank you for choosing our online chat support system. What is the model number
 of your unit, and how may I assist you today ?<br />
cody: i have a ez-dub model: 20a4pu<br />
Technical Support: Can you briefly describe your problem ?<br />
cody: and when i got to my device manager it says that the driver for this device are not installed (code28)<br />
cody: my computer is runin windows vista<br />
Technical Support: Have you gone into the registry set?<br />
Technical Support: editor<br />
cody: yes i did the last time i talk to yall and ive have deleted what yall said to. and then i restarted my computer<br />
cody: and it still says the same thang<br />
Technical Support: One moment please.<br />
cody: ok<br />
Technical Support: Did you delete the upper and lower filters<br />
cody: i deleted the upper, that was the only in the registry that yall had listed for me to delete<br />
Technical Support: Can we go back to registry editor right now and double check<br />
cody: one moment<br />
cody: how do open it a again<br />
Technical Support: type regedit in the search bar<br />
cody: ok<br />
cody: ok<br />
Technical Support: Click on the plus signs (+) next to the following folders* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE* SYSTEM* CurrentControlSet* Control* Class* {4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
Technical Support: This folder is the DVD/CD-ROM Drive Class Description in the registry. Look for any of the following names in the right hand column.* UpperFilters* LowerFilters* UpperFilters.bak* LowerFilters.bak<br />
Technical Support: Reboot your computer<br />
Technical Support: Open My Computer and check to see if your CD or DVD drives have returned. You may also want to open Device Manager and verify that the yellow exclamation and error code on the CD or DVD drive is gone<br />
cody: all there is a default, class, classDesc, EnumPropPages, IconPath, installer32, noInstallClass, silentInstall<br />
cody: all are file type REG_SZ<br />
cody: hello<br />
Technical Support: Hold on...<br />
cody: what do i NEED TO DO!!!!<br />
Technical Support: Can you hold on, we are trying to find an answer for your issue<br />
cody: okay<br />
Technical Support: You need to contact Windows about this issue. Because error code 28 is a Windows Generic driver issue. Only Windows will be able to help you resolve the issue. We don't have drivers you can download. If you don't call Windows, you can try
 to do a system restore or do a system recovery using the Windows disc.&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;now when i go in to the device manager, it says other&nbsp;device with a little yellow&nbsp;sign. ok i&nbsp;rigth click on it, then go to update driver, then i choose to&nbsp;let it go online to update the software. it the says software was found and is installing. then it
 says windows encountered aproblem installing the driver software for your device.... there is a usb icon, it says usb mass storage device...... access is denied!!!</p>
<p>ok then i go to the device properties and it says:</p>
<p>The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)</p>
<p>Access is denied.</p>
<p><br />
To reinstall the drivers for this device, click Reinstall Driver.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Lite-on should have been able to give the exact registry entries needed for that drive<br />
(not just the filters).</p>
<p>The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)</p>
<p>To install the drivers for this device, click Update Driver, which starts the Hardware Update wizard.<br />
Device Manager - double click on the CD/DVD device - driver's tab.</p>
<p>================================================================</p>
<p><br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.</p>
<p>Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack. Even if drive is not shown continue<br />
below.</p>
<p>Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.</p>
<p>Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

<p>Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<p>Some DVD drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for your drive if needed.</p>
<p>===============================</p>
<p>Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly.</p>
<p>Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.</p>
<p>Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible firmware updates and<br />
the correct Registry entries for your drive.</p>
<p>These are the keys I think are the ones in question - for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.</p>
<p>Forums - a lot of real expert help<br />

<p>CD/DVD units<br />
<a href="http://www.myce.com/storage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.myce.com/storage/</a></p>
<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in DevManView and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </span><span>I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing. I would like to ask you:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Do you remember making any software or hardware changes prior to this issue?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Were you facing any other issues or errors prior to this issue?</span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue may arise due to many reasons including hardware failure or boot files gone corrupt or a driver crashing. Try the following methods and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1: Try <strong>Safe Mode</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Safe mode is the configuration of Windows, when it is running on only basic set of drivers and all the startups are disabled. To know more about safe mode, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue is resolved in safe mode, follow step 2 after restarting the computer in regular mode.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Step 2: <strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows.
 To know more, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2: Run a Start-up repair</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Please insert the Windows&nbsp;7 DVD and reboot the computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 2. When we are prompted to press a key to boot from the DVD, please press Enter or the space bar.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 3. Choose your language settings, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 4. Click Repair your computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 5. Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 6. On the System Recovery Options menu, click Startup Repair. Startup Repair might prompt you to make choices as it tries to fix the problem, and if necessary, it might restart your computer as it makes repairs</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 3: System Restore</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the method above does not work. Try running system restore. Follow the steps above to boot from the disc and go to the advanced options.</span></span></p>

            <p>Advise that you run your hard drive manufacturer's hard drive testing program.&nbsp; If you need instructions on where to get it, please provide us with the model number of your hard drive.&nbsp; You can find it under Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start globe</p>
<p>type device manager</p>
<p>select and open that window</p>
<p>in the list click on the arrow beside Disk Drives</p>
<p>You should see the model number displayed there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that model number we can identify the specific hard drive manufacturer.&nbsp; Then we can direct you to the right page to download the software.&nbsp; You may need to do this on a different computer, if yours will not get into Windows.&nbsp; If that is the case, you
 will need to download the testing program that will produce a CD that you can start your computer with that will then test your drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this to rule out the possibility that the source of your problems is a failing hard drive.</p>

            Unfortunately I can't do that. It's impossible to get into Windows. I'm taking the computer to the tech support where I bought the computer, since I've tried every solution I could find but nothing has worked.

<h2>            Windows 10 - Video_TDR_Failure &#40;NVLDDMKM.SYS&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a home pc with a Nvidia 9800GT graphics card.</p>
<p>Since I upgraded to windows 10 i get a lot of blue screens with the error Video_TDR_Failure (NVLDDMKM.SYS).</p>
<p>This happens randomly, mainly when trying to open youtube links, or while video talking with skype but not always... (3-4 times a day), basicly on any use of graphic card.</p>
<p>This started from upgrade to windows 10 and after, I have never had any issue with previous versions of windows, windows 8.1 was working perfectly.</p>
<p>I'm sending the neccessary files,</p>
<p>I hope there is a solution.</p>

            <p>Abdul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer failed on the "startup repair"... and I'm continuing to have frequent BSOD's, I'm currently willing to do a clean install (and save and reload all my files, and reinstall all my software), but want to be sure that that will fix the problem before
 wiping everything out.&nbsp; I have attempted (about 10 or more times) to run the windows 7 system backup, but it has never been successful (causes the VIDIO_TDR_FAILURE) before getting half way through backing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone been successful with this more drastic re-install? (or perhaps more important, not successful?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently using Pro Insider Preview Build 10547, and have had this problem since the first version installed and through at least 3 significant upgrades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>Windows livemail is continually showing error 0x800CCC90</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mail Is imported into my Livemail account, but all other accounts will Not import e-mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each account is continually asking for a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can access mail is by going to my ISP homepage.</p>

</p><p>The problem occurred after the latest Windows update on 25/26 November 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repairing all Windows Live Programs although successful does Not cure the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has been around for over a year now, so why can't Microsoft fix it.</p>
<p>This is most frustrating.</p>
<p>One of my neighbours has the same problem.</p>

<p>Thank you. The vulnerability that that update addresses doesn't exist on Windows 7, so there's no need to install it at all. I do have it installed on W7, though,&nbsp;and I have no problem with authenticating any of my 28 mail accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>

<p>I'm not quite sure what this means - that your password was accepted by the server the first time you tried, but not subsequently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll say again - we'll never find out why the server is sometimes refusing to authenticate you if we don't see the entire error message. I can't understand why you're so reluctant to share it.

<h2>            Games will not open up</h2>
                    The games I usually play will not open for me - mahjong titans, solitaire, freecell. Any advice on how to make them open up?

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Which
 is the version of Windows installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may also try to turn off the games feature from within ‘Turn windows feature on or off’ and then turn it on again and check if that helps. Follow the link given
 below for more information.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow the link given below.</span></p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>If behavior doesn’t persist in safe mode, it indicates that a third party program or service is preventing you from performing the action as supposed to.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>To validate or determine which service/startup item could be causing this, restart the computer and boot to desktop normally. Once done, perform clean boot.
</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b><span>Step 2:</span></b></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Perform a clean boot.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b><span>Clean boot-<span> </span></span></b><span>It’s a process wherein you can start Windows 7/Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.<span>
</span>A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
