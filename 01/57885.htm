    <title>Can&#39;t make my account &#34;My Home Xbox&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xcanadianbatman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t make my account &#34;My Home Xbox&#34;</h2>
                    <p>On my secondary account, I have tried to set it to "My Home Xbox". After doing so, it worked fine. I got all my DLC, Games, Gold etc. But then it randomly stopped making that account my home Xbox. It said that I could only make 1 account my Home Xbox, and switch up to three times a year, but I don't have any other account as my home xbox nor switched. It says that every single time I try to click "Make this my Home Xbox". What could I do to fix this?</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Hmm.. That could be the case, though, my Home Xbox was set to that account previously, but out of nowhere my Home Xbox for that account&nbsp;just stopped working. I only noticed this because my DLC stopped working for my games. I know for a fact that I&nbsp;did not switch it afterwards. At one point, the account&nbsp;was set to my home Xbox, the next day, it wasn't.</p>

            Hi Jagar.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please run the Sound Recording troubleshooter at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hey Sheriff <br />I understand why you feel frustrated by Microsoft's actions. Microsoft is trying to improve their products all the time and take feedback very seriously. You can always help by sending feedback or suggestions about their products to encourage them to tweak the application. I'm sorry to hear you don't like their stance right now but I can assure you they are trying their hardest to create a better user experience even if this takes a while.

            Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            Hi Simon,
<br />
<br />The new Skype app it is being updated constantly to bring it up to the functionality of Skype 7 . . . 
<br />
<br />In order to improve Skype, please provide feedback to Microsoft regarding any shortcomings or bugs you have found in the new Skype app on this thread
<br />

<br />
<br />If you are unhappy with the new Skype app, Microsoft have decided to extend the period for which Skype Classic (version 7) will be available, the September deadline, no longer exists
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic:

<h2>            Skype video black and white during conferences</h2>
                    Hi everyone. It seems whenever I try to make a call on Skype, I appear in black and white on the preview box and also to the other party. If I go into settings and into video settings, it appears in color and normal. I don't have this issue with any other
 program. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.

            <p>Most counterproductive solution ever.<br />
First of all people (like me) use windows in english for a reason independent from our locality. those two options display language and input language should be independent as well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My native language is not supported in windows, so i have to use a foreign language(i prefer english) and i live in turkey, so i need to write in Turkish( using a Turkish q keyboard with Turkish letters) why should i have to see my apps in Turkish while i bought
 my copy of windows (for 20 years) in english?</p>

<p>Totally sabotaging solution!</p>
<p>My native language has no adequate translation for windows administration tools and most aps. Moreover, I work in Japan and my default input Language is Japanese. Just because Japanese input totally repeats English Input, why would anybody install both here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, why the hell do I get my national language in aps instead of English, which is my "DEFAULT INTERFACE LANGUAGE" in locales?</p>
<p>Who was that idiot, who offered <strong>ignoring specially implemented locales
</strong>features?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, In windows 10, they changed interface language linking from "Location" to "Default keyboard".</p>
<p>WHAT! WTF! WHY! AGAIN!</p>
<p>I have 3 keyboards installed, neither one is English, because Latin letters are always present in any language I use.</p>
<p>SO, why the hell it gives me JAPANESE in aps, when I have specifically installed English interface everywhere I can!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fall back to Windows XP. Or at least to Win7, it was the last "sane" version of windows.</p>

            Hi ElYaiko,
<br />
<br />Library folders like Documents, Pictures . . .etc. are virtual folders, that really don't exist, they just point to a location, that is why on the Properties Dialog, you can change their location easily enough . .. 
<br />
<br />I the software you are using relies upon having a Presets folder in the root of C, if you cannot change that requirement in the software settings, then you cannot move that folder . . .

                    <p>Alright, here's my predicament, my xbox 360 is fairly old and does not have built in wifi connectivity, I recently bought an xbox one and would like to transfer my profile, since it's an offline profile, I will need to first connect that account to the internet then sync over to my xbox one. My question is, if I take an ethernet cable from my console to my dish network reciever/DVR (the receiver is wireless to my router, which is upstairs {my console and receiver are downstairs}) will the wireless connection from my dish receiver allow my 360 to go online? Sorry it's a long question, but please answer. Any response is welcome, I really want my stockpiled&nbsp;&nbsp;gamerscore and game data to my xbox one. Please help!</p>

It's most likely that the wireless connection is only for the TV signal and wouldn't work, but it's hard to know. Your&nbsp;console would either need to be Hardwired directly to a Modem or Router in this case. Is the receiver you're talking about a DISH Network Joey? If so, that wouldn't work.</p><p><br /></p><p>Let us know!</p>

            <p>I tried Windows Media &nbsp;first, then i disable Groove . this allso did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still think that the problem is with the setup of my cd/dvd writer, it is set up as the MASTER BOOT RECORD.</p>
<p>Only time you will see the cd drive letter (E:) is when you insert a disc.\, when you take the disc out then the drive letter allso disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only program that can rip my cd music to mp3 is Ashampoo, i even tried to use Nero 2015</p>

<h2>            strict NAT problems with belkin model f7d1301 v1</h2>
                    
<p>allright, so i read the NAT sticky and tried a torrent to things to resolve this problem<br />
<br />
i previously had my UPNP on, my 88,80,53, and 3074 ports forwarded in tcp and udp , and i even tried using DMZ, but no matter what i do my NAT will not open at all<br />
<br />
honestly, its not a problem with a lot of games, mainly things made by activision, i find, and unfortunately red dead redemption(which if you have anything other than an open NAT, the game apparently believes that you dont deserve to play multiplayer at all)<br />
<br />
anyways the culprit games are irrelevant so much as the problem itself<br />
<br />
Ive got a belkin f7d1301 v1 n150 wireless N router , and the cox cable company supplied modem(which has no NAT problems at all, which is expected, since if i remove the router from the system, it works perfectly fine with an open NAT, but my other machines
 cant connect of course)<br />
<br />
Ive got an older elite from 2009, i believe, or whichever year MW2 was released, and ive got it plugged into the routers secondary port with an ethernet cable , and im using manual settings for IP and DNS</p>
<p>truth be told, im at my wits end, hoping some magical mind from the bounty of the internet has a solution in their bowl of tricks, or something</p>
<p>it might be some simple thing im overlooking but so far 7 other people and belkin tech support, as well as myself havent been able to figure it out</p>

<p>You were given wrong information - what you have will not work if you have Vista. Return it.</p>

<h2>            How do I set the preferences to save the file full size in paint&#63;</h2>
                    <strong>Original Title:</strong> Paint defaults.
<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to find this specific issue. When I open a photo with "Paint", do absolutely nothing to it, then click save as jpeg. The resulting file is only HALF the size as the original file. How do I set the preferences to save the file full size? I looked
 at the "resize" drop down box and it is set at 100%. But my file size&nbsp;keeps getting cut in HALF......If I
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">CHOOSE</span> to reduce it by 50%, it seems to reduce it by 60-75%!&nbsp; ALSO, if I CHOOSE to save it as a TIFF, then it TRIPLES in file size!&nbsp;How can I save my photo files at original size by default, or even by SELECTING
 it somewhere. But, the resize box is ALREADY set at 100%, but is not saving at 100%....what's the deal, 'what up with that?'...thanks.

            <p>Sorry, but not sure I totally follow, so just to clarify, do you mean the 'file size' as seen in Right-click properties of the file, or is the actual resolution being altered?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if your original picture was a bitmap (BMP) and you save it as a JPG, then the 'file size' ( as seen in properties ) will be smaller as a JPG is compressed. BUT the resolution should remain the same, i.e. if the picture was 640x480 as a BMP, it should
 remain 640x480 as a JPG,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So to clarify, are you talking about actual file size on the disc, or the pictures resolution? If its just the file size changing with the different file type, that is correct. JPGs will be smaller than BMPs but they will be compressed to some degree. See
 - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_formats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_formats</a> for information.</p>

            The original photo file is 3000 x 4000 pixel JPEG. The "properties" box shows this pixel count. I open it in "Paint", do absolutely nothing but click the "save as" drop down menu and save as JPEG. The JPEG file saved from "Paint" is only a 1500 x 2000
 pixel JPEG. Again, opening the "properties" box shows this reduced pixel count for the "Paint" saved JPEG photo file.&nbsp; I had a look at the "resize" module in "Paint" and it says 100%.

            <p>Have you tried altering the resize level to say 40%, then saving and quiting paint. Then restarting paint and resetting it to 100% and see if that alters anything and helps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or in the meantime until a fix is found, try another free paint package like paint.net (

            Yes. Many times. I use the resize feature a lot for 'bid sheet' jpegs. I do all the MS updates &amp; retsarts as well.&nbsp; It's not a real issue for me, I just wondered about it ... strange.&nbsp; Thanks for suggestions, don't worry about it anymore. ag<br />

When he tried signing into Roblox, it gave us an error about it being linked to my account. I unlinked my account from his Roblox account and now we're getting the error that the age restrictions won't allow him to sign in. I've gone into every setting on Xbox.com and changed them; I've gone into my MS account and changed his age restrictions to allow everything and we still get the age limit error. I've tried the other suggestion regarding changing the option on the "share stuff people make on 360" and still nothing works.</p><p><br /></p><p>Any current solutions?

    <title>windows 10 printer issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> claire dodds  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 printer issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing Windows 10, my printer worked fine for a while and now it doesn't at all.&nbsp; The printer is a Canon MG4200 wireless printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attempt to print from any program, that program hangs and cannot be rebooted - they just freeze.&nbsp; This happens if I try printing from Word, the internet, or anything else.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try and open 'Devices and Printers' then that option hangs too, with no way out.&nbsp; I've tried the Bluetooth Services fix and that didn't work.&nbsp; So I can't even get in to 'Devices and Printers' to look at the printer there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran the printer troubleshooter; that got as far as 'Detecting Problems' and then that hung too, whilst 'Checking for Spooler Service Errors'.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help?&nbsp; This is a pretty big deal - I need to be able to use my printer at home; it's vital.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou. </p>

            <p>I faced same situation like you and found it myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your old printer driver is useless for windows 10,</p>
<p>go to your printer's website and get your new windows 10 compatible driver.</p>
<p>If that too doesn't help, it means that your printer manufacturer had not written windows 10 compatible driver for the said device.</p>
<p>For such cases, only one option is left and that is to get a third party driver.</p>
<p>If that too doesn't helps then either you have to buy a new printer or downgrade windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.......</p>

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing Windows 10, my printer worked fine for a while and now it doesn't at all.&nbsp; The printer is a Canon MG4200 wireless printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attempt to print from any program, that program hangs and cannot be rebooted - they just freeze.&nbsp; This happens if I try printing from Word, the internet, or anything else.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try and open 'Devices and Printers' then that option hangs too, with no way out.&nbsp; I've tried the Bluetooth Services fix and that didn't work.&nbsp; So I can't even get in to 'Devices and Printers' to look at the printer there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran the printer troubleshooter; that got as far as 'Detecting Problems' and then that hung too, whilst 'Checking for Spooler Service Errors'.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help?&nbsp; This is a pretty big deal - I need to be able to use my printer at home; it's vital.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou. </p>
</blockquote>
guess what that doesn't fix it. I have a brand new printers with new drivers for windows 10 and it won't install. When I ran the Hp Scandoctor it said that there was a conflict with the new driver and the windows driver It won't let you install a printer with
 their driver still in it and there is no way to remove it. Mistake we made was getting an expensive printer trusting that it would install. The HP rep was there when we went to get the printer and said he had been hearing complaints all day from people with
 windows 10 having the same problem 60 people on facebook are having it too. Standard version of 8.1 when upgraded to 10 corrupts the printer drivers and when it was fixed the second upgrade undid the fix so that it hasn't worked for 5 months now on my computer
 connecting to any printer. windows 10 was not ready to be put out for public use. Forbes said that they knew it had issues but went ahead and did it anyway. Now there are hundreds of users unable to use their printers and not just old ones but new one's too
 with windows 10. They are at fault and should pay to fix this for everyone.

<p>
</p><p>Kindly reply: Could you open Windows Movie Maker, click on <strong>File &gt; About</strong> and reply with the version of Windows Movie Maker installed in your computer?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's&nbsp;try following the steps below and check if it helps </p>
<p><strong>Method 1:&nbsp;</strong>Ensure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio files. Audio and Video require codecs to play the file and itâ€™s important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Run </strong><strong>DirectX Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag):&nbsp; </strong>
</p>
<p>Movie Maker makes extensive use of the video card GPU (graphics processing unit). The display driver affects the reliability, performance, and compatibility of the video card with various software.
</p>
<p>To determine the version and video card driver date, run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag):&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on<strong> Start </strong>button, type <strong>dxdiag</strong> in the Search&nbsp;bar and press
<strong>Enter</strong> key on the keyboard.&nbsp; </li><li>Click on the <strong>Display</strong> tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.</li></ul>

<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key +&nbsp;X</strong> and click on
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Expand the <strong>Display Adapter.</strong></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Right-click</strong> on the&nbsp;Graphics card and select

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. Finally i figured out with my converting video. Movie maker couldnt save it cause of its size, I suppose the convert i did was too much for this program. I cut my work in 3 pieces i merged again as a new video and it was ready for
 save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway.</p>

<p><span>To use ICS, follow the steps below.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<span>Enabling ICS</span>
<p><span>To enable ICS, on your host computer:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Network Connections by clicking the
</span></span><span><span>Start</span></span><span><span> button, clicking
</span></span><span><span>Control Panel</span></span><span><span>, clicking
</span></span><span><span>Network and Internet</span></span><span><span>, clicking
</span></span><span><span>Network and Sharing Center</span></span><span><span>, and then clicking
</span></span><span><span>Manage network connections</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click the connection that you want to share, and then click
<span>Properties</span>.<span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<span>Sharing</span> tab, and then select the <span>Allow other network users to connect through this computerâ€™s Internet connection</span> check box.</span></p>
<span>Note:
</span><span>The Sharing tab will not be available if you have only one network connection.</span>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If desired, you can also select the
<span>Allow other network users to control or disable the shared Internet connection</span> check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Optionally, to allow other network users to use services running on your network, click
<span>Settings</span> and select the services you want to allow.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When you enable ICS, your local area network (LAN) connection gets a new static IP address and configuration, so you'll need to reestablish any TCP/IP connections between
 your host computer and the other network computers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To test your network and Internet connection, see if you can share files between computers and make sure each computer can reach a website.
</span></p>
<span>Step 2:</span>
<span>Configure TCP/IP</span>
<p><span>To use ICS, make sure the local area network (LAN) connection on each network computer is configured to get an IP address automatically. To do this:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Network Connections by clicking the
</span></span><span><span>Start</span></span><span><span> button, clicking
</span></span><span><span>Control Panel</span></span><span><span>, clicking
</span></span><span><span>Network and Internet</span></span><span><span>, clicking
</span></span><span><span>Network and Sharing Center</span></span><span><span>, and then clicking
</span></span><span><span>Manage network connections</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click the LAN connection, and then click
<span>Properties</span>.<span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<span>Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)</span> or <span>
Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)</span>, and then click <span>
Properties</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<span>Obtain an IP address automatically</span> or <span>
Obtain an IPv6 address automatically</span>.<br />
</span><span><br />

<h2>            Cerberus Network question</h2>
                    
<p>I used my cerberus network code on another account like a year ago and I don't know what I did with it. I go on my new account, and it says I need the code. Is there a way I can get the code on this account without paying for it? Seems kind of dumb how the
 one code doesn't go for all accounts... :/</p>

<h2>            Computer crashing with the WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR,  HAL.dll included.</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I have a problem with my computer.</p>
<p>I think it's related to the CPU's temp, once its too high (100 degrees etc.) it decides to crash with the WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR, including hal.dll.</p>
<p>It only happens while playing games (Rainbow6).</p>
<p>I went to a technician and he changed my cooler to Arctic Freezer Pro 7, i have an i7 4790k, i removed my overclock.</p>

            Hi Niente007, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .
