<h2>            Windows 10-BSOD, Problems with ntoskrnl.exe, nvvad64v.sys and portcls.sys.</h2>
                    <p>Hello all!</p>
<p>I was having some problems with my computer crashing every so often, so to solve it I updated windows and my drivers and it got a lot worse! Running the verifier I was unable to get a dump file, so I restored my windows to before the update and managed to
 get a dump file from there which I sent a link to below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://drive.google.com/open?id=1abRYjhFQiyr3iSQ7w5OKMAtj2AFqnS-Y</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            How To FIX a Corrupted TCP&#47;IP &#40;Or if You Can&#39;t use the Internet&#41;</h2>
                    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<p>-When my TCP/IP was corrupted I was running Windows 8.1 on a laptop where an Ethernet cable was not practical nor even work.</p>
<p>-I've already tried changing my Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) to follow a DNS server address I found on the internet, but I would not recommend you to try that.</p>
<p>-I've already tried to resolve this problem with 3rd Party TCP/IP Repair programs which did nothing at all since they required internet access. (*Face Palm)</p>
<p>-I've already tried to repair the TCP/IP Winsock through Command Prompt&nbsp;<strong>AND</strong>&nbsp;I've ran the reset log parameter</p>
<p>-<strong>THIS discussion</strong><strong>&nbsp;is &nbsp;ONLY for users that got no success with the listed above options and could not resolve the issue</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>*Disclaimer: I am not a certified computer technician. This process simply worked for me and I thought since no one published how to resolve the issue through this process it would be best to share it with the public. Be advised that you take full
 responsibility for any unsaved data losses during this process.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi everyone, if you're here because you can't access your internet but your wireless icon is white and lit up as if your machine is connected, and you're running Windows 8 or 8.1, this discussion is for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this you will have to be in Desktop mode</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>First thing first, check your Media State: (To see if your TCP/IP is corrupted)</strong></p>
<p>1) Go to Control Panel (Right click on the Start icon on the bottom left corner of your screen and click Control Panel)</p>
<p>2) Click Network and Internet, then click Network and Sharing</p>
<p>3) Under <strong>view your active networks</strong> you will see the name of the network you're connected to and to the right: &nbsp;<strong>Access Type:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HomeGroup:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Connections: Wireless Network Name</strong></p>
<p>Next to <strong>HomeGroup&nbsp;</strong>will say Not Connected.</p>
<p>4) Click on the wireless network that you're connected to located on the right of
<strong>Connections:</strong></p>
<p>A dialog box titled <strong>Wi-Fi Status</strong> will appear.</p>
<p>On the right of <strong>Media State&nbsp;</strong>you should see <strong>Not enabled</strong> or
<strong>Not connected</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To verify this click the&nbsp;<strong>Diagnose&nbsp;</strong>tab at the bottom the dialog box and after following its instructions you should eventually get to a point where Windows will try to repair a network problem, however for me this did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Here's what we're doing:</strong></p>
<p>Basically we have to either re-install Windows 8.1 or 8 <strong>OR</strong> reset it to Factory settings.</p>
<p>BUT if you have a recovery CD then you're in LUCK! (If so then I'm sure by now you know what to do with it)</p>
<p><strong>IF you were like ME, with a laptop pre-installed with Windows 8 and without a recovery disc</strong>
<strong>THEN KEEP READING.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>STEPS:</strong></p>
<p>1) <strong>You will need to Back up your data</strong>. I found that sadly a Windows image File or the backup Windows does for you created an exact replica of my previous system but with the corrupted TCP/IP. So for this you will have to manually back up
 any files and documents or pictures you want to keep, but sadly software is not salvageable, so take a screenshot of or write down the programs you want to re-install on your rebooted system for later.</p>
<p>2a) Now that you've saved everything, you will have two options: Reset to Factory settings or re-install windows. I didn't have spare cash nor any Windows CDs so I simply reset mine, PLUS IT'S FREE.</p>
<p>2b)<strong> To re-install Windows 8 or 8.1</strong> I would seek a technician to ensure that you don't have two instances of the same Operating System running on the same computer (and yes a friend of mine confirmed it was possible... No clue how.). And
 be advised that you probably will have to buy Windows 8 or 8.1 again as locating your serial key on your current system isn't easy (it requires a 3rd party program)</p>
<p>2c) <strong>To reset to Factory settings:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1) Move your cursor to the top right of your screen and click on the bottom icon called
<strong>settings</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2) Now click <strong>Change PC Settings</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3) Now on the left panel click <strong>Update and Recovery&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4)&nbsp;Click<strong> Recovery </strong>again on the left panel</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5) Now choose the middle option, <strong>Remove everything and reinstall windows
</strong>(Click<strong> Get started</strong>)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6) A pop-up screen that says <strong>Please Wait </strong>should appear, followed by another titled: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Reset your PC&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7)&nbsp;Click next and click the bottom option, <strong>Fully clean the drive.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8)&nbsp;Then click <strong>Reset</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9) After the reset your system will ask you to choose your country, language, and so forth. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Follow the instructions and provide the information asked to complete the installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10) Now believe it or not the Wireless will be disabled when we sign in. IF it isn't, well hey that's &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;great news. If not then... To fix this problem move your cursor to the top right of your screen and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;click on the bottom icon called&nbsp;<strong>settings</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;11) Now click&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;12)&nbsp;Click <strong>Network and Internet</strong>, then click <strong>Network and Sharing</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;13) Click <strong>Troubleshoot Problems</strong>, then choose Network Adapter</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;14) Click next, Select Wi-Fi, then Click next again</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15) The troubleshooter will diagnose and fix the problem. After that, the wifi icon on your toolbar should appear again but gray. Simply choose a network that you trust and put in the password if it's secure. Once the wifi icon on the toolbar appears
 white you're good to go!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck everyone, and thanks for stopping by! I hope this helps. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them and if not will get the attention of certified technicians who will do their best to simply such subject matters.</p>

<h2>            Cannot navigate to website in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>I cannot navigate to a website on Windows 7 machines.&nbsp;&nbsp;Http://xxx.xxxxxx.com:8080</p>
<p>I disabled the firewall on both Windows 7 machines.&nbsp; One machine was a fresh install with no anti-virus installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; When both machines would not work I tried Google Chrome, Firefox and still could not connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can connect to all other websites that I try with both Windows 7 machines.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I got the IP address of the remote server and tried to connect to http://111.111.111.111:8080&nbsp;on the windows 7 machines.&nbsp; They did not connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I tried the website address on 2 different&nbsp;Windows XP machines.&nbsp; I tried the IP address:8080 and FQDN. They both connect.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I diagnose the connection problems it says The device or resource (ebuy.endries.com) is not set up to accept connections on port "8080".&nbsp;I know this is not true because I can connect to the website on WinXP machines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On your Windows 7 Pc:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to <strong>Start</strong></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Run <strong>cmd</strong></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>After Cmd opens type this: <strong><em>netsh winsock reset catalog</em></strong></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press <strong>Enter</strong></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Next, type this command: <strong><em>netsh intip reset reset.log</em></strong></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Now <strong>reboot</strong> your computer and see if you can connect to the website</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if this helps <span><span>J</span></span></p>

<h2>            secpol fault on Windows 10 PRO</h2>
                    <p>My install of Windows 10 PRO (build 1511) gives me an error (popup message)&nbsp;when I try to open the Local Security Policy, which seems to indicate that the Namespace is repeated in the .admx file</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft-Windows-Geolocation-WLPAdm.admx&nbsp;&nbsp; - dated 10 July 2015 9:00PM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note the old file date on this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibly I could manually edit this, but I am loathe to do that if there is a way to have Windows fix it for me.</p>

            <p><strong>UNSOLVED</strong></p>
<p>and I can't find an forum at MSDN, perhaps I will check TechNet.</p>
<p>A search did find a solution that involves deleting and renaming the .admx files (and matching additional files), but
<p>I haven't activated the hidden administrative user logon, perhaps that is the only way to follow that recommendation?</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Group Policy Management Console</strong></p>
<p>When attempting to copy the contents of C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions from a Windows 10 client to the central policy store that contains down-level policies, you will see an error dialog stating, "Namespace 'Microsoft.Policies.Sensors.WindowsLocationProvider'
 is already defined as the target namespace for another file in the store." To address this issue:<br />
1. Dismiss the error dialog.<br />
2. Delete LocationProviderAdm.admx and LocationProviderAdm.adml from the central store.<br />
3. Rename Microsoft-Windows-Geolocation-WLPAdm.admx and Microsoft-Windows-Geolocation-WLPAdm.admx in the central store to LocationProviderAdm.admx and LocationProviderAdm.adml, respectively.</p>

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see any reply from the original Author, but I have the same question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So &nbsp;in answer to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) No I am not. I can already unpin that icon from the taskbar</p>
<p>2) I have three working monitors in extended desktop mode, and I still don't want the task view abomination.</p>
<p>3) I don't understand the purpose of this question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So let me try to explain clearly what bugs the F'n F out of me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What seems randomly occurring to me, is that when I am doing some activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleting email</li><li>Clicking a link</li><li>Getting ready to grab a window</li><li>Hovering</li><li>Copy for cut and paste</li><li>Use an app that produces a pop-up</li><li>Clicking a new tab in a browser</li><li>The list goes on and on and on</li></ul>
<p>The f'ing OS goes into F'ing task view mode. It is THE MOST ANNOYING FEATURE EVER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to disable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that is the same problem. Dillybars was not talking about '<em>photo email</em>' but about
<em>attached</em> photos. Photo email is the process that uploads pictures to OneDrive while sending a link to the uploaded files to the intended recipient.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">If you look around in this forum, you'll see several recent threads about the broken photo email feature. There's been no official response yet, so we have to find alternative methods meanwhile.</p>

            <p>I have had the same problem with sending pictures .. The other day from my picture folder I tried to send a bunch of pictures .. the pictures attached ok to the email ( Windows live mail) I clicked on send . Publishing photo album came up like normal ...
 most times this will take a min or so depending on how many pictures I send .. then it will to sending .. I have it so it will show my sending progress and when sent this box will go away .

<p>
</p><p>Found this thread while searching for "Publishing photos" and "Windows Live Mail" on Bing/Google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My parents (using Windows Live Mail 2012) too have this problem - it began a few hours ago (Wednesday, June 24th 2015) when they sent a photo e-mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been able to recreate the problem using Windows Live Mail 2012 on Windows 8.1, logged in using my standard Windows Live ID. Since I've created a photo e-mail with 4 random photos, I too get the error message "Publishing photos", and no matter how
 long I wait the window with the message remains open. Since the photo e-mail doesn't show up in the local outbox, nor at the server "Sent" map, I can't delete it either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TL;DR - the error is&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(106, 106, 106, 1); font-weight: bold">definitely,&nbsp;</span>without any doubt
<strong>a server-side error on Microsoft's behalf</strong>. Any moderators reading this thread are
<strong>strongly advised</strong> to bring the issue up with whoever is responsible for photo messages and Windows Live Essentials 2012. Thank you in advance!<br />

    <title>mp3 recording program and Windows 10 Skype - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            mp3 recording program and Windows 10 Skype</h2>
                    I was forced to install the windows 10 skype app. I need to record my skype calls and I am using an mp3 recording program. With the non&nbsp;windows&nbsp;10 version, this was not a problem. I am not able to do it now with the new version. I am trying to find where
 in settings I can go to give the permission for the program to be used. Your assistance is appreciated.

</p><p>Skype does not natively support Skype call recording, and&nbsp;in connection&nbsp;to the issues and problems encountered in the suggested third party applications to make this feature possible, it might be best to contact its developers as these third party applications

<h2>            Windows 10 Reset stuck on &#34;Just a moment&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I had an HP laptop lying around I hadn't used in awhile... And decided to do a complete factory reset to start fresh and make sure my computer was as fast as it could be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted, pressed f11 to enter the advanced menu, and did a complete reset where I deleted everything. After a few hours, I'm greeted with the welcome screen with Cortana.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time, I get past where she asks about my country and keyboard layout, and then she says "now we have some important setup to do" and the system tells me to wait "just a moment" and it's just an infinite loop of that screen. Other times, I'll
 turn the laptop on and it won't even get past the keyboard layout setup, it will just freeze there where I can't even move the mouse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read this could be an issue where a windows update screws with some kind of driver. I was wondering if I could get help with this issue so I can boot into windows and use my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've shut it down via the power button a few times now and booted back up only to keep having these issues.</p>

            Hi Mr. Jordan,
<br />
<br />Welcome to our community.
<br />This is Leocadia, independent community expert, and I am glad to assist you today.
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear about this inconvenience. Now, we would like to help you promptly. 
<br />It looks like the factory reset did not happen properly and not everything was deleted. Now the laptop keeps rebooting. Not worry, I'll do my best to help you. 
<br />
<br />
<br />We recommend you to perform the following steps to isolate the issue and arrive at a fix: 
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />    Power off the laptop.
<br />    Remove the battery out. If the battery is integrated and does not have a latch to release it then leave the battery inside the laptop.
<br />    Disconnected AC adapter from the laptop.
<br />    Press and hold the power button for 15 seconds.
<br />    Reconnect the battery and plug the AC adapter.
<br />    Power ON the laptop.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Please perform a system recovery by following the steps mentioned below:
<br />
<br />
<br />Turn off the computer.
<br />Disconnect all connected devices and cables such as Personal Media Drives, USB drives, printers, and faxes. Remove media from internal drives, and remove any recently added internal hardware.
<br />Do not disconnect the monitor, keyboard, mouse, or power cord.
<br />Turn on the computer and repeatedly press the F11 key about once every second until the Choose and option screen is displayed, and then continue.
<br />On the Choose an Option screen, click Troubleshoot.
<br />Choose an option with Troubleshoot selected
<br />On the Troubleshoot screen, click Recovery Manager.
<br />Troubleshoot screen with Recovery Manager selected
<br />Under Help, click System Recovery.
<br />Recovery Manager with Help and System Recovery selected
<br />When Recovery Manager prompts you to back up your files, select a backup option:
<br />
<br />    note: Depending on the version of Windows, the following screens might appear slightly different.
<br />
<br />Follow the instructions to backup your files and recover the system.
<br />
<br />    If you have already backed up personal files or you do not want to back up personal files, select Recover without backing up your files, and then click Next. Continue to the next step.
<br />
<br />    If you want to back up your personal files, follow these steps to create a backup.
<br />
<br />The Welcome to HP Recovery Manager screen is displayed. Read the on-screen information, and then disconnect any connected devices and cables, such as Personal Media Drives, USB drives, printers, and faxes.
<br />Remove media from internal drives, and remove any recently added internal hardware.
<br />Do not disconnect the monitor, keyboard, mouse, or power cord.
<br />Click Next to continue.
<br />
<br />    note: This process can take as long as 30 to 45 minutes. Do not interrupt HP Recovery Manager during the recovery process.
<br />
<br />When recovery preparation is complete, click Continue to proceed to the installation phase of the recovery process. The computer restarts several times during the recovery. This is normal. Do not close, shut down, or disconnect the computer while HP Recovery runs.
<br />Recovery preparation is complete
<br />
<br />After the system recovery is complete, click Finish to restart the computer. Complete the setup screens and wait until the computer finishes the setup.
<br />Once the setup is complete, turn off the computer, reconnect all devices and cables, and then turn on the computer.
<br />
<br />Before using the computer, update and protect your computer by reinstalling any virus and security software that was installed before the system recovery.
<br />Reinstall any software programs that were added after purchasing the computer, as well as any files that were backed up.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope it helps, but let me know if you need further assistance.

            <p>Hi Yvonne Husen, 
</p>
<p>I see that the volume control icon has disappeared from the taskbar. I will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>2.Which security software is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>3.Which steps did you perform to increase the free space on the C drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1.</b></p>
<p>You may run this fixit and check.</p>
<p><b>Automatically diagnose and fix Windows audio playback problems</b><span>:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/audioplayback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/audioplayback</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2.</b></p>
<p><span>To add the
<b>Volume</b> icon to the notification area of your computer, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>1-Click
<b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Run</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>2-Copy and paste or type the following command in the
<b>Open</b> box, and then click <b>OK</b>:</span></p>
<p><b>mmsys.cpl</b></p>
<p><span>3-Click to select the
<b>Place volume icon in the taskbar</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>4-Click
<b>OK</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3.</b></p>
<p><span>You may perform a system restore to a date when the computer was working fine. System Restore takes "snapshots" of critical system files and some program files and registry
 settings, and then it stores this information as restore points. If your computer is not functioning correctly, you can use these restore points to return Windows XP to a previous state when your computer was functioning correctly.</span></p>

<p><b>Note</b><span> System Restore does not affect personal files, such as email messages, documents, or photos. You can only restore files that you have deleted if you have made backups
 of those files.</span></p>

<p>I have a problem on my controller came with Xbox one system.</p>
<p>RT button makes disturbing noise whenever push it.</p>
<p>I called xbox service center in Korea to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Service person answered it would be covered by warrenty.</p>
<p>However, there is no available parts at the service center.</p>
<p>They don't know when they get the parts.</p>
<p>So, I have to wait till it become possible.</p>
<p>They also said they cannot accept my service request, because they don't have the parts.</p>
<p>It sounds like I have to wait forever. And, I really don't understand why I have take all the disadvantages cause by internal issues of Microsoft.</p>
<p>I even couldn't get the rough date when I get the service.</p>
<p>They keep saying that they call me back when they receive the stock.</p>
<p>I never thought warrenty service could be difficult and hard to understand this much.</p>
<p>Please send them service parts, so let me get the warrenty service. OK?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi Ranier, let us see if we can get Windows Update running again:
<br />
<br />Open a Command Prompt as Administrator
<br />
<br />Run these commands one at a time and hit Enter
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Check the see if Windows Update is now running . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />If Not, a great way of fixing issues with Windows update is to manually update your system
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />Go to update and Security - Automatic Updates
<br />Note down the KB number of a Cumulative Update that is having problems installing
<br />Close the Settings App
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />In the resulting dialog, note down the version of Windows you are running (1607, 1703, 1709 . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Click the link below to go to the Microsoft Catalog page:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />In the Search Box type Windows 10 and your Version No. (e.g. Windows 10 1703)
<br />
<br />In the resulting list of Updates find the update KB number you noted down earlier and download it
<br />
<br />Install that update by running the MSU file that downloads, that should clear any blockage in Windows 10 Update

            Try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + X.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.
<br />
<br />2. Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver
<br />
<br />3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />
<br />4. Now, let’s restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Typethe following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                        net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />                        net start cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                        net start bits
<br />
<br />                        net start msiserver
<br />
<br />5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it and then restart the computer. 
<br />

            Please follow these methods 
<br />1. Make Sure Your Webcam Can Work
<br />First and foremost, let’s start with this pearl of wisdom. Please do take it seriously – lots of webcam issues are reported to have been resolved by following this pretty straightforward piece of advice.
<br />
<br />So, take a closer look at your device:
<br />
<br />Is it on?
<br />Is it pointing towards you?
<br />Is there anything obstructing it?
<br />Is your video switched on?
<br />If answering those questions hasn’t helped you fix the ‘Skype won’t detect my webcam’ problem, then you should dig a little deeper.
<br />
<br />2. Connect Your USB Webcam to Another Port
<br />Here are some port-related tricks to make your webcam accessible:
<br />
<br />If you use an external camera, try connecting it to another USB port.
<br />If your webcam is connected to a USB 3.0 port, connect it to a USB 2.0 port.
<br />Your USB hub / docking station might be having issues – connect your camera directly to your computer’s USB port.
<br />Check whether Skype can find your webcam now.
<br />
<br />No luck? Then move on to the following tip – this decision may prove momentous.
<br />
<br />3. Test Your Webcam
<br />We know you can go to great lengths in order to recapture your precious webcam – especially if you have spent a small fortune on it. But before resorting to drastic measures, you should carry out a proper investigation into the case.
<br />
<br />Let’s start with testing your webcam:
<br />
<br />To test your webcam with the Windows Camera app, do the following:
<br />
<br />Windows logo key + X -&gt; Search -&gt; Type Camera into the Search box -&gt; Enter
<br />Camera app -&gt; Allow to give your computer permission to use the camera
<br />Examine the output on the screen -&gt; Close the Camera app
<br />You can also go to TestMyCam.com to test your device.
<br />
<br />Besides, it is a good idea to check whether your external webcam is fine by testing it on another Windows-based PC. Obviously, a defective camera will not work anywhere, which means it must be replaced.
<br />
<br />Now read on as it is time to run some diagnostics.
<br />
<br />4. Run the DirectX Diagnostics Tool
<br />First, make sure your DirectX version is at least 9.0 – otherwise, Skype video calls will not work.
<br />
<br />Then run the DirectX diagnostics tool to shed some light on your webcam mystery:
<br />
<br />Windows logo key + R -&gt; Type dxdiag.exe into the Run box -&gt; OK
<br />Wait for the diagnostics to complete
<br />Save the results to a text file
<br />We hope you have just scared up a valuable piece of information.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />To do that, make use of Task Manager:
<br />
<br />Ctrl + Alt + Del -&gt; Task Manager -&gt; Processes -&gt; Select the process which can be using your camera -&gt; End Task
<br />
<br />7. Disable and Enable Your Webcam
<br />Reportedly, this quick and simple procedure is capable of fixing the ‘Skype doesn’t find the webcam’ issue.
<br />
<br />Windows Device Manager can help you out:
<br />
<br />Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Performance and Maintenance -&gt; System -&gt; Hardware tab -&gt; Device Manager
<br />or
<br />Win + X -&gt; Device Manager -&gt; Imaging Devices
<br />Right-click on your webcam -&gt; Select Disable device
<br />Right-click on your webcam again -&gt; Select Enable device
<br />Close Device Manager
<br />Using Device Manager to fix your webcam issues.
<br />
<br />Check whether your webcam is OK now.
<br />
<br />8. Delete and Reinstate Your Webcam
<br />If you want to beat ‘My webcam has disappeared’ problem, deleting and reinstating the problematic camera may prove really helpful.
<br />
<br />Here is how to perform the trick:
<br />
<br />Win + X -&gt; Device Manager -&gt; Imaging Devices
<br />Left-click on your webcam -&gt; Press Del on the keyboard to remove it from Device Manager
<br />Make sure Delete the driver software for this device option is unchecked -&gt;Confirm your actions
<br />Device Manager -&gt; Action menu -&gt; Select Scan for hardware changes -&gt; Your webcam will be automatically reinstated
<br />9. Check Your Privacy Settings
<br />If Skype can’t see your webcam, make sure your privacy settings are correct.
<br />
<br />To check them, go this way:
<br />
<br />Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Privacy settings
<br />Automatically receive video and share screen with -&gt; Anyone or People in my contact list only should be selected
<br />10. Check Your Video Settings
<br />If your webcam has ‘gone missing’, we recommend you to check whether it is correctly configured.
<br />
<br />To access your video settings, go this way:
<br />
<br />Windows logo key + S -&gt; Type troubleshooter into the Search box
<br />Troubleshooting Control Panel -&gt; Hardware and Sound -&gt; Hardware and Devices -&gt; Next
<br />The Hardware and Devices troubleshooter will run a scan
<br />Restart your PC after using the troubleshooter
<br />Has the method above provided a fix for your webcam?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Windows logo key + R -&gt; Type regedit.exe into the Run box-&gt; Enter
<br />Registry Editor -&gt; Select the registry keys and/or subkeys you want to back up -&gt; File &gt; Export
<br />Choose the location and name for the backup file -&gt; Save
<br />To back up your personal files, you can use portable storage devices or special backup software, e.g. Auslogics BitReplica.
<br />
<br />To create a system restore point, go this way:
<br />
<br />Start menu -&gt; Type restore -&gt; Create a restore point
<br />System Properties -&gt; Create -&gt; Describe briefly the restore point -&gt; Create
<br />Now feel free to edit your registry:
<br />
<br />
<br />Start (right-click) -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; System and Security
<br />File History -&gt; Recovery -&gt; Open System Restore -&gt; Next
<br />Select the most recent working restore point -&gt; Next -&gt; Finish -&gt; Yes
<br />16. Reinstall Your Webcam Drivers
<br />You can try reinstalling your webcam drivers to fix the ‘Skype can’t find the camera’ issue.
<br />
<br />Make use of Device Manager:
<br />
<br />Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Performance and Maintenance -&gt; System -&gt; Hardware tab -&gt; Device Manager
<br />or
<br />Win + X -&gt; Device Manager -&gt; Imaging Devices
<br />Right-click on your webcam -&gt; Uninstall device -&gt; Uninstall
<br />Reboot your PC
<br />Your webcam drivers will be installed automatically
<br />Check whether your webcam is back home again.
<br />
<br />17. Update Your Webcam Drivers
<br />The notorious ‘My webcam is not detected’ problem is often caused by outdated webcam drivers. To get them back on track, move on to the following solutions.
<br />
<br />Run Driver Verifier
<br />Windows Driver Verifier is a built-in tool that can help your figure out if your webcam drivers are having issues.
<br />
<br />To use it, go this way:
<br />
<br />Windows logo key + S -&gt; Type verifier into the search box -&gt; Enter
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />Command Prompt -&gt; Input verifiergui.exe -&gt; Enter
<br />
<br />Follow the prompts to track down problematic drivers.
<br />
<br />Use Device Manager
<br />If Skype keeps having issues with your camera, your webcam drivers might need updating. In such a case, Device Manager can lend you a helping hand.
<br />
<br />To update your webcam drivers using Device Manager, perform the following steps:
<br />
<br />Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Performance and Maintenance -&gt; System -&gt; Hardware tab -&gt; Device Manager
<br />or
<br />Win + X -&gt; Device Manager
<br />Imaging Devices -&gt; Double-click on your webcam -&gt; Properties
<br />Click on the Driver tab -&gt; Right-click on your webcam -&gt; Update driver -&gt; Search automatically for updated driver software
<br />If newer webcam drivers are found, install them and check your webcam
<br />Fix Your Webcam Drivers Manually
<br />If you are a natural troubleshooter, you might enjoy updating your webcam drivers manually:
<br />
<br />Go to your vendor’s website, find and download the driver for your webcam model
<br />Double-click on the downloaded exe.file and follow the on-screen prompts to install the driver
<br />Bear in mind that there might not be a Windows 10 driver for your camera. In such a case, you will have to download the driver for Windows 7/8 – they tend to work well on Windows 10.
<br />I hope it helps

            Thank you for providing me with the methods, I've tried all the methods you've provided but none of them worked. The imaging device only provide me only Microsoft as the only manufacture and none of the devices could be recognized by the computer and for
 camera device, no option provided and its says i must have a disk. In trouble shooting option, no hardware and devices option available. I even tried to download devices from the company website and it didn't work as well so at this point i'm lost and I've
 got no idea what to do.

            <p>Hi Ami,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for us to determine the cause of this issue, we'd like to know if you've made any changes or installed an application or program before this issue occurred.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For initial troubleshooting, we suggest performing a clean boot. By doing this we will be able to identify if the issue was caused by a software conflict. Software conflicts occur when you recently installed an application, program, or an update. To perform
 a clean boot, refer to the article below:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have a wondering about how to use a stream mic for better quality while still playing on my xbox one X. Is there a way to, for example, use a stream mic on my windows 10 and chat in party ”there” while still hear my game audio and chat in my Astro A50?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you understood my question and would be happy to hear how you guys do it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It depends on the type of your streaming Microphone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's an USB microphone, then no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Microphone has an analogue connector (e.g. 3.5mm jack), you could use a headphone/microphone to CTIA adapter, and plug your Astro into the headphone plug and your streamer microphone to the microphone plug, and then plug the CTIA adapter into the
 controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, if you use a third party streaming software and are screen capturing from your PC, you can start the Party through the Xbox App on your PC, and stream the game to a capture card on your PC. Then you can mix the game audio from the captured
 console with your party sound (if your streaming software allows such a mix), and then stream that from your capturing PC to your streaming platform.</p>

<h2>            Cant open Windows Settings</h2>
                    I am having many weird problems. I cant open any windows settings or apps. They actually do 'open' but its like they open minimized and I cant do anything to actually see the window. Also when I open the start menu, it will not close unless i hit the start
 menu button again, whereas before I could just click away from it and it would automatically close. Any ideas??
