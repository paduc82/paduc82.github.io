                    <p>The party’s not over! Get the After-Party Upgrade for Sticker Packs containing: - Party Corn - Party SuperBrainz - 2 RUX Abilities - 50 Rainbow Stars</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I opened the RUX Abilities I got coins instead (50K &amp; 20K) </p>
<p>Anyone else get stiffed? Abilities if you were to one from RUX run from 250 -750K that I've seen. I talked with EA support, they say it's a MS issue.</p>

<p>Hi Walter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with the issue. This would not be a Microsoft issue as the DLC comes from the developer. When you get the wrong items in a pack the developer would be the one to fix that. Microsoft doesn't have the means to log into the game
 server and fix it. When you get with EA again, let them know all but 2 items were right and the two you didn't get what the pack states you got coins instead. Unless you can purchase the RUX abilities in game for the amount of coins you received. Try that
 see if you can purchase them in game with coins. That might of been what happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Guru</strong>_And we do not have the option to refund the third party purchases, I would suggest you to please contact the Microsoft support so that they could assist you better as we do not have the option to fetch the third party account details.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Walter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Products on the Microsoft store are advertised by the developer of the game. Considering that the content you were intending to receive from your purchase was not what was expected, it may be best to reach out to the developer once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do not have the tools necessary to assist with this, as stated by Brad above, and this would best be handled by EA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be locking this thread, but if you require any further assistance, feel free to create a new thread detailing the issue and we'll be glad to assist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

    <title>Locked out of Windows 10 PC after changing family features folder name - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobbybenny12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out of Windows 10 PC after changing family features folder name</h2>
                    <p>So last night I was trying to focus on my own work and I kept getting a popup saying something along the lines of "Sign in now so you don't miss out!" (<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_family/family-features-sign-in-so-you-dont-miss-out-keeps/32e5e632-8267-4180-ba2e-c1c877bb193d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_family/family-features-sign-in-so-you-dont-miss-out-keeps/32e5e632-8267-4180-ba2e-c1c877bb193d</a>)
 It kept popping up so I found a solution on Reddit that told me to rename the Microsoft Family Features folder. So I did and forgot to undo the change before restarting my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I restarted my computer and got stuck on the "Times Up!" screen after logging in, that's the furthest I can get. I know I can fix this by renaming the Family Features folder back to the original name which was something like "Microsoft Family Features
 - (String of characters and numbers here".&nbsp; I have tried restarting the computer again and I do not have backup snapshots of the computer to revert back to. My abilities are very limited as I am stuck to the login screen and the "Times Up!" Screen. I have
 had my parents remove me from the Microsoft Family group, I still got a message saying "Something went wrong" when trying to send a screentime request. So I was added back to the group. Nothing happens. Nothing from outside affects the "Times Up!" and "Something
 went wrong" screens after I renamed the Family features folder.&nbsp;<strong>How can I rename the Microsoft Family Features folder back to its original name?</strong> Reinstalling Windows is the only other option I have and that doesn't seem like a very viable
 option since I would be losing years of work and many important documents. My Windows apps are on my C Drive and I just need to know the path of this folder and how to rename it through the command prompt since I have access to the command prompt if I shift+click
 the restart button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I looked up the path of the folder and got part of the file path&nbsp;<del>C:\ProgramFiles\WindowsApps</del></p>
<p>I still need to know what the name of the Family features folder is and how I can rename it using the command prompt so I can restore my access to my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also the only account on my computer.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I found the folder path&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)"><strong>C:\Windows\SystemApps\ParentalControls_cw5n1h2txyewy</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">I remember exactly what I renamed the folder to, I just removed the y at the end of the string of characters.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried changing the current directory of the recovery command prompt to c:\windows\systemapps\&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following happened:</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17134.1]</strong></p>
<p>Not enough memory resources are available to process this command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>X: \windows\system32&gt;cd c:\windows\systemapps\</p>
<p>
</p><p>X: \windows\system32&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>nothing happens</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am currently using Version 10.0.17134.1 and the offline command prompt will not work because "Not enough memory resources are available to process this command."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The furthest I can get to is X:\windows\ by doing</p>
<p>cd..</p>
<p>cd..&nbsp;</p>
<p>cd x:\windows\</p>
<p>if I try cd c: or cd d: all I get is "The system cannot find the path specified, this is not a hardware problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I put the drive with the windows installation in another computer and fixed the folder name issue and put the drive back in my computer and I still have the same issue.</p>
<p>I also ran the family safety troubleshooter and it says that the family safety is corrupted. I did the scan on a windows 7 PC with the windows 10 drive plugged in.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm an engineer on the family safety team...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lotsa wrong in this thread:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "family safety troubleshooter" does not work on Windows 10.&nbsp; Do not use it, do not trust it, do not believe it.&nbsp; Please just pretend it doesn't exist.</li><li>"cd c:\windows\systemapps\" changed the current directory within the C: drive but you're in the X: drive.&nbsp; You needed to do "C:" or "cd /d c:\windows\systemapps".&nbsp; That's just how DOS works and the modern command prompt copied all its quirks.</li><li>Messing with system files puts your machine into an unsupported state.&nbsp; You need to run System Restore or do an in-place reinstall to fix your computer.</li></ul>
<p>But at the end of the day the problem was exactly what that dialog box was prompting you about.&nbsp; Your computer can't talk to the Family Safety service until you re-enter your Microsoft Account password.&nbsp; So it will never get the message from the Family Safety
 service to turn off Family Safety.&nbsp; Even worse, you can't fix it because you disabled the app that was there to help you fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you got access to the machine again, the solution would be to do an in-place upgrade - this means, use the Windows media creation tool to get a Windows setup DVD or USB key (of the same version you're already running) and run setup.exe and do an "upgrade"
 to the same version you're already running.&nbsp; This will fully reinstall the OS components and put them back the way they were.&nbsp; It should not reset your settings, but Windows will basically act like you upgraded even though you're still on the same version,
 so it might show some "hello" screens again.</p>

<h2>            Skype to go blocked number</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently called my Skype to go access number, and received a voice message saying that 'Sorry, your skype to go number has been blocked. To unblock it, go to skype.com and fill in a customer service request'. If I try any of my skype to go numbers for
 my contacts, I get the same message. I haven't used the numbers for quite some time, so I'm not sure if maybe they have been expired, but it is not through any inappropriate use; last time I used them they were working. I had a live chat with skype support
 but this did not resolve the problem other than to tell me that yes I would need to complete a request form, and when asked where exactly on the site I could find this request, I was told that it would be emailed to me, but I didn't ever receive an email.
 Does anyone know a solution to this?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Karen</p>
<p />

    <title>Scrolling issues with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sherlinob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scrolling issues with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I switched to Windows 10, I see that the check box of Scrolling gets de-selected in the Mouse settings automatically, whenever I boot my laptop. I need to go to the Mouse settings and select the check box manually to ensure smooth vertical and horizontal
 scrolling via Synaptics mouse touchpad. I did not face this issue in Windows 8 or 8.1. Has anyone experienced similar issue?</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sherl</p>

    <title>DESPERATELY trying to get a slideshow created on Movie Maker as a MP4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> debbie holley  say:</h3>
<h2>            DESPERATELY trying to get a slideshow created on Movie Maker as a MP4 to play in a DVD player</h2>
                    <p>I have created a slideshow of old photos, with a soundtrack and text effects for my Dad who has Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is currently saved as MP4. I have saved this project in the following formats;</p>
<p>.WDC</p>
<p>mpg</p>
<p>MP4</p>
<p>.WMV</p>
<p>and every time I insert the DVD into the DVD Player, I get the message "no supported files found".</p>
<p>
</p><p>One disc DOES play (saved as a .VOB file) but I used a trial version from Wondershare to create the DVD but it has "Wondershare DVD Creator" all over the "movie" and the soundtrack is very jumpy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not really want to download any programs as I would not have a clue as to which programs would be safe or work properly and I probably would not make another "movie" again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone tell me what format I need to convert it to so that I can play it on my (and my Dad's) DVD Player?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have succeeded to do it in the past, (I made a wedding video from photos for a friend) but for the life of me, I cannot remember how I did it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be eternally grateful for any help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I used Windows Movie Maker to create the slideshow</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just used iDealshare VideoGo 6 (unregistered) and converted the MP4 to "DVD Video (*vob) "</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I burn the "DVD Video (*vob) " to a DVD disc, would it play in a DVD Player?</p>
<p>
</p><p>**EDIT** I have just played the slideshow and it has only copied 5 minutes of it. It has not copied the whole slideshow. The MP4 version is 11 minutes long.</p>

<p>I have attempted to download from that link. However, there is an error ("failed - download error") when it is downloading and a McAfee pop up says "McAfee automatically quarantined an infected file on your device"</p>
<p>I have downloaded "DVD Flick" but have not successfully managed to get it to work yet :/</p>
<p>

            <p>Don't give up hope just yet. I use a freeware program called WinX DVD Author that's very safe to use. It burns several formats to DVD that will play on your DVD Player and any DVD player that you have on your PC or laptop. You can create menus and subtitles.
 You can also add music and pictures as backgrounds.</p>

<p>I will keep looking for Winx DVD Author on Google and see if I can download it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a great MP4 which I created on Windows Movie Maker. It has music, subtitles and loads of photos for my Dad but I am unable to convert the MP4 to DVD format. I can watch it on my laptop, but I need to be able to convert it so it can be played on a
 DVD player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Windows Movie Maker before I had Windows 10 and I was able to convert to DVD format so easily and quickly. This and a few other things I used to be able to do, I cannot do on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave and Ang, thank you both. I shall continue to persevere, for a little while longer at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**** EDIT ****</p>
<p>I have successfully downloaded Winx DVD Author and converted the MP4 to .vob</p>
<p>I have burned it to a disc and it plays instantly on my laptop but when I insert the disc into the DVD Player "no supported files found" appears on the tv screen.</p>
<p>The "movie" appears on the disc as "OutputVOB_1.vob</p>

            There are games that can be admitted in the back others no, it always depends on the developer and the success of the game in question.

            The more games they can bring, the better. However with Xbox Original titles, they are trickier as they are so old and getting licences to bring them across are much harder.

<p>Yep, my friends and I had the same thing happen to us. We had played the Ammunition mission and all got killed, so we quit and called it a day. Next time I logged in I had the achievement pop up. I checked with my friends and they had the exact same thing
 happen. Odd, but welcome.</p>
<p>I've had a similar thing happen with Left 4 Dead. I got the '20 car pile up' achievement upon loading the game up, but I hadn't even been trying for that achievement. It's a bonus, but I'd rather get my achievements legit.</p>

    <title>Remove border&#47;white space from photos in gallery viewer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remove border&#47;white space from photos in gallery viewer&#63;</h2>
                    Howdy, <br />
<br />
I'm using the Windows Live Photo Gallery to view photos; it's the default, and most of the time I'm looking at a single picture so it works fine. Sometimes I need other windows open, or multiple images, especially if I'm pulling data from a scanned form and
 inputting it into Excel or if I'm comparing several images to each other. Unfortunately, there's a minimum size that I am able to reduce the window to.
<a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8YjOwN0tllFUE5GZld5LWdpcVk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Here's a screenshot of what I'm talking about</a>. I can't make any of those windows any smaller, and there's a lot of wasted space on the left and right of those pictures (if they were wider, it'd be wasted space top/bottom). I can pull the window off the
 edge of the screen (the top left image) or push the bottom off (lower left), or I can zoom in on the picture (lower right), but I can't get around this minimum size. I just want to be able to shrink the windows down smaller (these images themselves have white
 space I could crop off in addition to the extra space imposed by windows). Is there a setting I can alter or something to let me size those windows down, or at least get rid of the automatic extra filler space? I could use another picture viewer, but this
 one does most of what I need it to, and it wasn't a problem before I was using the version of the photo viewer that came with Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            <p>Maybe I'm just operating in ignorance yet, as I have recently upgraded from my old HP XP laptop to my new 2n1 HP... 8.1...but a great big "duh where's the menu"? I can't make a menu a appear in my firefox developers edition... hadn't noticed that I didn't
 have tools, view, etc across the top...to busy with all the other "new" goodies I have to play with...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate this answer... so I can ... try going to Tools - Options - 3D View and, on the upper right menu, tick "OpenGL" instead of "DirectX" .... to make Google Earth work..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!</p>

    <title>MDAC and Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rich pasco  say:</h3>
<h2>            MDAC and Windows 7</h2>
                    A setup program which worked under Windows XP is giving me this error under Windows 7 (64 bit):&nbsp; "This program requires MDAC 2.5 or greater to install.&nbsp; MDAC 2.6 is required for SQL 2000 compatibility.... Please re-run setup when a newer version of MDAC
 has been installed."<br />
<br />
I understand that a Windows 7 includes the newest MDAC, and so I should not install it separately.&nbsp; So then, how do I get past the above error?<br />
<br />
FYI, the program is Service Pack 5 for MS Visual Studio 6.0.&nbsp; Please don't tell me it's obsolete: I know that already.&nbsp; All that I want to do is keep working with what I had before my Windows XP machine died and was replaced with a new Windows 7 system.<br />

If you are trying to install SP5 you will run into a MDAC compatibility check that you cannot get past through the installer. I saw this post from guideX at&nbsp;<a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/windowsgeneraldevelopmentissues/thread/cd740951-dd2c-46eb-856f-6e653a2e3d07/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/windowsgeneraldevelopmentissues/thread/cd740951-dd2c-46eb-856f-6e653a2e3d07/</a>,
 but wanted to save it here for future&nbsp;reference&nbsp;as well.
<div>
<br />
<div>
Here are the steps that I followed to get SP5 installed:</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
<div>
Tutorial: How to install Visual Studio 6 With Service Pack 5 on Windows 7 and avoid MDAC 2.5 compatibility check.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
1. Visual Studio 6.0</div>
<div>
2. Service Pack 5</div>
<div>
- Before running Service pack 5 setup, you must make modifications to the file 'sp598ent.stf' here's how to do that (note some of the spaces have been truncated, try to not remove the extra space in the stf file when modifying it. If you do, this will not work
 at all, and you'll get a "Setup Damaged" error)...</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Step 1) Copy all of the Service Pack 5 files to a temporary directory, say - C:\ServicePack5Dir\</div>
<div>
Step 2) Open C:\ServicePack5Dir\sp598ent.stf with 'Notepad.exe'</div>
<div>
Step 3) Replace the following line</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 13 Group 28 36 38 29 30 32 26 27 14 25 16 17 20 18 19 15 39 21 22 24 23 43</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -with-</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 13 Group 28 38 29 30 32 26 27 14 25 16 17 20 18 19 15 39 21 22 24 23 43&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Step 4) Delete the following lines leaving only a carriage return where it was</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 36 Depend "27 ? : 37"&nbsp;</div>
<div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 37 IsWin95 CustomAction "sp598ent.dll,CheckForMDAC"&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Step 5) Save and close C:\ServicePack5Dir\sp598ent.stf</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Step 6) Run 'setupsp5.exe' as an administrator.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
- Service Pack 5 Setup should work fine now.</div>

            Here's what I did:&nbsp; I installed MS Visual Studio 6 on an XP machine, and installed its Service Pack 5 update there.&nbsp; Then I manually copied the new compiler file cl.exe from that machine to overwrite the one on my Windows 7 machine.&nbsp; That seemed to accomplish
 the update, getting around the MDAC complaint.
