<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In the picture location drop-down menu under desktop backgrounds it's showing unused folders that don't exist and otherwise folders that I don't want. Is there a way to reset the history of this list?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are willing to remove the history of desktop background from the Picture location list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows Vista and later, you can change the Desktop Wallpaper by right-clicking on Desktop and selecting "<strong>Personalize</strong>" option and then click on "<strong>Desktop Background</strong>" option and there you can apply your desired wallpaper
 by selecting the image using "Browse" button or by selecting an image from the given list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But whenever you browse a folder for selecting your desired wallpaper, its path is stored in "Location" drop-down box and everyone can see and use that path as shown in following screenshot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d86a7be4-b9a1-4239-84b7-2b79d49c0cad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d86a7be4-b9a1-4239-84b7-2b79d49c0cad" /></a></p>
&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>If you want to clear the entire location history or want to remove any particular folder path from the list, you can follow these steps and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R.</strong></li><li>Type <strong>regedit </strong>in the <strong>run box.</strong></li><li>In the left pane navigate to :&nbsp;<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Wallpapers\Images</strong></li><li>In right-side pane, you'll see all directory paths listed. Simply select the desired key associated with the path which you want to remove and delete it.</li><li>That's it. It'll immediately remove that folder from the history list. Now you can check the Desktop Background list and your deleted path will not be present there.</li></ol>
<p>

    <title>Booting your computer from Iso image file. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Booting your computer from Iso image file.</h2>
                    <p>So someone please give me some advice and Info. So I am in a Windows Administrator course at my college and I had come across a subject I am unfortunately new to. Its all about ISO image files. My class mates tell me it is the best way to wipe your computer
 clean and boot up from scratch, Like going from Windows 7 | Reboot |&nbsp;ISO | installing Windows 8.1. So the questions I have are, 1. How and where do you make one? 2. Can you tell me a little bit more about ISO in the simplest form? and 3. Is there anything
 else I missed that I should know before messing with this dangerous sorcery? (I plan to do&nbsp;this when Windows 10 comes out,&nbsp;also if&nbsp;you want to advise me on the best way to do this then please do so!)&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft Community. As I understand, you need assistance to create an ISO image of Windows 8/8.1<strong>.
</strong><span>Let me assist you with your concern.<strong> </strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>For Query 1: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>Here’s an article which explains about creating media or ISO image of Windows 8/8.1:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Create installation media for Windows&nbsp;8.1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Burn a CD or DVD from an ISO file</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Burn-a-CD-or-DVD-from-an-ISO-file" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Burn-a-CD-or-DVD-from-an-ISO-file</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>For Query 2: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>An ISO image or .iso file is a container format that holds the file system used on optical disks (CDs or DVDs) to store programs, movies and other multimedia content. ISO is a formatting standard set by the International Standards Organization. The
 ISO format is not used with audio CDs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>ISO images will be familiar to anyone who has made copies of software CDs or DVDs. DVD burning software is used to extract the contents of a CD or DVD, creating a single .iso file. This file can be burned to a new disc, or it can be stored and used
 directly from the hard drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It can be very convenient to store an operating system (OS) CD on a computer as an ISO image. If you need to make changes to the OS, such as install additional features or repair the system, you won’t have to hunt down the original CD. When the operating
 system asks for the CD, direct it instead to the archived ISO image. A hard drive works much faster than a CD/DVD ROM, taking a fraction of the time to find and install the files required. This also means the original CD can be stowed safely away where it’s
 less likely to become lost or damaged.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>For Query 3</strong>: I highly recommend <strong><em>backing up all of your important files and folders onto an external storage device</em></strong> before attempting any type of OS repair or upgrade.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Make sure you read the articles provided by Microsoft before installing new operating system. It will help you to know about minimum system requirements to run the Windows smoothly.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may refer this Microsoft article for example;</span></p>

    <title>Screen Share Audio Sync Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curebeat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Share Audio Sync Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi there.&nbsp; I've posted about this here before, but I do a lot of business over skype. An important part of that revolves around screen sharing and being able to hear the audio from the other parties PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had no problem up until recently, but as of recently there is often syncing issues with the Audio/Screen Share. I will be able to hear a video or presentation they are showing me with no problem, but the video itself will be a few seconds behind.
 This has only cropped up over the past few months and it's very frustrating. I have tried some fixes for this but nothing will work. Sometimes it will work fine, others it won't. It is extremely important for me that this gets fixed, not just for the business
 side (I've almost lost deals over this due to not being able to properly experience the presentation) but also for recreational activity - as I travel a lot, this is how I spend a lot of time with my wife.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, please and thank you.</p>

            News:<br />
Now i've finally Windows 10 and it works very well!<br />
How I did this?<br />
Simply download the installer from this link, choosing the version 32 or 64 bits and following the instructions:<br />
https://www.microsoft.com/it-it/software-download/windows10<br />
<br />
This seems to me the easiest way to install Windows 10, without going crazy with windows update and its many errors!

<p>Sorry to hear about your issues.&nbsp; You may want to try the below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following solutions if none of your discs will play, or if you insert a disc and your console doesn't recognize it. If your Xbox Home screen tells you to insert a disc when a disc is already inserted, that means it doesn't
 recognize your disc. In these scenarios, there are two possible issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The settings for Instant-On power mode can render a small number of consoles unable to read discs.
</li><li>The console's disc drive needs servicing. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Solution 1: If you use Instant-On power mode, change power modes and power cycle the console</strong></p>
<p>Here's how: </p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button <span>
</span>&nbsp;to open the guide. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Power</strong>
<strong>&amp; startup</strong> &gt; <strong>Power mode</strong><strong> &amp; startup</strong>
</li><li>Select <strong>Power mode</strong>, and then select <strong>Energy saving</strong>.
</li><li>Perform a "hard power cycle" by holding down the <strong>Xbox</strong> button
&nbsp;on the console for 10 seconds. Once the console has completely shut down, press the
<strong>Xbox</strong> button <span>
</span>&nbsp;on the console again to restart it. </li><li>Try your disc again. Wait a few seconds to see if the console recognizes it. If the console can now read the disc, you can revert back to Instant-On power mode.
</li></ol>
<p>Follow the above steps if the problem happens again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this works.</p>

if it is with any disc and the problem persists, I would contact Xbox support instead of you. It may be that your drive is broken.</p>

<p>Hi there Burns,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying to keep us updated on the issue. I noticed that you stated that you stated you get the message asking if you owned the game/held the license was only happening with some games that you are trying to put in, but not all. Are these Xbox
 One games or Xbox 360 games, or both?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the off chance that the ones that are affected are 360 games, you may wish to try re-downloading your profile in the 360 emulator portion of the Xbox One to see if it refreshes the licenses. You can access that area by launching any 360 game (in this
 case, you may wish to do so with a digitally downloaded one), and when the 360 logo appears, press the View &amp; Menu buttons on the controller (2 small buttons in the center) for a few seconds. This should prompt the 360 Guide to appear. Once it does,
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-profile-xbox-360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
remove your profile, then re-download it to the console</a>, then attempt to launch your disc game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results and we are awaiting your reply. I hope this helps a bit more.</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear that the issue is persisting after trying the steps listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that a factory reset was mentioned earlier and I suggest at this point to go ahead and give a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soft factory reset</a> a try. This will give you the benefits of restoring the operating system to factory defaults while keeping your games and apps intact. Make sure you select keep my games and apps and also have your Xbox account login information available
 since you will need to re-add any profile's you had before the reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give that a try and let us know how it goes!</p>

<p>There was no prompt to ask if I wanted to save my personal files, which I believe is considered a bug.</p>
<p>Also, Windows.Old folder has a standard folders structure but, it does not contain any personal&nbsp; files. This is another bug/ misinformation that the files are copied under Windows.Old folder.</p>
<p>The strangeness of the problem is, the missing files are the more recent files. Some of the content in the same folders are saved/transferred to W10.</p>
<p>I have large number of files that need to be recovered. Please advise any methods that will help.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Microsoft People ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its been more than a week but this issue had not been resolved yet. Please understand that the data lost is very important and needs to be recovered asap. Although there are many softwares&nbsp; available to do this task but they can't recover the exact folder
 structure. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Everyday whenever I use Windows 10 ,&nbsp;I get frustrated&nbsp;just because I had my precious data lost after installing it.</p>

            <p>Hello Microsoft people - </p>
<p>I still have not been able to recover my lost data. Is there a bug limiting the size of the data that can be migrated to windows 10?</p>
<p>Looks like at least a couple of people on this threat have that magic number of 184gb as the current free size...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond quickly with some solutions to lost data and empty Windows.Old file problem. It is frustrating to deal with unknown amount of lost data.</p>

<h2>            Dragon Elder Scroll Missing Please Help &#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I started the dawnguard add on and have made it to the point where i found the female vampires mother and she gave me the Blood Elder Scroll. Now it says that i need the Dragon Elder Scroll and i know i got it in the main quest but its not in my inventory.
 I went to the academy to see if by chance i had sold it to the arcaneum keeper there but he doesnt have it either. Hes not offering me a quest to get it or a buy7 back option. What the heck do i do ?!?!?</p>

<p>There is no way you can sell, drop, or even store an Elder Scroll (I think) so it looks like the game has bugged, have you got a save prior to you recieving the Dragon Scroll?</p>

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t buy &#38;amp&#59; download Xbox 360 games to play on my Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>I have added money (via pre-paid Xbox gift cards) to my account, and for some reason, I am not able to buy backwards compatible Xbox 360 games for my Xbox One.</p>
<p>I tried first with Red Dead Redemption. It didn't work. I forget the exact message it gave me, but something along the lines of having to add an alternate payment source (even though I had plenty of pre-paid credits on my account).</p>
<p>I just tried to buy Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and was not able to complete the purchase. The message it gave me was: "The item you are buying is subject to usage restrictions. You can use this item on the first Xbox 360 console that you download
 it with. Access to this item will also be granted to all users on this first console. If you transfer the item using a memory unit or other storage device, you will also be able to use it on other Xbox 360 consoles, but you'll need to sign in to Xbox Live
 with your Xbox Live account on that console before accessing the item."</p>
<p><br />
Does this mean I have to hook my Xbox 360 back up, download the game to that console, then hook up my Xbox One and download the game again? There's got to be a better way. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Well yes</p>
<p>For the first error in order to make 360 purchases on xbox one you need to have the payment option on file and yes it will charge you for it</p>
<p>For the 2nd one you have a child account youcan onlyake the purchase on an xbox ,360 which also solves the first problems tok</p>

<p>For Web and xbox one purchases youust have a credit card on file or use a 360 console</p>
<p>Same with parental settings errors</p>
<p>Xbox one parental settings don't apply to 360 or Indie games</p>

<p>Gotcha. Thanks.</p>
<p>So, the best workaround is like I said - buy the game on my Xbox 360, then download it with my Xbox One?</p>
<p>Kind of a pain, but whatever. If it works, it works.</p>

<p>FYI, you can also go to the Xbox backwards compatibility site from your Xbox one, Free Games with gold section; it will launch the internet and you can sign in and buy the games and it will go to your ready to install section; or you can do it from a computer.
 this is how I buy them currently.</p>

                    When system sleeps/hibernates it won't wake up as usual with mouse or keyboard.&nbsp; If screen is blank for only a few minutes it will revive, but after that you must hold down the power button til it shuts down and the restart.&nbsp; However, its not like a cold
 start.&nbsp; You see the bios info, but then the screen comes up like you would if it had just been sleeping.

    <title>Xbox one controller not connected&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raistlen4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one controller not connected&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I recently got an xbox one x and a windows 10 laptop, and have been streaming myvgame with the laptop. When I start the stream however I get a notification stating there is no controller connected to either my xbox, nor my laptop yet my controller
 still works. Now the problem is that when I join a party I can neither hear nor say a sound, until I turn my tv on, my streamigs off, and turn the streaming on once again. It happens when I start the streaming as well as when I go idle for too long and the
 controller automatically shuts off. I cant even see my battery life because it acts as if, as I've said, there is no controller connected? Please help, I have no idea what to do here.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think your laptop is connected on the wifi… and maybe your Xbox too.</p>
<p>To get 100% working streamer use ONLY ethernet cable for both.</p>
<p>Please read this &gt;&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/how-to-use-game-streaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/how-to-use-game-streaming</a></p>
<p>About your controller not connected ,use a usb cable to connect it on your laptop, and follow this to setup the controller correctly with the lastest update on the Windows 10 laptop &gt;&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-windows/accessories/how-to-update-xbox-one-controller-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-windows/accessories/how-to-update-xbox-one-controller-windows-10</a></p>

    <title>Get a still image and audio while playing a movie in Windows Media - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Get a still image and audio while playing a movie in Windows Media Player, also get the message &#58; &#34;network is too busy to play file at its original quality&#34;</h2>
                    <p><em>Original Title : Windows Media Player</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go to play a movie using windows media player all i get is a still imagwe along with audio and this message "network is too busy to play file at its original quality". Also all my other media playing programs play the video but are rather 'laggy'.
 I think the problem is that i have previously used a program to download torrents called "BitTorent" and maybe this has used up all my bandwidth or processing speed? Not really sure but really would like it if i could again use WMP and so I am looking for
 a resolution to my problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
