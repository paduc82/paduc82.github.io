<p>
</p><p>Hello Sharief,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link that you provided (<strong>Shinmila H on May 13, 2010</strong>) does not address the problem that many of us are facing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need a method to download <span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MS&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;enumerator driver and
<strong>NOT</strong> the manufacturer specific driver. The&nbsp;reason being is that the manufacturer driver often times requires&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>MS&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;enumerator driver to be installed&nbsp;as a&nbsp;prerequisite&nbsp;for its installation. So, can you
 please help me find away to install&nbsp;</span></span>Windows 7 Bluetooth Bus Enumerator and Bluetooth Stack driver?</p>

                    Some of my photo folders and photos contained therein aren't showing in photo app on Windows 8.1. All folders show correctly on OneDrive and are all included in the picture library. Anyone any idea what might be wrong? I have already run the app troubleshooter.

<p>
</p><p>The picture folders are all located in the OneDrive folder on my SD drive. They all show in my picture library and on my OneDrive. However, about half do not show on my pictures app; the remainder do appear there. I have checked supported locations, as you
 suggest, and all the pictures are included in the library. I ran the troubleshooter but that revealed no indexing problems. I think it is a problem with the picture app but it seems it can't be uninstalled and reinstalled. I can live with the problem as I
 can get at my photos through OneDrive but it is somewhat annoying.</p>

            I have solved this. I went into 'properties' of my OneDrive folder and changed the location to read 'OneDrive' instead of 'SkyDrive' and all my files were copied to the new folder. The pictures app now shows all my picture folders. For the record....

            I spoke too soon. My solution only lasted one day and all my pictures have again disappeared from the photos app. They are all still showing in the library and on OneDrive, so I guess I'll just live without the photo app until a working version is released
 in the Store....

<p><span>Hello rullion27,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum. You can try to run the Windows update Readiness tool since the updates fail
 to install. This tool is offered automatically through Windows Update to computers that have a condition that the tool could resolve. You can try to run the Windows update Readiness tool since the updates fail to install. This tool is offered automatically

<p><span>Here is a link to that has information about the readiness tool:
</span></p>
<p><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821</span></p>
<p><span>If this does not work, try to reset the policy for Windows update from the registry.
</span></p>
<p><span>Important: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious
 problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information
 about how to back up annd restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
</span></p>
<p><span>322756 (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/ ) How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start, type services.msc in the Start Search box, and click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Double-click "Windows Update" in the list and stop the service.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Minimize this window.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click Start, type regedit in the Start Search box, and click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Backup the registry and then delete the following registry key:</span></p>
<p><span>HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate</span></p>
<p><span>6. Go back to the services and start the Windows Update service.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Try to do the updates now.</span></p>
<p><span>Regarding the Java updates repeatedly asking to install, you can verify what updates are installed on the computer
 from the Java website. Here is a link to the download and install the updates:</span></p>
<p><span>http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp</span></p>
<p><span>You can also try to delete (Uninstall) the previous version of Java updates installed and then try to download
 them from the above website.</span></p>
<p><span>I see that you are also having trouble in connecting to Internet. We would need more information on how you are
 trying to connect and what is the exact error message that you get when you try to connect.</span></p>
<p><span>How long they have you been getting this error?</span></p>
<p><span>Have you made any changes to the operating system prior to getting this error?</span></p>
<p><span>Any new hardware/software installed?
</span></p>
<p><span>I hope that this information helps.</span></p>

<p>This is probably because you installed an AV or security&nbsp;program that automatically deactivates Defender.&nbsp; What are you using now and what others have you tried in the past since you noticed this?&nbsp; Did you change it recently from something else?&nbsp; The AV
 or seccurity program typically does this through group policy (I'm not quite sure exactly how).&nbsp; If this is the case, the deactivation is intentional and not a problem - if the programs run at the same time they may cause conflicts, freezes, crashes, and all
 sorts of other problems.&nbsp; I know Microsoft Security Essentials does this and I know&nbsp;there are others that do so also (though I don't have a list of which ones they are).</p>
<p>I hope&nbsp; this helps.</p>
<p>Thanks and good luck!</p>

            <p>Sorry mate, it is a "feature" have you also noticed that it only runs in one of the cores? And no it is not a "build-pre-GA" issue it is a feature in all the GA builds too...</p>
<p>I am up to 10,000 threads and creeping up for the "feature" that is slowly killing a server class machine...</p>
<p>After spending hours on the phone with MSFT I got nowhere. **** according to&nbsp;my escalation "manager" I was with tier 3 and then&nbsp;CPR but did not know how do&nbsp;a live kernel &nbsp;debug.</p>
<p>I must be getting old because there use to be pretty smart people once you passed the tech support BS...I wish I had better news.</p>

<h2>            Skype for business I can see sent attachments but cannot open&#47;download - group conversation</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with sfb. When only 2 people are talking then there is no problem, I can send pictures with copy/paste or snniping tool and paste.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When there are more than 2 people and I am sending attachment then I can see that it is sent (special windows shows me that) but when me or anyone else is clicking open/save as then it is not opening/saving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is not only issue with my computer, we have been checking it on many other sfb accounts/computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people have off h&amp;b and sfb basic and others including me off365 E3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone can help?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>permissions are ok, tracing folder/sip profile in my opinion is not related with this issue - all users have this problem.</p>
<p>Just it case I've deleted it - no diffrence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your confirmation. I tried many times on my side to reproduce the issue, but all failed. May I know if any anti-virus has been deployed in your organization. In the meantime, I'd also like to know if the issue persists if you sign into Skype for
 Business with another account.&nbsp; By doing so, it helps confirm if it is related to the Skype for Business desktop client.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 2017 core 15 charging issue &#47; vibrating</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Pro 2017 Core i5 has did electric Arthur interesting work when attempting to charge from the Microsoft Surface dock. In a nutshell, if the device has fully discharged its battery then it will not charge from the surface dock; the LED on the connector
 flashes slowly, but the Surfsce remains cold and unresponsive. Mmmnm&nbsp; I have to use the portable power brick that came with the device comma even if just for a second, to enable it to resume charging from the dock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus far, I have:</p>
<p>1) Used two different docks (both of the newer black-brick variety), which have been updated with the latest firmware using the Surface Dock updater tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Downloaded and installed all relevant MS Windows and Surface firmware updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the problem persists. This is frustrating because&nbsp; I have to continually carry the portable charger back and forth between home and office just in case the battery gives up the ghost, and needs that instant hit of portable power to bring it back
 to life, before either of the two really quite expensive docks is able to fulfill their core function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a separate though possibly connected point, my SP2017 at times can be felt, and even heard close to, vibrating - almost as if fans were running (it tends to happen if the machine is warm, though as a rule I dont run particularly cpu intensive tasks for
 long stretches. No video editor or gamer I. I enjoy using the inking fearutes, and often sling the display out to a oair of monitors in extended setup, but that's as challenging as it gets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You never should have been sold the copy of Windows since it was an MSDN licensed version. The person that sold it to you knew what he was doing and sold your license key multiple times to make himself a lot of money before the activation key was blocked.</p>

            <p>Your diagnostic reports that the: "Windows Product ID: 00426-<strong>068</strong>-2769461-86706"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The portion you are interested is the three digit section of the product ID number, if it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have an MSDN or TechNet product key." These keys are not to be sold for retail use.</p>
<p><br />
065, 066, 067, <strong>068</strong>, 069 for Ultimate,&nbsp; 220 area for Professional and 230, 231, 232 area for Home Premium,
</p>
<p><br />
There are probably others but they should be close to those listed above.<br />
</p>
<p>Note: This has been an ongoing problem ever since Windows 7 was released. Althought sold illegally MSDN/TechNet product keys allow for more than one activation<br />
(typically 5 or 10), Therefore these keys can sold "multiple times" before activation may fail.</p>

            <p>Registry cleaners will not improve performance, double the speed of a computer or any other spurious clams made.</p>
<p>Back in the days of Windows 9x, it was important to control the size of the registry, and for this purpose, Microsoft released their very own registry cleaner which only removed entries which were absolutely
 safe to remove.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUT, that was back in the days of Windows 9x. Windows NT and all of the operating systems spawned from NT do not handle the registry in the same way as Windows 9x did. Windows NT and higher have a much
 larger limit to the size and they ignore orphaned entries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows 7 registry can grow to 2gb before the OS falls over, and even a well used system is unlikely to have a registry over 250mb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Richard has already stated, defragmenters have their own pet algorythms, and the work done by one is subsequently undone by another. The Windows defragmenter is as good as any even if you can't see
 it at work.. .</p>

</p><p>Hi there, I got a problem and here is how it started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plugged in my Kingston Usb Drive&nbsp;3.0 in my laptop and during this I was installing a software which required restart and after restarting my laptop with my USB Drive plugged in, I was not able to open my Pen drive.</p>
<p>I tried the following to recover it.</p>
<p>Normal format.....FAILED</p>
<p>Diskpart...... FAILED (data error (cyclic redundancy check)</p>
<p>Check Disk....FAILED</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Disk Management Doesn't give me any option other than Properties and Help.</p>
<p>In the Disk Management it appears as Readonly&nbsp;and in volume details as MBR.</p>
<p>
</p><div>Please help me recovering my Flash Drive. I'm not worried about the data loss. All I need is to get my flash drive back to working condition.</div>
<p />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were you installing something onto the Flash Drive, or did it just happen to be there ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be right clicking on the wrong place... Try right clicking on the far left where is says REMOVABLE (D:)... You may get more options...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing you can do is to download a bootable ISO Image of Partition Wizard, and try reformatting the drive while booted to the CD... It can be put on a PenDrive as well if needed.&nbsp;

Because I have several applications, for example, my backup program needs a mapi client to sen me the email, I need mapi to send files from within any of the MS Office programs. True, I can create the document, then go to all the trouble to open a browser login
 to a webmail services then find the file I want to send.</p>
<p>I have tried making Windows Live Mail my default email service but MS Office programs won't recognize it. Can you tell me how to make it work?</p>

Again: Windows Live Mail is a mail <em>client, </em>not a mail <em>service</em>. Mail service is what you get from an Email Service Provider, like Hotmail or your ISP.</p>
<p>Different programs look in different places to find out which mail client to use. Your backup program is clearly looking in the wrong place, but you may be able to help it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type <strong>regedit</strong> into the start search box and press <em>Enter</em>. Give permission where necessary.
</li><li>In the left-hand pane, locate the key called<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\Mail<br />
and click on <em>Mail</em>. </li><li>In the right-hand pane, double-click on&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(Default)</strong>. In the dialogue that opens, clear whatever is there, type&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>Windows Live Mail</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; and click OK. </li><li>In the left-hand pane, click on the sub-key called Windows Live Mail<br />
(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\Mail\Windows Live Mail) </li><li>In the right-hand pane. look for <strong>DLLPath</strong> in the <em>Name</em> column.<br />
If it's not there,
<ol>
<li>right-click on an empty part of the right-hand pane and select <em>New &gt; String value</em>
</li><li>Type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>DLLPath&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;to name the new value and press <em>Enter</em>
</li><li>Double-click on <em>DLLPath</em> and in the box that opens, carefully type<br />
<strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Live\Mail\smapi.dll</strong><br />
if yours is a 64-bit computer, or <br />
<strong>C:\Program Files\Windows Live\Mail\smapi.dll</strong><br />
if it's 32-bit.<br />
Click <em>OK</em></li><li>If it is there, skip 5.a and 5.b and proceed from 5.c<br />
</li></ol>
</li><li>Close Registry Editor, reboot your computer and test the functions you were lacking.</li></ol>

Believe it or not I DO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN EMAIL PROVIDER AND AN EMAIL CLIENT. You knew what I was trying to say no need for the attitude. Checked registry and everything you listed is already there.

            I agree with gegjr that with all those settings already existing in the registry, Windows Live Mail still does not work as a MAPI
<i>client</i>.<br />
<br />
It seems to be at least mainly an internal Microsoft software/OS issue, because Microsoft Office programs cannot utilize WLM to send files. For example, on MS Word, the options to "File &gt; Send To &gt; Mail Recipient (as Attachment)" and "File &gt; Send To &gt; Mail
 Recipient (for Review)" are grayed out.<br />
<br />
Other programs such as Adobe Reader X have no problem sending a document via WLM e-mail.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, after installing Adobe Acrobat Pro XII, in MS Word the option "File &gt; Send To &gt; Mail Recipient as Adobe PDF" now exists and it works just fine.<br />
<br />
So, to recap, it is Microsoft's own programs that will not utilize WLM as a MAPI <i>
client</i>.<br />
<br />
This seems ridiculous. We still need a solution.<br />

I have just checked on my own W7 Pro 64-bit machine. <em>Send to &gt; Mail recipient
</em>succeeded from both Word 2003 and Word 2013.<br />
<br />
Check your default programs again. If your version of Office includes Outlook, it may have tried to set Outlook as the default mail client even though it's not been initialized.<br />
<br />
This is not the same problem as the one gegjr is facing.</p>

<p><br />
I don't understand where your browser or webmail comes into it. You can attach a document to a mail message from within Windows Live Mail without going near webmail. Otherwise, see my reply to ProblemsToSolve a few moments ago.<br />
<br />
As regards your backup program, please ask the&nbsp;producer how the program determines which mail client to use. Some applications&nbsp;include pre-determined lists of clients that can be used, and if Windows Live Mail is not on that list, then the sendmail function
 won't work.</p>

            Thank you. This basic functionality should definitely be included. Especially since we were essentially "forced" to switch from OE to WLM. (Oh, I know all you good commenters, there are other choices...)<br />

<h2>            How to set up a peer to peer ethernet network with another PC&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Windows 10 PC and a Windows 10 laptop and I want to connect them with an ethernet cable. I have tried it but I guess I didn't configure it properly, because it wouldn't work.

<br />
<br />A standard Ethernet cable cannot be used to connect those two devices, you need a crossover cable (CAT)

            After looking through countless sites for answers to this same question it looks like this is a quick key issue. I had to reactive camera by pressing the camera button on my keyboard. I know, I know, it seems logical, but I didn't even notice I had that
 option until now. It was the F8 key (camera with a slash through it) on my Lenovo Flex 4-1130 which brought the camera back up. After hitting it I pulled up the camera app on my PC and voila! No, I do not remember ever deactivating or blocking the camera so
 I think whatever update happened activated that key or whatever. We have three laptops two Lenovos and one HP they had the same issue, so not a coincidence of me going cray and deactivating my cameras on each laptop. So, anyone else with this issue may want
 to look around for a camera quick key for your particular computer. BTW my camera driver or any camera device was not located in device manager before this and now it is as plain as day. Also, I did try to download device drivers, troubles

            Hi SnehilRai
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Use Media Creation Tool to reset your computer. You will have to cut Media creation tool on another computer.
<br />
<br />Refer to the section"Use installation media to restore or reset your PC "

            Hi Snehil
<br />
<br />Stop that reset and try running it again, if it fails the second time around, your best option would be to backup your data and clean install Windows 10, which will also repair your Recovery Image in Windows 10 . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Based on this FAQ by a company providing Home Use Program rights to its employees, the answer would be no:<br />
<br />
<span><b>17. I use multiple computers at home. Can I buy copies of the same Microsoft offered HUP products for each home computer or can I install my one HUP software product on multiple home computers?</b>
<br />
<br />
No, only one copy of each product can be obtained per NMCI email address and you are restricted to only one home computer for hosting the obtained Microsoft product. However, although you cannot purchase more than one license, it does allow for two installations
 on one PC and one "portable device" (i.e., laptop). For portable devices, simply download the software (if you don't have media) from the HUP email you received from Microsoft. The email must be accessed via your "portable device." You also must use the same
 product key. <br />
<br />
<b>18. I have multiple seats at work (e.g., laptop and desktop), can I order more than one copy of each application for home use?</b>
<br />
<br />
No. Even though you may have more than one computer at work and multiple copies of the subject Microsoft applications, you still only have one NMCI email address. Therefore, you can only purchase one copy of each application for home use.

<p>Please visit the <a href="http://www.microsofthup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HUP Web site</a> to see current offers.</p>
<p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong><br />
Customers pay $9.95 for the license and download of each product available. Physical back-up media is available for an additional $12.00 (includes shipping/not available for Language Packs). Prices can change and do vary outside the U.S. See the
<a href="http://www.microsofthup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HUP Web site</a> for current offers.</p>
<p><strong>What do I need to do to offer HUP to my employees?</strong><br />
Offering the HUP to your employees is easy. First your organization’s Software Assurance Manager will need to log into Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC) and
<a href="http://marketing.microsofthup.com/HUP/Index.html?modalwindow=yes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
activate your Home Use Program benefits</a>. Once activated, your Software Assurance Manager will get a HUP program code that he or she can send to employees using the email templates, banner ads or other
<a href="http://www.microsofthup.com/marketing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">downloadable marketing resources from HUP</a>.</p>
<p>Employees getting this information will use their HUP program code and work email address to
<a href="http://www.microsofthup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">validate their eligibility</a>. Once accepted, they’ll get a confirmation email that allows them to make purchases directly through the HUP Online Store.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have any other responsibilities?</strong><br />
As the Volume Licensing customer you are not responsible for your individual employee’s compliance with the Home Use Program end user license terms. Those terms are between Microsoft and the individual employee. We do require that you limit Home Use Program
 access to employees and tell them when they should discontinue use of the Home Use Program software, for example if your Software Assurance coverage ends or the employee leaves employment.</p>

            You would need to read the EULA/SLT that came with the program, as each will have its own rules - in general the ONLY application that *may* allow more than a single install is Office, and the licensing on that depends on the particular edition in use.

            <p>Steven, since you have indicated that the installation disc you are using worked with Windows 7 before, there is a possibility that your installer and Windows 10 is incompatible with each other. Developers usually release an updated version of the installation
 disc for a newer Operating System. You can contact the program developer to check if the installer you have on your end would still work with Windows 10.</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might be occurring due to any system file corruption or any third party software conflict.<br />
Please provide us the below information.<br />
-1. Are you using Local account or Microsoft account?<br />
-2. Do you have another User Profile on your PC?<br />
-3. Which is the current Windows 10 build in your PC?<br />
-4. Did you make any changes to the computer, prior to the issue?</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Lets follow below methods and see if this helps.</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Step1 : Safe mode.</strong><br />
Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the steps in the below Microsoft help article on "How to Boot into Safe mode".<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Clean boot.</strong><br />
A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows.<br />
I would suggest you to refer the below Microsoft help article on How to Perform Clean boot.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Please reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot by referring above article.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
Keep us informed with the status of the issue.<br />

    <title>Finding Checksum Values in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wandering10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Finding Checksum Values in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I shared the following question several users have asked in other portions of Windows Support:&nbsp; In Windows 10, how does one calculate the checksum values of files? As most users know, matching the checksum value of a file on your computer against hash values
 specified by the source of the file, for example, is an important security feature to ensure the integrity of the files you use.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer to this question is simple enough, but I didn't find it in any Microsoft documentation or websites. Those explain options limited to prior versions of Windows and do not work for Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
Windows 10 does offer two straightforward ways to find the hash values of files, at least using Windows 10 Home x64 as I did. I don't know if they work on other versions, but I would expect they do. Microsoft just makes it difficult to discover the tools needed
 to perform this routine task.
</p><p>
</p><p>One method uses the command certutil in the command prompt window.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>certutil -hashfile c:\Users\JDoe\Desktop\abc.exe SHA512</p>
<p>
</p><p>This command returns the SHA512 hash of file abc.exe located at the specified file path. You may use other values after SHA, such as 1 or 256, to produce the corresponding hash, and you may substitute MD5 or other supported parameters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another method is to use Windows PowerShell (version 5.1 for me) with the command Get-FileHash:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get-FileHash -Path c:\Users\JDoe\Desktop\abc.exe -Algorithm SHA512</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like certutil after a command prompt, this command in PowerShell returns the SHA512 hash of file abc.exe at the location specified on the C: drive, and you may substitute other parameters to find their corresponding hash values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the same question posted elsewhere on these forums, few answers have been posted. They suggest limited solutions, some of which work for certain users and others that do not. Some reference an FCIV command, which apparently works automatically in
 prior versions of Windows. For Windows 10, at least one user sets forth somewhat elaborate steps for installation and use of FCIV in Windows 10, and that may work for some. You may find it in this thread:&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_update/is-there-built-in-checksum-for-win-10/8dba82be-f036-4460-b427-954e057b678a&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In any event, in Windows 10 as it is configured, neither the command prompt nor Windows PowerShell recognizes FCIV as a command. Presumably, Microsoft does not expect it to be used, probably because there are alternatives. Microsoft just makes it difficult
 for anyone to discover them, at least in the experience of some of us.
</p><p>
</p><p>Free third-party checksum programs are available for download and installation. I have not tried any of them. Because Windows 10 apparently has simple commands to check the values as explained above, I don't see any reason to use them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft also makes it difficult for users to post anything in its forums. For instance, I could not reply to any of the existing questions but am limited to discussing the topic in this "community" section. For users who, like me, had a hard time discovering
 this information, I hope this post turns up in search results and offers some help.

<p>A checksum is used to ensure that a file copied from location A to location B copied accurately. It relies on the mathematical certainty that two otherwise identical files that differ by as little as a single bit will hash to different checksums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, websites that offer large downloads will often publish the checksum of the file. After you download the file you can recompute the checksum and compare it to the original. If the two match - voila! - the file downloaded accurately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another practical application: Image backup applications typically create a checksum for each backup. Since images might be moved from one storage drive to another, and every transfer introduces the possibility, however small, that the image will be corrupted,
 before restoring a backup I can recompute ('verify') the checksum to ensure that the image is still intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft used to publish the checksums for Windows ISOs but lately they've stopped doing that. No reason given of which I'm aware - it's a big secret.</p>

<p>Hi BullgogXX, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for accurately clarifying the purpose and use of checksums. They're about ensuring the integrity of the contents of the file for security and practical purposes, and they're often used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Microsoft may not publish checksums for Windows files because it prefers the fsutil, which allegedly checks file integrity and restores accurate versions of corrupt files from the Windows cache. But we never really know why it does anything.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t turn on Windows Firewall in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> debra_g  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t turn on Windows Firewall in Windows 7</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently uninstalled McAfee and downloaded Microsoft Security Essentials to be my virus protection.<br />
<br />
Now, I cannot turn on my Windows Firewall.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
When I try to, I go to Control Panel&gt;Windows Firewall and I get an option to use "Recommended Settings" but when I click on that, I get Error Code 0x80070424. I used Help and it told me to run Fix It, which I did. Then I get a note from Fix It that "Windows
 Firewall cannot be set as the default firewall. This problem may be occurring because of an existing Group Policy or because you are using the McAfee Firewall program. If you want to use Windows Firewall, exit this troubleshooter, uninstall the other firewall
 program, and then run this troubleshooter again."<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I have already run the MCPR.exe uninstall program to completely uninstall McAfee.&nbsp; I have no idea what to try next. Thank you in advance for your suggestions.

<h2>            these constant updates</h2>
                    <p>I have supported Microsoft since the days Windows replaced DOS.&nbsp; I cannot take it anymore.&nbsp; MS has wonderful support people who really do try and help....most would be UN-employed if Windows and Windows 10 specifically were any good.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our son arrived from over-seas for a visit and I wanted to show him my Surface 3.&nbsp; Turned it on and of course .....&lt;Working on updates 6%&nbsp; Don't turn off your PC.&nbsp; This will take a while&gt;&nbsp; No hint of what is going on.... really?....no option...just Microsoft
 arrogance showcased.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So he pulled out his MacBook Air which had just traveled over 20 hours in the air, hit a key and we were working.&nbsp; I gave him my LAN PW and we were collecting his emails and everything I had wanted to show him.&nbsp; 40 minutes now and still 6%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did save my wife's HP Win 10 laptop a horrible death.&nbsp; She was going to run over it with her car since it was "update worthless" so often.&nbsp; I snatched it, bought Windows 8.1, out-waited the Win 10 updates, and gave Windows 10 the fate it deserved....gone.&nbsp;
 So far 8.1 has had tiny if any updates and she is happy.&nbsp; Still 6%.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two desktops at my desk so that one is not updating....I cannot believe I admitted that.&nbsp; Still 6%</p>
<p>
</p><p>I retired from HP where of course we are MS users, I just did not appreciate what our IT people did for the 120,000 employees until I am subject to what they helped me avoid.&nbsp; MS is a job creator in the wrong way.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I alone in thinking like this?&nbsp; Am I the only person switching to Mac from update fatigue and MS arrogance?&nbsp; Chime in</p>

</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you Greg for your response,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also thank you for helping to prove my point.&nbsp; First off I got my Surface 3 right when it came out on the trade-up program from the previous Surface.&nbsp; So this is not a new installation at all, certainly not early stages in any sense.&nbsp; I am not a true geek,
 just close....but I am much more literate in this field than a huge percentage of the buyers of a tablet/Surface.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How many of the buyers go out and find such a thing as a Windows 10 Performance and Install Checklist-Microsoft Community web site and then check to see (if they even know how to check) all Updates are expedited.&nbsp; No....an easy OS is supposed to be easy
 and not require the customer to do everything that Microsoft should have done before shipping me the Surface.&nbsp; I also shutdown every time I use my Surface.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the first time I have heard about your second para even though I have developed a relationship with your fine support team.&nbsp; So tomorrow if I have time I am going to follow your link for a clean install and see where it takes me.&nbsp; You just told me
 that my experience will be improved if I do that so I have nothing to lose.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps Microsoft thinks that now all the users are true geeks and want to play rather than do actual work.&nbsp; I have 5 other tablets I use in the house and combined with the five I perhaps spend 1% of the time I do with the Surface 3 in any kind of trouble
 related time spent.&nbsp; I gave up on the Surface 3 with the docking station made for it (will sell on Ebay) and connecting any external drives in any way and even connecting to a large screen to work with Excel much easier.&nbsp; Resolution supported is laughable.&nbsp;
 I am happy to report the Bend mouse works great!!!&nbsp; But of course I only bought it after the Wedge mouse was an absolute failure.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you see that I have been a loyal MS follower and user for a very long time and this is so disappointing to me.</p>
<p>Thanks for the response and everyone is welcome to chime in.</p>

<p>I would have agreed with you until late last week. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My 14 month old laptop with Win 10 pre-installed refused to update (stuck at 75%). I performed a fresh install two months ago and have never installed a third part AV on it. While I probably could have resolved it I installed Win 8.1 which is a beautiful,
 underrated, non-obtrusive, piece of software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me, Win 10 is a time bomb, eventually the Creator's Update, Fall Update or whatever is going to kill a system, it's just a matter of time. You cannot make changes (most useless or ignored) to an OS and expect it to remain stable, not to mention user fatigue
 with the exponential changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will maintain one system with Win 10 as a lab rat, I expect it to die in a future update, it will then become a Win 8.1 system too!</p>
