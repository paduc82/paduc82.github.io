    <title>unable to connect to WMI service - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            unable to connect to WMI service &#34;&#92;&#92;.&#92;root&#92;cimv2&#34;. I have windows xp 32. Why is microsoft repair service ignoring my plea&#63;</h2>
                    I have Windows xp 32. Except that microsoft doesn't seem to care enough to provide a cure for Unable to connect to WMI service "\\.\root\cimv2" At age 78, I have enough of my own problems and don't need more from microsoft software. How can this problem
 be fixed? I'm not a computer whiz; just an old man trying to keep in touch with the outside world.

<p>When do you see this message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like your Windows Managment Instrumentation information files are missing or corrupted, so replace them.</p>
<p>To resolve your issue, stop the Windows Management Instrumentation service, rename the suspicious or afflicted WMI folder,&nbsp;the restart your system. &nbsp;When the system restarts, the WMI service will start automatically and rebuild the WMI folder&nbsp;and it's contents
 automatically.</p>
<p>1. On the Desktop, right-click My Computer, and then click Manage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Under Services and Applications, click Services, locate the Windows Management Instrumentation service, right&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; click the WMI Service, select Properties and Stop the WMI Service.</p>
<p>Respond in the affirmative if asked to stop the Security Center and Windows Firewall Services.</p>
<p>(with those services stopped your system is vulnerable to attack from the Internet so do not get on the Internet&nbsp;again until you restart your system).</p>
<p>3. Navigate to the following folder (assuming your boot drive is C)</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\Wbem\</p>
<p>3. Rename the <strong>Repository</strong> folder to something you can remember, such as: &nbsp;<strong>Repository.old</strong></p>
<p>4. Restart the computer and check to be sure that the WMI service has been restarted and that a new Repository folder has&nbsp;been created to replace the one that was renamed.</p>
<p>On the next reboot, there may be some errors like this in the Event Viewer System log:</p>
<p>Event Type:<span> </span>Error</p>
<p>Event Source:<span> </span>WinMgmt</p>
<p>Event Category:<span> </span>None</p>
<p>Event ID:<span> </span>4</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>Failed to load MOF C:\WINDOWS\MICROSOFT.NET\FRAMEWORK\V4.0.30319\MOF\SERVICEMODEL.MOF while recovering repository file.</p>
<p>This is because the wmipvse.exe must rebuild these parts of the repository as well. It is a sequencing error as indicated&nbsp;below. You should not see these errors again after the system has been rebooted and catches up and has rebuilt the&nbsp;Repository.&nbsp; That
 rebuild of the Repository will happen automatically and may take a little while then you should not see those errors again.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help. After doing what you instructed, the"unable to connect with WMI...........etc" is gone from my network diagnosis.You obviously know your business and are a giving person. However, the diagnosis still says IE Web Proxy, Computer System,
 Operating System, Version, Modems, Network Adapters and Network Clients all have WMI Error and FAILED in red letters.<em>Additionally</em> , I have&nbsp; been getting a notice every time I open my computer that says: "WIRELESS CONFIGURATION..Notification DLL has
 not been registered, program will not work correctly." I keep losing my wireless connection. That is a new problem. I've even tried Mozilla and get the same problem. I'll get you enough votes for a stallion, not a pony, if you can help me fix the connections
 problem.</p>

<p>Good job.<br />
<br />
Where exactly are you seeing this "diagnosis" with Web Proxy, Computer System, Operating System, etc. and you still see the WMI error and FAILED in red letters?</p>
<p>Now it sounds like you have come wireless connectivity problem, so we need to know a little more about your system and how you connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.</p>
<p>Tell us about how you connect to the Internet...&nbsp; Are you connecting wirelessly through a wireless connection built into your computer or do you have some kind of external wireless device (like a Broadcom adapter), do you use a cable, etc.</p>
<p>It sounds like you may need to reinstall your network connectivity software and that makes me wonder if somehow an antivirus or other malicious software scan (what are you using) may have quarantined some suspicious file.&nbsp; Either way, it sounds like it is
 malfunctioning.&nbsp; Did you install your network software yourself and could you install it again if you needed to?</p>
<p>Who is your (ISP) Internet Service Provider?&nbsp; Comcast, At&amp;T, Roadrunner, etc.&nbsp; If you are having connectivity problems, sometimes they are helpful people to call since they have people that sit around and this is all they do all day long&nbsp; - help people get
 connected.&nbsp; They may recognize this problem instantly and know exactly what to do.&nbsp; They do this stuff all the time and that is all they do.&nbsp; Don't let them talk you into reinstalling your XP though.&nbsp; If one support person is not helpful, don't get discouraged.&nbsp;
 Call back and talk to a different person until you find the<em>right</em> person.</p>

<p>Thank you again for taking the time to help me.</p>
<p>1. The Diagnosis came from the <strong>Help and Suppor</strong> t section in My Computer.</p>
<p>2. My wireless connection is driving me crazy. It seems as if I am bumped off every other minute. I am connected to the internet as an add-on. I live with my daughter and she has a Cisco router on her<strong>Vista desktop</strong> . I have
<strong>xp32 on my laptop</strong> . Broadcom sets us up with<strong>Linksys</strong> . My daughter has no internet connection problems. I have a<strong>Gateway MX6214</strong> laptop. The wireless card is
<strong>factory loaded</strong> .</p>
<p>3. I am "protected" by Microsoft Essentials. All systems come up Green (OK). My ISP provider is Optimum Cablevision, the nice people who, with FOX, have blacked out the World Series here on TV.</p>
<p>4. Optimum says I should contact Cisco. Cisco says to contact Broadcom. Broadcom says to contact Gateway. All warranties have expired so I am being treated as an orphan.</p>
<p>5. I couldn't get MSINFO32 via RUN. It said it couldn't find the information. I found many MSINFO32 files using a deep SEARCH but I don't know which file to send to you. I would welcome you into my computer for a look-see, if you wish.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>

<p>I don't know my way around the Help and Support but I think I see where you are talking about now (Network Diagnostics?) but mine will not defy me.</p>
<p>Let's get msinfo32 working since they both get information from the WMI folder.&nbsp; There are a couple other things that might need to be done there.</p>
<p>When you says msinfo32 said it couldn't find the information, when you try to run it, what does the message say exactly?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the screen empty or just a white background where the information should be?</p>
<p>Be thinking about how you are going to talk to Optimum Cablevision to get them to help with your lack of connectivity to<strong>their</strong> Internet service...</p>

 2 times before without changing anything. And I have gone into blean boot and that has not worked. Also I have deleted Registry.blob and other certain files. So please if you can find a way to get rid of this error please let me know! Thankyou.

            &nbsp;I have seen both of your posts. The only way you can get this working is to contact the game manufacturer support.

    <title>Microsoft XPS Document Writer print driver trouble with some - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft XPS Document Writer print driver trouble with some applications</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my system to Windows 8 Pro (64bit), and am having trouble with the XPS Document Writer.<br />
<br />
When I try to print using the Microsoft XPS Document Writer from some apps (IE10,notepad,paint) everything works as expected: I enter a filename and it saves just fine.<br />
<br />
Other applications (Office 2010 apps(32bit), WordPad,etc ), including the XPS Driver's "Print Test Page" do not.&nbsp; They get as far as allowing me to type in a filename, but the file does not save.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The only thing that I have been able to deduce is: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) no programs that I know are 32bit are able to successfully use the print driver<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) programs that I know are 64bit can.<br />
<br />
I've looked in the event logs, but I don't see anything that looks related to printing services.<br />
<br />
Why is this a problem for me?&nbsp; I'm trying to use Microsoft OneNote 2010 (32bit), which I understand uses the XPS driver for "Send to OneNote" functionality.&nbsp; Any apps that can successfully use the XPS driver can "Send to OneNote" (again: IE10, etc).&nbsp; Anything
 that can't use the XPS driver fails with "an unknown error occurred during printing".<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />

Hi C. Reichelt:<br />
<br />
This too has been driving me nuts since upgrading to Win 8 64bit from Win 7 64bit.<br />
<br />
I tried reverting the XPS drivers to Windows 7 version to no avail. I am now using the v4 drivers that ship with Windows 8 and I have found two workarounds:<br />
<br />
Either launch the application as <b>Admin </b>or in <b>Compatibility Mode for Win XP SP3</b>. I can now print to the XPS printer or Send to OneNote 2010.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!<br />
<br />
Cheers.<br />

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have been caused by either software conflicts or a corrupted system file. For us to troubleshoot this issue, we suggest that you perform the following methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Check Application Shortcuts directory.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>File Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Navigate to the following path and locate the apps which causing you issues:<br />
<strong>C:\Users\&lt;Username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Application Shortcuts<br />
<em>Note: </em></strong><em>Replace &lt;Username&gt; with the name of your account.</em></li><li>In this folder, you will find all the apps you’ve installed on your system, each in a separate folder. Locate the folder of the app that you're having issues with and open it.</li><li>In it, you will see a shortcut named <strong>App</strong>. Delete the shortcut and do so for all the apps that are having issues with shortcuts.</li><li>Restart your PC.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Use Power Shell.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>Windows Power Shell</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on it and select <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</li><li>When Windows PowerShell opens, enter <strong>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like “*SystemApps*”} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}
</strong>and press <strong>Enter</strong> to run it.</li><li>Check if the issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Perform a clean boot</a>.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><span><strong><em>Note</em></strong><em>: Please go through the section</em><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><em><span><strong>Reset

 box I see: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run, and also HKLM\SOFTWARE\<span style="text-decoration-line: underline; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Wow632Node</span>\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run, both running at startup with latest being
 the one without "\wow632node\". What can I do as I am trying to clean up my computer and trying to run faster using this Norton PC Checkup. (I've expressed the "wow632node" in underline and bold 'cuz it's driving me nuts).<br />

Thank you in advance<br />

<p><span>This is the startup sequence of the major registry keys, starting immediately after bootmgr has been read and ending with the program shortcut entries in the two Startup folders.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\BootExecute </span>
</p>
<p><span>Services start next, followed by the RunServicesOnce and RunServices registry keys (if present)</span></p>
<p><span>User then logs on to the system.</span></p>
<p><span>2. HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\UserInit </span>
</p>
<p><span>3. HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell</span></p>
<p><span>4. Program entries in these 2 registry keys for ALL USERS start next:</span></p>
<p><span>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run and \RunOnce</span></p>
<p><span>5. Program entries in these 2 registry keys for CURRENT USER start next:</span></p>
<p><span>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run and \RunOnce</span></p>
<p><span>6. Programs in the Startup Folders of All Users and Current User are started last of all.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Important programs like antivirus and firewall start early in the sequence as Services. The icons that appear in the Notification Area (bottom right of the screen) are just their user interfaces, i.e. options and preferences.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>The additional location for 32-bit software in a 64-bit computer is HKLM\SOFTWARE\<span>Wow6432Node and HKCU&nbsp;</span></span><span>in
 your case, as&nbsp;you have both 32 and 64-bit programs starting when you switch on.</span></p></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Number 1 above can include instructions to schedule the running of chkdsk but not user programs.</span></p>
<p><span>Number 2 above points to the program C:\WINDOWS\system32\userinit.exe and the entry ends with a comma. Other programs can be started from this key by appending them and separating them with a comma.
</span></p>
<p><span>Number 3 above should contain just one entry, explorer.exe.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Lastly, if you want to remove unwanted programs that start up when you switch on the computer, download Microsoft’s
</span><span>Autoruns from here </span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902</span></a><span> It doesn’t need installing. Run it and go to the Logon
 Tab and remove the tick alongside the programs you don’t want to start. <span>It is completely reversible if you unintentionally stop the wrong program from starting up.</span></span></p>

    <title>PPP.LOG not present in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michelemazz  say:</h3>
<h2>            PPP.LOG not present in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>With former Windows versions I used to troubleshoot Dial Up issues reading the PPP.LOG.</p>
<p>Until Windows 8.1 it was possible to enable it with "<strong>netsh ras set tracing</strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">&nbsp;*&nbsp;</span><strong>enabled</strong>"
 but with Windows 10 it has no effect.</p>
<p>There is a new procedure to enable PPP logging?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Michele.</p>

                    <p>Dear support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are trying to install W10 Ent 1709 N edition on a Surface pro. Everything Works except the integrated camera. The Picture itselft feels like it has a green overall filter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Camera drivers are up to date: <span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">SurfacePro_Win10_16299_1710007_0.msi</span></p>

<p>Hello Erik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're glad that you posted your concern. Based on what you've listed, it shows that you that you should be set on the softwre side of the camera. However, the camera still shows to not function as it should, since it has a green filter. Please check the
 camera and see if there is still a protective film covering the lens. If none, we suggest that you bring the device to a store and have someone there to check the hardware functionality of the camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to reply to this thread for any additional concern pertaining to the camera and it's functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p><span><span>Hello,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I have the same problem with camera on Microsoft Surface Pro with Windows 10 Enterprise N installed (The N stands for Not with Media Player ). If you want the camera to work you
 must install Windows_MediaFeaturePack. Then the screen is green and the camera react really slow.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Our solution will be: Clean install with Windows 10 Enterprise (without N)&nbsp;and remove Media Player. Then the Camera Works fine
 :)</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>If someone knows what to do that Camera Will work on Windows 10 Enerprise N I would be grateful.. :)</span></span></span></span></p>

    <title>The refresh button for windows 10 Photos app wont stop spinning on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            The refresh button for windows 10 Photos app wont stop spinning on laptop pc</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 home edition version 1607 (OS Build 14393.351).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a relatively new laptop that I purchased at Best Buy.</p>
<p>It came with Win 10 already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use an MS account to log on and everything run fine except for this one thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The photos app "Refresh" button spins and spins and never stops.</p>
<p>It doesn't "seem" to have a negative effect on anything but I should really like to find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how I can re-create the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start Photos.</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p>Remove all folders referenced under sources.</p>
<p>End Photos.</p>
<p>Create an empty folder on the "C" drive named "Test".</p>
<p>Start Photos.</p>
<p>Under collections, nothing shows of course, but the refresh button doesn't spin.</p>
<p>Settings.</p>
<p>Add C:\Test" under referenced sources.</p>
<p>Under collections, nothing shows (Cuz "Test" is empty.), but the refresh button doesn't spin.</p>
<p>End Photos.</p>
<p>Copy any .jpg or .mp4 into the "Test" folder.<br />
Start Photos.</p>
<p>Now, under collections I "see" the .jpg and I can play the .mp4 but the "Refresh" button spins and spins. &nbsp;For hours if I let it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't matter if I tell photos to use my MS OneDrive or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas as what I might do to correct this (unless this is considered expected behavior) is greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Okay then, here's the deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I made the Photos app aware of all my pictures and home movies (".jpg" &amp; ".mp4"), the "Refresh" button spun for five(5) hours and then finally stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what in the wide wide world of sports it was doing (nor how to speed things up.).</p>
<p>I have a pretty beefy laptop so this "seems" a bit excessive to me but, what the heck.</p>
<p>It <strong>did</strong> stop "Refreshing".<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when I clicked on the "Refresh" button a second time, it "Refreshed" for about 40 minutes before stopping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, methinks nothing is broken.</p>
<p>And this "Refresh" time might be considered "normal".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for now, it appears as everything is working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I would like to know what it is doing all this time and what I could do to speed things up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to all who took the time to read my post and cosider my issue.</p>

<h2>            Content Restrictions for family member not working</h2>
                    
<p>I have my son set up with an account and added to me under family. I have his content restriction set to 13 and below. However when he is signed in his content restrictions is set to Unrestricted. I have tried several times to make changes, log out, only
 have him signed in, restarted. But nothing I do seems to change this. It is accepting the restriction I set for Block Explicit TV whenever I change it, but Content Restrictions and Web Filtering will not change. Any ideas?</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;<span>gadgetdad,&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>Sorry you're having issues with your Family Settings on your Xbox One. Where are you getting this error? Is it on the TV? If that's the case, then you need to setup your Set top box with Parental Controls. The Xbox does not filter the STB (set top box).
 The Xbox just takes whatever signal it gets for HDMi and passes it to the television. The guide and channels are not from the STB, and just something that MS programs for your select provider.</p>
<p>Basically the family settings are more for internet and apps. For example. My kids Xbox doesn't have a STB and instead they use the Verizon APP which does block content based on the age set up on their profile. Now you stated that internet also? That should
 be blocked based on your selections. I would go online and verify that it shows their accounts blocked. To check this go to live.xbox.com, then click "my account" under your gamertag in the top right. Then click "Security, family, &amp; forums". After that, Click
 "online safety for Xbox On" Under Privacy &amp; Online safety. Select the profile you want to manage, and ensure the proper settings are there. If you do not see any change, then go ahead and make them here. If you do not see the profile you want, then go to the
 link below and setup your family safety settings.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Same thing here. This tuesday morning, my mother's Surface pro 3 suddenly wouldn't boot any more - requesting a bitlocker key which I knew nothing about and spent time looking for... After a time of panic not finding it (I was searching the wrong microsoft
 account), I finally found it and got the tablet to boot properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>But it now still requires the bitlocker key at each boot</strong>. Annoying and actually unacceptable knowing the consequences the loss of a bitlocker key has on your data: you can basically forget it, grieve and start over - or jump out of the window
 - there is no reasonable way to get it back without this very key. And depending on your loss, never ever trust/buy/use MS hardware for important work again.</p>

            <p>Same exact issue on now a Surface Pro 4 after 1607.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 1607 upgrade failed (downloaded from more info update on Aug 2nd) reverted back then all sorts of stuff broke on my 1511 build , no networks. So I figured maybe Bitlocker was the culprit, so I un-encrypted all my drive. Then I built a USB install from
 Microsoft and did a complete clean install.... now I am in same baoat as all of these nice SP3 users...no matter what i do I cannot get TPM.MSC to recognize the TPM chip in Device Manager that was working just fine in Build 1511. &nbsp;Says it cannot find a compatible
 chip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been in group policy, I created a new recovery partition 500MB, I went to the Microsoft Store too.. No dice nothing works. &nbsp;Please Microsoft issue a fix it seems like a common scenario, and on a surface pro device everything should work as its Microsoft
 Hardware, OS and Drivers for everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please put some engineers on this issue that seems to be common place. Thank you. I love my SP4 but this is nuts.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 update causes high contrast theme to revert to default each - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> g or jb or h  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update causes high contrast theme to revert to default each time the machine is turned on or logged onto.</h2>
                    <p>The issue I have is with the theme reverting to the windows default after each reboot or logout.&nbsp; I have scoured the web, seen hundreds of people with the same issue; even if worded differently.&nbsp; I have an 84 year old blind person who is able to use his
 PC if the standard Microsoft high contrast with a large mouse pointer is available.&nbsp; The issue started shortly after the last big Microsoft update.&nbsp; My uncle is totally unable to use his PC when it reverts back to the windows default theme.</p>
<p>Shortly after the update, the theme began reverting back to the Windows default theme.&nbsp; I started combing thorough the blogs and help sites for answers and nothing has worked.&nbsp; I have tried each answer without result and am about ready to go buy a MAC to
 accommodate a blind (limited sight) person.&nbsp; I have done these steps multiple times without result:<br />
1. Right click on Desktop and select Personalize or press Windows key + I, navigate to Personalization &gt;&nbsp; Theme.<br />
2. Under Theme, click on Save Theme&nbsp; option to save the theme you want to apply to the system and then set the theme, check if issue is resolved.</p>
<p>I have spent my entire holiday season creating a new user account (not synced profile) and repeating the two steps above and the theme still reverts back to the windows default and now it even reverts back when the screen saver kicks in!&nbsp; What on earth have
 you folks done, you must see the hundreds of people with this issue and why have you not posted something worthwhile to fix it and pushed an update to stop this madness?&nbsp; It worked just fine for several years and you are terrorizing the vulnerable and elderly
 with your madness!&nbsp; Please fix ! ! !</p>

<p>Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This solved the problem BUT only until the other profile on the machine is logged into, in other words, the profile J did fine after rebooting and logging off, but if the profile G is logged onto and then logged off, then logging back in as J, the&nbsp;profile
 J reverts back to the windows default still.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also done the Windows restore procedure and reinstalled all my apps and that did not work.</p>

<p>I'm having a very similar problem. Here are the steps I took and the symptoms I see:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) In the high contrast settings I have choose a custom theme "High Contrast with Mouse" that I created. I clicked the Apply button. Everything looks good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I use the left Alt + left Shift + Print Screen keyboard shortcut to turn off high contrast temporarily. Everything is still good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I use the same keyboard shortcut to turn high contrast back on but instead of using my "High Contrast with Mouse" theme it changes back to the windows default high contrast theme which is "High Contrast Black". This theme does not have my extra large
 inverted mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done this multiple times and I've tried restarting the computer. I'm on the most recent update of Windows 10 and this just became a problem after this update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a HUGE problem for people who are visually impaired. I really hope Microsoft is working on a solution ASAP.</p>

<h2>            Printers not working with Windows 10</h2>
                    We have 2 desktops and 1 laptop on a network with 2 printers (an Epson WP-4530 and an HP Photosmart 7525). After Windows 10 was installed on one of the desktops, both printers stopped working from all three devices. Both printers disappeared from the desktop
 upgraded and the HP disappeared from the other desktop.&nbsp; We added those back. On the first upgraded desktop we get the message "An error occurred while printing".&nbsp; Nothing shows in que for either printer. On the other desktop, it appears to print fine, no
 error messages, but no print. Nothing shows in que to print on the Epson, the HP shows qued print. The laptop shows no icon for printer que for the Epson. We can see qued print for the HP. We have removed the first desktop from the network and hardwired it
 to the HP. The results were the same. We have done the troubleshooting and updated drivers for both printers. They are showing OFFLINE. From the printers side, they both think everything is fine and connected to the net

<h2>            screen reader problems</h2>
                    
<p>When we open Yahoo home page we get a distorted screen. At the top It states Screen reader problems, with line to click on "Disable automatic page updates" I click on it and most of the time it takes me to a good Yahoo home page screen. Problem though is
 that I have to do this every-time. I have lost the ability to get a good Yahoo home page screen and have to work at getting it every time I open Yahoo.</p>
<p>I am not sharing my information or allowing it to be shared that I know of.</p>
<p>How do I correct this please?</p>

<h2>            Cannot Write Files to my hard drive after Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I'm unable to save any New data files in Excel or Word to the documents folder after upgrading.&nbsp; All personal data files are marked READ-ONLY now too and unable to save anything, anywhere.&nbsp; I am the administrator of the pc and have tried to change the folder
 attributes to uncheck the read only attribute.&nbsp; This doesn't work or stay permanent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help here?&nbsp; It makes no sense to have a personal computer that I cannot save information on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8/18 update:&nbsp; I can now write to my system.&nbsp; I somehow figured it out by going into File Explorer and using the "Share" feature for all folders (1 by 1).&nbsp; I granted Full Control access to Everyone and all Home Groups.&nbsp; I had other issues that forced me to
 create a new local admin account, so that may have had an effect - not sure.</p>

 owner from "SYSTEM" to my user name. This initially did nothing - I had the same problem - couldn't write to any of my files. HOWEVER, I just went back in and changed the owner from my user name back to SYSTEM, and everything seems to be working fine! &nbsp;I must
 admit, I have not restarted my machine since I made this change. &nbsp;I'll report if it reverts back to the same problem.</span>

<h2>            Should I buy an XB1 for offline use&#63; &#40;PerfectDark&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have very limited internet at home due to extremely restrictive data caps, so I am only interested in offline play.</p>
<p>I'm a crazy Perfect Dark fan so will PD(64) on Rare Replay work if I am completely offline?</p>
<p><br />
Flatout Ultimate Carnage (360) is too fun not to get, but would have to run that through backwards compat, is that possible completely offline?</p>
<p><br />
I have been reading but only come away confused if I would need to sign in to play (or install) PD.</p>
<p><br />
What about Halo, is that a pretty good offline game just for the story? There are diff bundles for me to choose including Gears of War &amp; Madden.</p>

<p>Honestly if you cant connect just to stay on , I wouldn't even bother, The ONE says you don't have to be online but being offline kills over half of the options on the console. Achievements wont work ( at least they did pop up until I logged back into LIVE)
 and your dashboard is pathetic, you cant do anything unless your at least logged in. if you have no problem with just logging in then you should get one.</p>

<p>I used mine not connected in most of the time due download limits and still have loads of fun however like said above you lose out on most of the fun with online stuff, if your not bothered about social gaming then by all means get an xbox one but you wont
 be able to update the bugs found in games</p>
<p>some of the updates like for halo are 16gigs worth if you want to play online lol ....</p>

<p>trust me on this one, a PC without being Online is about as much fun as playing on umm word or calculator lol, I only really use my PC for internet browsing these days...</p>
<p>when I done a fresh install of windows 10 I lost all my games thought I backed my steam folder up over 600 gigs worth of games and updates .. well I did but when I deleted the partition it was the wrong one lol ding all gone :/</p>
<p>tried to reinstall my steam game I have on disk but as soon as I try to play them steam wont give me the choice to play without updating (how stupid but there ya go) mind you origin will let me play my games without updating them but I can play online..</p>

<p>What is your data limit? </p>
<p>Some games on the xbox one need huge updates ranging 10 and 20 gigs per game. Some games need the update to make them stable to play.</p>
<p>Maybe the Xbox 360 is the way to go as it has Smaller updates. Game sizes are smaller which means smaller game downloads.

<p>Does anybody know how much data you'd need to activate an XB1?</p>
<p>What about to get the Rare collection (or PD64) running? Then simply always play offline after that.</p>
<p>I have a PC I also game offline with, tons of games are fun offline.. even shooters. (I have made a couple bf2 mods)</p>
<p>I could log in occasionally but knowing how frustrating devices can be with automatic updates and the like, I would really need to limit online activity.
</p>
<p>I sometimes exceed my data limit of 7gb/mo with normal PC web surfing.</p>
<p>Honestly I'm mainly after PD64 and Flatout, both are avail on the $150 XB360 and should play equally as good. Although PD64 on 360 HAS to be downloaded (correct?). Anybody know how large of download that would be?</p>
<p>As a PC gamer(builder) I recognize the significance of how much more powerful the xb1 is, 5x the tflops. I am in need of a BluRay player already and I am wary of the 360 red ring of death. The 360 is also end of its life as far as games. XB1 has current
 releases but if the age of simply buying the disc and playing offline is really over, maybe the XB1 ISN'T for me.. convince me otherwise?</p>

<p>With only 7 gigabytes the Xbox One will use that up fairly quickly. </p>
<p>Not entirely sure what size the setup update will be now.</p>
<p>Rare replay doesn't install the Xbox 360 titles in the collection from the disk but downloads the Xbox 360 backward compatibility titles to your consoles hard drive. Games in the collection like Perfect dark Zero is 6.3 gigs, Kameo is 6.2 gigs and Viva piñata
 is 5.6 gigs. So just downloading the backwards compatible titles it's going to eat up your data very fast.</p>

<p>My computer is new and has Windows 10. &nbsp;I just installed Movie Maker to edit some of my old videos and every time I load a video in there to edit it, I only get video, not audio. &nbsp;I have tried everything, including uninstalling and reinstalling, but I still
 have the same problem. &nbsp;Is it a Windows 10 glitch? &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Try these suggestions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the bottom of your screen at right side, click speaker icon, adjust slider bar to the right, or going up, then press escape to finish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click start, under computer management, select windows audio, click stop services, then click start services again, green icon appears if downloading is in progress. ( this is window 7 ) before upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>At movie maker, click video, click edit, on the left side adjust volume slider bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use audio wave format &nbsp;(.wav) files in adding music to your movie maker.</p>
