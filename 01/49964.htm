    <title>Transfer of files from Win 98 to XP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Transfer of files from Win 98 to XP</h2>
                    <p>I am helping an older computer user to "upgrade" as at last his 98 is unable to handle the Web and world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He likes XP as it looks similar in format with Office XP so at least it will cope for now, through those years there is a large collection of files he built up with Office 98 lots of documents with links to images here and there plus data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I wonder is if I "upgrade" his old 98 system to XP to be able to use XP's transfer system, at least the file format will be closer, then copy it to his newer system so I can return the old one back to 98.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would I have to elevate his old one to a full update and if so could I return it back to 98, or is that only viable without other updates included.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas please</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you fromDavid</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS Yes I have been trying to prise it from him for years now with his older POP3 etc in effect gone he had to get broadband not dial up!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never seen Win 98 panic so much in silence trying to cope with ebay or amazons adverts without up to date flash players!</p>

            <p>No the new system has "newer" type hardware, sata hard drive, P4 3.2GHz DVD writer etc with a GA81945 type motherboard which was selected because it was capable of XP through to Win7 should he desire more upgrades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>His old system is a P3 500MHz 256Mb memory only capable of DOS though it will upgrade to XP an issue between graphics and USB (as with many of its period but OK if I restrict its graphic driver to just basic).</p>
<p>
</p><p>He has used a lot of features in the older office and I was concerned that links to data fragments would be lost or complex to rebuild to restore a complete files plus he created those old UDF discs for data storage with Adaptec which had that software problem
 that compressed its data to enable drag and drop under Win98.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to buy a 3rd party software for his wife so her Win 7 could read them so that is why I wanted to return his old system back to 98, under the reasoning ( you made it you read it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thought was that with both the same system any file links and registry hive "settings" would be similar at some level such that those links would be more valid even if Office XP needed to convert them for it to display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps you</p>
<p>

            <p>Oh boy...UDF packet writting, aka Drag &amp; Drop!&nbsp; Don't get rid of the Windows 98 hardware until you are sure that all of his files on CD can be read and retrieved on the Windows XP machine or else they may be lost or difficult to recover!&nbsp; The problem with
 packet writing is that while in concept and theory it may appear to be very useful there is no certainty that files written in this manner will ever be guaranteed to be read in anything other than the very same CD/DVD drive and model as that on which they
 were written. This is a known problem with cds written with this writing method, in the old days it wasn't unusual to see posts on help groups from people seeking help because they could not recover their files.&nbsp; You change your computer and get rid of the
 old one, you forget (if you even knew) about your "Drag and Drop" cds and the new computer that you got has a different make of cd drive and all of a sudden all your precious files that you so carefully copied to cd are lost.&nbsp; Then you have to have recourse
 of recovery software like ISOBuster to try to recover the files!&nbsp; It can lead to file loss and major aggravation!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows XP has the "Files and Settings Transfer Wizard" that you can use to transfer settings from some microsoft programs, there is not really anything else in the Windows set of tools to transfer the other stuff and forget about copying registry settings
 from the Windows 98 to Windows XP, while there is a semblance of similarity the two registry are significantly different.&nbsp; If the transfer wizard cannot migrate some of the programs your user will have to fiddle and play with his applications to set them back
 to his liking.&nbsp; The biggest problem is usually email but luckily the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard can migrate Outlook and if he is using Thunderbird there is a profile backup and restore tool available to migrate his profile and emails to the new computer.</p>

            <p>True so so True, got him trained on memory flash now gave his 98 that generic nusb31e.exe (sorted out many problems for me) so that part is solved plus when files are large enough transfer to disc via a more normal method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must still ask though during an upgrade from Win98 to XP there is a hunk of restore file if you did not like it to return to 98, while it is converted you have that transfer wizard to use which I would think will do a better job of Office files transfer
 than my "dead drop way" most others I can deal with. </p>
<p>
</p><p>With many of his files like say word there are added images which .doc documents when saved use links to those image files when they are re-opened, that is what I wanted to keep and transfer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just want to cut down my work load, during win98 years used to spend ages copying things and "tickling" files so windows would register them (miss those times in a way simpler times)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am unsure of is, will that restore file which gets generated (Windows.old I think) work only with the initial convertion or would it be able to work if XP's later service packs are added to bring it into line with the new machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I presume Outlook express between 98 and XP should be OK by the export - import method?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so far from David</p>

            <p>I don't quite understand, earlier you said that it was newer hardware so I assumed a clean install, now you say that it was an in-place&nbsp; upgrade with W98 files left on the disk?&nbsp; Did you place the old disk in the newer computer and perform an in-place upgrade?&nbsp;
 The "hunk" of restore files are in case you want to go back to Windows 98 after an uprade that doesn't work as expected.</p>

            <p>Sorry I am getting confused myself....</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK he has a windows 98 system with all his files UDF writer software etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a newer system with XP and XP Office plus suitable hardware (that if required can go to Win7 if desired).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much of his data I can copy paste but he also has many linked documents with graphics added plus other data linked files from exel etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I know his old 98 from another similar system will tolerate XP, but has some hardware limitations graphics, USB and memory which should not be a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would like to do is to run an upgrade disc on his old system so I can use its transfer wizard to help me, once done return this back to 98&nbsp; as assurance he can get some data if I run into problems with his newer system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That newer system has all its updates service packs etc, would his older 98 when temporarily upgraded need to be enhanced with updates for an effective transfer (if the system files are different due to age gap) or would it be OK without.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If its needed could his 98 system be restored if it had all those updates? or just hope a simple initial upgrade without further updates would work OK.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this clears the confusion....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks from David</p>

            <p>You don't need to upgrade the Windows 98 installation to Windows XP to use the FST wizard, that is the whole point of the utility.&nbsp; You should cleanly install Windows XP and leave the existing Windows 98 installation be for the time being, clean installations
 tend to be more robust and reliable than in-place upgrades..&nbsp; If you want to upgrade Windows 98 to maintain the existing folder structure I suggest you do it with a clone rather than the original installation, rolling back in-place upgrades can be messy at
 times.</p>

            <p>So a copy of XP's Transfer wizard will work OK on 98, just thought with non similar file structures there would be a tendency to not place some files?</p>

            <p>Yes, while logged on to the Windows 98 installation just put the Windows XP in the CD-ROM drive and run the wizard, this is explained in one of the links I supplied earlier.&nbsp; As for the file links and the existing folder structure the File and Settings Transfer
 Wizard cannot copy this to the new machine.&nbsp; If you really must maintain a complex folder structure then an in-place upgrade would maintain it.&nbsp; Otherwise you will have to replicate the tree on the new machine. Robocopy or other backup utilities will be able
 to do this, just be careful not to replicate system folders, this is generally not for the faint of heart, just make sure you have good backup and images of the Windows XP installation before you attempt to do this.&nbsp; Also make sure that you have a restorable
 image of the Windows 98 installation, one wrong move with Robocopy could remove source files or folders.</p>

    <title>new logitech c615 does not work in skype - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            new logitech c615 does not work in skype</h2>
                    <p>HI</p>
<p>1 month a go I installed the latest version of windows 10 with the latest version of skype. during the video test, my whole monitor&nbsp;goes black and unresponsive. it worked on all third party test sites and in windows 'camera' app. dealing with Logitech tech
 support, I went through the usual of uninstalling and reinstalling skype, the webcam, drivers etc with no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then installed an older version of skype 7.36.0.101. the problem with that version&nbsp;is the video freezes and the audio goes out of sync and lags behind video for periods of up to 20 seconds. I went through the same uninstall and reinstall process with no
 change in performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after 2 weeks of dealing with Logitech, they said because it works on third party test sites the problem lies with skype and I should seek support here. are Logitech cameras compatible with windows 10? any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Your Windows 10 is not up to date.&nbsp; On April 11, 2017 (nearly 2 months ago), the Windows 10 Creators Update was released.&nbsp; You can update to that version, to see if anything changes for the better.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10http://" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Windows 10 - Windows 10 Creators Update now available</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The onboard video you have is over a decade old and very poor performing.&nbsp; It does not help that it does not natively support Windows 10 and is using 256MB of shared DDR2 memory.&nbsp; The courtesy drivers provided by Intel function in Windows Vista mode.&nbsp; This
 combination of things is not ideal for any type of video/camera application.&nbsp; The video and camera drivers work hand-in-hand and then interface with Skype's video engine.&nbsp; So while it may function outside of Skype, the added consumption of resources, the stability/compatibility
 level of the drivers (WDM1.0) and the delay in response time may be the issue.&nbsp; New iterations of Skype software do not tend to side with older hardware.&nbsp; This hardware would probably function better in Windows XP or Vista running Skype rather than in Windows
 10.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply installing a Windows 10 natively compatible dedicated memory graphics card would probably benefit your configuration greatly.&nbsp; Your motherboard does appear to have a PCI-E slot you could use.&nbsp; If you or a friend has a card lying around, it may be
 worth your time to simply test it out.</p>

</p><p>As my DxDiag has expressed the above statement in its report, I had found that I needed to upgrade to this version of the above mention Driver AMD's&nbsp;(Radeon Software Crimson Edition 16.2.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Question is &gt; Will or when is it possible to obtain a "Tested By Microsoft's Windows Hardware Quality Labs" version ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just an average Joe sorta Pc/Laptop user who notices little things like this....I'm posting this here as it seems to be the most logical place...So I'm Think'n maybe Microsoft and AMD should get together at a table to work this out how ever it's done
 these days ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps- Don't know which Category this falls under so i'll post it in windows for now ...you guys can work it out!</p>

            <p>I've done just that downloaded and installed the latest driver and only working driver that allows me to run certain games like Diablo 3 etc... but the version I've installed has no WHQL certification as I described above in previous post as this driver

<p>Hi Saber,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue you're currently experiencing regarding the computer unable to sleep can be due to the audio driver that is active due to an audio stream. It can be caused by a browser with a Flash content in it or an app that is running a process in the background.
 You can set the power management to ignore any audio stream so your computer can go to sleep. To do this, open an elevated command prompt and type
<strong><em>powercfg -REQUESTSOVERRIDE DRIVER "Realtek High Definition Audio" SYSTEM</em></strong><em>.
</em>Once done, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you'll be able to put your computer to sleep after running the command.</p>
<p>

            Hi GA.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Try reinstalling Windows Media Player with a PC restart in between:   Type Features in Start Search, open Turn Windows Features On or Off, under Media Features, uncheck Windows Media Player, click OK.  Restart PC, then reverse the process to check WMP, OK, restart again to reinstall it.  
<br />
<br />2) Try the fixes here:
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-problems-with-windows-media-player-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-problems-with-win...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/troubleshooting-tips-for-windows-media-player-2438908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/troubleshooting-tips-f...</a>
<br /> <a href="https://appuals.com/fix-windows-media-player-has-stopped-working-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://appuals.com/fix-windows-media-player-ha...</a>
<br />
<br />3) Download this troubleshooter and run it:
<br /><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_wmpc10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_wmpc10</a>
<br />
<br />4) Compare by installing and running VLC:  <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html</a>
<br />
<br />5) Try also the Movies and TV app which comes with Windows 10 which many prefer.  If you prefer either of the above then set them as default in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps.
<br />
<br />6) There may be system corruption or other problems.  Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />8) If this was caused by October Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks for the suggestion. I had found your reply in response to a similar request and tried all three troubleshooters before posting my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Media Player simply will not open. No error message or anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have it pinned to the task bar. If I right click it brings up the list of frequent as well as tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on Windows Media Player the "wheel" spins for a few seconds and that is all that happens!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>

            There is no risk in running a Repair Install, as it says it saves your files, apps and most settings in place while repairing the OS.  
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows as often as you want with the Digital License assigned permanently to the PC when you upgraded, just skip the Product Key during install.  In fact you may be much better off if you reinstall since What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues.  For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  
<br />
<br />So I'd not hesitate to do the Repair Install which fixes most problems and saves everything in place.  And if it doesn't work then doing the Clean Install is actually the best option of all.  
<br />
<br />Remember your files should always be backed up if you value them at all because a hard drive can die at any time without notice.

<p>I guess I would first make sure it's not actually your ISP causing the issue. &nbsp;Are you using wireless internet? &nbsp;Could need to make some adjustments in your router/modem to help a wireless connection. &nbsp;Hope you get things figured out! &nbsp;Good Luck!</p>

<p>Thank you for responding with the info.<br />
<br />
So you have a Strict NAT? Please follow the directions below to open up your NAT:
<br />
<br />
Open up the modem's interface by going to&nbsp;<a href="http://192.168.2.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://192.168.2.1</a>&nbsp;type the default modem password "1234" and go to firewall.&nbsp;<br />
Go to default policy and set everything to permit. Save the settings. From the main menu,
<br />
Let us know how that goes, or if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype Microsoft sign-in</h2>
                    <p>So apparently I no longer have access to the Skype home page overview and what not because I've got this log in screen that demands of me to log in with a Microsoft account. However, when I try to use my Microsoft e-mail account, I get the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"This doesn't look like a work or school email. You can't sign in here with a personal account. Use your work or school account instead."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So am I supposed to create some fake account I'll never use that fits some criteria? I am using Skype just fine for conversations and what not, but that extra new log in is something I've been ignoring since they implemented it.</p>

            Hi Peter.<br /><br />Yes, unfortunately you need iOS 10 or above to use Skype for iPad<br /><br /><br />Note: If you have Skype (version 8) on iPhone with iOS 9, you will not be able to update higher than Skype version 8.34.0.72. <br /> <br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa10328/what-a...</a>

            Hi Peter,
<br />
<br />The iPad 3 can only use up to iOS 9.xx, it cannot run iOS 10.xx
<br />
<br />I am sorry, there is no way for you to run Skype on that iPad, since Microsoft turned off support for iOS 9.xx a few days ago . . . 
<br />
<br />Your only option would be to use the web version of Skype - <a href="https://web.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com</a> 
<br />
<br />Please Note, you may have to use a different browser on your iPad to use the Web version of Skype . . .

I'm sorry to know that you're facing issues with Skype.   <br /><br />Unfortunately, iPad 3 only allows the user to ugrade the system to IOS9.xx but not IOS 10, but Skype requires IOS 10 or above. You may wish to use Skype on other devices.<br /><br />Hope it helps and please let us know if you have further questions!   <br /><br />Cheers, Zoe

<div>As a workaround, Skype for iPhone can be used on an iPad with iOS 9.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Install older iTunes 12.6.5 supporting AppStore:&nbsp;</div>
<div>https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208079&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. 'Purchase' the Skype for iPhone by downloading it in iTunes. Make sure to login in iTunes with the same Apple ID as on iPad.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Open Skype for iPhone in AppStore on iPad via this link:&nbsp;</div>
<div>https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skype-for-iphone/id304878510</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. Select 'cloud' icon to install Skype for iPhone. AppStore will prompt that iOS 10 is required and will offer to download an older version.</div>

<h2>            Bit-locker decryption stuck at 82.5&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a laptop with BitLocker&nbsp;already enabled on all drives. I need to resize the drive and also change the BitLocker password.</p>
<p>So I just disabled the BitLocker on both C and D drive. D drive was empty so finished immediately, but C drive was running. I was not aware of the decryption process that it would take too much time. So immediately I deleted D drive from disk management
 and shrank the C drive. Unfortunately, C drive size becomes small so again I increased the size of C drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The initial size of C drive 136GB -&gt; Shrank to -&gt; 107GB -&gt; Expendad to 110GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the same time decryption was running but after some time decryption stuck at 82.5%, and now it's been 4 days that progress remains on 82.5%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps I followed</p>
<p>1. Restarted the PC</p>
<p>2. Cleared the TPM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am not able to enable BitLocker on C drive since the decryption still running. How to reset or clear everything like a new fresh PC.</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />Can you enter the safe mode and see if this progress still continues?
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Dexter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Actually, the drive which stuck is C, so formatting is not the solution for the problem.</p>
<p>
Also, I don't&nbsp;have anything to recover as the drive is fully decrypted, the problem is only with the progress bar or the process.</p>
<p>
My Assumption - WHen the decryption started C drive was 107GB, but the progress bar is checking with 110GB. That's why the progress bar&nbsp;stops when the decryption finished for 107GB but the current size was 110GB so actually, decryption is completed but not
 completed in reference to 110GB.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 5Ghz Wireless issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I can't find any solution to my internet issue.</p>
<p>I have a Dell XPS 15 (9560) with Intel 9260 and since I updated to Fall Creators (then to April) Update I have some problems with my 5ghz networks.</p>
<p>I had a similar problem with the Killer 1535 wifi card so I decided to update to an Intel 9260, but the issue remains.
</p>
<p>I updated drivers, I tried to format and fresh install Windows and updated to the last BIOS but the problem is still there.</p>
<p>Also installed all the insider previews but nothing.</p>
<p>The troubleshooting is not detecting anything and I don't find any user with this problem.</p>
<p>I tried to reset the network but this didn't help.</p>
<p>No problems with 2.4 Ghz networks.</p>
<p>Here is a video of the problem:&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/0SNrWTzeZu8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://youtu.be/0SNrWTzeZu8</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/0SNrWTzeZu8?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/0SNrWTzeZu8?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>Any idea?&nbsp;</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

            Well, driver and hardware issues are usually the responsibility of the hardware manufacturer. Its possible because of the rapid pace of Windows 10 releases, Dell is having trouble keeping up, forcing them to abandon support or put it on the back burner to support newer models.

<p>Hi Justalgsoo,</p>
<p>You don’t have free download available anywhere for this game, because this is built in game with Windows 95. The inbuilt games are specific with the Operating Systems and cannot be downloaded.</p>
<p>However there is a Chess Titans available in Windows 7, you may use that game.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>Start</strong> and type <strong>optionalfeatures.exe</strong> in
<strong>Start Search</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand Games in Windows Features window and put a <strong>check mark</strong> for
<strong>Chess Titans</strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you restart the computer the changes will be applied.</p>

    <title>laptop keeps reading and dropping USB CD-ROM continuously - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meghanelizondo  say:</h3>
<h2>            laptop keeps reading and dropping USB CD-ROM continuously</h2>
                    <p>Problem: my CD-ROM keeps dropping in a repeating loop. I can sit there watching Device Manager as it has a CD-ROM entry and then it disappears and it reads the-cd-rom again every few seconds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does sometimes work correctly and read the cd-rom continuously and I can use it fine. The problem reoccurs when the USB cord is removed and plugged back in or when the laptop restarts or when the same disk is ejected and put back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Info:</p>
<p>Surface Book laptop, Windows 10 v1809. Up-to-date per Windows Update.</p>
<p>CD-ROM/DVD reader is SSTcorp&amp;Prod_CDDVDW_SE-S084C. </p>
<p>Driver: 10.0.17763.1</p>
<p>The disk and cd-rom work on our desktop Windows 10 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device Manager tells me the driver is working properly and driver is up-to-date.</p>
<p>Disk Manager consistently doesn't read the disk when it's in this state, even after a Rescan of drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried:</p>
<p>1. Restart of my laptop. </p>
<p>&nbsp; Result: Usually no change. After several restarts, it sometimes settles down and keeps reading he CD-ROM in a stable fashion.</p>
<p>2. When it reads cd-rom, Device Manager &gt; Uninstall driver, Restart computer. </p>
<p>Result: No change. CD-ROM is read but it doesn't usually make a difference to the looping read/drops. A couple of times it has continuously read the cd-rom.</p>
<p>3. When it's in the loop, Disk Manager &gt; Rescan drives. </p>
<p>&nbsp; Result: This doesn't usually do anything. I think it worked one time so it might have been random luck.</p>
<p>4. Following this info, Method 6: </p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/314060/your-cd-or-dvd-drive-is-not-recognized-by-windows-or-other-programs</p>

<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup

            You can use it to activate Windows 10 Home if its not in use or came with another computer. The opportunity to use it to activate Windows 10 might have passed, but its worth a try.

            Yes you will be able to do this.
<br />But make sure you get the windows 10 home edition.  The editions must match.

When you come to xbox.com with an account that doesn't have a Gamertag tied to it, it will auto-generate a Gamertag for that account. However, shawtycuzz definitely doesn't seem like an auto-genereated Gamertag.<br /><br />Are you absolutely positive that you never tied a Gamertag to that account?<br /><br />You may want to use the Contact Us page to set up a support call with an account specialist who can take a look into this account situation with you.<br /><br />Let us know how things go and we'll work with you from there. =)</p>

<p>Apparently a long time ago, I created an xbox live account, using my e-mail address, on someone else's xbox360 so I could play a game. &nbsp;The generated name was "gyrateconstant2" &nbsp;I must have left the account in a state that people were able to log on and
 use it, and they did so. &nbsp;They also changed the gamer tag. &nbsp;When I need a microsoft account, it said I already had one, so I reset my password. &nbsp;I didn't realize the connection to xbox live until I needed a live account. &nbsp;The last activity on the account was
 probably around the time I changed the password. &nbsp;They were probably disappointed they could no long log on :/
</p>
<p>Is there any way I can reset or delete my the xbox live profile and create a new on on this microsoft account? &nbsp;Should I go ahead and create a support call in order to accomplish this?</p>

<p>Hey Cuzz,<br />
<br />
<strong>There is no way to 'reset or delete' the Xbox Live profile associated with that Microsoft Account.</strong><br />
<br />
One possibility is to <a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Transfer Your Gamertag to Another Microsoft Account</a>. Other than that, you would need to use a different Microsoft account to create a fresh Xbox Live profile.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hope that clears things up, and let us know if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>You bet, shawty! The Gamertag can be changed on any Xbox 360 console connected to Xbox Live, for about USD $10. Make sure you have that amount (plus any applicable taxes) in your account balance, or have a valid payment method tied to your account.<br />

<p><span>One Win10 computer usually asks, but not always, to verify credentials.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I click on pop-up/alert it opens Settings &gt; accounts &gt; your email &amp; accounts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There are two choices 1. Manage my Microsoft account and 2. Sign in with a local acct instead.</span></p>
<p><span>One time there was another option: verify your credentials (paraphrased since only viewed it once) but every other time only the two choices above.</span></p>

<p><span>Sometimes when I save an existing sync word or excel sometime later popup: could not sync doc and then saves it with the original name of the doc

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused, I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, do let us know if you have two steps verification enabled. Also, did you try verifying the computer by click "verify"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two-step verification helps protect you by making it more difficult for someone else to sign in to your Microsoft account. It uses two different forms of identity: your password, and a contact method. Even if someone else finds your password, they'll be
 stopped if they don't have access to your other devices or accounts. </p>
<p>If you turn on two-step verification, you’ll get a security code to your email, phone, or authenticator app every time you sign in on
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-is-trusted-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>Try verifying the PC and check if the issue persists. </p>

            <p>I will post in office forum but want to clarify first.&nbsp; This occurs when I have no office documents open so is it still an Office issue to post in their forum?&nbsp; But OneDrive is automatically on when I start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No two step verification is not on.&nbsp; I sign in / out many times a day from desktop/laptop and didn't want two step every time.&nbsp; From your comment&nbsp;I think if my device is trusted I don't have to two-step verify each time?</p>
<p>

            Could be a corrupt software distribution folder.
<br />
<br /> The first troubleshooting option you can try is Microsoft's own Windows 10 Troubleshooter for Windows Update. In the Windows 10 Creators Update, you can find it in Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot, click Windows Update then click Run the troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />If you are running Windows 10 Anniversary Update or an earlier version of Windows, click Start, type: troubleshooting, hit Enter then launch the Windows Update troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />You can run the troubleshooter a couple times to see if it helps. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.
<br />
<br />2. Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver
<br />
<br />3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />
<br />4. Now, let’s restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Typethe following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                        net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />                        net start cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                        net start bits
<br />
<br />                        net start msiserver
<br />
<br />5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it and then restart the computer. 
<br />

            Hi Joe.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try this new guided walk-through to repair Windows Update:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />Another thing you can do do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.
