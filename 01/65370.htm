    <title>How to remove infected files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elizabethjaeger  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to remove infected files</h2>
                    <p>Recently I used the Windows 10 Malicious Software Removal Tool to scan my computer because my PC was not running smoothly.&nbsp; During the scanning process, I noticed that 10 infected files were discovered by the scanning tool.&nbsp; However, after the process was
 completed, the report informed me that there was no threat in my PC.&nbsp; So why was there a conflict between what was reported during the scanning process and after the completion of scanning?<br />
<br />
In fact, I always did a full scan on my computer with the inbuilt scanning feature on my Windows 10 Home version and also&nbsp; the security update.&nbsp; After completion each time, I was told that my PC was up-to-date and no action was needed.&nbsp; Despite this assurance,
 I am still concerned whether the 10 infected files are still lurking in my PC and also whether the scanning and security reports are not reliable (i.e. more of a ritual than an actual report).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate&nbsp; help from the real technical experts who are well-versed in this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>When Windows 10 is originally activated to PC then PC's hardware ID (based on mother board) is stored to MS activation server and you can reinstall that Windows without product key (if you don't have change mother board) and it will be activated automatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When installer ask product key you can just click "I don't have a product key" to cointinue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is good instructions how to do reinstall.</p>

            With Windows 10 you get a digital license where your activation information is stored on MS servers. As soon as you do a clean install, Windows would automatically activate when it connects to the Internet, for the first time-provided you install the same version as was installed before. If you are asked for a key, skip it.

            When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<p>Libraries are just a way of viewing folders - the folders that are contained in the libraries can of course be anywhere on your computer. Mine are on the D drive. Just move them using the "Location" tab.</p>
<p>FYI - you can't do this from the Library view you need to do this from Windows Explorer as the Location tab is not visible in Library view.</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;Angela Karp,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further assist you with this, can you provide me the Skype versions installed on the 3 devices?</p>
<p>Also, can you try to take a screenshot of the Skype page on your dad's pc whenever he tries to search your accounts and provide it to me here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, there's a possibility that your dad might be logged in to a different account that's why he cannot receive the messages and video/audio call. You may ask him to check the account that is logged in to the Skype application:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Skype for Windows desktop</strong></span></p>
<p>1. Click your name at the top left of Skype.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz705183.vo.msecnd.net%2fonlinesupportmedia%2fonlinesupport%2fmedia%2fskype%2fscreenshots%2ffa10858%2ffa10858_9.png" /><br />
<br />
2. Your Skype name is displayed in your profile.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz705183.vo.msecnd.net%2fonlinesupportmedia%2fonlinesupport%2fmedia%2fskype%2fscreenshots%2ffa10858%2ffa10858_8.png" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype for Windows 10 (UWP)</p>
<p>1. Click your profile photo at the top middle section of the page to view your profile:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz705183.vo.msecnd.net%2fonlinesupportmedia%2fonlinesupport%2fmedia%2fskype%2ffa300xx%2ffa34664_darkchat.png" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure your dad is logged in to the correct account so he will be able to see your messages and audio/video call invites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll look forward to your reply.</p>

<h2>            Only Public user icons are showing Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Been using Win10 for many, many months running with windows 7 format . This morning On logging in with password, it recognized me by username, BUT it then said "Preparing Windows". The desktop had only about 10 of the 50+ icons. Background image is gone.
 Start menu has none of the things I originally set up. I had Cortana turned off, but the taskbar says "I'm Cortana, ask me anything" and the task bar icons are gone except for Task View, Edge (which I had replaced with Explorer), and File Explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just
 confirmed the only icons showing are public ones.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I'm the only user, but other than welcoming me by name, It almost seems like it started up for a different user like guest.<br />
All apps shows all my programs there, and the desktop Recycle bin has things I deleted last night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems like this is treating me like a new login user.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>I've rebooted and logged in several times.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hello Hal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience. Let me assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed any further, let us know a few more details on the below questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A.</strong> What is the last Windows update which was performed on your PC?<br />
Steps:</p>
<p>1. Open the Settings Charm with the shortcut Windows Key<a href="http://solverbase.com/w/File:Windows_Key.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows Key"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsolverbase.com%2fimages%2f7%2f71%2fWindows_Key.png" height="17" width="24" /></span></a>+
 I.</p>
<p>2. Click/tap <strong>Change PC settings</strong>. </p>
<p>3. Click on the <strong>Update and recovery</strong> and click on the <strong>
View your update history</strong>. </p>
<p>4. You will now see a list of your installed Windows Updates. If you click on any one of the
<strong>"Successfully installed on (date)"</strong> links&nbsp;, you will find&nbsp;more details for that update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>B. </strong>Apart from the change in the Start Menu and the Taskbar functionality, did you find any files missing from the PC (apart from the All apps which you mentioned)?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>C. </strong>Were you using a Local user account or a Microsoft User Account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I&nbsp;suggest you to open Advanced User Accounts Control Panel to check and verify the accounts created in your PC. Please follow below.</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press the Windows key and R from the keyboard to open the Run Command Dialog Box.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Enter <strong>netplwiz</strong>. The following window lists all the existing user accounts.</span></span></span></li></ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p>
</p><p>Next, verify if you&nbsp;have a <strong>C:\Windows.old folder</strong> created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Write to us with the updated status and the required information related to the issue, for us to be able to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            I can not seem to get my desktop theme to stay on the one that I pick.</h2>
                    I made a theme for my desktop and when I select it, it uses it but then it goes to another theme and when I go back to check on it a unsaved theme has been chosen again.&nbsp; How do I get the theme that I want to use to stay on the desktop and not switch to
 another one?

            Hi Xing.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br /> 
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that fails then re-register the Microsoft Store app following Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>.  If there are other apps you can re-register them from Option Two or do all of them at once from Option One.
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>You can still download Concorde for FSX. &nbsp; There are various, but one is here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://flyawaysimulation.com/downloads/files/1788/fsx-concorde/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know how accurate this one is, but an option for you to consider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above suggestion was for installation of FS2000 in compatibility mode. &nbsp; However, since you already have it installed, can you go back to the .exe file and try launching the Sim as Administrator and if that doesn't work, to set the compatibility (from
 Properties) to an earlier version of Windows and try launching it now?</p>

<p>If you are referring to FS2000, then probably it's no longer compatible with later Windows OSs.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some are having problems with installing FS2004 and FSX, so your version is now obsolete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're interested in flight simming and have a good computer with a fast CPU and graphics card, then you may want to check out other Sims on the market.&nbsp; FSX-Steam Edition is a direct replacement for FSX.&nbsp; &nbsp;Prepar3d and X-Plane also put out great Sims.&nbsp;

    <title>Are there any microphone controls in windows 10 system tray - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reimusklinsman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Are there any microphone controls in windows 10 system tray</h2>
                    Previous versions of Windows had microphone controls in the system tray but I can't find any for the life of me in windows 10. Almost any change to the microphone requires a 7+ step process. Simply turning a microphone on or off. Changing the input volume.
 Setting up a microphone also requires granting permissions as well as setting up voice-to-text (at least in my experience). Changing the microphone device.&nbsp; These are all things that should be accomplished as easily as changing your speakers volume and previous
 versions has much easier functionality here

            HI ReimusKlinsman ... can you not just right click your sound speaker on the system tray and select open sounds settings?
<br />this will take you to your microphone settings.

            Yes, you can but it's far more cumbersome than it used to be when you need to adjust volume or switch microphones which I do a lot when switching between using the HTC Vive with it's onboard mic and discord with my headsets mic. I'm hoping that there would
 be a way to alter the microphone that's just about as easy as altering speaker settings (Click sound icon, change speaker)

            Depends if the microphone has drivers that do that.
<br />It's not a windows thing but more a device thing... so the vendor that created the microphone would create those type of capabilities.

                    <div>Dear People:</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>A few months back I decided to change to a different desktop I have, one with Windows 7. The other day I<br />
changed back to my Windows 10 desktop. The first thing I noticed was a very monotonous and somewhat<br />
"unspecific" notification stating the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>You need to fix your Microsoft Account for apps on your other devices to be able to launch apps
</em></strong><br />
<em><strong>and continue experiences on this device.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><div>What exactly is this notification asking of me? I have "googled" this notification and "you-tubed" it<br />
until the cows come home! It pretty-much states the same all over the net.......it is annoying. Some state there<br />
is a cure or fix for it, something about synchronizing apps. </div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, this Windows 10 desktop is working fine (knock-on-wood).....it is a Windows 10 Home OEM
<br />
64bit, Build 14393.</p>

            I had that issue before on my computer. I thought it could a blocked Microsoft account of mine. The simple way to solve it: Please delete your Microsoft account from your device, then the message will not appear again.

<h2>            Xbox LIVE cannot connect to the network. It says it can&#39;t obtain an IP address from the router</h2>
                    
<p>Ok I'm going to try and give you as much information as I can. I have successfully connected to Xbox LIVE before but then I added another computer to the network and now the Xbox can no longer connect to the network. Here is how it was set up before:</p>
<p>I had a Actiontec M1000 modem and the W1000 wireless module which sent wifi to my Windows 7 laptop. I connected to Xbox LIVE by bridging the local area connection and my wireless network connection and hooking my laptop up to the Xbox via ethernet cable.
 It worked great without any problems.</p>
<p>Then I added a XP desktop computer to the network by hooking it up directly to the modem via ethernet cable. The network works fine. Both computers can share files and they both connect to the internet great. But when I tried connecting to Xbox LIVE, it
 said that it can't obtain an IP address from the router. I went to Configure Network on the Xbox and it gave the Xbox an IP address that started with 169.</p>
<p>I have now tried setting it up a little bit differently. Instead of bridging it I just right clicked my wireless network connection and under the sharing tab checked the boxes to turn on Internet Connection Sharing. This way seems much better than bridging
 it. Anyways, I'm not sure why it would stop working after adding another computer to the network.</p>
<p>I want to provide as much information as I can so I did a ipconfig /all in Command Prompt on my laptop and this is what it shows:</p>

<p>Ok I'm going to try and give you as much information as I can. I have successfully connected to Xbox LIVE before but then I added another computer to the network and now the Xbox can no longer connect to the network. Here is how it was set up before:</p>
<p>I had a Actiontec M1000 modem and the W1000 wireless module which sent wifi to my Windows 7 laptop. I connected to Xbox LIVE by bridging the local area connection and my wireless network connection and hooking my laptop up to the Xbox via ethernet cable.
 It worked great without any problems.</p>
<p>Then I added a XP desktop computer to the network by hooking it up directly to the modem via ethernet cable. The network works fine. Both computers can share files and they both connect to the internet great. But when I tried connecting to Xbox LIVE, it
 said that it can't obtain an IP address from the router. I went to Configure Network on the Xbox and it gave the Xbox an IP address that started with 169.</p>
<p>I have now tried setting it up a little bit differently. Instead of bridging it I just right clicked my wireless network connection and under the sharing tab checked the boxes to turn on Internet Connection Sharing. This way seems much better than bridging
 it. Anyways, I have tried a whole bunch of troubleshooting. I even tried entering the settings manually, which gave me a different error message. Can't connect to your network hardware using a static IP address.</p>
<p>I want to provide as much information as I can so I did a ipconfig /all in Command Prompt on my Windows 7 laptop and this is what it shows:</p>

<p>So just to verify, I am connecting my laptop to my xbox via ethernet cable. I have enabled Internet Connection Sharing on my Wireless Network Connection on the laptop. If I set the Xbox settings to automatic, it receives an IP address that starts with 169
 and says it can't obtain an IP address from the router. If I try entering the settings manually, it says it can't connect to the network hardware using a static IP address. I may not have entered the settings in correctly since it gets really confusing. Once
 again, it worked automatically before adding the desktop computer to the network.</p>
I hope you can assist me with this major issue. Thank you!

            I can confirm that Internet Connection Sharing is set up correctly but it is not working. I still get an IP address that starts with 169.

            Thank you for the suggestion. It was set up to use an IP address that started with 169. Once I set it to automatic and then went back to see it it said 192.168.137.1 so I tried connecting to Xbox LIVE anyways but it didn't work and 169.254.247.124 was
 the IP address the Xbox was given. So I went in and put it to 192.168.0.1 and it still did the same thing.

<p>Hi U EnV Mee,</p>
<p>Modems commonly attach themselves to a single MAC address and won't let go without a power cycle. So try the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>With the XBox turned off, a</span>ttach the modem to the Xbox</li><li>Remove the power from the modem for 60 seconds </li><li>Attach the power to the modem and wait 3 minutes (to give time for the modem to make a connection with the ISP)</li><li>Turn on the Xbox and test the internet connection </li></ol>
<div>Let me know if this helps!</div>

            <p><span>Hi davidlamont,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you receive any error message, by chance?
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do the other USB devices function fine without any issues?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these methods:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Open the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</a> to run the automated troubleshooting services and see if that does the trick.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>Disable and re-enable USB controllers and see if that does the trick.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Use Device Manager to disable and re-enable all the USB controllers. This lets the controllers recover the USB port from
 its unresponsive condition. The USB controllers represent the USB ports in Device Manager.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>To disable and re-enable the USB controllers, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Device-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Open Device Manager</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Expand<b> Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>.
</span></p>
<p>
<b><span><br />
Note</span></b><span> You might have to scroll down the list to find this item.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click the first USB controller under
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>, and then click <b>Uninstall</b> to remove it.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Repeat the above step for each USB controller that is listed under
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer. After the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan for hardware changes and reinstall all the USB controllers that you uninstalled.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, Id suggest you to update the device drivers on your computer from the manufacturers website.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more information on updating drivers,
</span><span>see </span>

<h2>            cmd.exe Raster Font 8x12 is missing </h2>
                    8x12 is a default raster font under CMD<br />
<br />
Suddenly after launching cmd.exe it was really small. I changed its size using Properties available from the top-left corner of window, but...<br />
<br />
There is no longer Raster Font 8 x 12<br />
<br />
How can I restore it?

<h2>            Own video screen has disappeared from Skype for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Just upgraded to Skype for Windows 10 and the option to see your own video screen during a video call has vanished. I also don't see anywhere how to change this. Now during a video call I have no idea if the other persons actually sees me or the ceiling...</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to change this?</p>
<p>I'm really tired of these constant changes to skype without considering the basics...</p>

</p><p>You should still be able to see your own video during a video call on Skype for Windows 10. The video of yourself will be displayed&nbsp;in a small window on the bottom right part of the Application. If you are not seeing it during a video call, there must be
 something wrong with the Application. Please try to uninstall and reinstall your Skype Application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persist after uninstalling and reinstalling, kindly&nbsp;reply to this thread. Thank you!</p>

            <p>I had somebody to get the USB 2.0 version when it came out for a Toshiba laptop.&nbsp; It did work pretty good but do watch it with the built in ATI video chipset in the docking station.&nbsp; If you see any 'glitches' on the screen, unhook the docking station.&nbsp; His
 particular docking station did an electrical feedback to the laptop and ruined the laptop.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Other than that, it worked great.&nbsp; You do know that they make a wireless version as well?&nbsp; You don't hook up anything except install the software suite for it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Toshiba model was well built and would expect that the USB 3.0 will be better and since you will have an ATI video card built into it, you don't have to put up with Intel!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you prefer a wireless model, do a web search for "wireless docking stations" and don't be surprised to find some of them for around $40.&nbsp; Those might be super-cheap models though.&nbsp; With the wireless model (any of them), all you have to do is turn on the
 tablet within range of the transceiver and 'BINGO', it connects.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the make and model of the laptop?</p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you use any other key after using shift key?</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to contact the laptop manufacture support and check with the setting regarding the hibernation functions. Check to see if there is any function
 associated with the key. You can get&nbsp;more information from the manufacturer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>However if you want to disable the hibernation function you can refer to the Kb article:</span></p>
<p><b>How to
disable and re-enable hibernation on a computer

<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/920730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/920730</a></b></p>
<p><b>Warning</b>&nbsp;You may lose data if you make hibernation unavailable if a power loss occurs while the hybrid sleep setting&nbsp;is turned on. When you make hibernation unavailable,
 hybrid sleep does not work.</p>

<h2>            Unable to access internet connection with error&#58; &#34;Windows could not automatically detect this networks proxy settings&#34; after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have previously been a window 7 professional user, but came back to my PC a few days ago to see it had automatically updated to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the update, the internet (only through this Computer) appears to be experiencing a number of issues. It's being incredibly slow, web pages are failing to load 50%+ of the time, things like youtube will barely work, updates won't download. I assume
 it must be linked to the update as everything worked fine before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The troubleshoot against internet connections comes back with the error 'Windows could not automatically detect this networks proxy settings" (which again, I assume has something to do with it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried; </p>
<p>- Uninstalling and re-installing the wireless card</p>
<p>- Removing my original anti-virus </p>
<p>- Resetting the IP via command prompt </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to stick with Windows 10 now I have upgraded, but I simply cannot use my Computer at the moment. Can anyone help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Many Thanks</p>

<p><span>Thank you for getting back to me.</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried the steps mentioned and still experiencing the same problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I am connected to the network via wireless &amp; using Qualcomm Atheros AR5008X'. I have uninstalled &amp; reinstalled with the latest drives / reset several times.</span></p>
<p><span>The Proxy settings within internet options and firefox are all as they should be.</span></p>
<p><span>I have ran through the steps on why cant I connect to a network and there is no fix either. I am able to connect to my network, its just incredibly slow.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other solutions?</p>
