            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />Solution 1: Use CMD.
<br />0- Note that the following 3 steps are going to terminate your explorer.exe process, so your desktop and all of windows explorer open folders and any other related process would be terminated.
<br />1- Run Task Manager. ( by pressing ctrl + shift + esc or etc)
<br />2- Go to Processes tab.
<br />3- Find "explorer.exe" and click "end process" button. If you find more than one explorer.exe, kill them all.
<br />4- Now, click the file menu -&gt; New Task (Run...)
<br />5- Type CMD and click OK.
<br />6- Now you can do any thing that you couldn't did before with this UI. Some useful commands :
<br />- cd : Changes the current directory. Use "CD .." to do the "Up Button" in windows explorer.
<br />- dir : Lists the existing file and folders in current directory. Use "dir /p" to list it in pages.
<br />- del [File Name] : Deletes the existing [File Name] file in the current directory.
<br />- rename [Old File Name] [New File Name] : Renames the existing [Old File Name] file or directory existing in the current directory to [New File Name].
<br />
<br />Solution 2: Use another file manager.
<br />0- Install and execute another file manager like "XYPlore".
<br />1- Note that the following 3 steps are going to terminate your explorer.exe process, so your desktop and all of windows explorer open folders and any other related process would be terminated.
<br />2- Run Task Manager. ( by pressing ctrl + shift + esc or etc)
<br />3- Go to Processes tab.
<br />4- Find "explorer.exe" and click "end process" button. If you find more than one explorer.exe, kill them all.
<br />5- Use XYPlore UI and do what ever you want.
<br />Please note that the problem could happen with this kind of external explorers too. So close any file and go to a safe directory after your work.
<br />
<br />Solution 3: Do it your self!
<br />If you can program, there are some codes that could help you. These codes that Im talking about, will tell MS Windows to delete your annoying pinned files just before shutting down the system.
<br />Here is a sample one:
<br />MoveFileEx('C:\windows\system32\ld21E.tmp',nil,MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING or MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT);
<br />This code will work properly in Borland Delphi Compilers, and as you can see, the file "ld21e.tmp" will be removed after compiling this code and restarting your windows.
<br />

 move from that spot the only way I can get it to move freely again to press (control alt delete) and logoff which forces fsx to l Close and then log back on. still happening even sense I uninstalled all the programs I Reinstalled? Has anybody else had this
 problem, and can anybody help me?&nbsp;&nbsp; heres what ive tried, ive since added JOYSTICKS=1 from my [CONTROLS] section. ive cut/pasted and deleted my FSX.CFG from %APPDATA%\Microsoft\FSX and fsx did not create a new one. ive reinstalled my mouse drivers. ive uninstalled
 FS2crew. ive tried unplugging all my Saitek stuff. ive tried moving my yoke around and it does not affect the movement of your mouse. ive tried three different mouses, one wired and two wireless. and ive tried Starting up the machine from power off without

<h2>            Why are the Automatic Updates not installed automatically&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've&nbsp; just found out from my other PC that there are Updates today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;came back to my new one, checked for Updates and yes there were updates available. The message was along the lines "we'll schedule this for two days time at night when your PC is not busy". I clicked 'Scan Now' - it ignored me and the same when I tried
 again. So I switched it off and only then did the Updates started installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't Automatically Update mean just that? And why did Microsoft want to delay the downloading and installation?</p>

<h2>            Error code 0x80070426 from Store</h2>
                    I have an Aspire Acer laptop (purchased in June 2013), Windows 8,&nbsp;and get this error code 0x80070426 each time I try to download another app. I haven't always gotten this message but have no idea what changed. I have tried the Modern App troubleshooter,
 and resetting the store cache, but neither fixed it. I see there are a few more things I can try, but something tells me those tricks are not going to work for me. Thank you for any help you can offer!

I suspect it means you will have to try to find out more information about your symptom--unless someone knows
<strong>what</strong> "service has not been started".&nbsp;&nbsp; One would think that the repair procedures that you did would have noticed such a discrepancy and fixed it--if it had an obvious association with your problem symptom.<br />

            That was the most useless piece of information that someone can give. Most people who use a computer don't know how to do what you did. I took networking classes and still don't know what you meant or how you did it.

<p>The content of that message, which is the only possible thing that can be inferred from that code, is a generic message, referring to "the service".&nbsp;&nbsp; You would need to get some supplementary information from somewhere else, such as a log message produced
 by the repair procedure, to proceed further in a diagnosis.&nbsp; However, a more complete way for generating supplementary information is to run ProcMon when you try reproducing your symptom or redoing the repair procedure.&nbsp; Tip: you could try getting a handle
 on what diagnostics were being produced in either case by using a filter which specified:&nbsp; Operation Is WriteFile and then examining the related Path field.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>BTW I'm not familiar with either the Store service or its repair.&nbsp; I was just adding information and answering the question about the code.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are interested in trying to do your own diagnosis I am willing to try helping you that way, otherwise you
 also will have to wait for someone to fill in the necessary details and explain why the designed repair procedure is deficient.&nbsp; FWIW my guess would be that it will be a permissions problem but that too would be exposed by running ProcMon, if it is not already
 documented somehow, somewhere, such as in the procedures' log files.</p>

<h2>            Publishing in windows movie maker stops </h2>
                    i made a video, it is lengthy about 20min but i don't see how that is a problem, anyway since i can't "save as" anything but a movie maker project file, i tried publishing it, and no matter what folder i publish to or whatever setting i put it on, it stops
 at 43% and then the estimated time it will take increases indeffinitly (got up to 266 once)<br />
<br />
someone help me either publish it or find another way to convert it to wmv because this video is awesome and i don't want to lose it or not be able to share it with people.

            Hello Lord of Gingers,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting.&nbsp; It seems that you may have one of two problems.&nbsp; Either you don't have enough hard drive space for the conversion process and final converted video or your power saving options are turning off your hard drives.&nbsp; Let's try checking both
 of those by seeing if you have enough available hard drive space for the conversion process &amp; final video, and changing you power saving options.&nbsp; I've included a link to guide you on how to change your power settings here
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935799" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935799</a>&nbsp;or by following the directions listing below.<br />
<br />
<br />
To change an existing plan
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click to open Power Options.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <span>Select a power plan</span> page, click
<span>Change plan settings</span> under the plan that you want to change.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <span>Change settings for the plan</span> page, choose the display and sleep settings that you want to use when your computer is running on battery and when it's plugged in.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you don't want to change any more settings, click <span>
Save changes</span>.</p>
<p>-or-</p>
<p>To change additional power settings, click <span>Change advanced power settings</span>, and then complete steps 5 and 6.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <span>Advanced settings</span> tab, expand the category that you want to customize, expand each setting that you want to change, and then choose the values that you want to use when your computer is running on battery and
 when it's plugged in.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Click <span>OK</span>, and then click <span>
Save changes</span>.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me know if this helps you<br />

    <title>AccountNname and sethc.exe Application - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            AccountNname and sethc.exe Application</h2>
                    <p><font><font color="#000000"><font>I have two user accounts under Windows 7, recently upgraded from Vista. I have no idea what happened but we, my wife and I, lost access to both accounts.
 Our passwords do not work anymore. So I tried to find some help from Microsoft Support. They don‚Äôt help to get passwords back. So I decide to find help from some communities and I solve this problem. Now we can access our accounts and we learned a lesson:
 never more use password under Windows 7.</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Ok, but I did something wrong and now the application Sethc.exe doesn‚Äôt work in my wife‚Äôs account. And in my account I can‚Äôt copy back this file because
 the access is denied!</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>What I did‚Ä¶</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>I was in my wife‚Äôs login when I did boot off the Windows disk and I selected the ‚ÄúRepair your computer‚Äù option.</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>In Command Prompt I did:</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>copy c:\windows\system32\sethc.exe c:\</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>copy c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe c:\windows\system32\sethc.exe</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>After that I did hit the Shift key 5 times, in the administrator mode command prompt I wrote exactly the same who was helping me ‚Äúnet user geek mynewpassword‚Äù.
 As you can see below.</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>C:\windows\system32\net user geek mynewpassword</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>But I didn‚Äôt realize that ‚Äúgeek‚Äù was his account name (user name) and, in my case,&nbsp;I should put my wife‚Äôs name in that.</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>So, I tried to login in my wife‚Äôs account and it didn‚Äôt work. So I went to my login and just did the last step and my command was ‚Äúnet user arthur mynewpassword‚Äù.
 I got access to my account and I, as an administrator, deleted both passwords. We can‚Äôt trust in passwords under Windows 7 anymore.</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Was my wife‚Äôs account name changed inside the Windows? How can I fix the sethc.exe in both accounts?</font></font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Thanks!</font></font></font></p>

            Sethc.exe is the tool that invokes the Windows disability mode so that users can press key combinations such as Ctrl+A successively rather than simultaneously. It has no effect whatsoever on user accounts and passwords. However, when replacing it with
 cmd.exe you get a "backdoor" command prompt that allows you to change passwords or create new accounts. The backdoor is opened when tapping a Shift key five times.

<p>File and Printer Sharing still work fine. There are tips that show all the updates and how to use them. It will come up when Edge opens. Also see this--</p>

            Actually thank goodness they finally got rid of HomeGroup! It was an unnecessary boat anchor for sharing files and printers. You could already use the built in fire sharing which thankfully is still there.

            Nevermind retards, I've found the problem. You intentionally did not install an important feature which can actually be added manually by going to control panel-&gt; programs&amp;features and then Turn WIndows features on/off. You need to install (mark) SMB 1.0/CIF
 and voala...everythings works as before... stupid developers.

</blockquote>
<p>I am going to be honest and factual here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the 1st version of 10, there has been an issue of PC's and devices NOT showing in the Network folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now on version 1803, and having updated about 40 PC's in the last 4 days and setting up networks on some, there is also now an issue connecting to other PC's and devices. This has been the case in over 1/2 of them. They either will not connect or they do
 and then do not a minute later. This is separate from missing icons in network folder as You can create shortcuts to other PC's in the network if they are missing in the network folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the SMB 1.0/cif, ON,&nbsp;this has only worked for me in 4 days&nbsp;5 times on a PC to display all PC's and devices in the network folder. Also, it is interesting that all 5 that it did work was PC's, (NOT LAPTOPS), that were older and the OS was a BIOS Install
 and not an EUFI Install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, after v1803 update, even on a public network, you need to turn back ON in settings&gt;&gt;network &amp; Internet&gt;&gt;sharing Options</p>
<p>Turn&nbsp;"ON" in PUBLIC&gt;&gt;Network discovery and you should also</p>
<p>Turn&nbsp;"OFF" Password sharing for your private home network. As this setting is for your private home network even though it is listed in Public network.</p>

<p>I can no longer connect to my other two computers on my private network. The computers do not show up in network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>how can I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to say, 1803 has ben a disaster for me and some other things have disappeared in updating.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>1) What is the error message that you get?</p>
<p>2) Do you remember making any changes to the computer prior the issue</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us try the following methods and see if they can help.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disable the security software temporarily</strong></p>
<p>You may also temporarily disable security software‚Äôs and check if the issue persists. Make sure to enable those security software's on the computer after checking.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</a></p>

<p>If disabling the security software resolves the issue then, please contact the specific security software manufacturer to resolve the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you are done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Follow steps provided in the following Knowledge Base Article and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>Yes I noticed the adapter folder showing as empty as well. The only possible solution that I haven't managed to test yet is reverting back to Win8 (Settings&gt;Restore) uninstalling Cisco VPN Client (if you have that installed) and then reinstall windows 10.</p>
<p>

            <p>Yes it did, I now have Win10 running pretty much flawlessly! People have mentioned that Cisco has a newer VPN client, which I think is called Cisco All Access which works with Win10. I haven't read much into though since I only used it to connect to the
 university, but I've left now.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I just did a quick search and it's called Cisco Any Connect. I'd try it on windows 8 first to make sure it's compatable

<p>
</p><p>I have also managed to get win10 working by:</p>
<p>1) deleting the following reg key: </p>
<p><span>HKCR\CLSID\{988248f3-a1ad-49bf-9170-676cbbc36ba3}</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then running the following from admin cmd:
</span><span>netcfg -v -u dni_dne</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet to check my VPN client, but I think ill look into replacing it (hopefully it has some level of legacy compatibility!</p>

            <p>I have a similar issue with my WIFI since the upgrade no connections visible or limited connections when it did connect it dropped out straight away. I don't use vpn also I have updated to latest drivers which this did after a recovery reset. The only way
 I have been able to keep a constant connection is have a permanent connection to the mains, if I disconnect the charger the WIFI will drop out within 5 minutes or less if I'm lucky. I have a HP pavilion&nbsp;DV6 &nbsp;laptop with a intel centrino wireless -n 2230 card

            <p>My Issue was with Bit Defender (Anti Virus) Firewall settings. Once I figured this out I resolved my wifi issues after upgrading to Windows 10. Stealth Mode must be set to off under the adapter settings for the wifi (or Ethernet) setting.</p>

<h2>            Window Movie Maker - This project contains source files that are missing or that have been modified after import...</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting the following error when trying to save a movie in Window Movie Maker:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This project contains source files that are missing or that have been modified after import. Your project cannot be saved as a movie until the source files have been located or deleted from the project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 7 and Movie Maker 6.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my videos are AVI or WMV format, my pictures are all JPG or PNG, my music files are WAV. &nbsp;I have tried deleting the whole timeline, apart from a few title overlays and the problem persists, even when there are no source files on the timeline. I have
 plenty of space on my hardrive and the movie maker saved another (significantly smaller) project as a movie just moments before I tried to do this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            Change themes back to numbered tiles in Microsoft Mahjong</h2>
                    3 days ago my user profile became corrupted in my still very powerful 6-year old computer.&nbsp; It would not allow me to log in (even though I had the proper User ID and PW).&nbsp; I had to create a new user profile, which ultimately lead to me having to do a factory
 restore to the computer.&nbsp; Now when I load Microsoft Mahjong, I get the option of just the 4 themes (Underwater, Tranquility, Cosmos, and Autumn Glade).&nbsp; Before my user profile became corrupted, the theme I had was standard English numbers on the tiles, along
 with a few tiles that had jellyfish looking characters and a few other graphical ones.&nbsp; But mostly numerical.&nbsp; How can I get back to the numerical tiles I had before?&nbsp; I've checked every menu and I do not see that option.

<h2>            Changing billing-related communication preferences</h2>
                    
<p>Whenever I purchase something on my Xbox 360, I get an email sent to every email address that was ever tied to my gamertag. This means that the email goes to my current address and then CCs three of my other email addresses, too. How can I stop this? I'd
 like purchase confirmation emails and everything else go just to my current email address/Live ID.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

here</a>. Check this to make sure it is your most current email address.<br />
<br />
Also, are you sure that your email client isn't auto-forwarding those emails to the other accounts? Are these accounts ones that you use regularly, or can you ignore them?<br />
<br />
If you believe there is a glitch with your email settings, I would call up phone support to see about getting them to look into your account.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I've been using my (warranty replaced) Surface for about 2 months. Since new I have used the&nbsp;"Automatically pick an accent color from background" feature in themes, in combination with DisplayFusion Pro 9.1 managing my background (I wouldn't necessarily
 need to use DF if Windows themes would let you set the same background on 2 monitors, but that's another issue). I have the background set to change every 30 min.</p>

</p><p>Two days ago I un-docked my Surface, went to a meeting, and about 30 min later I re-docked at my desk. I noticed the Start Menu, Taskbar and folder titles had reverted to Windows default blue. On the "Colors" menu, the "Automatically pick an accent color
 from background" box was checked, as was the box for Windows blue. I unchecked and checked the "picker" box and the blue box. Nothing. So I restarted and that fixed it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday morning when I got in, when I woke up my Surface, "Automatically pick an accent color from background" had stopped working again. I checked and unchecked the "picker" box, restarted, changed backgrounds. Nothing. While the Start menu was not working,
 folder title bars were...or so I thought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I had time so I did some troubleshooting. When I change from Picture to Slideshow, the&nbsp;"Automatically pick an accent color from background" works - it chooses a color from one of the two images on my 2 monitors and applies it correctly. However,
 I also noticed that now when I change back to Picture, the Start Menu and Taskbars change to Windows blue, but folder title bars revert to a grey color it had chosen from a background two days ago. If you manually set the color, the Start Menu, Taskbar, and
 folders titles all change. Checking the&nbsp;"Automatically pick an accent color from background" box, the Start Menu and Taskbar go to blue, the folder titles got to that certain grey.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This small, unimportant issue is driving me crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And before the MS chuckleheads recommend updating/patching etc, I did that just prior to posting here. I'm on the brand spanking newest version with the latest updates as of this posting. And no, I'm not willing to try the nuclear option (reinstalling Windows)
 first thing out of the gate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone here ever experience this issue? Anyone able to shed light on how to fix it? Anyone at MS know why this setting randomly decided to go rogue?</p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some cases, if the wallpaper transition animation fails for some reason, the color change will not happen.&nbsp; As a&nbsp; workaround, unticking "<strong>Animate controls and elements inside windows</strong>" option at the top of the Performance Options control
 panel may help in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, answering the following questions may help us in resolving the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Aside from un-docking your Surface, were there any changes made on your computer?</li><li>Have you tried creating a temporary user profile to isolate the issue?</li><li>Have you tried performing a clean boot to check if the issue is caused by a startup program or a third-party software?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have clarifications.</p>

<p>Hi Darian,</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion about the Performance Options (they don't make that easy to find do they?). I unchecked it, changed wallpapers, and the colors automatically changed. I ticked the box back on and it is still working.</p>
<p>

<p>1. Not that I am aware of</p>
<p>2. No</p>

            Hey Tony. Dolby Digital Plus has been known to work after uninstalling the Conexant Audio driver so follow my directions: 
<br />
<br />Go into device manager with Win + X &gt; Device manager 
<br />
<br />Go to audio drivers drop down and uninstall Conexant Audio driver 
<br />
<br />Restart your PC and let Windows find a new version itself and install then. 
<br />
<br />Restart your PC after the driver is installed 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps       
        </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 KB890830 kills wifi on HP Pavilion &#34;We couldn&#39;t find wireless devices on this PC.&#34;</h2>
                    Malicious Software Removal Tool KB890830 installed successfully today, 23/12/15, (and previously on 12/12/15, apparently the same version, also successfully...) and promptly interrupted my activities to Configure the PC.&nbsp; It appeared to complete OK, but
 upon restarting, the wifi was not working.&nbsp; Connecting an ethernet cable, I was able to get on-line, but in settings, searching for wifi returned the reply "We couldn't find wireless devices on this PC."&nbsp; Toggling between Flight Mode On and Off, or the F12
 key itself, still causes the LED to be orange, on key F12.
<p>I allowed cumulative update KB3124200 to install, again seemingly without a problem, but I'm still left with a non-functional wifi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would try uninstalling these latest updates, but only the cumulative update is listed as something I can choose to uninstall, and KB890830 is not listed as something I can uninstall, so if anyone else can suggest another remedy, to allow me to move forward,
 I'd love to hear from you.</p>

            <p>Hi Deepika,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying, and explaining about the Malicious Software Removal Tool.&nbsp; I have now overcome the problem by reinstalling the Wireless Drivers, using the HP Driver Update utility, after a whole slew of other efforts, including a tedious and ineffective
 rewind to a restore point.&nbsp; I wish I knew the cause of the problem; and it may not be the MSRT, it just became the subject of my suspicion as it was listed as the only update that had occurred today, when the wifi had been working fine, then one oddly forceful
 restart to "Configure the PC" and my wifi was out of action.&nbsp; Perhaps HP are to blame.&nbsp; Either way, that's five hours of my life I won't get back, and a few minutes of your time, too.&nbsp; Hopefully, someone else can learn the quicker way to fix this, if they
 have the same symptom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone reading this and wondering if they have got a corrupted driver, rather than dead hardware, then on the HP laptop, at power-up, tap F2, then select Component Test, and Device-Network, to check that the wifi device is good.&nbsp; If so, try the HP Driver
 Update utility.</p>

<p>Windows performs many tasks at night, including backup jobs, degragmenting hard drives, and more. &nbsp;These are typically the root cause of the wakeups.</p>
<p>You can begin troubleshooting by opening an elevated command prompt* and typing
<strong>powercfg /lastwake</strong>&nbsp;to see what woke up the computer last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*To open an elevated command prompt, type <strong>cmd</strong>&nbsp;into your start Menu, then press Ctrl-Shift-Enter.</p>

            <p>I found a solution!&nbsp; I installed Windows Live Mail 2012 onto my Windows 8 machine.&nbsp; Set up very easily with both my POP account and my IMAP account.&nbsp; And Live Mail is a great email program.&nbsp; Has several nice features AND allows me to "zoom in" on received
 emails using CTRL+.</p>

<h2>            Screen Saver&#47;Desktop&#47;Screen Saver</h2>
                    <p><strong>When I do no entries from the keyboard for a chosen time the screen saver comes on and will run until I move my mouse or touch a key on the key board. If I move the mouse or touch a key on the keyboard the screen saver will stop and the screen will
 display anything that was on the screen before the time had expired between touching a key on the keyboard or moving the mouse. I have started running Windows 10 ver. 1730 and moving the mouse or striking a key on the keyboard will no longer turn the screen
 saver off, &nbsp;The only way I can get the screen saver to stop is to unplug the computer (there is no other way to turn it off) and restarting the computer by plugging it back in. &nbsp;I have found that I can stop the screen saver by hitting CTL- ALT - Delete and
 when a new screen comes up click on Cancel and I am back to the desktop. &nbsp;I can no longer get back to the desktop by moving the mouse or striking a key on the keyboard. &nbsp;Is there anyone beside me that is experiencing this? Please respond here.</strong></p>

            That answer totally disables the screen saver. &nbsp; Duh !&nbsp; Ever since the last update, my screen saver is doing what the first question was about.&nbsp; Turning off the screen saver is a sorry answer.&nbsp; When I set my screen saver to "Photos", it works correctly,
 but when I choose "Slide Show", that's when the computer will not "wake up" when I touch a key or move the mouse.&nbsp; I have to shut down &amp; restart to get my normal screen back&nbsp; I really liked the way the "slide show" displayed my pictures verses the "photo"
 option.&nbsp; Fix this please ! ! !

            I have a screen saver that I have used with Microsoft 1995,Microsoft XP, Microsoft Vista, M.S. 7, &nbsp;M.S. &nbsp;8 and Windows 10 versions of O.S. without ever having a glitch or any other problem until my computer accepted upgrade to Windows 10 Version 1703.
 &nbsp;I can run the Screen Saver but I have to enter CTL/ALT/Delete and then CANCEL the screen that comes up after that. &nbsp;Of the list of Screen Savers listed with Ver 1703 only 3 will work with moving the mouse or striking a key on the keyboard. &nbsp;Instead of that
 version being and upgrade it is a step backward. &nbsp;That is not the only thing I don't like about Ver.1703. &nbsp;I tell my friends to not download that can of worms.
