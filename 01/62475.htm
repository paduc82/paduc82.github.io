    <title>PC going to sleep instead of shutting down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cagross1184  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC going to sleep instead of shutting down</h2>
                    <p>Hi all. When I shut down Windows (Win 7 64-bit), my computer does not shut down, but goes into some sort of sleep mode. &nbsp;Can anyone help me troubleshoot this further? &nbsp;Here are the symptoms. &nbsp;When I press Start--&gt;Shut down, Windows goes through the normal
 shut down process: &nbsp;blue "Shutting down" screen, then the monitor enters a state of no display received. &nbsp;But system components continue to receive power. &nbsp;Here is a list of those components :<br />
<br />
--both internal fans (cpu fan and rear case fan)<br />
--front LED light on the case (next to power button)<br />
--orange light next to onboard NIC<br />
--CD drive<br />
<br />
Furthermore, pressing the restart button brings the computer back to boot, where it goes through the POST process again.<br />
<br />
Normally when I shut down and get to this sleep state, I switch off the PSU via the rear switch. On the next boot, Windows never complains about being unable to shut down properly.<br />
</p>
<p>When I boot to safe mode and shut down from there, Windows freezes at the blue "Shutting down..." screen. &nbsp;But when I perform a hard power down (switch power off from the rear of the PSU), then power on again, Windows does *not* complain about not being
 shut down properly--Windows boots normally without issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Event viewer does not display any errors or warnings during these events.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked taskbar--&gt;properties--&gt;start menu--&gt;power button action and it is set to Shut down. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I have also tried to isolate any hardware issues, by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have checked that all cables on the motherboard are seated properly.</li><li>I have tried isolating all components by bringing in and testing a new GPU, new RAM, and new hard drive. &nbsp;</li><li>I have tried a very simple system configuration, with a single stick of RAM, a single, simple GPU, hard drive, and PSU.</li></ul>
<p><br />
Here are the relevant components:<br />
</p>
<p>Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-P67A-UD3-B3<br />
Case: Cooler Master Force 500M<br />
PSU: Stronger SPSN-070P</p>
<p><br />
This is a fresh install of Win 7.<br />
</p>
<p>This certainly looks like a software issue, but I am out of ideas on how to troubleshoot. &nbsp;Any advice for further troubleshooting would be helpful.</p>
<p />

            <p>Thank you for the reply. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried switching my power plans, but the issue remained. &nbsp;I actually did not try creating a new one. &nbsp;I will try that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the graphic card driver--why do you think that would be the cause of my symptoms? &nbsp;I'm not doubting you--I'm just curious for my own edification. &nbsp;Anyway, video driver was already up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an update though. &nbsp;I upgraded to Windows 10, and the issue remains. &nbsp;It is actually worse now. &nbsp;When I shut down, the computer goes to sleep for about 5 seconds, then boots up again. &nbsp;I cannot get it to shut down. &nbsp;I haven't tried a command line shut
 down (can I try that?). &nbsp;This is a new issue--one that was not present in Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I cannot put the computer into sleep mode. &nbsp;When I do so, the computer immediately wakes up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what else I can try. &nbsp;Are there any Windows logs I can review?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>d) If this issue still occurs after you disable one device, disable the devices in this list one by one until you determine which device is causing the issue. If you want to re-enable a device to wake the computer,

<p><span><span>Hi ggonzalez88,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows Vista by default does not give you an option to switch between Multiple Monitors at a push of a button. However, certain
 computer come with hotkeys configured to switch between monitors like your Laptop.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This also depends on your graphics options. Some of the graphics options allow you to configure hot keys to switch between
 monitor. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Like I tried reproducing this on my computer and I could configure switching between dual monitors with the buttons I wanted.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You should first try to look for these options from your graphics properties.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right
 click on an empty space on your desktop and click on ‚ÄòGraphics properties.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Check
 if you can find any options for ‚ÄòHot keys‚Äô.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If your graphics properties and your graphics card do not support this, then your option would be to use some third party
 software that helps you configure and customize the dual monitor options. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third
 Party Software is at your own risk. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To play a Blu‚Äëray Disc, you need to use a non-Microsoft program that supports Blu‚Äëray playback and a device capable of reading Blu‚Äëray Discs.</p>

<h2>            Screenshot with Vista Home Basic</h2>
                    I need to find out how to take a screenshot with my Vista Home Basic. The Microsoft info page says "Take a screen capture (print screen). Applies to all editions of Windows Vista. To copy the entire screen:<br />
<br />
Press PRINT SCREEN."<br />
<br />
I can tell you this does not work. <br />
<br />
What is the secret?<br />

<div>It took me forever to figure this out myself, lol.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
After pressing the "PrintScreen" button, open MS Paint, go to the edit menu, and choose "Paste". The collected screen capture should paste in, and can now be saved as a jpg or png file.

<div>If it still doesn't work, it is possible that a third-party program has hijacked the button for its own purposes.</div>

    <title>Notification on mandatory upgrade to Skype 8. Multiple chat - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlosperez68  say:</h3>
<h2>            Notification on mandatory upgrade to Skype 8. Multiple chat windows&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have received a notification on the mandatory upgrade to Skype 8 soon (Nov 2018).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rejected upgrading because my first experience with Skype 8 was terrible. It was a ****, unusable product... with lack of basic features such as multiple (simultaneous, split...) chat windows.</p>
<p>Obviously, everybody, including the Skype/MS developers must agree on that a product without such a basic functionality is of no value...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simple question, before upgrading to Skype 8:</p>
<p>Is multiple chat window support already available in Skype 8? or is MS forcing their users to migrate to a competence product?</p>

    <title>Disc Read Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> juxtapose13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disc Read Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>A while ago my Xbox 360's disc drive started having disc read issues.&nbsp; Should the drive fail completely this will be my third console to go due to disc drive issues, so I do know what to expect and am posting here in case someone else has a suggestion I
 may not have thought of.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problem Description</span></p>

<p>The issue began a few months back and every so often, when I'd place a disc in the tray and close the tray, it would fail to read and simply display "Open Tray" on the Dashboard.&nbsp; Re-opening and re-closing the tray would resolve the problem, and again, this
 was intermittent (happening every few weeks).</p>

<p>About a week ago, it began happening every time, and last night, I had to re-open and re-close the tray twice to get it to recognize the disc.</p>

<p>I have an Xbox 360 Pro console (original model) with a 120 GB HDD and Wireless Networking Adapter attached.&nbsp; On occasion, I have a Sandisk Xbox 360 8 GB USB Flashdrive in one of the front USB ports.</p>


<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Troubleshooting Steps Already Tried</span></p>

<p>- I've tried different game discs.&nbsp; Thus far the issue has occurred with <em>Halo 3: ODST</em>,
<em>Gears of War 3</em>, <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, and possibly <em>Halo 4</em>.</p>
<p>- I've inspected the discs and confirmed that they are not dirty, scratched, or damaged.</p>
<p>- I've removed my USB Flashdrive, power cycled, and tried again.</p>
<p>- I've followed the steps in the Xbox Disc Drive Solution Support Article <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/disc-drive/disc-drive-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>- I've confirmed all my game discs are the correct region.</p>
<p>- Over the last few months, I've cleared my System Cache multiple times.</p>

<p>Later today, I'll try a movie DVD just to see.</p>

<p>My expectation is that the drive will ultimately fail (be it in a few days to months) and I'll either need to send the console to Xbox Support or replace it with a new unit, but again, just want to see if anyone else has any other suggestions.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello Juxtapose13,</p>
<p>I think that your CD-reader is damaged (maybe some lens), so if you already tried those troubleshooting steps i think you should contact the xbox phone support and ask for a repair.</p>

<p>Just to update, I tried with a basic movie DVD (Big Fish) and it worked fine no issues.</p>
<p>Since Xbox 360 games are on a DVD, I thought they'd read the same. &nbsp;Any difference (excluding the extra lair DVD's newer games come on)?</p>

<p>Hmmm... in order to do that though I'd need to remove the current System Update, which I'd need the button combination from Xbox Support to do.&nbsp; I'll call and inquire when the drive gets worse.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>So my Xbox 360 Pro console's DVD drive is getting worse. Last night I played some Mass Effect 3 with a buddy, and it took exactly seven tries of ejecting and closing the tray for it to recognize the game disc.</p>
<p>This morning though, it detected my Halo 4 Disc 1 first try.</p>
<p>Anyway, I called Xbox Support and confirmed my console is no longer under warranty, so basically, when it truly dies, I've confirmed with them that I have two options:</p>
<p>1) I can set up a Service Order with Xbox Support, which will cost me about $100.00 and ship it in. Xbox Support will send me another refurbished console (my fourth), and while I'm generally fine with this process as I've done it enough before, the console
 will only come with a three month warranty. That's not a lot, and I very much recall refurbished consoles from Xbox Support used to come with a one year warranty.</p>
<p>2) I can go buy a new Xbox 360 S console at retail, running me about $299.99 + HST.</p>
<p>Is there anyone here using a refurbished console from Xbox Support that they got within the last year? If so, have you had any issues with it?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Thought I'd update this thread to let you all know my DVD drive appears to have been fixed. &nbsp;How did I fixed it? &nbsp;I watched some movies.</p>
<p>No joke. &nbsp;I picked up The Dark Knight Trilogy a few weeks back and watched Batman: Begins, and after that the DVD drive starting reading game discs reliably again. &nbsp;It was reading everything first try save for once, where it took two tries.</p>
<p>The following weekend I watched The Dark Knight and my DVD drive has read game discs flawlessly since.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of is since I always install my games, the drive hasn't had much of a work out in years and it either needed one or there was some dust or something stuck on the laser and the constant disc reading for a few hours dislodged it.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
        </p>

<p>I just purchased a new Magic Jack Plus and tried to install it on my computer.&nbsp; Everything goes through fine, except I can't make any calls.&nbsp; There is a dial tone, but when the number is dialed, the dial tone comes back on.&nbsp; I have tried the Magic Jack Plus
 and the phone on another computer running Windows XP and it works fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; It just seems to have problems on this 2012 Emachine with Windows 7 Home edition on it!&nbsp; Does any one have any answers.&nbsp; I have uninstalled and re-installed the magic jack, tried different
 USB plugs to no avail.&nbsp; I am ready to chuck the computer and WINDOWS 7 out the window!!</p>

</p><p><span><span>Is it happening to all contacts or to a specific one? Can you try to uninstall Skype again but this time, make sure to clear cache and data before installing Skype again. Do not forget to reboot your device too, before reinstallation.</span></span></p>

<p>Gente, n√£o consigo entrar na Live, antes de ontem eu jogava tranquilamente na Live, ontem eu fui tentar jogar e aparecia para Testar a Conex√£o , at√© ai tudo bem , mas ele n√£o conectava nem na Rede, ou seja, o problema n√£o era a Internet por si pr√≥pria ,
 at√© pq eu jogava com cabo mas hj eu botei no meu quarto pra ficar mais perto do wifi &nbsp;e mesmo assim n√£o funciona, o sinal do wifi √© √≥timo no xbox mas mesmo assim, aparece sempre O Teste Falhou , j√° tentei todo o suporte do site , mudar o IP mas de nada adiantava,
 ent√£o cheguei a conclus√£o que a internet por ambos os jeitos (com cabo ou sem cabo) n√£o eram problema, eu consigo mexer suave no computador e no Ipod pela internet menos no xbox, estou com medo por estar banido , mas se fosse realmente banido eles teriam mandado
 um aviso. Me ajudem por favor ,</p>

            Hi Balakrishnan, I think this is related to a recent Windows Update - it has not been kind to graphics card drivers !!
<br />
<br />You should go to the support page for your drive on the Dell website, then download and install the Graphics drivers they recommend . . .

    <title>Double tap to left click and drag on trackpad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eve&#8234;coder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Double tap to left click and drag on trackpad</h2>
                    Hello, I was trying to find a way to click and drag by using the Type Cover 2 trackpad without keeping the left mouse button pressed. Most touchpads nowadays register a rapid double click as a "left click and drag" command and, according to
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/touchpad-a-builtin-mouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the documentation on Microsoft's website</a>, the Type Cover 2 should as well. However, I tried to use the feature both in Desktop programs and UI apps with no success. How to left click and drag without keeping the trackpad's left mouse button pressed?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Edit: called the customer service, and I was told that the team is aware of the issue and that a fix is planned.</div>
                </div>

            With 8.1 update 1, type/touch cover 2 can now perform double tap-drag. All hail lord Microsoft.

    <title>Nothing Happens when I click Change Settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jadonballinger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nothing Happens when I click Change Settings</h2>
                    I would like to Allow an app through Windows Firewall but when I click Change Settings nothing happens, it doesn't ask for my password or anything.
<div>I've looked a lot of places and found no answers :/</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT: I have figured it out! This should work for almost everyone on Windows 8 (Maybe on others)</div>
<div>On the bottom right of your screen click the arrow pointing up, then click customize, on the top of the window that should appear click the "All Control Panel Items" then click Administrative Tools, Find and click "Windows Firewall with Advanced Security"
 (For me its near the bottom of list.) on the left click on Inbound Rules and find the app you want to allow then RIGHT click it, click properties, and change from Block The connection to Allow The Connection.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>:) Hope this helped&nbsp;</div>
