<h2>            Why can&#39;t I go on www.imvu.com anymore&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've tried resetting my computer entirely and reinstalling everything, I haven't changed any settings or anything. But when I try to go onto www.imvu.com it tells me "The page cannot be displayed because an internal server error has occurred." I'm using
 Google Chrome and it was working earlier, but now every time I try it comes up with that message and it's really making me frustrated because I don't know how to fix it or what happened or why it does that. I've tried uninstalling everything and reinstalling,
 but it still doesn't work, even when I use Internet Explorer. But I'd like to know how to fix it on my Google Chrome so I can use the site please?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please confirm are you able to access all other websites through Internet explorer ?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to disable any security program on your computer and check if it resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>After checking for the issue you need to re-enable the security program on your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is a potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security software after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the
 issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Second the issue may be caused due to a corrupted add-on in Internet Explorer. To confirm the same, run Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode and check if the issue persists.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>To open Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode,&nbsp;</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click the Start button, click All Programs.<br />
b. Click Accessories.<br />
c. Click System Tools.<br />
d. Then click Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</span></p>
<p><span>If disabling all add-ons solves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will allow you to figure out which add-on is causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Delete the corrupted add-on and restart Internet Explorer normally and check if the issue reappears.
</span></p>
<p><span>After you have used this process to determine which add-on is causing errors, you can disable that add-on. Or, you can uninstall the software that installs the add-on. We also recommend that you contact the software vendor that provided the add-on
 for additional troubleshooting and support. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Refer:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Internet Explorer add-ons: frequently asked questions</span></strong><strong><span><br />

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong></p>
<div>
<p><span>If the above method does not fix the issue, then I would suggest you to perform Internet Explorer Optimization on your computer and check for the issue.<br />

<strong><span>Disclaimer</span></strong>: The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control
 settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try these steps and let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            KB4025342 causing extremely long boot time</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed update KB4025342 automatically through Windows Update on July 12. Noticed extremely long boot up times of the order of 10 mins for a laptop that normally gets to desktop in under 1 min. Repeatedly happened over several shut downs and boot ups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I uninstalled the update and PC is back to normal. Again, have done several shut downs and boot ups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like this KB4025342 is the culprit. Wonder if anyone knows how to report this and what I should do now? Wait for different cumulative update or try installing again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Skype for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have several problems with the new skype version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I can't change my status to online, offline, etc...<br />
My name is not shown next to my profile picture?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>, I can't change my status to online, offline, etc...<br />
My name is not shown next to my profile picture?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>Please be advised that with the new Skype, there is no option to change your status to&nbsp;<strong>offline</strong>. You can change your presence status in
<strong>Active, Do not Disturb&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>Do not show my presence.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>I can't add people to my contact list?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>To add a new contact,&nbsp;<strong>search for a contact </strong>
&gt; <strong>send a message </strong>and by <strong>default </strong>the system will send a friend request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>I can't change my username? </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>It is not possible to change Skype Name/ID or user name. If you need a new one, you need to create a new account.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>In general, ROM operates much more slowly than RAM. Because hardware code is typically stored in ROM, performance can suffer each time hardware code is executed. Performance can be improved by copying code in the slow
 ROMs into RAM, and executing the code from RAM instead. The RAM that contains the copied code is called<strong> "shadow RAM."</strong> Although RAM shadowing can dramatically improve performance, it uses some additional RAM, which is then no longer available
 to applications.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Many BIOS ( Basic Input/Output System) allow RAM shadowing to be disabled. (The method for doing this varies from computer to computer; you may refer to the user manual of your computer, or contact the OEM.) The usual reason
 for disabling shadow RAM is to reclaim extended memory for use by other programs. It should only be done as a last resort, because disabling shadow RAM usually slows down a computer noticeably. (Some lower-quality computers may slow down so much that they
 become nearly unusable.) Because of the cost in performance, in most cases,shadow RAM should be left enabled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope the information is helpful.</span></p>

    <title>Surface Pen model 1776&#58; eraser button doesn&#39;t work after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> go2kevin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pen model 1776&#58; eraser button doesn&#39;t work after reboot</h2>
                    <p>Every feature of the pen works immediately after being added to my bluetooth profile.&nbsp; However, the next time I bootup the Surface the eraser button stops responding.&nbsp; The button is communicating with the Surface, as is evident when pressing it while on
 the Bluetooth device setup screen.&nbsp; I have followed every help/troubleshoot protocol that MS has, but nothing brings it back.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remove the pen from my Surface BT profile, reboot the Surface and then reinstall the pen, it works until the next time the Surface is rebooted.&nbsp; This is the second model 1776 (flat edge, no clip) that I have had in 3 weeks.&nbsp; I returned the first one
 because I thought it was a pen problem.&nbsp; Now, I am convinced that it is a software problem between the pen and the programming options.&nbsp; My pen eraser is programmed to open the Windows Ink Workspace on the first click.&nbsp; That and the other programmed setting
 cease to work after the Surface 6 is rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please update the software to fix this issue before I return my pen to MS for a refund.&nbsp; Feb. 20 '19</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be experiencing this issue due to compatibility conflicts or a corrupted user profile. To troubleshoot this issue, we suggest that you use the
<em>System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</em> and the <em>Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM.exe)
</em>to check and repair your Windows installation. For the steps on how to use these tools, kindly refer to the following link:
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">
System file check (SFC) Scan and Repair System Files &amp; DISM to fix things SFC cannot</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to experience file permission issues, we recommend that you download and run
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17590/automatically-diagnose-and-repair-windows-file-and-folder-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the File and Folder troubleshooter</a>. This tool diagnoses and repairs Windows file and folder problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you may refer to the following link to determine if your computer is compatible with the latest Windows 10 update:

<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we suggest that you perform an in-place upgrade instead of reinstalling Windows. By performing an in-place upgrade, you will clean up the system which may help resolve some&nbsp;troubles with the system. You may refer to the following article
 for steps on how to do it: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-an-in-place-upgrade-with-windows-10/7f0b236e-3c6c-4913-9691-c4baa2a6190a">

<p>Hi Gino Des&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">- SFC and DISM didn't do anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">I wonder if they ever helped anyone. In all my many, many problems I had with windows, they never helped.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">- The File and Folder troubleshooter found some seemingly unrelated issues, but secretly set all my changes to folder security-tabs back to normal: I am, again, unable to extract zips into "programs files", for example. I'll have to
 take ownership of program folder again. (Interestingly, nobody has write-rights according to the security tab. Not "ThrustedBinstaller" nor System, or any users/admins)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">- The Windows 10 compatibility checklist appears to be total nonsense: First, It doesn't show the hardware manufacturer of my Laptop at all - implying it isn't compatible - although there's no problems what-so-ever with their new laptops/notebooks
 getting shipped with Windows 10. And second: A simple list of incompatible Hardware would be way more sensible. And I mean "hardware" in the sense of "Hardware IDs", like "Pentium III" and not like "That yellowed PC in your in your attic you forgot to throw
 away-Corporation".</p>
<p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">This stupid checklist bears no information and is most unhelpful, even deceptive! It's not even a "check"list, wth?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">- I'm pretty sure the in-place upgrade will change all my group-policy and registry settings I had to do in order to stop windows from installing ONE faulty driver! THERE SHOULD BE AN EASIER WAY! I HAVE BOUGHT THE "PROFESSIONAL" VERSION
 AFTER ALL, THINKING IT WOULD ALSO TREAT ME AS A PROFESSIONAL, FFS!!</p>
<p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">So. It appears as if some problems with starting programs are gone. Before, some just crashed on start with weird errors, as if they don't expect this to ever happen to them. (&lt;--Important information!) But I haven't installed new programs
 yet.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">Yet I have the same folder-rights problems. What could cause this? Should I reformat to FAT32 to get rid of this bug- oh I mean: feature? (joke)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">I re-enabled UAC, btw.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">Anyway... Do you have any more Ideas, Sir?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">What do you even mean by:&nbsp;compatibility conflicts? I don't think any tool I ran checked for this.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">What do you mean by: corrupted user profile? I don't think any tool I ran checked for this, too.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">If it is a "corrupted user profile" Wouldn't the obvious fix be to make a new one and copy all the important data over? Or to use the "Administrator" profile and check if the same problems are apparent there? (Why is it even deactivated
 when you buy a professional version of Windows- or, why why is there still the need to go through net user to activate it and not a simple checkbox in settings, if it is such a professional version?)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(204, 204, 204, 1)">But maybe you meant "corrupted system profile"? But then I wonder how that is even possible? What could destroy the "System" or "ThrustedBinstaller"-profiles? Are the profiles even more than a list of different security settings for
 files and folders, for the sake of tidiness and debugging? Do you know?</p>

<h2>            Black screen before login screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently experienced a problem with Windows 10. Whenever I select Windows 10 (I have dual-boot configuration, the other OS is Ubuntu), it normally boots and I hear the startup sound. I also see the mouse indicator and I can sometimes control it, yet
 the screen is completely black. I neither see login page, nor keyboard combinations (Ctrl+Alt+Del) works. All I can do is forcibly shut down the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is due to some driver issues, particularly AMD Radeon HD 7400M Series (I have also integrated graphics card driver, Intel(R) HD Graphics 3000). Maybe the problem is with the graphics card itself, since I have exactly the same problem with Ubuntu.
 Consequently, I am only able to boot into safe mode in Windows 10 and recovery mode in Ubuntu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, the situation is rather bizarre, since I have been using the computer with the same hardware and drivers for seven years without such problems. For your information, I installed the latest feature update (October 2018) on January 2019 and this
 strange problem occurred on March 2019.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I have added below some information from the reliability monitor:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/408cfe90-25a5-44b6-917f-72a6f27069f3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/408cfe90-25a5-44b6-917f-72a6f27069f3?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9bf19a7e-dc63-4d02-95de-cff93296e1c1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9bf19a7e-dc63-4d02-95de-cff93296e1c1?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27dea045-f2f9-4e23-906d-f076ac8445ed?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27dea045-f2f9-4e23-906d-f076ac8445ed?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e028673b-2c9a-4c59-aacb-1ea4534081f5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer no

            Hi Aorist6 
<br />
<br />When your system boots up, it will, by default use your Intel HD Graphics 3000 graphics and I think that is the problem . . .
<br />
<br />Version 1803 and 1809 of Windows 10 does not support the 3000 or 4000 series of Intel HD Graphics
<br />
<br />Possibly, to get your system stable, you would probably have to revert to version 1703 of Windows 10 . . .       
        </p>

<p>I am having the same problem. But I think you are misunderstanding the problem here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Graphics card: Radeon HD 7400M</p>
<p>Working driver: AMD Catalyst 15.7</p>
<p>Broken driver: AMD Catalyst 15.7.1</p>
<p>Possibly working driver: AMD Catalyst 15.11.1 beta</p>
<p>
</p><p>AMD website offers the driver Catalyst-15.7.1 but that version is buggy and causes the longer time to boot. By removing all AMD software (as administrator) and removing AMD Radeon HD 7400M driver and manually installing the catalyst 15.7 driver the problem
 is solved until Windows 10 automagically forces the driver to upgrade to 15.7.1 version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried disabling the automatic driver upgrade but I was not successful. And reverting the driver in Device Managament does not work as expected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To restore driver I have to remove again the driver and AMD software and manually reinstall the 15.7 driver by picking it from location (C:\AMD\AMD-Catalyst-15.7-Win10-64bit\Packages\Drivers").<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>The real problem is that Windows 10 is forcing a driver upgrade to a broken version!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been experimenting with driver "AMD Catalyst 15.11.1 beta" and it seems to be working fine. I recommend you try it.</p>

            <p>So I was sort of OC-ing. I have a Asus p8b75-v MBO, witch suports (4 x DIMM, Max. 32GB, DDR3 2200(O.C.)/2133(O.C.)/2000(O.C.)/1866(O.C.)/1600/1333/1066 MHz Non-ECC, Un-buffered Memory
<br />
Dual Channel Memory Architecture ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my 1600 MHz memory was always running on 1333 MHz, so a few months agoe (before upgrading from w7 to w10) i switched it to run in 1600 MHz, and it was stable on&nbsp; W7. That was the last change on this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after your post&nbsp;I de-OC it back to 1333 MHz. And it didnt help I just got a BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So tomorow i'll try Driver Verifier. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>But I don't think it is kaspersky, maybe I'll try to skip kaspersky in next Driver verifier run. to see if anything else is the problem. On the other hand it could be KIS, because last few bsods happened while i was opening a wep page in new tab. Other previous
 BSOD-s I didn't see. I was AFK.</p>

    <title>How to login with Microsoft Account to Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertolopes  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to login with Microsoft Account to Windows 8</h2>
                    I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 8 Pro while within Windows 7 with the option to keep apps, account, etc<br />
The installation process went smoothly and finally Windows 8.<br />
<div>The problems started when the login prompt showed up - it showed a username and when I tried to use the password to which I used to login to Windows 7 it wasn't working as well as to all @live.com, @outlook.com and @gmail.com accounts I have - nothing
 worked</div>
<div>Luckily in the first setup time they then allowed to login via Microsoft Account - username@<br />
I logged in with *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and got in. I installed some apps via Microsoft Store and after installing some other apps I was asked to restart the laptop.<br />
I restarted the laptop... but now only that initial username is there (I can't login again with *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) and I don't know how can I login to the computer. How can I login via @outlook.com or @live.com to my Windows 8 as I did as a backup in the
 first setup attempt?</div>

            <p>Hi RobertoLopes,</p>
<p>When you get the screen to log into the account, do you see a "back" arrow (pointing to the left) next to the User name/picture?</p>
<p>If so, click that back arrow and it should then show you the other User profiles available to log into.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Skype Account password recovery redirects to Microsoft Account password recovery</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that my Skype has been hacked (a link was sent to all of my contacts) but I can't change the password as changing the password directs me to&nbsp;Microsoft Account password recovery. How can I change my Skype password that is
<strong>not linked</strong> to my hotmail account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;"<span>I have both a Microsoft account and a Skype account which&nbsp;</span><span>are not linked</span><span>&nbsp;despite being registered to the same email address. I tried to link them today using
 the Skype Windows 10 app, but could not recall my Skype password. I went to the password recovery page, entered my email and pressed "Send email" so I would receive a recovery code, but was instead redirected to the Microsoft account password recovery for
 my microsoft account. What do I need to do to get back into my skype account so I can link my accounts?"</span></p>

<p>Hi Vivek,</p>
<p>

 Forwarding Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Call Forwarding Settings menu, under&nbsp;<strong>Your current call forwarding settings</strong>, click the link next to&nbsp;<strong>Unanswered calls will go to</strong>.</li><li>Choose the phone number you want the call to go to. For example,&nbsp;<strong>Voice Mail</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>New Number or Contact</strong>. You need to select the number instead of the voice mail.
</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;to go back to the&nbsp;<strong>Skype for Business ‚Äì Options &gt; Call Forwarding</strong>&nbsp;window.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Punish your boy and tell him to NEVER make purchases again without allowance.. And I doubt you can get the money back because your son would've payed for the ROBLOX virtual currency known as robux and he as probably bought clothing and game passes with these robux so nor Microsoft or the ROBLOX team will be able to get the robux back because they are unable to take the bought items off his ROBLOX account.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also change the settings on your Xbox to make it require a passkey or your password when making a purchase!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Startup Sound does not play</h2>
                    <p>This Is not a new issue with Windows 10, BUT it is still a problem that I have and, it seems from all of the posts I have seen,&nbsp;many others have&nbsp;as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it was released, the Windows 10 Startup sound <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
will no</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><del>t</del></span> play after the initial load/update&nbsp;-- build be darned!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this something that is being addressed by Microsoft or is it an item that will never work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something that I or anyone else can do to apply a little pressure somewhere to get this fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do others who are experiencing this problem cope with this obvious lack of concern from Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your response and your opinion.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; However, the very issue that I am&nbsp;complaining about is&nbsp;the issue that is contained in your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter how or who reports this&nbsp;problem with the Win10 startup sound not playing, the answer is always that same------ check the box that says 'Play Windows Sounds On Start-up.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry, that does not&nbsp;solve the problem; it has never solved the problem, and Microsoft continues to offer it as the 'fix' for the no sound issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have applied&nbsp;every update of Windows 10; the problem persisted,&nbsp; I upgraded to Windows 10.1 and applied every update; the problem persisted.&nbsp; And, each and every time I or anyone else reports the problem or questions the status of the problem, the answer
 given is always 'check the box to play the startup sound!'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry, but there must be a solution that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can make the Windows 10 Startup Sound play by going into the Power Options (under Control Panel) and turning 'OFF' the fast start option.&nbsp; If I turn that option 'ON' there is no sound.&nbsp; I do not want to use the No fast start option because (in my case)
 it takes five times as long to start up the system.&nbsp;&nbsp; It should not take five times longer to initialize a system just to here a startup sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a solution?</p>

            <p>I want to thank you for your two responses to my problem.&nbsp; Neither of your suggestions corrected the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me re-state the problem again:&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows startup Sound does not play!</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can make it play by turning 'OFF'&nbsp;Windows Fast start&nbsp;on the Power Options selections, but that really, really slows down the startup process.&nbsp; If I turn 'ON' the Windows Fast Start Option, there is no startup sound.&nbsp; All I want is Windows Startup Sound
 and Fast Start to work together as they are supposed to work together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM -- IT GOES BACK TO WINDOWS 10 PRE-RELEASE.&nbsp; IT HAS BEEN REPORTED TIME AND AGAIN, AND IS STILL A PROBLEM RIGHT UP TO THE LATEST UPDATE TO WINDOWS 10.1.&nbsp; EACH TIME IT IS REPORTED THE ANSWER IS THE SAME ONE THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO ME.&nbsp;
 THAT ANSWER DOES NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM.</p>

            <div>I must be a real thorn in your side, but I want to state again that this problem persists on ANY Win 10 or Win 10.1 system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It has been around since the late Beta-days of Windows 10.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It has been reported by many others from the Microsoft community.&nbsp; Every time is has been reported the same answers that I am being given are being given to the others who reported on this issue.&nbsp; And, like me, those others try all of the Microsoft suggestions
 and still end up with NO SUGGESTION or NO CORRECTION that fixes the problem.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It must be a Microsoft 'glitch' since&nbsp;it <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
always</span> works if you are not in Fast Start mode and it <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
never</span> works if you are in Fast Start mode --- this is true for any system that I have access to whether up-to-date with the latest drivers and all&nbsp;software updates or still at the initial release of Windows 10.&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I will suggest again that there must be a problem on the Microsoft Side of this issue that results in bypassing the Start up Sound when the Fast Start Flag is turned ON in&nbsp;Power Options.&nbsp; I know that I cannot change the Microsoft software to cause this
 to happen; I just hope that someone at Microsoft who can change the software will fix this&nbsp;problem.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I apologize for continuing to complain, but I truly feel my complaint is a real issue and it is being ignored by Microsoft.</div>

            Possibly a related issue - I had the Windows 10 welcome sound play partially (began, then silence).&nbsp; I noticed two "display adapters" appearing in the device manager (one was the motherboard chipset, the other was an NVIDIA card).&nbsp; The sound problem went
 away after I disabled the one for the motherboard chipset.&nbsp; Since the NVIDIA card participates in the sound processing, it may have been cut-off while the two "display adapters" fought over "who does what".

<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; However, the very issue that I am&nbsp;complaining about is&nbsp;the issue that is contained in your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter how or who reports this&nbsp;problem with the Win10 startup sound not playing, the answer is always that same------ check the box that says 'Play Windows Sounds On Start-up.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry, that does not&nbsp;solve the problem; it has never solved the problem, and Microsoft continues to offer it as the 'fix' for the no sound issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have applied&nbsp;every update of Windows 10; the problem persisted,&nbsp; I upgraded to Windows 10.1 and applied every update; the problem persisted.&nbsp; And, each and every time I or anyone else reports the problem or questions the status of the problem, the answer
 given is always 'check the box to play the startup sound!'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry, but there must be a solution that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can make the Windows 10 Startup Sound play by going into the Power Options (under Control Panel) and turning 'OFF' the fast start option.&nbsp; If I turn that option 'ON' there is no sound.&nbsp; I do not want to use the No fast start option because (in my case)
 it takes five times as long to start up the system.&nbsp;&nbsp; It should not take five times longer to initialize a system just to here a startup sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a solution?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Fast Startup option is a hybrid hibernate power state that when enabled does not actually exit Windows, so there is no Windows "startup" to play the Startup Sound. The article linked (may have to cut and paste) below will help to answer your questions
 and provides some solutions. The comments after the article may be helpful too. It was written for Windows 8 but will work for 10 also.

            Hi Ernest, please try this:
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center 
<br />
<br />Go to Virus &amp; threat protection - Virus &amp; threat protection settings 
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access 
<br />
<br />Temporarily turn off Controlled Folder Access and check to see if you can save to those locations 
<br />
<br />If so, from there, you can add an app to the list of safe or allowed apps to prevent them from being blocked 
<br />
<br />Please do not leave Controlled Folder Access turned off permanently

<h2>            How do I transfer Windows 10 to new SSD from Hard Drive inside Dell Inspiron 5548 upgraded from windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I need to make a clean install of Windows 10 on a new 2.5" intel 256 gb SSD</p>
<p>I have an usb HDD external adapter.</p>
<p>Is there a way to install Windows 10 on the new SSD connected to the external adapter, Boot the PC on the SSD and later activate Windows with the activation key from the original HDD?
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'</p>

            Not sure what your problem is - either log on to Skydrive and retrieve files as you need them, or download the Skydrive app and they will all be downloaded at one time.

<h2>            Microsoft Flight Simulator 9 doesn&#39;t run on my Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Recently installed FS9 on my windows 8.1 computer. The game gets installed without problems, both in 'normal' mode and&nbsp;custom mode. When I try to run it however, it doesn't run. Just nothing happens. The Compatibility tool&nbsp;made sure that it runs as administrator,
 but trying to run it in XP mode or any other compatibility mode (Vista, 7, 8) doesn't make it run. There's nothing in task manager other than two background&nbsp;processes to indicate that the program is running at all, but they run for a split second, so I don't
 know how they're called or what they are. Flight simulator as a program never appears. Of course, the game did work on my previous XP laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-installed with the following options: Express, Custom full install and Custom compact install. Nothing works. Any suggestions on how to solve this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Microsoft stopped development after Flight Simulator X in 2006, which  meant kind of stopped at Windows Vista, but was still possible under Windows 7. Your best option is probably to setup a dual boot with an earlier version and play it there.

<h2>            How to monitor File History on Windows 8.1 &#47; 10 remotely&#63;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
We are using File History feature in Windows 8.1 and 10 on the machines. It's been working well.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Is there anyway from the administrator point of view (remotely) that can monitor this activity whether is running/updated or not via powershell or anything.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
At the moment, we only checked the last modified date in Config1.xml in the actual file history backup - {machine_name}/Configuration/Config1.xml. The way we do the File History is that we are backing up to remote device. If it's current date and time means
 ok.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I'm appreciated your feedback.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Thanks</p>
