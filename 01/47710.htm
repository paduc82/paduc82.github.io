In the computer, Open Xbox App.</li><li>Click on Connect in the left pane options.</li><li>Your PC will scan for available Xbox One consoles on your network. After the scan is complete, you should see MyXboxOne available on the list.</li><li>If your Xbox One isn‚Äôt automatically recognized, you‚Äôll see <em>Add a device window</em> and you‚Äôll be asked to enter your Xbox One‚Äôs IP address. To find your console‚Äôs IP address just go to
<strong>Settings &gt; Network &gt; Advanced Settings</strong> on your Xbox One.</li><li>Click the <strong>Connect</strong> button.</li><li>Now connect your <a href="http://windowsreport.com/xbox-one-controller-error-windows-8-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't need to pay for windows updates. It's free as always. And yes, it's recommended to install windows updates. Issue with installing printer software from HP has nothing to do with installing windows updates unless the windows update is about the
 HP printer driver that might interfere with the installation of your printer software but if not then you can install all the windows updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing printer software is supported by HP. They should be able to help you out with that. It's there scope of support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            My new xboxone takes between 5 and ten minutes to turn on</h2>
                    
<p>hi</p>
<p>I bought a xbox one three days ago due to it being on offer at tescos for 349.99 with titanfall. The problem is it wont switch on right away. The first time i took it out set it up it worked right away. Now when i try it dont work. I try first with the speech
 commands as i have it set on the first security setting which basicaly says it comes on as soon as you are in front of the connect. Yea right. So then i press the white button on my stick for ten seconds like i do with my 360. Nothing happens. so then i gently
 tap the white button on the consul it makes the tinkle noise but nothing happens. i try again nothing happens. Meantime my tv screen is telling me "no signal" then after about 5 mins of this my tv tells me oi think there is a signal i wait patiently. but then
 thirty seconds later it goes back to telling me there is no signal. So here i am im pleading to the conect "please xbox on" "xbox active" "xbox do somthing" while every 20 40 seconds or so trying the consul button trying the stick button wayving my hands.
 So anyway after trying the consul button another 5 times or so all of a sudden it comes on. This has happened every time apart from the first time. Oh and i even try inserting disks and ejecting them that works the drive spins ect but it still wont come on.
 Here is the thing if this continues over easter then first thing tuesday morning i will taking it back to tesco and buying ¬£349.99 worth of ps4 games. You see that cossul has worked properly since the day i got it no troublw whats so ever. In fact when i was
 unpacking it i swear to god it was purring like a content kitten unlike the xbox one which felt like i was holding a ice cold slab of black brick. Ive looked at all conections. ive reset all thats resetable. I even took it all apart (leads ect not the consul
 its self) and put it together as if first time still not comming on. Ive checkedonline i found other relations to this type of problems but they seem mostly to be power pack fault i am thinking given the light on my power pack is white during this wait for
 it to switch on thats not the problem. Any takers and please serious takers none of that have you tried dancing naked to singing in the rain in a bowl of water while whistling dixe nonesence.</p>

<p>First of all the console should not come on just by standing in front of it and waving.</p>
<p>That feature is for signing in.</p>
<p>And the "Xbox On" voice command only works if the console is in Instant on mode.</p>
<p>If the console is in energy saving mode it will take longer to switch on. Maybe about a minute but during that time there is an xbox logo on the screen and the power button on the console will be white.</p>
<p>Is the power button white when you switch it on or does it just go dark again after being on for a second?</p>
<p>Also have you tried a different HDMI cable just to make sure the problem isn't the fact that the screen is blank due to a faulty cable?</p>

<p>I know standing and waving does not do anything i am amused that u took that seriously. My xbox one is indeed on instant on. And no the white light of the xbox symbol on the front of the xbox does not come on white not even for a second. well not untill
 it does finaly turn on. It does however make the tinkle noise. Has for it being a faulty cable then all the more reason to take it back and get my money back i am not forking out futher for this machine. specialy it being brand new the cable should not be
 faulty. Oh hang on a min we are talking microsoft here given there past track record it just may well be but then that is simply further evidence to get rid. To be honest i dont want to i believe in about 8 to 12 months time when developers have got used to
 what it does or can do then were all in for a treat but i will not put myself through what i did with the 360. Three times i had to send that machine back through one fault or another and all there own doing (or they wouldnt have extended everyones warrity
 to cover the faults) by there own admision. Further i have tried the HDMI cable in the three other HDMI slots on my tv no change there. &nbsp;have a friend who is bringing his own cable from his own xboxone this evening tried and working so i will update acordingly.</p>

<h2>            Videos folder set to user profile, can&#39;t get it back</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>this might sound silly, but I was playing around the location of Videos, Music, Pictures etc... and I wanted them to redirect them from C://user//my user to a D://myvideos folder. At first I thought changing Location creates folder in a given path, but it
 ties directly to a given folder, and as I was putting my Videos folder back, I accidentally set it to C://user//myuser instead of C://user//myuser//Videos and I can't redirect it from here anymore because some of the hidden files are seemed to be tied to it
 now and I always get error whenever I try to redirect Videos location from my profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to redirect location of Videos from my profile, everything works fine but cosmetically it looks terrible and I would like to put it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully I won't have to reinstall system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jakub</p>

            HiJakub,
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Click View and make sure 'Address Bar' is turned on
<br />
<br />Paste this into the Address Bar at the top and hit Enter
<br />
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
<br />
<br />Double click 'My Video'
<br />
<br />In the resulting dialog, set its Value Data to : %USERPROFILE%\Videos
<br />
<br />Then click OK and close the Registry Editor and restart your PC
<br />
<br />That will put your video library folder back into its original location
<br />
<br />You will have to manually move any folders back into that Videos folder . . .

<p>Well my mistake, Fix It 50123 does not work, and yes did you tell me to follow the instructions at
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><u>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982</u></strong></a>&nbsp;but not which to choose!</p>
<p>Now you tell method 2?&nbsp;The statement&nbsp;I have repeated as stated that ONLY if&nbsp;the said Net.Framework is not successfully installed, then it is applicable. This does not applies&nbsp;to me! Would you show me who or which url addresses that have solved the problems
 exactly like mine. I can not go round round&nbsp;your "guinea pig" experiments to feedback to you&nbsp;with many trial errors.</p>

Dear sir,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have forgotten or misread at here my first threads;</p>
<p>"At "Program and Features", I did repair to Microsoft.Net Framework 4 Client Profile Maintenace and it will also repair together with Microsoft.Net Framework 4 Client Extended. Reboot, it still did not solve the problems. dated 20 July 2012"!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done it and repeated many times and still it is NOT solved! Then what to do next?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advice me professionally asap with confident. Thank you.</p>

Dear Sir,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reviewing all your questions. I find that it is not solving any problem.&nbsp;After the answers given to you,&nbsp;you will blame all third parties as per above No.9 to11 except Microsoft&nbsp;as per your above No.5 to 8 (Net.Framework)!&nbsp;And you also blame all the
 antiviruses No.3 and 4! Any one to pick from by you happily and then accused them that corrupt the said Net.Framework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please open your mind wide plus wide!. Please answer all the problems in your forums and other url addresses&nbsp;about the said Net.Framework 4. I did not find anyone url address/es that is solved. If yes, then you can start the roll of questions to blame other
 than microsoft! I just asking a simple question "How to solve it and NOT asking irrelevant questions by you?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I ask for your concise answers.What proof I like to know that the above said "your blames" of third parties antiviruses, fixes, cleaners, registry,quik book, Turbo tax, etc....... seem no end to what you want!? What is your purpose than to&nbsp;find a
 solution on Net.Framework 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please say here what has been <strong><u>SOLVED!</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please don't make me run round the christmas tree looking for presents with you when the season is still far away!</p>

<h2>            windows 10 install on portable hard drive</h2>
                    Is there a way that I could download a version of windows 10 and install it on my portable hard drive as a trial or test before I buy the OS and find out my PC cannot run it or something weird like that happens? i know that you can put the real version
 on a portable HDD, but I want to make sure i can get it to work first.

            Hi ryuunga,
<br />
<br />Windows itself will not boot from an external hard drive. It is only when you install Windows, you can then create a Windows to go Flash Drive
<br />
<br />What you could do is temporarily partition your hard drive and install Windows 10 onto that to test it out . . .

 use numbers on top of my key broad but it's easier for my to use the number pad. I am at my last straw and just want to have my number pad off of the toggle key setting.&nbsp;

<h2>            Console not staying on</h2>
                    <p>we just purchased a new cord and power bank from Microsoft for our Xbox one (original Xbox one). It was dead before with the old cord&nbsp;but worked with my parents cord. With this new cord and power bank, the light on it goes white than orange. The power on the console stays in for a few seconds and then shuts off. Did we get a bad cord or is it something else?</p>

    <title>Undo New Folder Complete WTF Happened to My Files&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> telekinatis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Undo New Folder Complete WTF Happened to My Files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I got some files/photos off my phone and put them into a New Folder. As I went to copy over other files some said replace and gave no other option but to skip or replace and no way to verify if the ones I replaced would be the same ones, but I figured they
 must be so I did that. Now on a normal transfer you get the Undo Move option - why the hell wasn't it there? Looking for it I accidentally clicked Undo New Folder and discovered to my absolute horror that ALL my photos disappeared - no recycle bin, no restoration
 to the phone, nada, zip, zilch. Now I would think that this would be something that SHOULD have not been an issue as it didn't even ask me if this was an action I wanted to do. So..... is this where I get told I can kiss my files/photos goodbye or will I actually
 get someone with some working knowledge who will actually help me find out where the hell these files went and help me retrieve them as I am struggling to understand WHY this is screw up is not yet fixed when - as I saw when I Googled it is a rather common
 occurrence. It makes me wonder when we can expect to see a lawsuit in suing for lost/damaged property that was the responsibility of Microsoft in their capacity to ensure their product works efficiently enough that screw ups like this don't happen and are
 FIXED and property restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question is - where the hell are my files and how can I get them back, because these were important and I want them back now.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Multiple Problems After Windows 10 Upgrade... Any fix possible&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spangledhoagies  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Problems After Windows 10 Upgrade... Any fix possible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The week after I upgraded to Windows 10 on my Lenovo z585, my graphic driver failed. To this day, while surfing Facebook, Youtube etc. the driver will crash. My screen will go black and start to flash repeatedly until i exit out of every running program.</p>
<p>Next went my internal wireless adapter. I opened my computer one day and couldn't connect. After countless hours searching for a solution and downloading various drivers, I took it to my local Microsoft store. The staff was friendly and they understood my
 concern completely. One staff member even explained to me that for some reason Lenovo computers have been having problems with the new Windows update. I left my laptop with the store and after a week I was called back and told that they couldn't fix it...
 The only thing they could tell me is to go buy an external wireless adapter (which i have been using for the past year). I would have liked to receive reimbursement for this.</p>
<p>The most recent problem (and the one that compelled me so much to finally post about it) is my bluetooth driver. Gone. Vanished. I attempted to download a driver off of Lenovo's site but just my luck, no driver update for Windows 10. I went and downloaded
 the most recent one anyway and it did not work. I know this may not be Microsoft's issue but this is to emphasize the fact that I have found NO solutions for my problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I feel as if Windows 10 has actually destroyed my computer, and I'm terrified that it will only get worse from here. Can anyone give me some reassuring words? I know millions of people are having problems and I KNOW that Microsoft is listening,
 but I refuse to shell out more money for this broken system. </p>

            The Lenovo z585 does not appear to be on any list of Lenovo devices that support upgrading to Windows 10. There is no reason to believe that device is compatible with Windows 10 or any of the resultant updates.&nbsp;You may want to work with Lenovo support
 concerning your issues. Or just reload the original OS and go on with life.

            If this is the case then why were the constant Windows alerts so adamant on getting me to upgrade? For a computer that comes with Windows already installed on it you would think that any update to the OS would be compatible. I would have reloaded the original
 if it wouldn't wipe out my entire hard drive. Thanks for your help though.<br />

            <p>It is always good to remember the OEM is responsible for support of devices with Windows preinstalled, not Microsoft. And the OEM is always responsible for hardware drivers. There have always been a percentage of devices incompatible with new Windows versions,
 because the OEM decides not to provide new hardware drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck with your choices, just remember they are always your choices, not someone else's.</p>
