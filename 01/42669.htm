    <title>Unable to read and problems sending emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> black darter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to read and problems sending emails</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone advise me in straightforward ways how I can resolve an issue with my emails which has only just occurred and could be my own fault!</p>
<p>My Live mail tells me that there are incoming messages waiting to be read but when I click on inbox nothing happens. All this has happened I think because I wasn't concentrating and tried to send an email with photo attachments without downsizing them to
 thumbnails and Windows told me that the email couldn't be sent. I've tried a system restore but that doesn't appear to have helped. I think I've found all my incoming emails by trial and error but I don't know if the offending email is still stuck somewhere
 as I can't locate it now. Maybe its been removed or deleted. Live mail tells me I'm working online and I have a wifi internet connection OK. Is there a fixit tool that I can use? Or, do I have to try to follow the various directions which I read about but
 which all seem to be very complex. I'm on Windows 7 on a 64 bit Hp laptop and my&nbsp;broadband provider is PlusNet. Any advice would&nbsp;be much appreciated. Gordon&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Dhenz S</p>
<p>Thanks for your quick response to my problem. I've tried to follow your advice but have immediately run into a problem so I need more help, please.</p>
<p>In the section 'To repair Windows Live Mail' &nbsp;I got to point 5 OK but got no further. Although the window is headed 'click uninstall, change or repair' all I get is a small box which says Uninstall/Change with no mention of repair. Also, when I click on
 the WLE icon&nbsp;at the bottom left nothing happens other than this small box appearing. In other words it doesn't uninstall or give the option to change and there is no mention of repair. I've tried to find repair options elsewhere without success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS I've now found that I can send and receive emails but that I can only access them by going into EDIT then FIND so that I can view them. Does that help or make it more difficult?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It sounds as if you have an unsent message stuck in the outbox. This can cause a logjam for both outgoing and incoming messages. Click
<em>Work offline</em>, then remove all messages from the outbox (below the account folders in the folder pane). When you've done so, compose a test message and send it to yourself. If you see an error message, click on it to select it, then use right-click
 to copy it and paste it into your reply here.</p>

            <p>!Firedog. Thanks for joining in.</p>
<p>I've done as you suggested and the following messages came up when I sent an email to myself. This was after clicking to go offline then clicking again to go online to send the message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Message 1. When you send an email message it will be placed in your Outbox folder ready to be sent the next time you choose the Sync command</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Message 2. You have unsent messages in your Outbox. Do you want to send them now? (answered Yes)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Message 3. You are currently working offline. Do you want to go online now? (answered Yes' though I had already cancelled the check mark in the 'working offline' box and it seemed to have reinstated itself!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Message 4. The processing of requested tasks was interrupted, Please review the list of errors below for more details:- TASKS - Check for new messages on Gordonwyse.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STATUS - Cancelled</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONNECTION - Local Area Network</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Outbox was showing as empty when I checked. After sending messages to myself I was able to access them only through 'Find'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this will give you a clue where my problem lies. Could it be the Sync command that's wrong?</p>

            I think it's more likely that Windows Live Mail is getting stuck in offline mode. This seems to happen on systems where (a) a third-party browser is installed (e.g. Google Chrome) and (b) Internet Explorer 10 is subsequently installed or updated. To check,
 open Internet Explorer and press Alt-F to open the <em>File </em>menu. Is <em>Work offline
</em>selected? If so, deselect it and try sending from Windows Live Mail again. It might take a few select/deselect cycles of
<em>Work offline</em> in IE to persuade Windows Live Mail to work online.<br />

            <p>Hi Firedog</p>
<p>Sorry, I've tried that but it wasn't showing as offline and I am online.</p>
<p>Problem is still with me after repeated tries following your suggestion. Regcurepro advertise tool to fix mail problems and I've tried that but it didn't make any difference.</p>
<p>Current position is that if I click on inbox, sent, deleted etc messages in Live mail nothing happens but I can access using Edit and Find.

            <p>Hi SimonPeter</p>
<p>Thanks for joining in. Yes it's very frustrating as I'm running out of things to try.</p>
<p>Your suggestion is one that I've already tried but I seem unable to uninstall WLE. Dhenz S suggested a similar route originally and you can see my response. I can't get to Step 4 in the instructions as I don't get the windows shown on the page in 'How to
 remove and reinstall WLE'. All I get if I click on WLE in Programs is a small box saying 'Uninstall/Change' and when I click on that nothing seems to happen. If I click on it again after the first time it tells me to wait whilst the program is uninstalled
 - but that never happens.</p>
<p>I can send and receive emails but access them only via 'Find'. I also seem to be in some other program -
<br />
Outlook, I think - which sends me receipts when messages are read by addressees. I tried to overcome the problem by enrolling into Messenger which transferred to Skype, but that didn't work so I uninstalled Skype. I think Outlook has some connection with this
 but don't think its causing the problem.</p>
<p>All I want is to be able to click onto inbox etc and see&nbsp;them open with all messages listed as I was able to do 7 days ago.</p>
<p>If you've any other ideas I'd be glad of your advice.</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>Gordon</p>

<p>original title: Help with Generic Bluetooth Adapter Error Message - Windows 7</p>
<p>Hello:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First time poster. My laptop runs Windows 7 Professional, 64 bit operating system.</p>
<p>I noticed an error message in the Devices and Printers area. There was a yellow caution sign&nbsp;with an exclamation mark. I right clicked and selected&nbsp;'troubleshoot'.</p>
<p>Tthe message was 'problem detected with generic bluetooth adapter'.The problem found was that the 'generic bluetooth adapter is not working properly'.</p>
<p>I also saw a message in the 'Device Status'&nbsp;area&nbsp;that said 'Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43).</p>
<p>The specifics were Device type: Bluetooth radio; Manufacturer: generic adapter and Location: Port_#0006. Hub_#0004.</p>
<p>I did try searching online for solutions</p>
<p>I tried 'update driver' and Microsfot says I have the most recent driver installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also looked under Control Panel, Hardware and Sound, Device Manager and see that under Bluetooth Radios there is an entry for Generic Bluetooth Adapter with a yellow caution sign. I have only had the laptop for a few weeks and it is new to me. I have not
 seen the error message previously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am looking for information concerning what to do to get rid of the yellow caution message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Dear Vinod,
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;I am sorry if I am posting at a wrong place, in fact I posted in a lot of forums to no yeild. I have exactly the same problem and my bluetooth suite stopped working after I updated it from the manufacturer's website.</div>
<div>&nbsp;Now, the biggest problem is that Windows would not allow even the manufacturer's driver software to run and close it with a message reading "The software removal you are attempting cannot proceed. To remove this software, please first be sure that Intel
 (R) wireless adapter is correctly installed and enabled".</div>
<div>&nbsp;I did uninstall the Generic Bluetooth Adapter from the Device Manager and it automatically installed the software on its own but it still does not run the Bluetooth.</div>
<div>&nbsp;Similar problem&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;with WiFi driver but it got fixed with Wireless LAN Half-mini driver re-installation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>How can I stop Windows from disabling a device on its own? Is there a way to enable the Bluetooth device and override the OS command of disabling due to error reporting? Any response will be highly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
Sorry if I were a&nbsp;botheration. My problem was solved by installing a driver I got from the vendor I bought my laptop from. Its not available on the manufacturer's website but I don't know how to upload or post it over the internet. It was an generic&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;driver
 and not any other propriety driver whatever they call it, thats why was it wasn't available on the manufacturer's website I guess. Hope it works for others if they receive an error like this.

<h2>            Windows System Image Restore</h2>
                    <p>
Using an HP Notebook with WIN 8.1.</p>
<p>
After installing some new software\drivers, my system was totally corrupted. I could not start the computer.</p>
<p>
I had to use an HP Recovery USB thumbdrive to get back into the computer. That sort of 'Recovery' takes me a long way back, so I lose all Data &amp; installed programs.</p>
<p>
Fortunately I have all of my Data backed up on an external HD only about 1 week old. So after some work I have my Data restored.</p>
<p>
However, also on that external HD I have a 1 week old System Image Backup. But Windows 'Recovery' doesn't allow me to access that Backup. Without that, I have the very big job of re-installing all of my programs.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
So - how do I get Windows Restore to allow me to choose a previous Image backup from my external HD?</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks Bill for your efforts - but you have not solved my problem.</p>
<p>I do weekly System Image Backups. The last one was 2016-05-15.</p>
<p>I've used 'Recovery' several times in the past to get me out of problems. I've always had the option to choose previous Backup\Restore Points. But right now in Windows 'Recovery' I can't find my&nbsp;System Image Backup of 2016-05-15, so I can't 'Recover' from
 that. Why can't Windows 'Recovery' recognize my external HD &amp; list the available&nbsp;System Image Backups on it?</p>
<p>For me that is an immediate &amp; critical issue.</p>

<p>Thanks Bill for your efforts - but you have not solved my problem.</p>
<p>I do weekly System Image Backups. The last one was 2016-05-15.</p>
<p>I've used 'Recovery' several times in the past to get me out of problems. I've always had the option to choose previous Backup\Restore Points. But right now in Windows 'Recovery' I can't find my&nbsp;System Image Backup of 2016-05-15, so I can't 'Recover' from
 that. Why can't Windows 'Recovery' recognize my external HD &amp; list the available&nbsp;System Image Backups on it?</p>
<p>For me that is an immediate &amp; critical issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have no idea what your options are in the "recovery" you are using.</p>
<p>But you said you are using HP's recovery media?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You boot from the installation Media and recover the System Image Backup.</p>
<p>And I am referring to Microsoft installation Media, not HP's</p>

            <p>​Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are facing this issue due to compatibility. It would be better to contact the printer manufacturer for further assistance. The driver software is programmed/created by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only option is to install the driver in compatibility mode once you get the driver software from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For reference, you may refer to the following Microsoft Help article.<br />

            <p>​Hi Robert,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand the you do not have driver setup. As I have mentioned in my previous response, I have asked you to check with the manufacturer for the driver setup. Drivers are programmed/designed by the hardware manufacturer not by the Windows. So it would
 be better to contact the printer manufacturer for further assistance with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue you are facing is with the hardware and driver compatibility. I have provided you information about it in my previous response. I am sorry for giving the incorrect hardware link, I was not able to find the hardware manufacturer website which you
 have mentioned in the original post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply with the exact name of the USB serial convertor manufacturer.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Unsupported Directory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryan freed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Unsupported Directory</h2>
                    My Windows 8.1 Pro won't let me just "upgrade" to Windows 10. It says it has to uninstall all programs and reset all settings. The installer says "You can't keep Windows settings, personal files, and apps because your current version might be installed
 in an unsupported directory." I would like to keep my settings and apps, but it's okay if I don't. But when I ran Windows 10 as a bootable ISO it said my key would not work and I checked it several times. It's a copy of Windows 8.1 I got from Dreamspark. I'm
 scared that if I clean install Windows 10 it won't keep my key.

<p>Actually, the machine is still the 1511 version, so the online update process just reinstalled the old version!</p>

            <p>I, too, am getting this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Windows 10 Pro v1511 from a USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I see that the Anniversary Update (1607) is not downloading through Windows Update, and attempting to use the media creation tool says Windows is not installed in the correct directory and I must do a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only place windows is installed on my PC is in C:\Windows&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This must be a pretty big bug in the Anniversary Update.</p>

            <p>I ran DISM (repairing from DVD), sfc /scannow, etc.&nbsp; These found errors and repaired them.&nbsp; Still, I cannot install the 1607 update after restart. All of my paths look correct in the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried installing the update from the Media Creation tool only.&nbsp; From downloading and trying to upgrade directly, and from building an ISO to install from.&nbsp; Both have failed with the:</p>
<p><strong>Windows may be installed in an unsupported directory</strong></p>

 broker' in task manger get spiked up consuming more than 70 percent of my cpu.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently i did a system restore and also un-installed antivirus.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also did this (as i got from some tech blog - but did not work)-&nbsp;</div>
<div>type or paste the following command:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore\AppxManifest.xml</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>hit Enter.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now in that same Administrator Command Prompt type or paste: start "" "ms-windows-store:"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also tried app troubleshooters from microsoft, but none of them worked.</div>

    <title>How to turn of autocorrect typing in Edge&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shinnokina  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to turn of autocorrect typing in Edge&#63;</h2>
                    Hi everyone! Since I tried Edge, it just makes me really irritated that when I type, it automatically makes some words Capital letters. (this Capital here is also autocorrected by Edge, I'm not going to go back and delete the Capital letter each time).
 I hate this. It's annoying especially when I type in languages other than English. Even in English, we don't capitalize nouns, that's a German rule. How do I turn this feature off?? I searched the support pages, nothing, I googled it, nothing. Any ways to
 stop this program rewriting my stuff? Thanks in advance!

            I think i got it, it's not about Edge but the whole win 10. Open Settings from the start menu, then go to devices. There you'll find a tab named Typing, fifth in the list for me, and the autocorrect feature is displayed there. If you switch the autocorrect
 off, edge will stop bugging your text (i actually wrote this in edge ;) ). Enjoy. :)

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>See my original post:&nbsp;http://community.skype.com/t5/Windows-desktop-client/How-do-I-disable-auto-correct-for-Skype-in-Windows-10/m-p/4079941#M361710</p>
<p>
</p><p>If for some reason the "<strong>Typing</strong>" tab in the settings is gone (It was for me) you can
<strong>unhide</strong> it through regedit.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Use regedit and search for the following value: "<strong>ShowAutoCorrection</strong>". Change the value to '<strong>1</strong>' and you should be able to access "<strong>Settings -&gt; Devices -&gt; Typing</strong>" to change your autocorrection
 settings.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>Restart</strong> your application, log in and out, or reboot your system to make the changes apparent. It worked for Skype at the very least for me.</p>

            Yeah, same problem with me as well. These autocorrects are getting out of control, capitalizing every I and correcting some words (from my native language) into correct English words, which is simply not fair and overwrites my initial intentions.

<h2>            Task Manager Problems</h2>
                    Hello, my Task Manager won't start. When I go to the Windows Defender I notice there is a task manager button, it says that the system administrator disable task manager, but that's not true, I never did. i have Windows vista and I did a scan and it still
 won't let me use task manager. Is there any tricks where I can get to Task Manager on my own? Please help.

            First make sure your computer is virus/malware-free since a disabled Task Manager is one of the symptoms of infection.<br />
<br />
Go through these general malware removal steps systematically - <a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a> <br />
<br />
If the computer is really clean, then Start Orb&gt;Search Box&gt;type: regedit<br />
<br />
When Regedit appears in Results above, right-click and choose "Run as administrator"<br />
<br />
In Regedit, navigate to:<br />
<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System<br />
<br />
In the right-side pane, edit "DisableTaskMgr" to change its value from 1 to 0.<br />
<br />
Exit Regedit.

            Having the same issues.&nbsp; I have timed it and it is somehow set for about 2 minutes no matter what I have in my settings.&nbsp; I am running Windows 10 Home, Version 1709, Build 16299.248 &nbsp; I cannot think of any changes that have occurred that may have caused
 this issue and I am the only user of this computer, therefore, only one profile.&nbsp; I have checked my updates and KB4088776 is installed.&nbsp; I have tried the easy-fix solution and it did not change a thing, even though it advised me that it had fixed the problem.

<h2>            Cirrus Logic High Definition Audio issues</h2>
                    After updating my Dell Inspiron 3520 to Windows 10, I found that the audio doesn't work at all. When I click on the sound icon on the task bar, it just opens a troubleshooting window which tells me that I need to reinstall Cirrus Logic High Definition
 Audio, and kidly offers to do this for me, but the installation fails every time. So I'm left with a laptop that can't read any audio files. How do you fix this?

<h2>            Hijackware Infection and a W32 Alureon-variant Rootkit Infection</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was the one whose Windows Update installed 'old' updates recently and issues with printing and was told by PA Bear&nbsp;that the computer likely has&nbsp;a hijackware infection and&nbsp;a W32/Alureon-variant rootkit infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not had any issues since and AVG whole scan and AVG Rootkit scan have not&nbsp;detected any errors-How would I be able to check/tell if there was a hijack infection and W32 rootkit infection? Is there a free program available to download?</p>

<p>Thanks. I run disk cleanup several times a day and the 'Microsoft® Windows® Malicious Software Removal Tool' is installed automatically by Windows Update when it is available. I also run Windows Updates regularly manually to check on required and optional
 updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To&nbsp;use the 'Microsoft® Windows® Malicious Software Removal Tool,' should I reboot in Safe Mode then download or just run it or do I reboot in regular mode then download and reboot in Safe Mode and then run it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reviews on Kaspersky TDSSKiller state that there&nbsp;are bugs associated with it and that it is difficult to uninstall. Can anyone recommend any other software to detect and remove hijackware infection and&nbsp;a W32/Alureon-variant rootkit infection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is AVG AntiVirus Free Edition not sufficient for detecting rootkits even though it is included in the whole computer scan?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is Windows Firewall sufficient or should ZoneAlarm alarm be used instead? Can more than one firewall be used at a time?</p>

            tdsskiller doesnt install (so you cant uninstall it) it just runs scans and removes rootkits. Thats it<br />
<br />
So whatever review you were reading / looking at, must have been talking about another program<br />
<br />
And no you should only have 1 firewall, otherwise they'll conflict with each other<br />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>In oreder to log in without password and a specific name, the computes have to be set with the Guest account On, and its permission configured.</p>
<p>Using the Guest account means that you do not have control on the Network logon.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Account No longer Logging In To Windows 10 Xbox Apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kintofer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Account No longer Logging In To Windows 10 Xbox Apps EXCLUSIVELY &#40;only&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must admit I am at a loss and on the last few attempts I can think of concerning the subject above. To spare you much reading here's a bullet-description of the situation</p>
<p>
</p><p>-(10-14-2018) Bought Zoo Tycoon Ultimate Animal Collection through Microsoft store (on a refurbished desktop I purchased in 06-2018)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Technical difficulties with game right off the bat- Invested in a 150$ graphics card a week later</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Windows 10 upgrade to version 1809 a few days later - and BAM new card useless. Windows no longer apparently recognizes my adaptors and drivers. Game crashes immediately. Labelled incompatible by a Level 2 Microsoft Tech support after a 4h phone conversation
 and such. No signs of teredo's adaptors - no way of having them installed. was asked to roll back or reinstall windows cause apparently it was incomplete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Get ready for new installation but give one last go at Color Management which i Had missed (what would color have to do with a grame crashing) believe it or not, some profiles had disappeared and by re-adding these i was playing again! Reinstalling Windows
 no longer required... until I played with my graphics card settings shortly after because quality wasn't as good as when I installed it and I BBQed my desktop. It wouldn't even boot anymore. Flash drive came in handy after all and after 4 or 5 days, everything
 seems to be back to normal (but i havent been playing due to updates and reboots and etc) back in the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wait for it... wait for it... yup! Because faith has a weird sense of humor, my curse kicks in AGAIN!</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Suddenly no longer able to connect into Xbox live/Xbox App/Insider hub with my Microsoft account... FOR A MONTH NOW! tried everything and anything I can find online (When I say everything, i mean EVERYTHING) reached out to communities, Xbox, microsoft again
 for another 3h today... I even went as far as changed my online dating profile to "Desperate to make friends with a PC Connaisseur - am ready to pay!" but nobody knows why I cant log on to Xbox Live or any of its apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you remember the title of my message, I said something about exclusivity. I kept thinking it was Teredo related, NAT Network type related because It was strict - moderate, blocked and would keep changing constantly. Until I tried something silly a week
 ago. Converted a new email into a Microsoft Account and connected to the apps. Worked like a gem right off the bat. But that means I&nbsp; have to play from scratch.. possibly having to convert everything I own in life to this new email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wondered if my original account functioned at all period else where. And it does. Fabulously. I can connect through any web browser, Android App, and even borrowed my neighbors daughters Xbox 360 to play my original save file. That was 3 days ago and i
 only found out this eve that the game is not compatible for 360s... -_-</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Yup: original account connects to my xbox profile in every way except PC apps. and the apps work fine and let me play if i use a different account. This makes NO Sense at all to anybody. I am determined to play under my original account and will NOT let
 any type of box tell me what I can and cannot do with it. We created them and should therefor be in control of them. I'm tempted to sacrifice my blow dryer in the tub as a threat or teaching it the laws of gravity from a third floor window. (I am only saying
 that to express how this whole experience has been aggravating) I'm a nintendo and Sony Playstation type of guy. I don't even need to wonder why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help and explanation AND A SOLUTION as to why I get "We couldn't sign you in to Xbox Live"&nbsp; - a specified logon does not exist. It may already have been terminated" with the option to try again or cancel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How ever, if I click on "Not you?" at the top left and attempt to connect again with my faulty account, I see my gamer profile appear, welcoming me back and the "Lets play. button and then moment I click on that - back to nothing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thank&nbsp;you for bringing this issue to our attention here on the forums. I understand you've been having trouble signing into your Microsoft account on the Xbox Apps is that correct? Does the issue occur in both the Windows 10 PC and on the&nbsp;Mobile App? Try
 going to <a href="http://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Account Site</a>&nbsp;and sign into the account to make sure there isn't any issues going on with the account itself. Let us know with a reply how it goes!</p>

    <title>Upgrading from Windows 7 SP1 Professional to Windows 10 free - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Upgrading from Windows 7 SP1 Professional to Windows 10 free</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have windows 7 SP1 Professional and need to know what version of the Windows 10 free will be the upgrade to. Windows 7 professional has features that the Windows 7 Home does not and I am hesitant to upgrade to windows 10 since it may lack the features
 i currently have on windows 7. &nbsp;I am a developer and don't like to be caught by surprise. &nbsp;Does any one know if i will loose features in the upgrade? Specifically, i do a lot of remote desktop to other computers and to my computer as well, will this be part
 of the upgrade or do i have to pay for this?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>ilikecoding.<br />

 10.</li><li>If your PC or tablet is currently running Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update, you can check to see if it meets the requirements by using ‘Check my PC’ in the Get Windows 10 app.</li><li>Applications, files and settings will migrate as part of the upgrade, however some applications or settings may not migrate.
<ul>
<li>For Anti-virus and Anti-malware applications, during upgrade Windows will check to see if your Anti-virus or Anti-malware subscription is current. Windows will uninstall your application while preserving your settings. After upgrade is complete, Windows
 will install the latest version available with the settings that were set prior to upgrade. If your subscription is not current, upgrade will enable Windows defender.</li><li>Some applications that came from your OEM may be removed prior to upgrade.</li><li>For certain third-party applications, the “Get Windows 10” app will scan for application compatibility. If there is a known issue that will prevent the upgrade, you will be notified of the list of applications with known issues. You can choose to accept
 and the applications will be removed from the system prior to upgrade. Please make sure that you copy the list before you accept the removal of the application.

            <p>Hi <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/15481a0f-6ebe-4f63-bae0-53216a715363" title="TaurArian">
TaurArian</a>,</p>
<p>Thank you for your prompt response!</p>
<p>I was also wondering about the recovery, currently i have a laptop which has a recovery partition that is set by the laptop manufacturer i.e. Gateway. Will the upgrade wipe this partition or overwrite it? Currently, if i have an issue with my computer i
 can always reset using this partition. </p>
<p>Another thing is the license key, is there a license key associated with the windows 10 and will we have to have this to authenticate our windows 10 version - I know that i can look up the computer properties and get this on my computer at anytime - I am
 bringing this up to see if there are any considerations that need to be made for future or is this handled?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            <p><strong>Q1. Will the Windows 10 upgrade erase my manufacturer's recovery partition?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A. </strong>No. The Windows 10 upgrade will replace your current operating system on the current volume only, and will not affect anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Q2. </strong><strong>Will I have to deal with licensing, product keys, etc. when I upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A. </strong>No. As long as your current OS is activated and deemed genuine, it'll be smooth sailing.</p>

            <p><strong>What happens to my previous operating system when I upgrade to Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 replaces your previous version of Windows by moving it to the Windows.old folder. Windows 10 becomes the default operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I uninstall Windows 10 if I do not like it or something goes wrong?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can see the following: <a href="https://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/how-to-rollback-to-a-previous-version-of-windows-from-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Throughout the history of Windows revisions, Microsoft has included an option to uninstall the operating system when you upgrade to a newer version. My recollection of this capability goes back to Windows ME which included the option to uninstall the operating system and restore to a previous version of Windows (I was running Windows 98 SE at the time). Microsoft has supported this functionality in its NT based versions of Windows too, albeit not in a seamless way. The ability to restore a Windows 8.1 installation to Windows 7 required knowing some command line operations that in some instances didn't guarantee the process would go according to plan. With Windows 10, it seems Microsoft has listened and has provided a welcome option to its recovery tools to make it easy to uninstall Windows 10 and go back t
</p>
<p><strong>Will I get a product key, can I get a product key?</strong></p>
<p>By default, Windows 10 builds are pre-keyed, meaning, you do not have to enter a product key and should not be prompted to enter one even after Windows 10 has completed setup.</p>

<p>
</p><p><em>Microsoft tells me that it will be possible to do so. And that a key part of this process is that it will save a product key tied to the previously upgraded PC or device in Windows Store. This is how Windows 10 will later know that the install is allowed:
 It’s “one of the benefits of the new delivery system,” a Microsoft representative told me.</em></p>

<h2>            Need to REMOVE airplane mode &#34;Feature&#34; from Windows 10</h2>

<strong>ON</strong>, disconnecting me from the network and the internet, sometimes while I am online and in the middle of typing. I have tried to use the Windows 10 Device Manager to change the properties of the computer's wireless LAN adapter, a Realtek RTL8188EE,
 in order to inactivate the <em>Airplane Mode</em>. I have also updated the driver to the latest version, 3/23/2016. But nothing works.
<em>Airplane Mode</em> just keeps coming back like the common cold. How do I permanently remove or at least disable this annoying feature??

Well, the only answer from Microsoft is "TOUGH BEANS!" The "Airplane" feature is built-in, NOT removable and NOT disable-able. Learn to live with this POS "feature" because we-say-so. And never mind that it randomly turns&nbsp;itself on, "It's a feature." Thanks
 a million.

            I have this issue as well. Even worse... I'm on a desktop computer!<br />
<br />
I'll either be remoted into a network trying to work or in the middle of a multiplayer game, then BAM! No more internet!! It's the most ridiculous angering and complete garbage feature I have ever had the pain of dealing with! It has convinced me all the great
 window software engineers have passed on and we have a bunch of blundering idiots decorating the OS with pointless features to try and make it like a tablet.<br />
<br />
Did I mention I'm on a desktop computer!? Why would I ever need airplane mode!? Why by the nine divine would I ever want airplane mode on!? It needs TO GO.
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Remove Airplane mode!</em></span></strong><br />
<br />
I keep taking the necessary actions to make sure it doesn't just <strong>randomly</strong> out of the blue
<strong>turn on</strong>... but then weeks later out of nowhere it flips on and I either lose time on a project or a hardcore character dies!<br />
<br />
There's no reason to have it. PERIOD. Not every flipping piece of hardware is a surface tablet! I wish I could go back to Windows 7 but apparently this
<em>"feature"</em> has been added as well.
