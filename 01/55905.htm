<h2>            PARENTAL PERMISSION</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem signing in to my skype account. </p>
<p>It's asking me for parental consent event though I'm well over the legal age limit.
</p>
<p>I am not willing to provide my credit card information, and even if I was, I do not have a US credit card number so that point is mute.
</p>
<p>I have also made another address to verify my own and it's still asking me for credit card info.
</p>
<p>My skype account is important to my job and I don't want to make another address.
</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>

            I have exactly the same problem. In addition I tried to manage my microsoft account and change the age there, since for some reason the date of birth was 1.1.2017, but microsoft did not allow the change. So I changed the date of birth in the skype profile,
 but that won't probably help. I have time to prove to be adult (over the legal age) until 17.4.2018. But how will I do that, if I don't want to give my credit card number and the microsoft don't allow to change the date of birth in the account... If anyone
 has solved the problem, please help.

            Today I struggle with the same problem all day. OneDrive has accepted my credit card but Skype has not received the data from my Microsoft account. In both places, the same birth date is given, indicating a lot of adults.<br />
Skype would be important to me, I have a lot of contacts and it would be difficult to handle new registrations.

            I did the same thing, I tried to change my birth date because it was set at May 5th 2015 and the account wouldn't let me change it, after hitting send it would just refresh back to 2015.
<br />
Then, I tried opening a fake account (to act as my parent) and they asked for my card information and wanted to charge it 0.50 USD after saying they just want the card to verify age. So now, there is NO CHANCE I will give out my information.
<br />
After trying to log in a couple hundred times I was able to log into skype on my computer, but on my phone there's still the same problem. I'm going crazy literally, I can't even log out, because I don't even know if I will be able to log back in again.

            I was able to miracularly log in after changing my Skype, Outlook, Gmail&nbsp;and Microsoft account. I don't even understand what the problem was because all my dates were set correctly and still no change and then all of a sudden they accepted. I talked to
 my coworkers (I work in IT sector) and no one has ever seen this before. <br />
<br />
Plus I'm not from US and my credit card info is invalid in any case. <br />
<br />
Hoping someone will have a solution to this.

<p>Thank you for the reply. The situation is a bit complicated, since I don't understand it, why are you forcing people to give credit card numbers or submit information of their passports, driver's license etc.&nbsp; I don't want to submit my social security numbers
 via email, postal mail or fax as a matter of fact I don't want to give my personal data or give my credit card number at all. There is always the possibility that my personal information would leak to the third person or someone might steal the information
 from microsoft. No one can guarantee 100 % safety. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to sound suspicous (though I know my questions sounds like it), but are you going to archive the photocopies of the official identification (passports, driver's license etc)? Who is checking the information which is sent to you? What will happen
 to the information?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I have not set my date of birth to be 1.1.2017. Everyone knows that 1- year -old is not able to set an account.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been using skype under the account (of which the date of birth has been set to be 1.1.2017) for many years now.&nbsp; I am not from
 US or Korea and still not able to change the date of birth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is good that you have the parental consent I don't deny that, but the information what you require is just too much.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, is there any other way who this issue can be solved? </p>

            I agree! Unfortunately, my work requires Skype, because many of my partners use it. (I'm trying to use join.me, but it is much less used.) I do not think it's a good thing for everyone to know all of my data (like birth date). Too much data is required,
 which I think is unnecessary. For the time being, I have not solved my login problem either by sending the requested information. :(

<p>I agree with you 100%.<br />
I don't want to give out my personal information to anyone, let alone some company that I don't even share a continent with.
</p>
<p>I'm at work right now and out of the blue my skype just crashed and is now again asking me for parental permission.
<br />
I have changed my date for too many times, I do not have the strenght to do it again.
<br />
Every time I change it, log out of Microsoft account and log back in, my birth date goes back to 2014.&nbsp;<br />
Now I am unable to do my job because I have no logical way to log into my Skype account, and all this support can do is give out the same pointless guide lines that I don't want to follow, nor should I, or enyone else for that matter.</p>

<p>These steps, to remove the UpperFilters and LowerFilters values, if they exist, at the named registry key may help.</p>
<p>Create a System Restore Point beforehand and restart the computer afterward.</p>
<p>Also, for the BSODs,&nbsp;can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link)&nbsp;via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?<br />

    <title>Custom Skins with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maddyx myelstrom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom Skins with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I chose to stick to the latest edition of windows 7 (Because i don't have a touch screen and really don't enjoy the tile style, and because of the customization offered by 7). I have a few custom skins on my computer itself, such as the start menu, file
 and music icons, Etc. Will Windows 10 keep these when it upgrades or will it potentially mess up the upgrade? Should i go ahead and revert my screen back to normal? Also, Does windows 10 run with Dreamscapes?</p>

<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview is much appreciated.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When you will check for the compatibility of your System with Windows 10, it will check the compatibility of every device, drivers or software‚Äôs present
 on your System. Through this you will get to know whether Dreamscape is compatible with Windows 10 or not.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows&nbsp;10 is designed to be compatible with the vast majority of Windows 7 and Windows&nbsp;8.1 devices. So your device is most likely compatible.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>For details on your specific device and apps, you can use the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app to do a compatibility check. Click the menu in the upper left of the app, and select ‚ÄúCheck your PC‚Äù or ‚ÄúYour PC is good
 to go.‚Äù This displays any compatibility issues we find and recommends a resolution; while we don‚Äôt have info on every app or device in existence, it provides a comprehensive list of all known potential compatibility issues.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Some Windows&nbsp;10 features will require advanced hardware and not all features and services are available on every device, nor in every market. For instance, Cortana is not available in all markets.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Keep us posted if you face any issues on windows in future. We will be glad to help you.</span></span></p>

    <title>How to skip the login screen as before&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> liberty55  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to skip the login screen as before&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have never had a&nbsp;password for login to Windows.<br />
For 20 years I have not needed that.<br />
In addition I have never needed to use or see a login/signin screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>In windows 8 and windows 10 I thus use a local account<br />
<br />
<br />
But in windows 10 I can not avoid the unnecessary sign in screen (where the Sign in button is located)?<br />
I have studied different possibilities but found none<br />
<br />
<br />
Why is it so?<br />
Any help? Registry?</p>

            I know this way well that does not work in my case.<br />
<br />
As I said I do not&nbsp;have a password (empty), &nbsp;which has always been the case for me since 25 years.<br />
I have been using one or more&nbsp;Personal computers mainly for myself.<br />
A password is then a complication.<br />
<br />
I want to have it in Windows 10 as before when it worked without a password.<br />
<br />
Is there not any other way? It should be.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
BTW what is a MVP?<br />

            <p>I told you several times that the procedure in Windows 10 does not work if you leave the password empty.<br />
<br />
To make this change, Windows 10 ask you to tell your UserId and Psw.</p>
<p>To leave the Psw empty is not accepted.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pls try this&nbsp;and explain my luck.<br />

            <p>You can only leave the password empty if you do not have a connection to your Microsoft Account.&nbsp; If you use the Mail app, Cortana, sync-settings, or the app store, then you can't have a entirely blank password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can still skip the login screen, but you have to set a password first.&nbsp; Then, use the instructions on the link I sent to set your computer to always auto-login.&nbsp; Technically you'll have a password, but you'll never be asked for it.</p>

I have never used a password in Windows for my laptop and I want to continue with this, for different reasons.<br />
</p>
<p>1. Do you understand?<br />
<br />
I also want to skip the Windows login screen.<br />
</p>
<p>2. Do you understand?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This situation have been possible before in Windows up to the introduction of Windows 10.</p>
<p>3. You seem now finally to agree&nbsp;to this deterioration, is this correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have so far not provided a solution to this problem (which I call a bug or mistake by Microsoft).</p>
4. Do you and Microsoft confirm that there is and will be no solution to this deterioration?<br />
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Windows never had online features like this before. &nbsp;If you don't connect the online features you absolutely can set a blank password and have none at all. &nbsp;They didn't change anything that was already possible before. &nbsp;They just added new additional capabilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you prefer it to be like Windows 7, then you can continue using it like you did in Windows 7, without a password at all.</p>
<p>

            <p>Now you have missed the subject of this forum issue..<br />
And you are completely wrong.<br />
In earlier Windows I could have empty password and skip the login screen on my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pls answer to my questions 1- 3 above. Then it should be very clear what I want, I hope<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>and then tell me how I can&nbsp;skip the login screen without a password&nbsp;<br />
- that is the subject of this issue.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should be very easy for Microsoft to delete the requirement of a nonempty password</p>
<p>at the change option.&nbsp;Do you agree?<br />
<br />
Finally please reply to my question 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks<br />
</p>
<p><br />
BTW What does MVP Insider means? Should you not report to Microsoft about unsolved issues?</p>

            <p>Yes you can do all those things. &nbsp;Please read my post for every available option.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You can still set a blank password like always</li><li>or you can skip the login screen like always<br />
</li><li>or you can even do BOTH to have it exactly the way you want (like always). <strong>
You won't even have to click your user account to login, it will skip the login entirely and you will never see it.</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, if you have a blank password, you can't use anything that didn't already exist in Windows 7. &nbsp;So no Cortana, no online backup. &nbsp;No app store. &nbsp;All those things require online connections to your account, which is impossible without a password.
 &nbsp;But if you're happy with what you had in Windows 7, then this is your solution.&nbsp; It does everything you want.</p>

    <title>Desktop and library folder issues on safe mode, and The group policy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hoiyo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop and library folder issues on safe mode, and The group policy client service filed the logon. Access denied.</h2>
                    Hi guys,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a custom built PC with Windows 7 Ultimate and it is already nearly 1 year old and it worked just fine. I am a student that follow the studies of electrical engineering. That oftens create electric schematics for school and put it in the "Document"
 folder of the library.</div>
<div>I dont have many knowledge about computers (the software part). Once a week I scan for virus with Kaspersky internet security and it could't not find any virus. Sometimes I download anime's ( yes I watch anime's) and put it in the video folder library.</div>
<div>My computer worked just fine when i was playing a game and checked the e-mail thats all. No problem.....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Until the next day when I start my computer and my little brother pressed the reset button on my PC chassis because he want to irritate me or wtf.</div>
<div>My PC reset and it does it everyday startup, everything looked fine but then after the message "<b>Welcome</b>" I got a another message that says:</div>
<div><b>"The Group Policy Client service failed the logon. Access is denied." </b>
after this error it logged off and returned to the account selection screen.</div>
<div>I don't know what it means...so I restart my computer again. After the restart I got the same error again. Then I tried to restart my computer on "<b>Safe mode</b>"<b>&nbsp;</b>and it logged in my account
<b>without</b> getting the error:&nbsp;<b>"The Group Policy Client service failed the logon. Access is denied.".</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>But, when it logged in successfully in Safe mode, there where unexpected things that i have never seen and I dont know why. First is that the background of my desktop is black and all my dekstop icons and files are missing.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Secondly when I got to "<b>Computer</b>" (windows logo+E or windows orb --&gt; computer) my Library files (videos,pictures,documents) are missing on the left panel.</div>
<div>So the first thing I did is right mouse click and clicking on "<b>Show all folder</b>" but nothing happened. So the second thing I did is right click on Library and click on&nbsp;</div>
<div>"<b>Restore default library" </b>and the videos, picture and documents folder where restored, so I had some relief. But, when I click on the video folder to check if my anime series and really important school documents are save, but they were missing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I have checked my &nbsp;user profile at<b> "C/users/Eric"</b> and I have:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Appdata</div>
<div>Contacts</div>
<div>desktop</div>
<div>Ntuser</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is the screenshot of it:&nbsp;<a href="http://imageshack.us/f/38/86959947.png/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imageshack.us/f/38/86959947.png/</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And I have tried what most peoples suggest but to no avail:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Chkdsk : &nbsp;didnt found any problem.</div>
<div>SFC/scannow: found corrupted files, not all the files are repaired.</div>
<div>system recovery: tried 10 times even at boot but didnt helped my problem.....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I checked the regedit for the register because I followed the steps from a guy that helped someone with nearly the same issue from a answered thread from other forum. Saying that &nbsp;a register is corrupted and have to look for registers that are the same
 with one that have .BAK behind its name and removing the one without the .bak and rename the one with .bak to normal:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So i followed it:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE----&gt;SOFTWARE---&gt;MICROSOFT---&gt;WINDOWS NT---&gt;CURRENT VERSION---&gt;PROFILELIST.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and i got those registers:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>S-1-5-18</div>
<div>S-1-5-19</div>
<div>S-1-5-20</div>
<div>S-1-5-21-487321731-627411630-2395495840-1000.bak</div>
<div>S-1-5-21-487321731-627411630-2395495840-1007</div>
<div>S-1-5-21-487321731-627411630-2395495840-1008</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So there are NO registers which are the same but i tought by renaming "S-1-5-21-487321731-627411630-2395495840-1000.bak" to</div>
<div>"S-1-5-21-487321731-627411630-2395495840-1000" the problems are solved.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now my registers are:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>S-1-5-18</div>
<div>S-1-5-19</div>
<div>S-1-5-20</div>
<div>S-1-5-21-487321731-627411630-2395495840-1000</div>
<div>S-1-5-21-487321731-627411630-2395495840-1007</div>
<div>S-1-5-21-487321731-627411630-2395495840-1008</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But it didn't........</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>someone from another forum told me to create a new account and migrate my user profile to the new account.&nbsp;</div>
<div>So I created a new account and named my new account "<b>Eric lol 2</b>".(because I cant think of a other name ;p)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>With my new account i can log in without safe mode and without the error message:&nbsp;<b>"The Group Policy Client service failed the logon. Access is denied."&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>But this account have also some issues....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>With this new account the desktop is black and all the icons are missing and get the error message that it&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>" Couldnt locate C:windows/system32/config/systemprofile/desktop".</b></div>
<div>Everytime I go to&nbsp;to "<b>Computer</b>" (windows logo+E or windows orb --&gt; computer) I get the same error message:</div>
<div><b>" Couldnt locate C:windows/system32/config/systemprofile/desktop".&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>And in my users folder by<b> "Computer" </b>there is no<b> "Eric lol 2"</b> user profile folder<b>. Even if i go to folder option in configurationpanel and set the option "Show hidden files".</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I dont know what to do....&nbsp;</div>
<div>I didn't made a backup so i regret it now..... and maybe i shouldn't have to touch the registers?? I dont know......</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Some peoples says that I have to delete my user profile<b>. </b>But if I do that will all my files deleted? I am very reluctant with this since i dont have much knowledge about computers and I am afraid that I will never get my files back. (anime's documents,
 contacts and pictures etc.).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have those problems for nearly 6 days and it is really time consuming.</div>
<div>So at this point I am panicking because I think I have lost all my anime's, pictures, electrical schematics and important school documents. None of the answered thread from the other forums helped.</div>
</div>
<div>Sorry that I have wrote too much. It is my first time to write my problem on a forum. I hope you can understand what i wrote since my english&nbsp;</div>
<div>is not at a high level ;). Those issues are really frustrating and I dont know why it happened so suddenly.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you can't understand some parts I will try to explain it better.</div>
<div>Those issues are really frustrating and I dont know why it happened so suddenly.

            <p>&nbsp;I think I'd boot to Safe Mode again and try backing up whatever files I could.&nbsp; I assume you've looked in the Recycle bin.&nbsp; I hate to say it, but it sounds like you're going to need to reinstall Windows.&nbsp; I know this will be a pain, but it should take much
 less than the 6 days you've already spent with no solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;At the risk of sounding like I'm trying to teach a drowning man to swim, this is a classic example of why you need to constantly back up your computer's data.&nbsp; Personally I back up my whole system monthly and take incremental backups every 4 hours using
 Norton Ghost and a 2 GB external hard drive I bought.&nbsp;&nbsp;There're plenty of other good commercial backup programs, but Ghost is what I've been using for the last 8 years without the first problem.&nbsp; You can buy a 1.5 GB external hard drive for $100 these days
 (probably less if you can get a student discount), and if you watch the sales, you can get Ghost for next to nothing.&nbsp; Flash drives are cheap (around $10 for 16 GB), but external hard drives are much better.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp; The March 2012 issue of PC World is very high on the FREE program from Easeus, Easeus Todo Backup Free, which you can download from
<a href="http://www.todo-backup.com/products/home/free-backup-software.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.todo-backup.com/products/home/free-backup-software.htm</a> .
<br />
-<br />
&nbsp;CNET has a lot of backup program reviews at <br />
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/windows/backup-software/?tag=contentBody;sideBar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/windows/backup-software/?tag=contentBody;sideBar</a> .</p>
<p>Some of these are free (last time I checked there were over 300), some have free trials (over 1000), and some are purchase only (over 200).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

            I have already a 1 TB external HDD. =/
<div><br />
<div>I have found something what i dont understand, I right click on C drive (HDD) and it says that I have used 200GB out of 1.80 TB. But when i go to my C drive and CTRL+A and right click properties, it says 100GB...thats the half of the 200GB that I used
 and my files especcialy my anime series are somewhere near 50GB + my other files. So it have to be somewhere?<br />
<div><br />
<div>I have a question:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was at my internship where I have my own workspace and computer.</div>
<div>I did some experimenting:.....because i had a long break and watched a youtube clip about the computer library and I followed that youtube clip because I was curiuous. This is what I did according the youtube clip:</div>
<div><br />
<div>I had some music in the library folder at "My music", I have deleted that music folder and along with the music in that folder &nbsp;( I have copied the music in a empty map of course, in case something happened..).&nbsp;</div>
<div>Then i did right click on the Library and click on "restore default Library". The music folder was restored, and the deleted music was also restored.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Of course I have also emptied my Recycle Bin. But what i want to know is how can windows restored the music that was completely deleted? Does it store the files elsewhere than the library? Sorry I am a curiuous person who wants to learn more so in the
 future i can solve it for other person. But I still dont know why it is happening =/</div>
<div><br />
<div>Well If I have to reinstall windows than there is no helping it...I have learned my lesson.</div>
<div>Of course I tought maybe there was a way to extract those files (especcialy files from documents, videos and pictures) and place it in a external HDD and then reinstall windows 7.</div>

            <p>&nbsp;OK, for your question about the 200 GB vs 100 GB discrepancy, in the latter case there were hidden files that weren't included when you did the CTRL-A.&nbsp; This would include things like the NTFS file mapping tables, your System Restore points, paging file,
 possible hidden system folders, etc.&nbsp; So believe the 200 GB figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now the question about restoring Library files.&nbsp; When you have things listed under Libraries, they are only LINKS to where the data really exists on the C: drive, so when you delete from Libraries, you're only deleting the link, not the data itself which
 is still on your C: drive under C:\Users somewhere.&nbsp; This is something MS came up with in Windows 7 to help keep people from fiddling around in the C: drive itself.&nbsp; It took me and the folks I work with a while to understand this new wrinkle, but when you
 think about it, if's probably a good idea.&nbsp; That's especially true from a support person's perspetive who doesn't want to be hassled by problems created by users fiddling around in places that cause problems.&nbsp; :-)</p>

<p>&nbsp;I'm not sure I understand your comments about copying data to the external drive.&nbsp; You can copy and paste anything to an external drive.&nbsp; If you use any of the 3 backup/restore programs I'm familiar with (Ghost, Memeo, Easeus), you can selectively retrieve
 files and folders from the backup.&nbsp; I imagine most good utilities in this group do the same, but I can't speak to the Windows provided backup (which I strongly dislike).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>1. so it doesnt scan the hidden files, system restore points etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Ok, now i understand it, I was asking because it was not on XP &nbsp;=).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. I will look for those software. But those 3 back up software are the same?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am going to reinstall windows 7, thanks from your explanation and help ;)&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have somehow manage to download the movies and was very lucky that the torrents are not dead xD. I will look for the other files/data that I have lost somewhere...&gt;.&gt;</div>
<div>After reinstalling windows 7 I will immediately make &nbsp;a back-up ;).</div>
<div><br />
<div>PS: I have noticed you have add some text about back-up under your name XD</div>

            <p>&nbsp;I'm certainly relieved to know the torents aren't dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Yeah, I added the words about backup because I've seen so many situations like&nbsp;yours that wouldn't be a&nbsp;problem if folks had just created backups.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;The 3 backup programs I mentioned are different ones from different vendors.&nbsp; Ghost is what I've used most and it is from Symantec.&nbsp; It retails for $70, but is often on sale with $50 and $20 rebates.&nbsp; Memeo is from Seagate and they put it on a lot of hard
 drives they sell with a 30 day free trial; you can buy it for $29.99 - you can download it from
<a href="http://memeo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://memeo.com</a> .&nbsp; The March 2012 issue of PC World is very high on the FREE program from Easeus, Easeus Todo Backup Free, which you can download from
<a href="http://www.todo-backup.com/products/home/free-backup-software.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.todo-backup.com/products/home/free-backup-software.htm</a> .&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;CNET has a lot of backup program reviews at <br />

<p>Some of these are free (last time I checked there were over 300), some have free trials (over 1000), and some are purchase only (over 200).<br />
-<br />
&nbsp; I was an EE student until I got to AC circuits.&nbsp; That's when I decided to major in math and minor in physics!&nbsp; That was a lot of years ago.&nbsp; Do you know anyone&nbsp;who's looking to buy a good slide rule?&nbsp; Give my regards to Messers R, L, and C.&nbsp;&nbsp;:-)&nbsp;</p>

I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

<div>yes, I will give you regards to the R,L and C ;)&nbsp;</div>
<div>I was planning to do physics as minor and EE as major well I still dont know xD</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have used the RLC circuit for my coilgun project at school, well with a budget of 20 euro..(yes, I live in europe) I think it is around 25 dollar? with that low budget you cant buy good components and thus it is not powerfull....</div>
<div>So now I am going to make my own coilgun at home xD.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway how can a userprofile, registers or library going corrupt and getting that access denied issue?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have download the free backup program, I am going to use it on my software broken&nbsp;</div>
<div>computer :). I use my uncles computer atm.&nbsp;</div>
<div>But whats the difference by using the backup from windows and third party backup software?</div>

            <p>&nbsp;I just think the Windows backup program is buggy.&nbsp; I was very disappointed in it when I tried it, and I see many reports from frustrated users here who've used the Windows backup and run into incomprehensible problems which the MS people don't seem to be
 able to solve.&nbsp; Bear in mind that MS has come out with a different backup program with almost every release all the way since the early DOS days.&nbsp; And most of them have been incompatible with the earlier versions.&nbsp; They just don't seem to be able to get it
 right.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just my personal opinion, based on about 23 years of experience with PCs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As far as computers doing things that don't make sense, remember that while they're blindingly fast, they are also dumb machines that understand little more than high, low, and equal.&nbsp; When something happens that the MS programmers didn't anticipate, the
 machine is going to do something stupid and difficult to understand.&nbsp; A good example of how strange things can happen would be when some error occurs, Windows goes into error recovery and wham, another error occurs.&nbsp; Disk errors would be a good example, expecially
 if they occur during paging operations or when Windows is trying to load a critical piece of software and it can't get it because of I/O errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Microsoft Surface Type Cover Does Not Work After Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Microsoft Surface Specialty Keyboard does not work after Windows was updated.&nbsp; I have tried the procedures that I found in the forum like hard reset, uninstall then install keyboard again, etc... But it doesn't seem to work.&nbsp; The Surface recognize the
 keyboard but it doesn't work.&nbsp; When I tried the keyboard to other Microsoft Surface units, it worked well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if Microsoft has already solution to this?&nbsp; What other procedures can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this up. To assist you accordingly, can you confirm if the touchpad in the Type Cover works? What other troubleshooting steps have you tried as an attempt to resolve the issue?</p>
<p>

    <title>Wifi Adapter not showing up, HP laptop can only connect to internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ramromp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi Adapter not showing up, HP laptop can only connect to internet thru ethernet</h2>
                    <p>My HP laptop (using windows 10) has been having trouble recently. At first, every time the internet would go down (wouldn't connect to wireless), I could restart it and it would work again. Then, the wireless network stopped showing up all together. I had
 to go into the device manager and turn the wifi adapter back on. That worked for about a day. My wireless is down again, I'm currently connected thru my ethernet cable. I tried enabling the adapter, but it said it already is. I tried to go in and make sure
 my wifi was turned on, but my wifi isn't even showing up. It just gives me the ethernet option. My router is working, obviously, because the ethernet cable is working, but also because our phones and gaming systems are working fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what to do from here, and customer service doesn't work weekends. Any suggestions/help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you are using a mouse with a 3rd party driver be sure to update it if there is a newer version.<br />
<br />
Use the Clean Boot and other methods to try to determine the cause of and/or eliminate the issues.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause<br />
strange issues). You said Vipre however I left this in so you would see how important those are to<br />
proper performance. Be sure to check with Vipre Support to see if there are any known issues.<br />
<br />

TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />
reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods
<br />
above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are
<br />
found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<h2>            Intel Graphics Media Accelerator driver not working in Vista</h2>
                    <span>I just installed Windows Vista Home Premium edition. The display resolution was set to 648X480 pixels.
                    <span>I just installed Windows Vista Home Premium edition. The display resolution was set to 648X480 pixels.
<br />
<br />
I tried to download and install Intel¬Æ Graphics Media Accelerator drivers for Windows Vista 32-bit. But the installer says
<br />
<br />
This computer does not meet minimum <br />
requirement for installing this software. <br />
<br />
Setup will exit. <br />
<br />
Is it because I have Intel(R) 845G chipset family for which Intel has ended support? My computer info is:
<br />
<br />
Processor: Intel Pentium 4 CPU 1.8 Ghz <br />
Memory(RAM): 1024 MB <br />
System type: 32-bit operating system <br />
<br />
Is there any other method of installing ¬Æ Graphics Media Accelerator drivers for Windows Vista 32-bit on my PC?
<br />
<br />
Plz tell. My entire PC experience has been affected with it. The windows are so big that i cannot even click on many button which are down the window.</span>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
According to Intel, there will be no more driver updates.<br />
<br />
Intel¬Æ 82845G Graphics Controller <br />
End of Interactive Support Announcement <br />
These products are no longer being manufactured by Intel. Additionally, Intel no longer provides interactive support for these products via telephone or e-mail, nor will Intel provide any future software updates to support new operating systems or improve compatibility
 with third party devices and software products <br />
<br />
This would be a good time to upgrade to&nbsp;a different graphics card that has Windows Vista support.<br />
<br />
If that's not possible, take a look at the following external web site.&nbsp; A few may have figured a way around this.<br />

<h2>            Teredo is unable to qualify</h2>
                    Hi so I've been having this problem, in the XBOX app on my ASUS desktop my Teredo keeps being unable to qualify.&nbsp; I've tried resetting blocked components to zero, I've tried reinstalling both the app and Teredo, I've tried just about every fix I can find.&nbsp;
 Whenever I go to the device manager however it shows that I don't have either Teredo adapter or the pseudo tunneling software, even when I go to the install drivers area neither will show up even with show hidden turned on... this has gotten very frustrating,
 does anyone know if there is a way to get it elsewhere? or bypass it at this point I'm almost ready to try anything...

<h2>            PALTALK starts and ends after 10 seconds</h2>
                    <p>Hello people</p>
<p>I am using a registered version of windows 10 and PALTALK on a DELL laptop touch screen with I7 processor 16 GB ram.
</p>
<p>Recently I have installed the latest version of PALTALK. I start the program and exactly after 10 seconds it closes by itself without any warning or a popup message to explain why.</p>
<p>PALTALK vendor seems to fail in helping me solve the problem which I already have for almost 2 monthes now.</p>
<p>Can anyone assist?</p>

            Hi ◊†◊™◊ü◊í◊®◊ô◊†◊ë◊®◊í
<br />
<br />Most likely there is a conflict with PalTalk and a version of Windows 10
<br />
<br />On both your systems, check the version of Windows 10 you are running - are you running the exact same version (1709, 1803 . . etc.) on both systems?
<br />
<br />To check your version of Windows 10:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what version of Windows 10 are you running?

<br />
Most likely there is a conflict with PalTalk and a version of Windows 10 <br />
<br />
On both your systems, check the version of Windows 10 you are running - are you running the exact same version (1709, 1803 . . etc.) on both systems?
<br />
<br />
To check your version of Windows 10: <br />
<br />
Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter <br />
<br />
On the resulting dialog, what version of Windows 10 are you running? </blockquote>
<p>Thank for the reply, Dave</p>
<p>On my laptop the version is 1803</p>
<p>on my desktop...well, for that ill have to get back home after work and check it out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What if both are the same?</p>

            Hi Nathan, since that is running OK on one system and not on the other, it is more likely the versions of Windows are different
<br />
<br />This issue is a problem for the developers of PalTalk, it is their responsibility to make sure their software is compatible with all versions of Windows 10. Software manufacturers usually push out updates just after Microsoft updates Windows to keep their software working
<br />
<br />If it turns out both systems are in fact running the same version of Windows, try uninstalling and re-installing PalTalk and see if that resolves this
<br />
<br />I understand from your initial post that the software manufacturers are less than helpful. you should contact them again and have them help you with this if the above does not fix this for you . . .

<p>I already uninstalled and installed it 5 times, downloaded the installation using chrom and edge. Deleted the catch memory. restarted the computer endless of times with no use. it acts exactly the same each time.</p>
<p>The people from paltalk answer me ruffly once a week or two, saying how sorry they are that I have that problem and sudgests doing the same things over and over. They are helpless. It seems they have no idea what to do hense my approach to the poeple in

                    I have a Windows 7 x64 computer and when I tried to install .net 4.5.2 or went to verify the msi files and one wouldn't verify. I got the installer straight from Microsoft so I don't see what the problem is. Btw this is a desktop and I have no home internet

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you mentioned that you have no home internet connection, we suggest that you try the Offline Installer for Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 . You may download it by clicking on this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/download/details.aspx?id=42642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. Though to set your expectations, we still recommend that you use the Web Installer whenever possible to ensure optimal efficiency and bandwidth requirements.</p>
<p>

            I've downloaded it already, when it goes to verify everything it comes with, one of the x64 installers doesn't verify its certificate so it doesn't install 4.5.2. That's my problem&nbsp;

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using the latest Skype version for Windows 10 (v12.xx), this is a known issue, and we are working on a fix but no estimate time frame yet on when will it be resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, I would suggest you to download classic Skype v7.41 following below steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Go to <strong>www.skype.com</strong></li><li>Click on <strong>Downloads </strong>tabs.</li><li>From the blue drop-down button, select <strong>Get classic Skype.</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<p>Please note that this installer is supported on Windows 7 and higher only. Windows XP/Vista users remain on Skype for Windows desktop v7.36</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps! Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

            HI Mark.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you're getting access denied to Device Manager then it points to account corruption.  Try creating a new Local Admin account, sign into it, test if the problem persists.  If not move your files over, check all programs run from it or reinstall them as needed, then when ready delete the old account:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />In addition  Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Install the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC. 
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall any printer software.   
<br />
<br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers: 
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click printer to delete  Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.   
<br />
<br />5) Go to the printer model‚Äôs Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot.
<br />
<br />6) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.   
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>What is next? Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>I suggest to scan your PC for viruses/malware and then to try to install the Printer.</p>
<p>For that task you can follow the instructions in this article:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wintips.org/quick-malware-check-removal-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wintips.org/quick-malware-check-removal-guide/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have problems after the scanning, then try to fix Windows file corruption. To do that, open Command Prompt as Administrator and give the following commands in order:</p>
<pre><p>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</p><p /><p>and </p><pre><p>sfc /scannow<br /></p><p /><p>Good luck!</p><p /><p><span>________________________________________________________&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Standard Disclaimer: There are links to non-Microsoft websites.

<p>Hi Greg. I'm sorry about this but I have a problem and I dont know how to fix this. But I would like to talk to someone. I tried calling Skype on the 800 number but I live in South-Africa and It says that number doesn't exist. I know this has nothing to
 do with the problem above, but I need help! I'm trying to sign in to my Skype account and it doesn't want to and it doesn't give me a reason of what the problem is, it told me to come to account.live.com and the(robot) told me to come here. I would love to
 speak to a human being. Please help. Because I have a Skype meeting today. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Kenny Versfeld</p>

<h2>            windows software warranty scam</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I&nbsp;received&nbsp;a phone call from someone claiming to be working for windows. She said I had a lot of viruses and things on my computer and since my computer has been working slower than usual I stupidly believed her, despite having norton anti-virus 360.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I've searched all the other posts and like them they asked me to put in a 6 digit code via logmein123.com or something like this, and gained access to my computer.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I was watching everything the so called "technician" was doing and he downloaded some advanced spyware programme, to show me all the problems I had with my computer and then ran a cmd check which showed that my windows software warranty had run out, and
 in order for him to fix the problems I had to renew the software warranty.</div>
<div>I found everything quite odd, especially since on the cmd check warranty was spelt as "warrenty" and she kept on&nbsp;insisting&nbsp;I renew right at that moment. Eventually she gave me a phone number to call her back on.</div>
<div>Now after discovering this site, I believe it was a scam. I've had my dads card cancelled but I will be keeping a close eye on my own bank account. My main concern is what can they potentially do with the little information I did give them of myself which
 was my full name, email address and mobile phone number, and anywhere or anyone I can report this incident to? &nbsp;Also could they have downloaded spyware or viruses in the time they had access? I tried the met police fraud reporting website but they don't specifically
 ask about myself and what details were taken.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'm especially worried they might use my name and hack my email address. One final issue is that I've tried to do a system restore to put the computer back to an earlier period of time but every time I've tried it says it didn't work. Would I need to reboot
 the whole windows vista to brand new?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help or advice would be much appreciated. Thank you.</div>

If anyone calls you to initiate anything like this (technology based or not) - chances are it is a scam. Reputable companies do not do cold calls or pretend to know what is wrong with your system before they have spoken with you in detail or seen it.</p>
<p>Format your system (restore to factory defaults.)&nbsp; How you do this depends on the system and the method(s) the OEM (manufacturer of the computer) has given you.&nbsp; You can then restore your data from backup.</p>
<p>Change all your passwords (online and offline.)&nbsp; I recommend 15+ characters consisting of at least three of these four things : uppercase letters (A, B, C...), lowercase letters (a, b, c...), numbers (1, 2, 3...) and symbols (!, #, $, &amp;...)</p>
<p>Contact all your financial institutions and warn them you may have been scammed - ask them to mark your accounts in such a way to help prevent/monitor out-of-the-ordinary transactions.</p>

            <p>Hi Ashish</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response </p>
<p>
</p><p>The make and model of my laptop is Dell Vostro 3550, and i don't see any error on the screen till yesterday &nbsp;, &nbsp;i just get the blue windows logo with dotted animation for processing and then the screen goes blank. But now i am seeing an error screen and
 the system restarts , i get blue windows logo and below that a message stating Preparing Automatic repair and then i get a error message Your PC ran into problem and needs restart we'll restart for you and bellow that there is a note which states If you'd
 like to know more you can search online later for this error : WDF violation. And then the system restarts and this cycle keeps on repeating, and i have to shutdown the system using the power button to stop this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a windows recovery disk or the installation disk since my laptop was preloaded with windows 7 Proffessional</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards..</p>

Hi,<br />
<br />
If it's something you downloaded, it may be copy protected by DRM, in which case you cannot burn it to a CD or DVD.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Here are few things you may try:
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1. Make sure the disc is clean.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Try a different brand of blank discs.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Stop all other programs that are running.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Make sure the hard disk doesn't use disk compression.</span></p>
<p><span>I'd suggest you follow these steps and check if they help resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Try using the troubleshooter to see if that fixes the problem.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>a. Open the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the search box, type "troubleshooter", and then click Troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click View all, and then click Windows Media Player Settings.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Method <span>&nbsp;</span>2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Select a slower recording (write) speed for the CD burner.</span></p>
<p><span>Change settings for burning a CD or DVD in Windows Media Player</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-settings-for-burning-a-CD-or-DVD-in-Windows-Media-Player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-settings-for-burning-a-CD-or-DVD-in-Windows-Media-Player</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you have any third party burning software, I'd suggest you temporarily
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
uninstall</a> it and then try burning the disc using Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Reinstall the software after the test.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Method 4:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Defragment your hard disk and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>Improve performance by defragmenting your hard disk</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Improve-performance-by-defragmenting-your-hard-disk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Improve-performance-by-defragmenting-your-hard-disk</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Method <span>&nbsp;</span>5:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Temporarily turn off any programs that might activate themselves while burning is in progress, such as screen savers or anti-virus programs.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</a><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a><br />
<br />
<strong><span>Note: </span></strong>Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is a potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security software after completing the troubleshooting
 steps and after identifying the issue.</span></p>
